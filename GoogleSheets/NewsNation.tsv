Authorities to update on 2024 deaths of 3 Kansas City Chiefs fans	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (NewsNation) — Authorities were expected to provide an update Wednesday on the investigation into the deaths of three Kansas City Chiefs fans who were found dead in the backyard of their friend’s home in 2024. Ricky Johnson, 38; Clayton McGeeney, 36; and David Harrington, 37, were all found dead in their friend’s Kansas City backyard on January 9, 2024. After their deaths, NewsNation local affiliate WDAF reported toxicology results revealed the men died from fentanyl-laced cocaine. Gas prices expected to rise as tariffs take effect That, however, was never confirmed by investigators. Weather records indicate the low temperature that night was around 33 degrees. One factor fueling speculation about their deaths has been that the homeowner says he didn’t know the bodies of his three longtime friends were on his back porch and in his backyard for the two days before they were found. Officer Alayna Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the Kansas City Police Department, previously said that the homeowner was cooperating with the investigation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/update-2024-deaths-chiefs-fans/	2025-03-05T12:07:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/01/65b5cf233245e3.73946802.jpeg?w=900
Gas prices expected to rise as tariffs take effect	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian imports, and that means Americans could see higher gas prices. Analysts say that states in the Northeast could be affected first and see a 20 to 40 cent increase per gallon on the price of gas. Trump said open trade has cost Americans factory jobs and that the tariffs will be a 'path to prosperity' for the country in the long run. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said with the closure of a refinery in 2019, Northeastern states rely on Canada for oil and could feel the effects of higher gas prices by mid-March. How many people over 100 receive Social Security benefits? Canada is the fifth-largest producer of natural gas, exporting half of its supply to the U.S. in 2024. Sixty percent of U.S. crude oil imports also came from the country. The Midwest, Great Lakes and the Rockies could see anywhere between a five- to 25-cent increase per gallon in two to three weeks if tariffs stay in effect. 'If the tariffs disappear quickly, the impact may as well,' De Haan said. De Haan said gas prices are already low compared to last year because of concern over the economy regarding the impact of tariffs and that oil prices have fallen recently because of the economic duress the tariffs could bring. 'If the economy slows down, we'll see lower gas prices because Americans will buy less, spend less and travel less,' De Haan said. 'If we see a stronger economy, we see higher gas prices because of more demand.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/gas-prices-rise-tariffs/	2025-03-05T10:46:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/4ff49a7cfbe04e87aa0bebb1de967c53-1-1-1-e1734435033999.jpg?w=900
Republican introduces censure resolution against Al Green	The House will vote this week on a resolution from Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) to censure Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) for his outburst at President Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. Newhouse introduced the resolution and moved to force a vote on it Wednesday, less than 24 hours after Green’s disruptive protest. Because the resolution is privileged, leadership has two legislative days to move on the formal reprimand, and the House is scheduled to leave town after Thursday. The resolution reads: 'Whereas, the conduct of the Representative from Texas disrupted the proceedings of the joint address and was a breach of proper conduct; and whereas, after numerous disruptions the representative from Texas had to be removed from the chamber by the Sergeant-at-arms; Now, therefore, be it resolved that Representative Al Green be censured.' The Washington congressman’s effort has the backing of House GOP leadership, apparently winning out over two alternative measures to censure Green that were being crafted by Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) and the House Freedom Caucus, and Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas). 'I believe this is the first one outta the gate,' Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told a NOTUS reporter of Newhouse’s resolution. Newhouse acknowledged there were many people interested in leading such a resolution, but told reporters he was the first to approach the Speaker about it. And Newhouse dismissed the notion that the move was aimed at improving his relationship with Trump and his allies, given he is one of two House Republicans remaining in Congress who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. 'I don't see how that would work at all,' Newhouse said. 'This is about the House of Representatives, Congress and respecting the rules of decorum that we have.' A House censure is a formal reprimand taken by a vote of the House but does not typically carry consequences beyond having the member stand in the well of the House as the resolution detailing their transgressions is read aloud. Censure has become more common in recent years, with House Republicans in the last Congress censuring Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and then-Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.). The House issued a reprimand, a less severe rebuke than a censure, to Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) for an outburst at former President Obama’s 2009 address to Congress when he yelled, 'You lie!' Wilson’s outburst now looks tame compared to the protests that have escalated at presidential addresses. Green’s protest — and ultimate removal — played out within the first few minutes of Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, the first of his second term. When Trump was discussing the 'mandate' he received from voters in November, Green stood up and yelled back at the president, arguing he did not have a mandate to cut Medicaid. The social safety net program has emerged as a key issue this Congress, with Republicans eyeing cuts to it through their sprawling border, energy and tax cuts package. When Green started yelling at Trump, chants of 'U.S.A.' rang out on the Republican side of the chamber. Johnson, sitting on the dais next to Vice President Vance, gave Green a warning, telling him to 'take your seat.' Green, however, continued his protest, and shortly after, Johnson ordered the sergeant-at-arms to remove him from the chamber. Republicans sang 'hey, hey, hey, goodbye,' as the Texas Democrat made his way off the House floor. Green later told reporters he was 'making it clear to the president that he has no mandate to cut Medicaid.' 'I have people who are very fearful. These are poor people, and they all need Medicaid in their lives when it comes to their health care,' he added. It remains unclear if any Democrats will join the GOP’s censure effort. At least one Senate Democrat criticized his behavior Tuesday night. 'I think it’s counterproductive,' Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) told The Hill. 'I think to stand up and say, you know, he doesn’t have a mandate to cut Medicare, fine, but I think he — I think it went beyond decorum.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/republican-introduces-censure-resolution-against-al-green/	2025-03-05T10:45:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25064091246010-e1741142760519.jpg?w=900
40-day Target boycott begins following company's DEI diversion	(NewsNation) — Target, a private company not required to follow President Donald Trump's orders to dismiss diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace, did just that in January. The Minnesota-based chain announced on Jan. 24 it was ending its hiring, supplier recruitment and promotion goals for women, members of racial minority groups, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities. Target had previously been hailed as an inclusive company, in part because of its six-figure donations to groups championing Black economic empowerment and LGBTQ+ acceptance. Dozens of Education Department staffers on leave amid Trump’s DEI purge Though it's not the only Fortune 500 company backtracking on DEI, it's facing major customer blowback and a new boycott. Target boycott: Pastor suggests dropping retailer for Lent One Atlanta-area megachurch pastor, the Rev. Jamal Bryant, asked dispirited Target shoppers to 'fast' from the retailer for the 40 days of Lent. Bryant asked participants to abstain from shopping at Target, in-person or online, and to sell personal stocks and shareholdings with Target Corporation. 'This is a fast for accountability. A fast for justice. A fast for a future where corporations do not bow to pressure at the expense of marginalized communities. As we journey through these 40 days, let us pray, reflect, and act — knowing that our collective sacrifice can bring about transformation,' the movement's website reads. Bryant and other leaders plan to meet with Target's board when the 'fast' ends on April 17 to 'assess whether we will proceed to Phase 2.' No details about a second phase have been shared yet. Target braces for Trump's tariff impact Target recorded soft sales in February and a 13% drop in stock price in the past month, a forecast likely made murkier by Trump's tariffs on top trading partners Canada and Mexico. Target said that back in 2017, 60% of its store-label products were sourced from China. The stock market is down: Are Trump’s tariffs to blame? That’s now at 30%, Target executives said. The company is on its way to reducing that number to 25% by the end of next year, the company said. Target plans to add 20 new stores this year, and it expects to add $15 billion in sales by 2030.

Border facility in Texas closing amid decline in crossings	EAGLE PASS, Texas (NewsNation) — A U.S. Customs and Border Protection migrant processing facility in Eagle Pass, Texas, is closing, sources told NewsNation on Wednesday. The temporary, soft-sided facility called 'Firefly,' which opened in July 2022, was originally designed to quickly process people in Border Patrol custody by providing food, shelter and processing space. The 153,300-square-foot, climate-controlled facility served the Border Patrol's Del Rio sector. It replaced a smaller structure that opened in Eagle Pass in April 2021. Similar facilities in El Paso and San Diego will remain open. Sanctuary city mayors defend policies before Congress The news comes amid Vice President JD Vance's visit to the southern border Wednesday to highlight the Trump administration’s tough immigration policies as the White House touts a sharp decline in border crossings. Illegal crossings at the border have dropped 94% compared to last year, according to Border Patrol officials, and the decline is attributed to several factors — including labeling cartel groups as terrorist organizations, boosting ICE deportations and deploying military resources for enforcement and deportation flights. Alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, Vance is expected to visit Eagle Pass, once considered a hot spot for illegal crossings. The visit comes as the White House pushes its 'whole of government' approach, coordinating efforts between the departments of Homeland Security, Defense and Justice.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/migrant-shelter-closing-texas-border/	2025-03-05T08:30:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/52214238210_bc77c0ef05_o.jpg?w=900
Border retailers brace for economic hardships from new tariffs	McALLEN, Texas (Border Report) -- Milly Chirino owns three retail shops in the downtown business district of this border town. She sells shoes, handbags, clothes and other wares and she says most of her items are imported from China and will be subject to new tariffs. Border businesses, residents begin to feel pain of Trump’s tariffs President Donald Trump on Tuesday implemented 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and 10% tariffs on goods from China. Shoes, handbags and other items are sold at Millys in downtown McAllen, Texas. (Sandra Sanchez/Border Report Photos) 'It is going to affect as far as the pricing,' Chirino told Border Report on Tuesday. But she also put an optimistic spin on the tariffs, saying that consumers who buy from retailers, like her, who buy in bulk, will feel less economic effects from the tariffs, rather than those who buy directly from companies within those countries. 'Maybe they will start buying more local,' she said. Suresh Mansinghani, aka 'The Perfume King,' has operated his perfume shop here for 42 years. He says he has enough stockpiled supplies that he won't need to order from China or Mexico for a couple of months, and that means his customers won't see any price increases for a while. Downtown shops line the streets in the border town of McAllen, Texas. (Sandra Sanchez/Border Report) He is one of 13 perfume shops on a single block in this downtown shopping district that is just north of the Rio Grande and the northern Mexican city of Reynosa. He says most of his competitors also stockpile their goods, as do his suppliers, and he isn't worried, at least for now. Border exporter worries Mexico will implement it own tariffs 'I don't think it's going to affect it, because it's going to take time for all the new merchandise to come in, and it usually takes between 30 to 60 days, so I don't expect any price increases at all. In fact, I'm dropping my prices just to entice customers to buy more,' Mansinghani said. Suresh Mansinghani, AKA 'The Perfume King,' has operated his McAllen, Texas, perfume shop for 42 years. He supports new tariffs on products from Mexico. (Sandra Sanchez/Border Report) He says in his decades in the perfume business, he has weathered tough times. And he doesn't see this as one to fret. 'What the local people need to know is that don't overreact. This is just a strategy that the politicians do, and we don't have any control at all. We just got to go with the flow,' he said. Several of his employees have worked for him for over 30 years. He says he had a staff meeting Tuesday morning and told them not to worry. He said business was brisk and kept coming Tuesday, despite the news. He says his retail sales so far this year are up 3% over last year 'and I had a fantastic year last year,' he said. Mansinghani says he supports the tariffs because he doesn't believe it is right that some countries place tariffs on U.S. goods, but the United States does not put tariffs on their goods. 'I think everything's going to be fine,' he said. But shopper Mari Gonzalez, of Edcouch, Texas, says she can't afford to pay more. Border shopper Mari Gonzalez, of Edcouch, Texas, says she can't afford to pay more for goods from Mexico due to new import tariffs. (Sandra Sanchez/Border Report) She says inflation already is too high and she believes the tariffs are bad. 'It’s very bad because right now the economy is very down,' she said in Spanish. Several other shoppers who spoke to Border Report also felt the tariffs were not going to help the economy, but rather hurt it. However, many did not want to give their names. 'This is going to be very hard. It's going to be very difficult for us,' Gonzalez said.

Supreme Court denies Trump administration request to cancel $2 bi...	The Supreme Court in a 5-4 emergency ruling Wednesday refused to halt a judge’s decision ordering the Trump administration to immediately release nearly $2 billion in foreign aid payments owed under existing contracts. It hands a loss to the administration in the first time that Trump’s efforts to drastically reshape federal spending, agency by agency, have reached the high court. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the court’s three liberals to side against the administration. Four of the court’s conservatives — Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — dissented. 'Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars? The answer to that question should be an emphatic ‘No,’ but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned,' Alito wrote, joined by the three others. The Trump administration has broadly looked to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), including by firing employees and freezing its payments to contractors, sparking a wave of lawsuits. The Supreme Court’s emergency decision keeps in place a lower judge’s order enforcing his directive that the administration maintain foreign aid agreements that existed before Trump took office. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali, an appointee of former President Biden, had found the Trump administration wasn’t complying with his order to resume the unpaid USAID contracts and grants. Last week, Ali demanded the funds be released by the end of the following day. 'Given that the deadline in the challenged order has now passed, and in light of the ongoing preliminary injunction proceedings, the District Court should clarify what obligations the Government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order, with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines,' the Supreme Court’s unsigned order reads. The Justice Department quickly went to the Supreme Court after Ali’s order, warning the administration couldn’t comply so rapidly and asking for an emergency intervention. 'The Executive Branch takes seriously its constitutional duty to comply with the orders of Article III courts,' the Justice Department wrote in court filings. 'The government is undertaking substantial efforts to review payment requests and release payments. Officials at the highest levels of government are engaged on this matter.' Chief Justice John Roberts received the request by default, just hours before last week’s midnight deadline. He issued a brief delay until the court could hear from both sides. Now that it has, the full court denied the administration’s motion, refusing to maintain the freeze on the funding. The group of USAID contractors suing warned they will soon shutter without access to the funds. They urged the justices to deny the government’s application, saying the judge acted within his 'sound discretion.' 'The government comes to this Court with an emergency of its own making,' their attorneys wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/supreme-court-denies-trump-administration-request-to-cancel-2-billion-in-foreign-aid/	2025-03-05T06:37:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25064076627793-e1741140755989_ae2499.jpg?w=900
Tariff trade war could raise medical costs — but not quite yet	(NewsNation) — A majority of medical experts foresee at least a 10% increase in drug prices as a result of President Donald Trump's tariff standoff, a new Black Book Market Research survey found. A brewing trade war between the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico could increase the cost of medical supplies, intensify drug shortages and limit device makers' ability to import critical supplies. The full scope of tariff impacts will take some time to completely take shape, and Accreditation Council for Medical Affairs founder and CEO William Soliman tells NewsNation that prices and future drug availability are difficult to predict. Ontario premier: Trump tariffs ‘backfired,’ inflation to hit US 'A lot of the common drugs that Americans take — your cholesterol lowering drugs, your blood thinners, your antibiotics — a lot of these drugs, a lot of their active pharmaceutical ingredients, are made in China. They're made in Canada,' Soliman said. 'You are going to see, potentially, price issues in terms of price increases and maybe potentially shortages of those generic drugs in the U.S.,' he added. About 90% of the drugs Americans consume are generic — of that percentage, a vast majority are at least partly manufactured overseas. What is causing your spring allergies and what can you do to prevent them? That includes common drugs like antibiotic Z-Pak, anticoagulant Coumadin and cancer-fighting drugs. But Soliman said patients shouldn't panic just yet. There's likely a 12- to 18-month stockpile for many drugs, he said, so there should be no immediate issue with supply chain shortages when it comes to generic medications. Name-brand drugs, however, could see significant problems when it comes to availability in the future, Soliman said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/tariff-trade-war-medical-costs/	2025-03-05T05:40:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Mucinex-Tylenol-Cold-and-Flu-Dayquil.png?w=900
Vance to visit southern border to highlight immigration crackdown	EAGLE PASS, Texas (NewsNation) — Vice President JD Vance will visit the U.S. southern border on Wednesday to highlight the administration's tough immigration policies as the White House touts a sharp decline in border crossings. Border security is a top priority for President Donald Trump, and Vance's trip marks the highest-ranking official from the administration to visit the border since he took office six weeks ago. Alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, Vance will tour a federal immigration processing facility in Eagle Pass, Texas, once considered a hotspot for illegal crossings. This visit comes as the White House pushes its 'whole of government' approach, coordinating efforts between the departments of Homeland Security, Defense and Justice. Trump touts decline in illegal border crossings Illegal crossings at the southern border have reportedly dropped 94% compared to last year, according to Border Patrol officials, and the decline is attributed to several factors — including labeling cartel groups as terrorist organizations, boosting ICE deportations and deploying military resources for enforcement and deportation flights. A year ago, there was an average of 4,800 migrant encounters daily, officials said; that number has now reportedly dropped to less than 300. Areas like Eagle Pass and Del Rio in South Texas that once saw thousands of illegal crossings under the Biden administration now reportedly average less than 50 encounters per day. Pentagon sending combat troops to southern border Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said February marked the 'lowest month in recorded history for (migrant) encounters at our border.' She reposted Trump’s social media post that said there were 8,326 apprehensions of undocumented immigrants by Border Patrol agents at the U.S.-Mexico border in February. 'My first full month in Office, had the LOWEST number of illegal immigrants trying to enter our Country in History – BY FAR!' Trump wrote on Truth Social. The latest Customs and Border Protection data, released in January, reports a total of 179,572 immigrant encounters by Border Patrol agents since the start of fiscal year 2025 on Oct. 1 — but that data includes more than four months of encounters under the previous administration. Trump: ‘A new president’ has solved the border crisis In January, there were 29,116 immigrant encounters on the Southwest border, CBP reported. The largest number of encounters occurred in the San Diego sector, with 6,397. The Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol reported the second-most encounters with 5,965, and the El Paso sector was third with 4,871, CBP said. The number of single adults encountered on the Southwest border so far in fiscal year 2025 has dropped 73% from the previous year, and the number of families has dropped 84%, CBP reported. Customs and Border Protection releases monthly encounter data but has not yet released February figures. Trump eyeing plan to revive Title 42 Trump is also considering reinstating Title 42, an emergency health authority that allows immigration officials to turn away migrants at the border to prevent the spread of disease. If Title 42 were renewed, officials could enact similar restrictions while citing the potential spread of diseases such as tuberculosis, according to internal government documents obtained by CBS News.

Suspect in Kabul airport bombing during Afghanistan pullout is ca...	WASHINGTON (AP) — A suspected senior planner in the suicide bombing at the Kabul airport that killed 13 American service members during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan has been taken into custody and will appear Wednesday in federal court in the United States to face charges. President Donald Trump announced the arrest during his Tuesday night address to Congress, with the White House and the Justice Department subsequently identifying the suspect as Mohammad Sharifullah. Officials accuse him of being a member of the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate, known as ISIS-Khorasan, or ISIS-K, and say he admitted his role in that attack and others during an interview with FBI agents on Sunday after being taken into custody. Senior Pakistani intelligence officers on Wednesday confirmed the arrest and said Sharifullah, also known as Jafar, was captured in the country's restive southwest Balochistan province near the border with Afghanistan after multiple operations had failed to seize him. The officers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said Sharifullah had joined the militant group in 2016 and was involved in numerous attacks across Afghanistan. Sharifullah is charged in federal court in Virginia with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, resulting in death. He will face a judge on Wednesday and be assigned a lawyer to speak on his behalf. Additional charges are possible as the case moves through the court system. Trump, in his address to Congress, said he was 'pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity. And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.' The Abbey Gate bombing, in the waning days of an airlift for those fleeing the Taliban takeover of the country amid the withdrawal by U.S. forces from the country, occurred in August 2021 when a suicide bomber attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabul’s airport. Besides 13 U.S. service members, about 170 Afghans were also killed in the attack, which triggered widespread congressional criticism and undermined public confidence in President Joe Biden’s administration. According to an FBI affidavit filed as part of the case, Sharifullah admitted under questioning to having joined ISIS-K in 2016 and to having participated in the Abbey Gate bombing by scouting a route to the airport for the bomber and communicating to other members of the militant group that the path was clear. The bomber was later identified as Abdul Rahman al-Logari, an Islamic State group militant who had been in an Afghan prison but was released by the Taliban as the group took control of the country that summer. During his FBI interrogation, Sharifullah also said he had shared firearms and weapons instructions before a March 2024 attack in Moscow that was also carried out by ISIS-K, authorities said. Sharifullah was arrested in 2019 by the U.S.-backed Afghan government at the time but escaped from prison on Aug. 15, 2021, as the Taliban took Kabul. The Pakistani officials said Sharifullah had planned the bombing from behind bars with other senior militant figures. They said he remained on the run in the border areas of Balochistan until his arrest through a joint intelligence-sharing operation between Pakistan and the U.S. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for 'acknowledging and appreciating' the country’s role in counter terrorism efforts in Afghanistan. 'We will continue to partner closely with the United States in securing regional peace and stability,' Sharif said on the social platform X. From Kabul, the Taliban chief spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid declined to comment beyond saying that the arrest 'on Pakistani soil' of an Afghan national and member of the Islamic State group shows that IS group figures 'have taken refuge and established havens' inside Pakistan. 'This issue has nothing to do with Afghanistan,' Mujahid said. The regional Islamic State affiliate is a rival group to the Afghan Taliban. Trump, a Republican, had repeatedly condemned Biden's role in the Afghanistan withdrawal on the campaign trail and blamed Biden, a Democrat, for the Abbey Gate attack. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity Tuesday night to discuss a case that had yet to be unsealed, said Sharifullah's arrest came after fresh U.S. intelligence community coordination, increased intelligence sharing and pressure on regional partners to bring those responsible for the attack to account since Trump’s swearing-in in January.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-suspect-in-kabul-airport-bombing-during-afghanistan-pullout-is-caught-and-heading-to-us-trump-says/	2025-03-05T04:24:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67c84306d4a1d1.76554143.jpeg?w=900
Mayors of sanctuary cities set to testify before Congress	(NewsNation) — The mayors of four major U.S. sanctuary cities are set to defend their cities' status in a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing Wednesday. Boston's Michelle Wu, Chicago's Brandon Johnson, Denver's Mike Johnston and New York City's Eric Adams will face questions from Republicans, including committee chairman James Comer, who has vowed to hold the mayors accountable for their policies. Billions in federal funding at stake for sanctuary cities In January, Comer launched an investigation into sanctuary city practices he claims put 'Americans’ lives at risk.' The hearing is slated to begin at 10 a.m. ET and is available to stream on the House's official website. What is a sanctuary city? While there's no set definition of a sanctuary city, the term generally refers to cities that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. President Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, says a rise in modern transnational criminal gangs has created an unprecedented risk — one he's vowed to 'eradicate.' 'This is the biggest national security issue this country has seen, and we're going to address it,' Homan said in reference to Tren de Aragua and MS-13. Supporters of sanctuary cities say they want to be welcoming landing spots for immigrants. 'That's just who we are. We're a city, again, that was established by a black Haitian immigrant. That is the punch. We're responding to individuals who don't share our values,' Chicago's Johnson said. They also warn that victims and witnesses of crimes who are in the country illegally may be less likely to come forward if local law enforcement is cooperating with ICE. February ‘lowest in history’ for border encounters, White House says The only one of the four mayors who seems willing to join forces with the Trump administration's effort is New York's embattled Adams, who has voiced support for rolling back policies barring city staff from working with ICE. Adams' detractors believe his leniency on the issue is an attempt to curry favor with the Trump administration, which recently ordered the Department of Justice to drop the mayor's federal corruption charges. Hearing could cost sanctuary cities federal funding The four cities have struggled to manage the influx of migrants from the southern border, collectively spending billions of dollars on shelter and support services. But Wednesday's hearing could strip sanctuary cities of some federal funding. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has already sued the state of New York and the city of Chicago, alleging they have obstructed the federal government from enforcing immigration laws. Shortly after Trump took office, the Department of Justice directed federal prosecutors to investigate whether local officials should face legal action for resisting federal immigration laws. In addition to the two lawsuits, Bondi issued a memo in early February stating that sanctuary jurisdictions will not have access to federal funds from the Department of Justice. Trump talks immigration in joint address The president leaned into immigration during his address to Congress on Tuesday night, casting the decadeslong border crisis as merely a failure of Democratic leadership. 'Our friends in the Democrat party kept saying we needed new legislation, 'We must have legislation to secure the border.' But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president,' Trump said. Trump added that his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, 'didn't just open our borders, he flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country.'

Al Green's protest at Trump speech not helping Democrats: Stirewa...	(NewsNation) — NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt said Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, trying to argue with President Donald Trump during his Congressional speech was 'not the look the Democratic Party was trying to get.' During Trump's speech, Green stood up and told Trump, 'You don’t have a mandate. ... You have no mandate to cut Medicaid.' He was immediately drowned out by people chanting 'USA' and booing. Trump: US faced ‘economic catastrophe,’ ‘inflation nightmare’ Democrats in the House of Representatives raised placards saying, '(Elon) Musk steals,' 'Save Medicaid' and 'Protect Veterans.' Stirewalt expressed confusion over their actions, saying, 'I have no idea what Democrats thought they were doing holding up those signs … If you don’t want to be there, don’t go,' he said, stating it'd be more powerful to not show up at all. 'It’s all beneath the work of a great nation,' Stirewalt added. Trump praises major government cutbacks, efficiency measures Green says getting ejected from speech was 'worth it' According to a White House pool report, Green spoke to reporters after getting escorted out of the House of Representatives chambers for protesting Trump’s speech. 'It’s worth it to let people know that there are some people who are going to stand up' to Trump, Green said. After Trump’s address, the Democratic Party gave a brief speech in response. This year’s response was delivered by Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.

Democrats disrupt, protest and wear pained expressions for Trump’...	House Democrats greeted President Trump’s return to Congress on Tuesday with a spirited series of disruptive protests – and a number of painful looks as they suffered through an address in which the returning president repeatedly cajoled and mocked them. All in all, it was an extraordinary display of partisan scuffling even by the standards of the polarized modern era. The clashes began just minutes into Trump’s joint address to Congress, when Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), a 77-year-old liberal from Houston, stood from his seat and heckled Trump with charges that the president’s proclaimed 'mandate' was nothing of the sort. The outburst prompted Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who was seated on the dais behind Trump, to warn Green to 'maintain decorum in the House.' When that didn’t work, he ordered Green to 'take your seat.' When that also failed, Johnson directed the House Sergeant at Arms to remove Green from the chamber. The episode seemed to pain the top Democratic leaders — Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), Katherine Clark (Mass.) and Pete Aguilar (Calif.) — who have criticized Republicans for occasional outbursts during Democratic speeches, and watched with glum expressions as Green was escorted from the room. Republicans had a lighter response. They belted out a chorus of 'Hey, Hey, Hey — Goodbye.' It was the most dramatic episode of a dramatic evening, but hardly the only one. Shortly after Green’s ejection, several other Democrats stood and turned their backs on Trump to display a one-word message on the back of their shirts: 'Resist.' Then lawmakers — including Democratic Reps. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Lateefah Simon (D-Calif.) and Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) — marched out of the chamber on their own accord. Other Democrats repeatedly yelled out to protest specific remarks from Trump. One lawmaker, for instance, shouted 'Jan. 6' when Trump broached the issue of law enforcement — a reference to the 2021 attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, and the president’s recent pardon of more than 1,500 rioters. All told, the chorus of disruption made the 2009 'You lie!' outburst from Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), described with revulsion by Democrats and some Republicans at the time, seem mild by comparison. If Trump was bothered by the demonstrations, he didn’t let on. Indeed, the president delivered a gladiatorial speech that pulled no punches, offered no olive branches and doubled down on vows to advance the same assertive policies that have stirred so much controversy during his first six weeks back in power. 'America is back,' Trump boomed at the outset. 'And we are just getting started.' Trump also lobbed plenty of his own salvos across the aisle — even in his prepared remarks, where he characterized Joe Biden as the worst president in history and attacked congressional Democrats for what he considered a failure to appreciate his successes. 'I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or make them stand and smile or applause,' Trump said, looking out into the Democrats’ side of the chamber. 'These people standing right here will not clap, will not cheer.' The speech thrilled the president’s Republican supporters, who occupied one side of the House chamber. They roared their approval after each claimed victory — closing the border, eliminating foreign aid, defeating 'wokeness' — and jumped in applause at each new promise to realize the 'America First' agenda that brought him to power. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a conservative firebrand and staunch supporter of the president, stuck out from the crowd in her red hat with a proud message: 'Trump Was Right About Everything.' On the other side were Trump’s Democratic adversaries, who cast a dour shadow on the president’s triumphant return to Capitol Hill. Despite the sporadic outbursts, most sat in stoic silence through the vast majority of the address — a sea of glum faces incredulous that Trump had won a second term and horrified by the same policies the president was eulogizing from the lectern. On a milder note, a number of Democrats in the chamber held up signs throughout Trump’s speech: 'Musk Steals,' read some. 'Save Medicaid,' read others. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) held another: 'This is not normal.' And Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) carried a white board into the chamber, penning various messages to Trump throughout the address. 'No king,' she wrote at one point. There were other, more symbolic, gestures of protest, as well. Some Democratic women were decked out in white, a symbol of the suffragists who fought a century ago for women’s rights to vote. Dozens of other Democratic women were dressed in pink — a more generic symbol of protest designed to highlight Trump’s policies affecting women and families. And some members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) donned black to demonstrate against the president’s policies. Democrats are also up in arms over Trump’s recent overtures to Russia amid their ongoing invasion of Ukraine. To show solidarity with America’s democratic allies in Kyiv, a number of lawmakers wore the colors of Ukraine: blue and gold. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) was among those pro-Ukraine Democrats, who went to the chamber in a blue and gold tie. 'I give this credit to Marcy Kaptur. She bought 100 ties, and she told me to wear it,' Lynch quipped. 'So I’m doing what I’m told.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/democrats-disrupt-protest-and-wear-pained-expressions-for-trumps-speech/	2025-03-04T21:01:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/house_dems_030425gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Trump praises major government cutbacks, efficiency measures	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump claimed sweeping government efficiency gains in his congressional address, announcing immediate freezes on federal hiring, new regulations and foreign aid while highlighting what he characterized as significant waste in government spending. Trump declared an aggressive approach to government downsizing, stating, 'Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations and freeze on all foreign aid.' The president singled out specific spending programs as examples of waste, including an $8 million program promoting LGBTQI+ initiatives in Lesotho, a small African nation. Trump referenced the Department of Government Efficiency as a key driver of these changes. Rep.Slotkin giving Democratic response to Trump speech He portrayed these cuts as crucial cost-saving measures, though the program was originally initiated by Republican predecessor George W. Bush. Trump alleged 'shocking levels of incompetence' in the Social Security program, stating that government records show 4.7 million Social Security recipients aged 100-109 and 3.6 million members aged 110-119. The administration also touted withdrawals from international organizations, including the World Health Organization and the United Nations Human Rights Council, as accomplishments of streamlining government operations. The stock market is down: Is Trump's trade war to blame? The president said his administration would balance the federal budget for the first time. He antagonized Democrats by saying they appreciate the cuts but 'just don’t want to admit it.'

Trump clashes with Democrats at testy joint address	President Trump on Tuesday sparred with Democratic lawmakers during an address to a joint session of Congress that began with a congressman being escorted out of the chamber and saw other Democrats leave the room as Trump spoke. Trump spoke to lawmakers for more than one hour and 39 minutes, breaking a record for the longest such speech delivered in modern history. It included several unprecedented attacks on his predecessor, President Biden, and protests from many Democrats in the chamber. The evening began with a rare scene, when Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), a regular Trump foil, stood to heckle the president after he boasted of his election victory. 'You don’t have a mandate,' Green called out, interrupting and briefly stopping Trump’s speech. When the congressman did not relent, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) directed the Sergeant at Arms to remove Green from the chamber, drawing raucous applause from Republicans in the room. The episode appeared to please both parties. Democrats were clearly ready to protest and push back on Trump’s remarks, while Republicans reveled in the frustration of the opposing party. Several Democrats left the chamber throughout Trump’s remarks. 'I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or make them stand and smile or applaud,' Trump said looking toward their side of the chamber. 'I could find a cure to the most devastating diseases. A disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history…and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand, and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements.' 'It’s very sad. And it just shouldn't be this way,' Trump added. When Trump walked into the chamber, Rep. Stansbury (D-N.M.) held up a sign that read 'This is NOT Normal' before Rep. Lance Gooden (R-Texas) ripped it away and threw it in the air. Among the Democrats who left the chamber at points throughout the speech were Rep. Jasmine Crockett (Mo.), who showed off a shirt that read 'RESIST' on the way out, Rep. Maxwell Frost (Fla.) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (Md.). At one point, Trump taunted Democrats by suggesting they would vote to extend tax cuts that are set to expire later this year.'Because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office,' Trump said, gesturing to Democrats in the chamber. 'So I’m doing you a big favor by telling you that.' While arguing that the U.S. has given too much money to support Ukraine, days after a spat in the Oval Office with Ukrainian President Zelensky, Trump called Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) his nickname for her: 'Pocahontas.' She responded by clapping from her seat. Trump referred to Democrats at one point with a positive tone, when he thanked them for voting for his Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Senate confirmed Rubio, a former senator, in a 99-0 vote. At other points, several Democrats held up round, black signs that read 'False,' 'Musk Steals,' 'Save Medicaid,' and 'protect veterans.' Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) held up a white board that at one point was held toward Trump and read 'start by paying your taxes.' When Trump spoke about support for law enforcement, some Democrats yelled out 'Jan. 6' to reference Trump’s pardons for rioters at the U.S. Capitol, including violent offenders who were convicted of attacking police officers that day. Then tensions were reminiscent of scenes during Trump’s previous addresses, culminating in his final State of the Union of his first term in 2020 when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) ripped up her copy of Trump’s speech while behind him on the dais. The president called out former President Biden multiple times during his remarks, an unusual and rare move for a sitting president giving such an address. Trump called Biden 'the worst president in American history' while touting that migrant crossings at the southern border are down during his presidency compared to his Democratic rival. Trump then lamented that his administration inherited 'an economic nightmare' from the Biden administration and that he is fighting 'to reverse this damage.' It took Trump roughly 20 minutes to address inflation, a top concern for many voters, at which point he blamed Biden for the high price of eggs. When Trump began reiterating his unproven claims that millions of people well above the age of 100 are still receiving Social Security checks, Democrats yelled out and held up signs that said 'false' and 'lies.' Democrats also pointed to Elon Musk, who was sitting in the gallery, when Trump said 'the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.' The president also called out various actions he has taken that hit on areas Democrats support, rattling off that he has ended Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs and took steps to prevent transgender athletes from womens sports. And, the president slammed the CHIPs and Science Act, one of Biden’s signature achievements that aimed to boost domestic semiconductor production. It passed with bipartisan support and has been a boon to some Republican districts. 'Your chips act is a horrible, horrible thing,' Trump said to Democrats. 'You should get rid of the CHIP Act and whatever’s left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.' Trump also touted economic investments from major companies like Apple and SoftBank since his election – pointing to Democrats and saying that would not have been the case if Vice President Harris won in November. 'For just this one night,' Trump asked Democrats at one point, 'why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-clashes-with-democrats-at-testy-joint-address/	2025-03-04T20:46:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/Trump_Dems_Address.jpg?w=900
Trump: 'A new president' has solved the border crisis	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump, during a joint address to Congress, declared his administration has launched the 'most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.' Trump noted that the Laken Riley Act, the first bill he signed after his reelection, mandated the detention of 'dangerous criminal aliens' and used the tragedy to underscore his immigration policy. Riley's mother and sister were guests of honor at the address, drawing bipartisan applause. The president said that a change in leadership, not new legislation, was the key to controlling border crossings. Rep. Slotkin giving Democratic response to Trump speech 'The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation to secure the border — but it turned out that all we really needed was a new president,' Trump told Congress. Beyond border enforcement, Trump proposed a $5 million 'gold card' citizenship pathway for wealthy investors, replacing the existing $1 million investor visa program. He said that more than 100 countries have similar programs, though some, including Spain and the U.K., have discontinued them due to concerns about housing prices and security. Trump called on Congress to expedite border funding 'without delay,' targeting House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune for immediate action. The stock market is down: Is Trump's trade war to blame? 'Joe Biden’s insane and very dangerous open border policies — they are now strongly embedded in our country but we are getting them out and getting them out fast,' Trump said, referring to migrants. Trump also signed an executive order renaming a national wildlife refuge in Texas in honor of Jocelyn Nungaray, who was killed by migrants after they crossed the border illegally.

Trump's Canada tariffs 'backfired,' inflation to hit US: Ontario ...	(NewsNation) — Ontario Premier Doug Ford has threatened to cut off electricity exports to the United States following President Donald Trump’s newest tariffs. The move places a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 20% tariff on all imports from China. Energy resources from Canada will have a lower, 10% tariff. Supreme Court denies Trump administration request to cancel $2 billion in foreign aid 'It's absolute chaos right now,' Ford said Tuesday during an appearance on NewsNation's 'The Hill.' 'Trump ran on creating more jobs, lowering inflation. This has totally backfired. Inflation's gonna hit the American people and Canadians... This is all unnecessary.' There are a combined 380 million people in Canada and the U.S. who could face higher prices or power cuts if the trade war continues. 'Canadians love Americans': Doug Ford Ford apologized to the American people, insisting, 'We never started this.' 'I've talked to endless Americans... Canadians love Americans. They love the U.S. They look at Americans as part of the family, and so do I. And this is totally unnecessary,' Ford added, placing blame on Trump as the party responsible. Ford said cutting off electricity is the 'last step he wants to take.' Trump talks first days in office during joint address to Congress 'I do not want to do this to the Americans, but we have to retaliate when our country, our sovereignty, is at risk right now,' Ford added. 'I will do everything and use every tool in our tool kit to make sure we come to a resolution.' Who will be affected by a Canadian energy cut? Multiple regions of the U.S. will feel the heat — or lack thereof — if Canada decides to stop exporting energy. The stock market is down: Are Trump’s tariffs to blame? Oil refineries in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions rely on Canadian oil to make gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. In 2023, the U.S. imported 1.4 million barrels of Canadian crude oil daily — more than half its daily import of 2.4 million. America’s northern border has more than 35 major electricity transmission lines and 70 oil and gas pipelines, connecting the U.S. and Canada in the 'closest energy relationship in the world,' per the embassy of Canada’s official website. How much does the US rely on Canadian electricity? In some way or another, all 50 states in the U.S. receive energy or benefit from the energy relationship with Canada. 'The energy relationship between the two countries extends beyond just the trade of commodities, encompassing a variety of common, though not always identical, economic, security, and environmental priorities,' according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In 2024, Canada supplied 62% of American crude oil imports. Other energy exports from Canada include: Hydroelectric power Natural gas Other fossil fuels In New England, states like Maine, which are 'secluded from other regional energy infrastructure,' could face electricity cost hikes of up to $200 million per state, Heatmap News reports. The state of Vermont has partnered with Hydro-Québec to have the Canadian company provide 25% of the state’s annual energy needs through 2038. Similarly, New York has a deal for megawatt importation through 2030.

Luigi Mangione case Mangione is currently awaiting trial for the killing of Brian Thompson, the former UnitedHealthcare CEO. Mangione allegedly arrived in New York City days before the shooting. Police said that on the morning of the shooting, Mangione was fully masked and wearing a hood before shooting Thompson near the Hilton Hotel. Thompson was shot in the back and the leg and later pronounced dead at a local hospital. After searching for days, Mangione was arrested by police at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was denied bail in December and pleaded not guilty in the case. He allegedly wrote a manifesto that talked about the insurance industry. 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming,' the manifesto stated. It also spoke directly to the federal agents in the case.

Canada may halt electricity exports to US over Trump tariffs	(NewsNation) — Ontario Premier Doug Ford has threatened to cut off electricity exports to the United States following President Donald Trump's newest tariffs. 'If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything — including cut off their energy with a smile on my face,' Ford told reporters at a mining convention in downtown Toronto, the Toronto Sun reported. Trump enacted a 25% tariff on imports from our northern neighbor on Tuesday, making good on his campaign promises to make other North American countries pay for perceived failures in border security. But beyond the political posturing are a combined 380 million people in Canada and the U.S. who could face higher prices or power cuts if this trade war intensifies. Does US rely on Canadian electricity? The United States and Canada have had a symbiotic energy relationship for nearly six decades. America's northern border is home to more than 35 major electricity transmission lines and 70 oil and gas pipelines, connecting the countries in the 'closest energy relationship in the world,' per the embassy of Canada's official website. As of 2021, Canadian energy exports to the United States totaled $112 billion — conversely, the U.S. imported $25 billion in energy to Canada. Car prices could jump by $12K under Trump’s new tariffs: Report In 2024, Canada supplied 62% of American crude oil imports. Other energy exports from Canada include hydroelectric power, natural gas and other fossil fuels. 'The energy relationship between the two countries extends beyond just the trade of commodities, encompassing a variety of common, though not always identical, economic, security, and environmental priorities,' according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In some way, shape or form, all 50 states get energy or benefit from the U.S.-Canada energy trade. Can Canada cut off electricity to the US? Yes, Canada can make good on Ford's promise — though it'll take more than his threats to enact tariffs or pull the plug altogether. It will take federal government approval for Ontario or any province to retaliate against Trump, experts told CNN back in 2024 when Trump and Ford first floated their warnings. Who will be affected by a Canadian energy cut? Nearly every region of the country will feel the heat — or lack thereof — if Canada decides to stop exporting energy. Oil refineries in the Midwest and Great Lakes region rely on that oil to make gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. In 2023, the U.S. imported 1.4 million barrels of Canadian crude oil each day — more than half its daily import of 2.4 million. In New England, states like Maine, which are 'secluded from other regional energy infrastructure,' could face electricity cost hikes of up to $200 million per state, Heatmap News reports. The state of Vermont has partnered with Hydro-Québec to have the Canadian company provide 25% of the state's annual energy needs through 2038. Similarly, New York has a deal for megawatt importation through 2030. Both deals could easily fall apart if Ford's threats come to fruition, leaving much of the northeast scrambling for a new source. What would happen if Canada stops exporting energy to US? If Canada does shutter its energy exports to the U.S., Trump and his administration will have to buy from a pricier source, shift power across the country or create more energy facilities in-house. Integrity Energy, one of the largest commercial energy brokerages in the nation, warns this could 'single-handedly impact power reliability and costs in many states along the Northern border and throughout the Midwest.' The Ohio-based enterprise forecasts a jump in both gas prices and energy rates, especially for states in the northeast like Maine, which is 'secluded from other regional energy infrastructure.' Trump trade war intensifies as tariffs go into place RJ Johnston, research director at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told CNN in December that he doesn't 'see much vulnerability' for America in this situation. He argues that the U.S. has abundant electricity resources and that any energy scramble would likely be temporary. 'Even in an extended outage, the US has the ability to add more generation capacity in a relatively short period of time,' Johnston said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/canada-energy-us-tariffs/	2025-03-04T10:27:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6764336d9706f7.97046770.jpeg?w=900
Here are the White House guests for Trump's address	(The Hill) -- The White House on Tuesday unveiled the list of guests who will sit with first lady Melania Trump at the Capitol during President Donald Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress. Fifteen individuals will sit with the first lady, with the invited individuals intended to highlight Trump's accomplishments six weeks into his second term and, in particular, his administration's priorities around immigration. Trump trade war intensifies as tariffs go into place The White House invited Allyson and Lauren Phillips, who are the mother and sister of Laken Riley. Riley was a college student who was killed roughly a year ago in Athens, Georgia, by a Venezuelan migrant who had been arrested for shoplifting ahead of the attack and paroled in the U.S. Her death became a rallying cry for Trump on the campaign trail. The president and first lady will also host Alexis Nungaray, whose 12-year-old daughter, Jocelyn, was killed by two individuals who entered the country illegally. Also sitting with the first lady will be Roberto Ortiz, who has served as a Border Patrol agent for nearly a decade. The White House also invited Marc Fogel and his mother, Malphine. Fogel was released from Russia last month as part of an exchange brokered by the Trump administration. Fogel, a teacher from Pennsylvania, had been detained for more than three years in a Russian prison. House Republicans advised to avoid in-person town halls amid protests Two White House guests will highlight Trump’s executive actions to ban transgender athletes from women’s sports and to restrict access to gender-affirming care. The first lady will host Payton McNabb, a former high school volleyball player who said she sustained a concussion after a transgender athlete spiked a ball that hit her head. Melania Trump will also host January Littlejohn, who sued a Florida school board alleging officials 'socially transitioned her daughter to a different sexual identity without January and her husband’s knowledge or permission.' Other guests include the family of Corey Comperatore, who was killed during an assassination attempt at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July; Stephanie Diller, the widow of New York police officer Jonathan Diller, who was killed last March at a traffic stop, and Jeff Denard, a steel plant worker from Alabama. 5 things to watch as Trump delivers joint address to Congress Two guests will highlight the first lady’s initiatives specifically. There is Elliston Berry, a 15-year-old who was the victim of deepfake images. Melania Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Monday for a roundtable on deepfakes and revenge porn legislation. There is also Haley Ferguson, a college student who benefitted from an initiative championed by the first lady to assist foster children. The president is set to address the joint session of Congress at 9 p.m. EST on Tuesday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-address-congress-guest-list/	2025-03-04T09:34:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25021042744876-e1741106304941.jpg?w=800
Zelenskyy says Ukraine wants peace, shows gratitude to US	(NewsNation) — Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy said Ukraine wants peace in a social media post Tuesday morning. Despite a tense exchange with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on Friday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine is 'ready to come to the negotiating table' to bring 'lasting peace.' Zelenskyy also expressed a willingness to collaborate with Trump. 'My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,' he said. 'We are ready to work fast to end the war, and the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky — ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure — and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.' Tariffs on Canada, Mexico take effect, as China takes aim at US farm exports Trump called for Zelenskyy to show greater appreciation for the United States on Monday, something the Ukrainian president addressed in his post. 'We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,' Zelenskyy said. 'And we remember the moment when things changed when President Trump provided Ukraine with Javelins,' he said. 'We are grateful for this. Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be. It is regrettable that it happened this way. It is time to make things right. We would like future cooperation and communication to be constructive.' Zelenskyy added that Ukraine is ready to sign a rare minerals agreement. Trump pauses aid to Ukraine amid clash with Zelensky Vance told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that, should Ukraine be willing to negotiate, 'everything is on the table.' 'The president is still committed to the mineral deal,' Vance added. 'I think we’ve heard some positive things, but not yet, of course, a signature from our friends in Ukraine,' Vance said. 'But look, the mineral deal is a very important part of the president’s policy.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/zelenskyy-ukraine-peace-gratitude/	2025-03-04T09:10:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201830748.jpg?w=900
Starliner astronauts avoid engaging in politics about their retur...	(NewsNation) — Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, along with astronaut Nick Hague, will speak to the media ahead of their scheduled return. The crew said they support political leaders and when it comes to being the subject of political discussions, noted that there is information about the situation politicians may not have and likewise, there is political information they are not privy to while in orbit. When it comes to looking ahead, Williams said one of the difficult issues is having family members who know they are coming home but still have no firm date to expect them back. Blue Ghost has first completely successful private lunar landing Williams also answered a question about her dogs, two labrador retrievers, noting that at least they can't tell time but said she was looking forward to returning to them soon. She also expressed sorrow that it could be her last trip to the ISS and indicated she might leave a personal object on board, though she declined to say what it would be, suggesting the next crew would have to find it. The pair will be using generic spacesuits on the return since they were not Earthside to get fitted for custom ones. Unlike the usual suits, they won't be emblazoned with their names though Wilmore joked that they have Sharpies on the ISS and so his suit might have a name after all. He also joked that life in space is great, since all his aches and pains disappear without gravity. Wilmore and Williams initially blasted off for what was expected to be a roughly two-week mission on the International Space Station. However, Boeing's Starliner capsule experienced multiple issues on the journey, including numerous helium leaks in the service capsule and difficulty with thrusters when docking. After evaluation, NASA determined it was unsafe for Starliner to make a crewed return. The capsule made an autonomous journey back to Earth, with Wilmore and Williams embarking on an extended stay on ISS. The pair have pushed back against media and political characterizations that they are 'stranded,' saying they are enjoying the opportunity to spend many months on the ISS. The two are scheduled to return with NASA's Crew-9 mission, currently estimated to return at the end of March. Teacher’s art featured in the International Space Station President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk have attempted to take credit for returning the astronauts on a SpaceX capsule, but NASA began making plans to use a SpaceX vehicle for the return last fall. Crew-10 could launch as early as Mar. 12. Once it docks, there will be a brief handover period and then Wilmore and Williams will return with the Crew-9 mission crew.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/starliner-astronauts-press-return/	2025-03-04T08:53:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Quiz-astronauts_060524_AP_Chris-OMeara-e1734531090665.jpg?w=800
Car prices could jump by $12K under Trump's new tariffs: Report	(NewsNation) — The cost of some new cars could jump by $12,000 due to President Donald Trump's newly enacted tariffs on top trade partners China, Canada and Mexico, a new automotive consultant study found. On Tuesday, 25% tariffs were placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 20% tariff was placed on those from China. Energy resources from Canada will have a lower, 10% tariff. Michigan-based automotive consultant Anderson Economic Group's latest data points to these levies as potential price drivers, Bloomberg first reported. What are tariffs, and why did Trump enact them? Analysis shows the cost of building a crossover utility vehicle will rise by at least $4,000, with electric vehicles seeing a three-fold increase of $12,000. That's on top of already high prices due to inflation, with the average new car transaction last month ringing in at $49,740, per Kelley Blue Book. Which automakers will feel biggest impact from Trump's tariffs? According to new Edmunds data, 48.6% of all new vehicles sold through February were built in the United States. Another 17.4% were built in Mexico, 7.4% in Canada and 26.5% elsewhere. Some automakers rely on our North American neighbors more than others. Nearly half, 45%, of Volkswagen's vehicles are built in Mexico, followed by Nissan (35%) and GM (28%). Roughly one-fourth of new Hondas sold in America come from Canada. 'In the short term, automakers will need to pull every available lever to minimize disruptions and soften the immediate impact, but there’s no escaping the fact that higher costs will ultimately be passed on to consumers,' Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights, said in a statement. Chipotle will absorb tariff-related cost increases, CEO says Other makes and models that could see massive price shifts include the Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck and the Ford Bronco Sport SUV, multiple outlets report. Pricier production will directly impact customers and potentially hurt sales, Patrick Anderson, CEO of AEG, told Bloomberg. 'That kind of cost increase will lead directly — and I expect almost immediately — to a decline in sales of the models that have the biggest trade impacts,' Anderson said. What impact do Trump's tariffs have on the economy? The automotive industry is just one that will likely feel the burn from Trump's tariffs and subsequent international retaliation. Americans could see higher prices on a range of goods the U.S. imports from its top three trading partners, including vehicles, fruits and vegetables, smartphones, toys, laptops and even fuel at the pump. A 2024 paper by a group of top economists looked at Trump’s 2018 tariffs and found that 'import tariffs on foreign goods neither raised nor lowered U.S. employment in newly-protected sectors.' However, retaliatory tariffs had 'clear negative impacts,' primarily in agriculture. NewsNation's Andrew Dorn and the Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/car-prices-trump-tariff-impact-economy/	2025-03-04T08:32:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/6643cc87d66e99.19875148.jpeg?w=900
5 things to watch as Trump delivers joint address to Congress	President Trump will head to the Capitol on Tuesday for the first joint address of his second term emboldened by a month of mass federal agency slashing, shocking foreign policy moves and a dizzying array of executive actions that have disrupted Washington and beyond. Trump will show off such prowess before a joint session of Congress in the House chamber, where his Cabinet secretaries, Supreme Court justices, House and Senate lawmakers, and perhaps the controversial Elon Musk prepare to be his live audience. The president is expected to tout his sweeping efforts to reshape the government, crack down on immigration and reorient U.S. foreign policy on the heels of an Oval Office spat with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Here are five things to watch for in his prime-time speech. Musk and DOGE The White House has yet to say whether Musk will be in attendance, and if so where he will sit, but Musk has joined Trump both in the Oval Office and at his first Cabinet meeting, where he spoke at length, sometimes for longer than Trump. Musk has been put in charge of spending cuts and worker firings within the federal government that the administration says has so far totaled in the billions of dollars. Trump has floated the idea that 20 percent of that could go to taxpayers and another 20 percent toward paying down U.S. debt, but some budget hawks want the deficit taken care of before rebates are sent out. Trump also has to defend the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Musk despite widespread controversy over the manner in which agencies have been slashed and workers fired on the spot, sometimes over one-line emails. Some Republicans have faced pushback at town halls in recent weeks over the cuts the billionaire tech executive has implemented. There’s also ongoing concerns from Democrats and some Republicans about the scope of the cuts that DOGE is implementing, especially as the team has overhauled the work of the U.S. Agency for International Development and targeted the critical work of the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Aviation Administration, among other departments. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats are bringing fired federal workers to the speech to highlight their opposition to DOGE’s sweeping cuts. What Trump will say about Ukraine The speech comes right on the heels of Trump on Monday night pausing aid to Ukraine in an about-face of U.S. foreign policy amid his public clash with Zelensky starting in the Oval Office late last week. Trump also called off peace talks with Zelensky but said Monday that a minerals deal was not completely off the table. Trump’s remarks may provide more clarity on the path forward for U.S. policy toward Ukraine. 'We’re making a speech — you probably heard about it — tomorrow night. So I’ll let you know tomorrow night,' Trump told reporters Monday when asked about discussions around Ukraine. The president said a proposed deal for the U.S. to invest in Ukraine’s critical mineral supply was still possible, but that Zelensky 'should be more appreciative' if he wants to restart talks. Some Republicans have in recent days suggested Zelensky was not the right leader for Kyiv moving forward, while Democrats have warned the Trump administration is playing into Russia’s hands. Trump on Monday doubled down on criticizing Zelensky, bashing him for saying that a deal to end the war is 'is still very, very far away.' Zelensky later said 'we need real peace' and insisted on security guarantees, adding 'it is very important that we try to make our diplomacy really substantive.' New agenda items The news out of the second Trump administration keeps coming at a frenetic pace, but Trump on Tuesday will have perhaps his biggest prime-time audience since retaking office. Trump has used his time before cameras at the White House to make major announcements on tariffs, immigration and foreign policy, including when he stunned the world with his unexpected plan for a U.S. takeover of Gaza and an Oval Office fight with Zelensky that he said would make 'great television.' Trump may find more opportunities for fireworks from the dais, particularly those regarding how he plans to advance his legislative agenda, which he has suggested could be done in one or two sweeping packages involving tax cut extensions, border funding and energy investments. 'Tomorrow night will be big. I will tell it like it is,' Trump posted Monday on Truth Social. The day before the speech, Trump announced additional tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico will now go into effect the day of his address and that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company will make a $100 billion investment in U.S. chip manufacturing plants. How Democrats respond Trump has had limited interactions with Democrats on Capitol Hill since taking office, meeting with bipartisan governors at the White House but largely avoiding Democratic members of Congress. That is set to change on Tuesday, with many Democrats slated to attend Trump’s speech. All eyes will be on whether Democrats jeer or heckle Trump or conduct some type of silent protest. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) famously ripped up her copy of Trump’s State of the Union address in 2020 to show her displeasure with his speech. Democratic women have also attended previous of Trump's State of the Union addresses wearing all white to symbolize women’s rights and suffrage. Trump has taken jabs at former President Biden in various comments to the media since taking office and could use the address as another opportunity to criticize his predecessor, leading to more fireworks. Still, joint addresses to Congress have typically contained some type of outreach to the other party to work on behalf of the American people. Biden used his joint addresses to advocate for issues that he said should be bipartisan, such as care for veterans and addressing the opioid epidemic. In Trump’s case, much of it will come down to whether he and his team view the speech as an opportunity to broaden his appeal, or another chance to double down on the mandate he has claimed in the wake of the 2024 election. Shutdown threat looms Trump will speak to lawmakers 10 days before a government funding deadline that could lead to a shutdown if no agreement is reached. The potential for a shutdown has been overshadowed in the early weeks of Trump’s term by the president’s own actions, as well as congressional Republicans’ efforts to get moving on his agenda. Trump last week publicly backed a 'clean, temporary government funding bill,' urging lawmakers to pass a continuing resolution that would keep the government funded through September. The question is whether Trump can get Republicans unified around that idea. Some Republicans have called for incorporating spending cuts into any funding measure after DOGE identified various contracts it deemed wasteful. Including DOGE cuts in appropriations, however, would spark outcry from Democrats and almost certainly lead to a government shutdown. The narrow margin in the House leaves little wiggle room for Republicans, and Trump may use his speech to urge lawmakers to avoid a worst-case scenario of a messy shutdown.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/5-things-to-watch-as-trump-delivers-joint-address-to-congress/	2025-03-04T08:04:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/Top-Trump_012125_AP_Julia-Demaree-Nikhinson.jpg?w=900
Trump trade war intensifies as tariffs go into place	(The Hill) -- Americans awoke on Tuesday morning to an intensifying trade war, as President Donald Trump’s newest tariffs on Canadian, Mexican and Chinese imports were imposed and those countries quickly moved to retaliate. The Trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on most imports from Canada and Mexico and a new 10 percent tariff on imports from China. In retaliation, Canada hit the U.S. with 25 percent tariffs on $30 billion in goods just after midnight, though it did not specify which products were included. 'Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures,' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said late Monday in a statement. 'While we urge the U.S. administration to reconsider their tariffs, Canada remains firm in standing up for our economy, our jobs, our workers, and for a fair deal,' the outgoing prime minister added. How to watch Trump address to Congress Mexico is expected to announce tariffs on U.S. products later today. China said Tuesday it would impose 15 percent tariffs on imports of chicken, wheat, corn and cotton from the U.S., as well as 10 percent tariffs on imports of sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafoods, fruits vegetables and dairy products, according to The Associated Press. Also on Tuesday, Beijing added 15 U.S. companies to its unreliable entities list, which could potentially bar them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. 'China has decided to include 15 U.S. entities that endanger China’s national security and interests in the export control list, prohibiting the export of dual-use items to them,' the Commerce Ministry said in a statement. Trump has threatened but then pulled back from tariffs previously, but in this case followed through with his vows despite a severely negative reaction from stock markets. The S&amp;P 500 dipped by 1.76 percent on Monday, the biggest loss since December last year. The Dow Jones also fell by nearly 650 points. The Nasdaq Composite was down 2.64 percent as Nvidia stock dropped by nearly 9 percent. Ford and General Motors stocks also fell on Monday. The president is set to address a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening when he will be expected to defend his trade actions. Trump said on Monday that 'vast amounts of fentanyl got poured into our country' mostly through Mexico and from China and suggested to car manufacturers to build factories in the U.S. to successfully sidestep the levies. 'So, what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs,' he added. 5 things to watch as Trump delivers joint address to Congress In hitting Canada and Mexico with tariffs, Trump has argued he is both seeking to crack down on fentanyl illegally entering the country and seeking to make fair a trade system he says penalizes the United States. But Canada and Mexico argue they are taking steps to prevent illegal drugs from crossing the border and that Trump’s actions punish longtime U.S. allies even as they violate previous trade deals. It is unclear where the trade war will head next, though Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Monday he is prepared to cut off electricity exports to the U.S. if Trump's 25 percent tariffs on Canadian goods go through. 'If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything — including cut off their energy with a smile on my face,' Ford told reporters at a mining convention in downtown Toronto, the Toronto Sun reported.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-trade-war-intensifies-as-tariffs-go-into-place/	2025-03-04T08:03:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25063244073051-e1741095130908.jpg?w=800
Designated survivor' is Veterans Affairs Sec. Doug Collins	(NewsNation) — House and Senate lawmakers, U.S. Supreme Court justices, Cabinet members and invited guests will attend President Donald Trump's joint session address to Congress on Tuesday — except for one pivotal person. A 'designated survivor' is a Cabinet member chosen by the president to stay behind during speeches like the State of the Union, leaving the United States with a leader in case of a catastrophic event. NewsNation has learned that Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins will be Trump's 'designated survivor.' Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., announced he was selected by Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries as the 'designated survivor' for the Democratic side. Originating in the 1950s as a Cold War-era policy, assigning a designated survivor is an 'obscure but important ritual' for joint-session events, according to the National Constitution Center. Trump to deliver high-stakes address to joint session of Congress Who is Trump's designated survivor? Typically, the name of the designated survivor is revealed just before, or even during, the address. Like the president, the designated survivor has to meet a few requirements — they must be at least 35 years old and a natural-born U.S. citizen. All members of Trump’s Cabinet meet both requirements. Previous designated survivors include: 2024: Education Secretary Miguel Cardona 2023: Labor Secretary Marty Walsh 2022: Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo 2021: No one, since the pandemic did not allow all members of Congress to gather 2020: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt 2019: Energy Secretary Rick Perry Previous designated survivor describes experience as 'sobering' In 2007, President George W. Bush selected then-U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to be his designated survivor for the State of the Union. Gonzales told NewsNation in 2024 he received no special training to prepare him for the position but that he was given two options for passing the time. 'The option I chose was to put me in an airplane during the State of the Union,' Gonzales said. 'I just felt perhaps it would be kind of cool to fly around as the president gave the State of the Union.' Congress eyes probe, reforms in response to aircraft tragedy When he arrived at Joint Base Andrews, officials from every major department and agency appeared with the necessary documents to advise him in case of disaster. 'President Bush gave his State of the Union, and it was at that point in time where I suddenly realized, ‘Oh, my gosh, if something happened back at the Capitol, then conceivably, I would become president of the United States,'' Gonzalez said. 'It is a sobering thought, quite frankly.' When is Trump's speech? Trump will go to Capitol Hill with first lady Melania Trump tonight, with remarks slated to begin just after 9 p.m. ET — mere hours after he paused aid to Ukraine and enacted hefty tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico.

Congress to hold hearing on air traffic staffing, FAA infrastruct...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — A House subcommittee will hear testimony Tuesday on U.S. air traffic control staffing shortages and technology and infrastructure woes faced by the Federal Aviation Administration. Airlines for America, the nation's largest airline industry trade group, has reported a shortage of about 3,500 air traffic controllers affecting airports nationwide. Lawmakers will discuss 'the critical need to invest in modernizing and adequately staffing the current system' and will hear from labor leaders, aviation safety experts and the CEO of Airlines for America. The hearing begins at 10 a.m. ET. FAA probing 'false alarms' at DC airport The hearing comes amid mounting scrutiny following several recent aviation incidents, including a near-collision last week at Chicago's Midway International Airport involving a Southwest Airlines jet and a Jan. 29 crash at Washington-Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people after an American Airlines regional jet collided with an Army helicopter. US tariffs on Canada, Mexico take effect The FAA is also investigating false collision alerts issued to pilots while attempting to land at Reagan National Airport over the weekend, though no other aircraft were nearby. It is unclear why the alerts went out, the FAA said. To address staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a hiring surge, with a 30% increase in starting salaries for those who attend the FAA academy. He noted the average starting salary is more than $160,000 per year. NewsNation travel editor Peter Greenberg said the shortage of air traffic controllers dates back to 1981, when former President Ronald Reagan fired striking air traffic controllers and replaced them with military controllers. 'There was no provision by the FAA to understand retirement and rehiring, and they’ve never been able to catch up. So the fact that they’re 3,500 controllers short has been going on for four decades,' he said. Greenberg added that three U.S. air traffic control centers are operating under 85% staffing, forcing controllers into mandatory overtime, which is problematic. FAA OKs SpaceX test launch Special government employee Elon Musk has called for retired air traffic controllers to return to work amid growing concerns over conflicts of interest as the Department of Government Efficiency attempts to overhaul the FAA. Senate negotiators look at dueling options to avert government shutdown The FAA has cleared Musk's SpaceX for another test launch, weeks after a Starship explosion during a January test flight, despite the company failing to complete a mandatory investigation into the incident. SpaceX was chosen to help upgrade the FAA's air traffic control system, leading some Democrats, such as Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., to accuse Musk of 'trying to interfere' with the U.S. air traffic control system. While the FAA recently fired 350 staff members as part of a downsizing effort, Duffy asserts that none were air traffic controllers.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/congress-hearing-air-traffic-faa-staffing/	2025-03-04T04:37:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/dca-e1738868011805.jpg?w=800
Trump to deliver high-stakes address to joint session of Congress	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump plans to review his first weeks in office and discuss the future of at least three major topics in Tuesday's joint address to Congress. A White House official tells NewsNation that Trump’s address will focus on 'the renewal of the American Dream' and hinge on four main tenets: First month in office The economy Conflicts abroad Immigration Trump said on social media he intends to 'tell it like it is.' 'In his Joint Address to Congress, President Trump will celebrate his extraordinarily successful first month in office while outlining his bold, ambitious, and common sense vision for the future,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. Melania Trump urges Congress to act on deepfake porn When is Trump's speech? Trump will go to Capitol Hill with first lady Melania Trump tonight, with remarks slated to begin just after 9 p.m. ET — mere hours after he paused aid to Ukraine and enacted hefty tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico.

More than just lawmakers will attend Tuesday's event. In addition, members of the U.S. Supreme Court and Trump's Cabinet will be in attendance. The president typically invites guests to view the address from the balcony above the House floor, next to the first lady. One such guest is January Littlejohn, a self-described 'mom fighting to protect children and families from the harms of gender ideology,' Leavitt announced on social media. Littlejohn claims she 'saved' her daughter from a school that tried to help her young daughter socially transition — changing name, pronouns and appearance. Trump has addressed the topic during his campaign and in the Oval Office, attempting to withhold federal funds from institutions that provide gender-affirming care for minors, among other executive orders. The first lady has also invited more than a dozen 'everyday Americans' to attend Tuesday’s address. Notable attendees include the family of Corey Comperatore, the fire chief killed during the July 13, 2024, attempt on Trump’s life, and Alexis Nungaray, whose daughter Jocelyn was sexually assaulted and killed by two Venezuelan nationals who were in the U.S. illegally. Senate negotiators look at dueling options to avert government shutdown And lawmakers aren't going to Trump's address alone — each gets to bring a guest. More than a dozen Democrats are inviting recently fired federal workers, multiple media outlets reported. Just last week, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer urged rank-and-file lawmakers to issue those invitations. Another confirmed guest is Jennifer Hegseth, wife of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who will be attending with Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn. Is Trump's speech a ‘State of the Union’ address? Technically, a State of the Union address is usually delivered in January or February, and it covers both the previous year's accomplishments and the upcoming year's plan. Since Trump has only been in office six weeks, Tuesday's event will be simply a joint address to Congress. Tariffs an ‘expensive game to play’: Powerteam International CEO According to the American Presidency Project, the impact of these first-year speeches should be considered to have the same heft as the State of the Union addresses that follow in subsequent years. And, just like the State of the Union address, the opposing party gives a brief speech in response, which, like the president’s remarks, is televised. This year’s speech will be delivered by Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.

Tariffs on Canada, Mexico take effect, as China takes aim at US f...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s long-threatened tariffs against Canada and Mexico went into effect Tuesday, putting global markets on edge and setting up costly retaliations by the United States’ North American allies. Starting just past midnight, imports from Canada and Mexico are now to be taxed at 25%, with Canadian energy products subject to 10% import duties. The 10% tariff that Trump placed on Chinese imports in February was doubled to 20%, and Beijing retaliated Tuesday with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would slap tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. Mexico didn't immediately detail any retaliatory measures. Here’s what tariffs are and how they work The U.S. president's moves raised fears of higher inflation and the prospect of a devastating trade war even as he promised the American public that taxes on imports are the easiest path to national prosperity. He has shown a willingness to buck the warnings of mainstream economists and put his own public approval on the line, believing that tariffs can fix what ails the country. 'It’s a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form,' Trump said Monday at the White House. 'And now we’re using them.' The Canada and Mexico tariffs were supposed to begin in February, but Trump agreed to a 30-day suspension to negotiate further with the two largest U.S. trading partners. The stated reason for the tariffs is to address drug trafficking and illegal immigration, and both countries say they've made progress on those issues. But Trump has also said the tariffs will only come down if the U.S. trade imbalance closes, a process unlikely to be settled on a political timeline. The tariffs may be short-lived if the U.S. economy suffers. But Trump could also impose more tariffs on the European Union, India, computer chips, autos and pharmaceutical drugs. The American president has injected a disorienting volatility into the world economy, leaving it off balance as people wonder what he’ll do next. 'It’s chaotic, especially compared to the way we saw tariffs rolled out in the first (Trump) administration,' said Michael House, co-chair of the international trade practice at the Perkins Coie law firm. 'It’s unpredictable. We don’t know, in fact, what the president will do.’’ China slaps extra tariffs of up to 15% on imports of major US farm exports, adds trade curbs Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the tariffs, and even some Republican senators raised alarms. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she’s 'very concerned' about the tariffs going into effect because of her state’s proximity to Canada. 'Maine and Canada’s economy are integrated,' Collins said, explaining that much of the state’s lobsters and blueberries are processed in Canada and then sent back to the U.S. The world economy is now caught in the fog of what appears to be a trade war. Even after Trump announced Monday that the tariffs were going forward, Canadian officials were still in touch with their U.S. counterparts. 'The dialogue will continue, but we are ready to respond,' Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair said in Ottawa as he went into a special Cabinet meeting on U.S.-Canada relations. 'There are still discussions taking place.' Shortly after Blair spoke, Trudeau said Canada would impose 25% tariffs on $155 billion Canadian ($107 billion U.S.) worth of American goods, starting with tariffs on $30 billion Canadian ($21 billion U.S.) worth of goods immediately and on the remaining amount on American products in three weeks. 'Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures,' Trudeau said. Tariffs an ‘expensive game to play’: Powerteam International CEO The White House would like to see a drop in seizures of fentanyl inside the United States, not just on the northern and southern borders. Administration officials say that seizures of fentanyl last month in everywhere from Louisiana to New Jersey had ties to foreign cartels. Damon Pike, technical practice leader for customs and trade services at the tax and consulting firm BDO, suggested the responses of other countries could escalate trade tensions and possibly increase the economic pressure points. 'Canada has their list ready,' Pike said. 'The EU has their list ready. It’s going to be tit for tat.’’ The Trump administration has suggested inflation will not be as bad as economists claim, saying tariffs can motivate foreign companies to open factories in the United States. On Monday, Trump announced that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the computer chipmaker, would be investing $100 billion in domestic production. Still, it can take time to relocate factories spread across the world and train workers with the skills they need. Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of The Toy Association, said the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods will be 'crippling' for the toy industry, as nearly 80% of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China. 'There’s a sophistication of manufacturing, of the tooling,' he said. 'There’s a lot of handcrafting that is part of these toys that a lot of people don’t understand … the face painting, the face masks, the hair weaving, the hair braiding, the cut and sew for plush to get it to look just so. All of that are very high hands, skilled labor that has been passed through generations in the supply chain that exists with China.' For a president who has promised quick results, Ahearn added a note of caution about how quickly U.S. factories could match their Chinese rivals. 'That can’t be replicated overnight,' he said. Gillies reported from Toronto.

O'Reilly: Trump avoiding Putin criticism to negotiate peace deal	(NewsNation) — Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly says President Donald Trump is deliberately avoiding criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin as a calculated strategy to secure a peace deal in Ukraine. 'Trump knows that Putin is never going to stop murdering people, unless Putin can walk away with some kind of victory, some kind of saving face,' O'Reilly said Monday on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' 'That's why Trump isn't attacking him. That's why Trump even patronizes him to a certain extent, not condemning him.' O'Reilly said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fails to understand basic negotiation tactics, saying 'a 10-year-old would' recognize that 'if your enemy is more powerful than you, and you want the enemy to stop murdering your people, you have to make some accommodations.' Paul Manafort: Peace is not in Zelenskyy’s interest O'Reilly's comments followed Trump's contentious Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy, and Monday's announcement that the Trump administration is halting U.S. weapons aid to Ukraine. 'Zelenskyy is going to lose some territory' at war's end, O'Reilly said. Despite criticizing Zelenskyy for being 'in way over his head,' O'Reilly defended the Ukrainian president's intentions, saying, 'I believe that Zelensky wants the best for his country. He's just out of his league. He doesn't understand the danger that surrounds him.' O'Reilly concluded by expressing optimism that Trump would eventually secure a deal, though he acknowledged Democrats would likely criticize any agreement reached.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/on-balance-with-leland-vittert/oreilly-trump-avoiding-putin-criticism-to-negotiate-peace-deal/	2025-03-03T19:39:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-5.jpg?w=900
Paul Manafort: Peace is not in Zelenskyy's interest	(NewsNation) — Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'survives by having a country at war' after a contentious Oval Office meeting between the two presidents. 'Zelenskyy is imperial,' Manafort told NewsNation's 'CUOMO' on Monday. 'His office has expired. He's a martial law president, and that's fine. I mean, that's a legitimate position to be in, but his popularity in Ukraine is not very high.' Manafort, who previously advised former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, said Zelenskyy has political motivations for prolonging the conflict. Trump pauses aid to Ukraine amid clash with Zelensky 'I'm not saying he likes war, but he survives by having a country at war, and so it's in his interest to find ways to stop the fighting, but not necessarily reach peace right away, until he can get strengthened politically,' Manafort said. His comments come after Friday's Oval Office photo op where Trump berated Zelenskyy in front of cameras, calling him 'disrespectful' after the Ukrainian leader pressed Vice President JD Vance on diplomatic solutions with Russia. According to Manafort, Trump had developed a peace plan that included European partners and a peacekeeping force. He said Zelenskyy was warned it 'probably was not a good idea' to come to Washington but insisted on the visit. Second email to federal workers comes with caveat Manafort alleged Democratic lawmakers met with Zelenskyy before the White House meeting and 'got him all juiced up,' saying they 'weren't looking for peace, they were looking for political issue.' When asked about Trump pulling all aid to Ukraine, Manafort described it as 'purely a pressure tactic' rather than a genuine threat. 'Putin is ready to come to the table,' Manafort said, adding that Trump 'has a plan' for negotiations. The Friday meeting was originally scheduled to discuss an agreement for U.S. access to critical minerals in Ukraine, which Trump has argued would boost the Ukrainian economy and help recoup U.S. aid to Ukraine. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, following its annexation of Crimea in 2014.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/paul-manafort-peace-zelenskyy/	2025-03-03T18:49:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-3.jpg?w=900
Trump pauses aid to Ukraine amid clash with Zelensky	President Trump has ordered a pause to U.S. aid going to Ukraine in its war against Russia, a consequential move as he clashes with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about the path to ending the conflict. 'The President has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well,' a White House official said in a statement. 'We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.'

How law enforcement targets migrants on ‘smuggler’s highway’	(NewsNation) — As President Donald Trump ramps up border enforcement, smugglers are becoming more creative and aggressively utilizing minibuses to transport people illegally into the country on what's been called the 'smuggler's highway.' The highway stretch on Interstate 10 in Arizona was targeted under a special operation by the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office, which says migrants have become more aggressive in the weeks since Trump took office. Sheriffs told NewsNation they've had more 'hot pursuits' on the smuggler's highway in recent weeks. Crisis at the Border: On the Frontlines Deputies say under the Biden administration, migrants who were caught would pull over knowing that they weren't going to be locked up and deported, but now, they keep driving out of fear. One migrant told deputies he paid $8,000 for his minibus ticket to cross illegally, while another was found crossing with more than $140,000 in cash. The money was wrapped in small bags, and the man carrying it couldn't explain how he got it. Law enforcement said the money likely came from drugs or that the man was a smuggler and had been paid by some of the migrants in cash.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/law-enforcement-migrants-smugglers-highway/	2025-03-03T15:25:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/entinborderteaseVO_mp4_WGNX3826_446_mp4_00.00.21.23.jpg?w=900
New York City reports measles cases, raising public health concer...	NEW YORK (PIX11) -- A highly contagious illness that can cause pneumonia, swelling of the brain, miscarriage, and even death, has been reported in New York City. Measles is a highly contagious virus that can infect up to 90% of unvaccinated people who come in close proximity to an infected person, according to the New York City Department of Health. RFK Jr. calls for measles vaccinations as cases spread In 2024, New York State reported 15 cases, 14 of which were in New York City. The biggest outbreak in New York City over the last decade was in 2019 with 605 confirmed cases. In addition to the two confirmed cases in New York City, several measles cases were recently reported in New Jersey. In one case, a patient who was unvaccinated traveled outside of the U.S. and became sick with the illness after returning home to New Jersey, according to the state department of health. Two other unvaccinated people contracted the highly contagious illness from the first patient, the New Jersey health department said. Mexicans warned not to travel to Texas over measles What is measles? It’s a respiratory disease caused by one of the world’s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes, or coughs. It most commonly affects kids. Measles first infects the respiratory tract, and then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes, and a rash. Measles is one of the world’s most contagious viruses. Here’s what to know and how to avoid it The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees, according to the CDC. There’s no specific treatment for measles, but health officials say that people who have had measles once cannot get it again. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Mexico says US guns fuel cartels, Supreme Court to weigh in	(NewsNation) — The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday on whether the country of Mexico can proceed with a lawsuit against U.S. gun manufacturers, accusing them of fueling violence caused by drug cartels that use American firearms. For the first time, the case asks the nation’s highest court to consider the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA. The law was passed in 2005, and gives immunity to gun makers so they can’t be held liable for injuries caused by criminal misuse of their weapons. The case came to the Supreme Court on the same day President Donald Trump put into effect tariffs on Mexico to put pressure on the nation to stop fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration. Trump says 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports will start Tuesday, with ‘no room’ for delay The outcome of the case could have significant impacts in the U.S. depending on how the court rules, Andrew Willinger, executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law, told NewsNation. 'I don't think this is going to sort of cut off these types of lawsuits, but depending on how the court decides and what language majority opinion uses, it could make lower courts a little bit more skeptical of these claims across the board,' he said. In 2019, the Supreme Court declined to consider a gun manufacturer's argument that PLCAA prohibited the families of the Sandy Hook school shooting victims from suing. But this ruling could make that harder if the court rules more broadly, Willinger said. Why is Mexico suing US gun companies? Mexico filed a $10 billion suit against leading U.S. gun manufacturers in 2021 over allegations that their practices facilitated illegal gun trafficking to Mexican drug cartels, causing violence and bloodshed in the nation. In its filing, the government of Mexico stated that it has only one gun store, issues less than 50 gun permits a year and that about 70% of all guns recovered from Mexican crime scenes come from the US. Mexico argues the companies knew weapons were being sold to traffickers who smuggled them into Mexico and decided to cash in on that market. The defendants include big-name manufacturers such as Smith &amp; Wesson, Beretta, Colt and Glock. Prices rose along border ahead of Trump’s tariffs — now disruption looms They 'deliberately sell their guns through dealers who are known to disproportionately sell firearms that are recovered at crime scenes in Mexico. They provide these red-flag dealers with the firearms that Petitioners know cartels prefer, designing and marketing those firearms in ways they know cater to the cartels. They embrace distribution practices they know enable these red-flag dealers to illegally sell to cartel traffickers. And they intentionally do all this to boost their bottom lines,' Mexico wrote in one of its filings. The gun companies say Mexico has not shown the industry has purposely done anything to allow the weapons to be used by cartels and is trying to 'bully' gunmakers into adopting gun-control measures. Those companies argued that the lawsuit was barred by the PLCAA, which prohibits certain lawsuits against gun manufacturers. 'When the manufacturer or supplier of a lawful product simply puts its product in the general stream of commerce, the aiding-and-abetting statute does not charge that business with broadly policing every bad actor who may pick up its products downstream,' they wrote in filings. How did the lower courts rule? The lawsuit was initially dismissed by a district court that cited legal protections for gun makers from damages resulting from criminal use of firearms. The First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that while the PLCAA does apply to lawsuits by foreign governments for harm suffered abroad, Mexico’s lawsuit falls within the law’s 'predicate exception,' which allows lawsuits when gun companies knowingly broke the law. The gun makers are asking the Supreme Court to undo the appeal court ruling. Man claiming cartel ties arrested after interstate shooting: Police 'Mexico has extinguished its constitutional arms right and now seeks to extinguish America’s,' the National Rifle Association told the Supreme Court. 'I suspect that the court is going to side with the gun manufacturers here,' Willinger said, adding that it was primarily an inference from the fact that the court decided to take the case at this early stage. 'If the justices were sympathetic to Mexico's allegations, they would look at this and say ‘we want to give the trial court a chance to see what Mexico brings forward,’ but the fact that they didn't signals that they likely have issues with the appeals court ruling,' he said. What are the implications of the case for Americans? The words used by the court will be crucial, Willinger said. The families of the Sandy Hook victims were able to sue a gun company under an exception to PLCAA, eventually settling with the manufacturer that made shooter Adam Lanza’s assault weapon for $73 million in 2022. While the violations alleged were different in the Sandy Hook case, a broad court opinion on PLCAA and how important it is could have caused cases like Sandy Hook from moving forward, he said. 'To the extent that the court is more focused on the nature of the violation, like aiding and abetting illegal sales and to what extent a gun manufacturer can be liable even when they don't know, that could have a big impact on domestic litigation because the issue in those cases is often the same,' he said.

Trump's change in rhetoric signals push for peace: James Jeffrey	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump's change in rhetoric signals an inevitable peace deal, according to James Jeffrey, a former ambassador and deputy national security adviser. Trump addressed Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a media conference Tuesday. 'I just think he should be more appreciative,' Trump said of Zelenskyy. 'Because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin. We've given them much more than Europe, and Europe should have given more than us because, as you know, that's right there.' Jeffrey said Trump's comments signify a shift back to the messaging of a peace deal, which he spoke about early in his meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday before tensions increased. Trump announces $100B semiconductor investment from Taiwan 'The problem is that Zelenskyy is not really sure he wants to do a deal,' Jeffrey said. 'Zelenskyy was raising issues [on Friday] that are nonstarters with President Trump, and frankly, they're nonstarters with the Russians. So that led to the irritation. Now, people are trying to work this out. 'European pledge to support Zelenskyy is helpful, but Zelenskyy knows, or should know, Europeans alone cannot either deliver enough weapons and other financial support or negotiate with Russia.' Trump said peace talks could resume when Zelenskyy showed greater gratitude to the United States and told reporters he didn't think a deal was dead. Earlier in the day, the president took umbrage with Zeleskyy's comments that the end of the war was 'still very, very far away.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/trump-rhetoric-push-peace/	2025-03-03T14:09:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Trump-and-Putin-0221202.jpg?w=900
Trump: 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico will go into effec...	President Trump said Monday that the 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico will officially go into effect Tuesday, announcing there is no room for dealmaking to delay them again. 'The tariffs, they're all set. They go into effect tomorrow,' he said, adding there’s 'no room left for Mexico or Canada' to make a deal before midnight. Trump had warned last week that the tariffs will go forward after he delayed them for a month following conversations with the Canadian and Mexican leaders, during which they agreed to action to address the flow of drugs at the border. Trump said Monday that 'vast amounts of fentanyl got poured into our country' largely through Mexico and from China, and he encouraged car manufacturers to build plants in the U.S. to avoid the upcoming tariffs. 'So, what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs,' Trump said Monday. The president also announced that reciprocal tariffs will start April 2, which will cover imports from all nations that levy import taxes on U.S. goods. 'Reciprocal tariffs start on April 2. And I wanted to make it April 1, but I didn't want to do it, I didn't want to go April Fool's Day, because that … costs a lot of money … so we're going April 2,' Trump quipped. Trump said on Truth Social earlier Monday that tariffs on 'external' agricultural products will be imposed early April. 'To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!' he said. The stock market took a hit after Trump's announcements on tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 700 points after Trump's announcement. The president also suggested Monday that the 10 percent tariffs on China could increase to 20 percent. When Trump delayed the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, he had imposed a 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports over the issue of fentanyl production, and China responded with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-25-percent-tariffs-on-canada-and-mexico-will-go-into-effect-tuesday/	2025-03-03T13:21:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/Trump_SouthLawn_02282025.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr. calls for measles vaccinations as cases spread	(NewsNation) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, urged people to consider getting vaccinated as measles cases have been reported in 10 states, with the outbreak now spreading to New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 'All parents should consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine. The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,' Kennedy said in an op-ed at Fox Digital. The New Jersey Department of Health issued an alert Friday confirming its third case of measles in the state. An unvaccinated person from Bergen County contracted measles after returning from a trip overseas and spread it to two other people. Mexicans warned not to travel to Texas over measles Two measles cases have been confirmed in New York City, and one case has been confirmed in the state of Pennsylvania. Last week, Texas health officials announced an infected child had died, becoming the first registered measles death in the U.S. in a decade. The outbreak in the state has infected more than 140 people. Measles cases have also been reported in Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Mexico and Rhode Island. What is causing your spring allergies and what can you do to prevent them? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a total of 164 measles cases across the country. Measles is an extremely contagious airborne disease. It spreads when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes and can cause severe illness and even death. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body. Anyone not vaccinated against measles is at risk. Young children and pregnant women are at a higher risk of severe complications. The best way to prevent measles is by getting vaccinated against it. The MMR vaccine is most effective at two doses and provides lifelong protection.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/rfk-jr-measles-cases-northeast/	2025-03-03T13:16:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/RFK_041024_Photo_Getty_0a28db-e1732303765297.png?w=800
JD Vance's role in Zelenskyy clash puts spotlight on VP	(NewsNation) — Vice President JD Vance played a noticeable role in the escalation of tension during a combative meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday. Vance's vocal involvement was among several noteworthy moments and led to mixed reactions. The vice president received praise from supporters of the GOP for defending the Trump administration and criticism from supporters of the Democratic party. Once Vance truly inserted himself into the conversation, calling for diplomacy for Russia, the temperature between the leaders rose. Texas border officials using drones to stop smugglers A Trump administration official told NewsNation that the president and vice president 'were totally on the same page' and Trump 'was happy with how the vice president jumped in.' The vice president in those kinds of settings, in the Oval Office, typically does not interject the way that Vice President Vance did. For the first month of this administration, Elon Musk has largely been the most visible right-hand man for President Trump. It remains to be seen if Vance will continue to be a staunchly vocal defender of the Trump administration. Education Department offers $25K for staffers to quit Many Democrat lawmakers are very concerned about the state of a potential peace deal, and many of them have blamed President Trump and Vance specifically. Most of the discourse in Washington falls along party lines. Republicans have been very defensive of Vance and Trump, saying that they were defending American values and that Zelenskyy was disrespectful in the Oval Office.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jd-vances-zelenskyy-clash-spotlight/	2025-03-03T10:47:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-2201827007.jpg?w=900
Live: Trump makes investment announcement	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is making an investment announcement Monday afternoon. The White House did not release any other information on the announcement, but the Wall Street Journal reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. intends to invest $100 billion into chip manufacturing in the U.S. over the next four years. The announcement comes just ahead of Trump's first address to Congress in his second term. Senior USAID official ousted after sending memo on ‘lifesaving’ aid The president is also dealing with the aftermath of a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week. The two got into a shouting match during an Oval Office photo op, an unprecedented clash in front of media. Trump has signaled he is not ready to make amends with Zelenskyy and could withdraw U.S. support for Ukraine as the country continues to defend itself against Russia. European leaders have come out in support of Zelenskyy, making it possible they will step in to try to fill the gap.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-investment-announcement/	2025-03-03T10:11:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201496887.jpg?w=900
Education Department offers $25K for staffers to quit	(The Hill) -- The Education Department sent out an email to staffers on Friday saying if they quit by Monday at midnight, they will receive a $25,000 cash payout. A department official confirmed the email, which warned of significant layoffs in the near future, to The Hill. The email, first reported by Politico, was sent by Jacqueline Clay, a chief human capital officer, giving employees until 11:59 p.m. on Monday to make a decision. RFK Jr. says Texas measles outbreak a ‘call to action’ 'This is a one time offer in advance of a very significant Reduction in Force for the US Department of Education,' Clay said. The department did not answer when asked how many staffers have accepted the offer so far. Some employees are ineligible for the payout such as those who have not yet been employed at the department for three years, those who have recently received a bonus or other award or those who got a student loan repayment benefit in the last three years. Clay said the payout would be 'the equivalent of severance pay or $25,000, whichever is less.' The offer comes after the department has already put dozens of employees on administrative leave as the Trump administration eyes moves to shut it down completely. $2 bills: Why does the US still print the rarely used currency? While complete elimination of the Education Department would take an act of Congress, it seems the agency will be slashed in other ways, as almost one billion dollars in contracts have been canceled. The email also comes the same day Linda McMahon, President Donald Trump’s pick for Education secretary, is set to be confirmed by the Senate. The former World Wrestling Entertainment head laid out in her confirmation hearing that she would like to see certain programs from the Department of Education move to other federal agencies. 'President Trump believes that the bureaucracy in Washington should be abolished so that we can return education to the states, where it belongs,' McMahon wrote to Democratic senators. 'I wholeheartedly support and agree with this mission.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/education-department-staffer-payout/	2025-03-03T09:23:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/ed-e1739188791590.jpg?w=800
Texas border officials using drones to stop smugglers	(NewsNation) — The Texas Department of Public Safety is employing cutting-edge technology to turn the tide on border-smuggling operations: drones. NewsNation exclusively joined DPS officials on the Lone Star State's border in the small town of Roma, Texas. Separated from Mexico by the Rio Grande, the area is a hotbed for cartels looking to move people or drugs across the border. Texas state trooper Sgt. Guadalupe Casarez was one of the officials using drones to monitor potential smuggling activity along the river. From Roma, Casarez said he can see cartel scouts patrolling the border on foot, in vehicles and in the air — using their own drones to spot Border Patrol agents and troopers — as they look for landing points for the small rafts carrying migrants into the United States. Elite US border unit trains daily to pursue dangerous intruders One cartel guide had no idea that Casarez's eye in the sky could see his every move. He brought two migrants from the bushes and made a run into a residential neighborhood. 'It’s an overall operation for them on their side,' Casarez said, explaining the process and planning needed to get people into the U.S. without detection. The migrants believed they had made it into the U.S. undetected by authorities, and the smuggler thought his job was finished. But Texas troopers operating the drones had already called back to Border Patrol agents patrolling nearby — and the pursuit was on. Border patrol agents rushed to the scene and arrested a female migrant. Agents then quickly jumped into the bushes, attempting to chase down the cartel guide and a male migrant who were making a run for it. The guide and the male migrant could be seen jumping into a raft, where another cartel scout was waiting to paddle them back to Mexico. Texas troopers, US Border Patrol team up to squash smuggling Drones like the ones used in this operation are equipped with heat sensors and play a crucial role in border security, Casarez said. Troopers also place game cameras in strategic areas to catch smugglers, using motion alerts to pinpoint where they need to deploy. Cartel scouts have taken to stealing the surveillance cameras and returning to Mexico before law enforcement can arrive. Texas DPS partners with U.S. Border Patrol agents and members of the Texas National Guard to try and track migrants that immigration officials characterize as 'gotaways.' In most cases, the Texas DPS works to determine if it can file state charges against those they encounter and charge them with smuggling people across the border. In other cases, U.S. Border Patrol officials file federal charges for human smuggling. The agencies also work together to stop the flow of illegal drugs being moved across the U.S.-Mexico border.

Senior USAID official ousted after sending memo on 'lifesaving' a...	(NewsNation) — Nicholas Enrich, acting assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development, was fired after sending a memo about the agency's failure to implement 'lifesaving humanitarian assistance.' Two USAID sources told NewsNation that Enrich, in a six-page letter to the entire agency, said Secretary of State Marco tried to unfreeze several pools of funding that he found to be critical aid. Rubio, on Jan.28, issued a temporary waiver to the pause on foreign assistance referenced in Trump's executive order on 'Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid,' the memo said. Second email to federal workers comes with caveat However, Enrich wrote, Rubio was overruled and ran into bureaucratic hurdles. Political leadership at USAID, the State Department and the Department of Government Efficiency created obstacles to prevent implementation of his waiver, the memo said. The sources said Enrich was let go shortly after the document was sent out and that they found the timing of this troubling and not coincidental. The prevailing feeling within USAID, the sources said, is that Enrich was let go as retribution. USAID funding cut Notices were sent out en masse last week stating that over 90% of USAID’s contracts for humanitarian and development work around the world were being terminated, per an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press. The Trump administration has outlined plans to cut some $60 billion in funding. Projects that were closed, according to the AP, include treating tens of thousands of malnourished children in Congo; food assistance in Ethiopia to more than 1 million people; and a program distributing bed nets and medication to prevent malaria in Senegal. Claims about USAID funding are spreading online. Many are not based on facts USAID staffers were told last week that Trump administration officials would be firing 1,600 employees and placing all but a fraction of employees on administrative leave, NewsNation partner The Hill reported. On Wednesday, USAID employees were given 15 minutes to collect their belongings from their offices.

Officials search for missing Oregon toddler last seen in yard	(NewsNation) — Authorities are searching for a 2-year-old boy in Oregon who was reported missing Saturday afternoon. Dane Paulson was reported missing from his family's Siletz, Oregon, home around 4:25 p.m. He had been playing in the yard out of his parents' sight. The Lincoln County Sheriff's Office launched a search of the property and surrounding areas using foot searchers and drones with thermal imaging equipment. Florida police search for missing 17-year-old from St. Pete The search continued Sunday with dogs and watercraft at the nearby Siletz River. Around 300 people were involved in the search, which had covered 382 areas and 283 miles as of Sunday evening. A vehicle seen near the home was found and is no longer a point of interest, according to the sheriff's office. The office said an Amber Alert was not issued because the case doesn't meet the criteria and that there is no evidence so far suggesting criminal actions. The office described the toddler as friendly and fearless, comfortable around strangers and water, but unable to swim. Amber Alert issued for missing, endangered teenage girl in North Carolina Dane Paulson has brown hair and green eyes and was last seen wearing a fuzzy, grey hoodie with ears, blue and white shoes and black pants.

Trump administration ramps up attacks as Zelenskyy thanks US	(NewsNation) — The Oval Office spat between Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy is raising serious questions about the future of the U.S.-Ukraine alliance. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said there is a rift in the relationship and accused Zelenskyy of standing against freedom. 'Many of these European countries who are coming to Zelenskyy's side as he walked out of the White House saying basically that they are going to support him in continuing this war, and that they don't stand with us around these fundamental values of freedom,' Gabbard said on 'Fox News Sunday.' National security adviser Mike Waltz and House Speaker Mike Johnson have also joined a growing chorus of Republicans who think Ukraine might be better off finding a new leader. 'Something has to change. Either he needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,' Johnson told NBC's 'Meet the Press' on Sunday. GOP lawmakers divided on Trump-Zelenskyy feud But some Republican lawmakers, such as Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, have dissented from their party's approval of Friday's meeting. On Saturday, Murkowski lamented the situation on social media: 'I am sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin, a threat to democracy and U.S. values around the world.' Lankford, R-Okla., said it was inappropriate for senators to call for Zelenskyy to resign and predicted that such a move would 'spiral Ukraine into chaos right now.' UK prime minister won’t cancel Trump visit after Zelenskyy meeting On the heels of the tense clash in the Oval Office, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reportedly paused all U.S. Cyber Command actions against Russia indefinitely — including possible digital offensives by the Pentagon. This comes as Moscow celebrates the White House's position. A Kremlin spokesperson said the Trump administration's new approach aligns with Russia's vision. Zelenskyy thanks US after Trump altercation For his part, Zelenskyy seems to be trying to get things back on track. During a summit with European leaders in London over the weekend, Zelenskyy recommitted to signing a rare earth minerals deal with the U.S. That deal was originally meant to go public during Friday's White House visit. Ukrainian president thanks Trump, US on X day after heated meeting Zelenskyy also stressed Ukraine's gratitude to the U.S., writing on social media Sunday: 'We are very grateful to the United States for all the support. I’m thankful to President Trump, Congress for their bipartisan support, and American people. Ukrainians have always appreciated this support, especially during these three years of full-scale invasion.' UK summit drafts peace plan for Ukraine At Saturday's summit, European leaders bolstered support for Ukraine and drafted a ceasefire plan for presentation to the U.S. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also promised a $2 billion deal to fund air-defense missiles for Ukraine. 'Because my reaction was we have to bridge this, we have to find a way that we can all work together because in the end we’ve had three years of bloody conflict now, we need to get to that lasting peace,' Starmer told the BBC. Early chatter of a peace deal involves a temporary truce lasting around one month, but how soon that deal could come — and if it will include security guarantees — remains uncertain.

Illinois man accused of deadly mass shooting at July 4th parade f...	WAUKEGAN, Ill (AP) — The trial of a suburban Chicago man accused of a mass shooting at a 2022 Independence Day parade that killed seven people and wounded dozens more is set to begin Monday. Robert Crimo III faces 21 counts of first-degree murder, three counts for each person killed, as well as 48 counts of attempted murder. Prosecutors dropped the less serious 48 counts of aggravated battery before jury selection last week. The road to the trial has been bumpy, with delays partly due to Crimo’s unpredictability, including his rejection of a plea deal that even surprised his attorneys. As potential jurors were questioned last week, he sporadically appeared in court, at times refusing to leave his jail cell. Authorities alleged Crimo perched on a roof and fired into crowds assembled for the annual Fourth of July parade in downtown Highland Park, 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Chicago. Prosecutors have submitted thousands of pages of evidence, as well as hours of a videotaped interrogation during which police say Crimo confessed to the shooting. But the 24-year-old has since pleaded not guilty. His defense attorneys have declined comment ahead of the trial, which is expected to last about a month. His father, Robert Crimo Jr., a onetime mayoral candidate, was charged in connection with how his son obtained a gun license. He pleaded guilty in 2023 to seven misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct and served less than two months in jail. He has attended his son’s hearings, sometimes making eye contact with him during court. He declined to discuss the case in detail ahead of the trial. 'As a parent, I love my son very much,' he said. 'And Bobby loves this country more than anyone would ever know.' Prosecutors plan to call multiple law enforcement officers and survivors of the shooting to testify. They also will show videos of Crimo’s statements to police. Some of the videos already have been shown in court as prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to have them thrown out. Crimo’s erratic behavior has contributed to court delays. He fired his public defenders and said he would represent himself, then abruptly reversed himself. In June 2024, when he was expected to accept a plea deal and give victims and relatives a chance to address him publicly, he arrived at the court in a wheelchair and rejected the deal. Residents in the wealthy Highland Park community of roughly 30,000 set along Lake Michigan have mourned the losses deeply. Some potential jurors were excused because of their connections to the case. City leaders canceled the usual parade in 2023, opting for a 'community walk.' The parade was reinstated last year on a different route and with a memorial for the victims. 'Our community is once again reminded of the immense pain and trauma caused by the Highland Park shooting,' Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering said in a statement ahead of jury selection. 'Our hearts remain with the victims, their families, and all those whose lives were forever changed by that devastating day.' The victims killed in the shooting included Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35. Survivors and their families have filed multiple lawsuits, including against the maker of the semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting and against authorities they accuse of negligence.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/ap-illinois-man-accused-of-deadly-mass-shooting-at-july-4th-parade-faces-trial-3-years-after-attack/	2025-03-02T21:06:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67c53a167a5d52.97467677.jpeg?w=900
Francis off mechanical ventilation entirely, signaling he's overc...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis remained in stable condition and didn’t need any mechanical ventilation Sunday, the Vatican said. It was a sign that he had overcome the possible complications from a respiratory crisis Friday and that his breathing function overall was improving as he recovers from pneumonia. The 88-year-old pope did continue to receive high-flow supplemental oxygen after Friday’s coughing episode, which sparked fears of a new lung infection. Doctors in their late Sunday update said Francis remained stable but again referred to the complexity of his overall condition and kept his prognosis at guarded, meaning he wasn’t out of danger. Francis, who has been in the hospital since Feb. 14, rested, prayed in his private chapel and participated in Mass after a morning visit from the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and his chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra. The content of their talks wasn't known, but even when at the Vatican, Francis meets at least weekly with them. He again skipped his weekly noon blessing to avoid even a brief public appearance from the hospital. Instead, the Vatican distributed a message written by the pope from Gemelli Hospital in which he thanked his doctors for their care and well-wishers for their prayers, and prayed again for peace in Ukraine and elsewhere. 'From here, war appears even more absurd,' Francis said in the message, which he drafted in recent days. Francis said he was living his hospitalization as an experience of profound solidarity with people who are sick and suffering everywhere. 'I feel in my heart the ‘blessing’ that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,' Francis said in the text. 'At the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people.' Signs point to a recovery Many signs indicated he was improving, especially after a respiratory crisis on Friday afternoon that resulted in him inhaling vomit during a coughing fit and raising the possibility of new infection. Doctors aspirated the vomit and put him on noninvasive mechanical ventilation, a mask that pumps oxygen into the lungs. He used the ventilation on Saturday, alternating it with just supplemental oxygen, and by Sunday no longer needed it. Doctors also reported he had no fever or raised white blood cell levels, which would have indicated his body was fighting a new infection. The doctors had said they needed 24 to 48 hours after Friday's coughing episode to determine if there were any negative impacts on Francis' overall condition. The passage of time and positive reports Sunday suggested he had overcome the episode successfully. The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted to Gemelli on Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into a complex pneumonia in both lungs. Prayers continued to pour in Francis’ hospitalization has come as the Vatican is marking its Holy Year, drawing pilgrims to Rome from all over. Many have added a pilgrimage destination to their itineraries so they can pray for Francis at the Gemelli hospital, which is around a 20-minute drive from the Vatican, longer in rush hour or on public transport. The Rev. Riccardo Fumagalli had accompanied a group of young people from Milan to Rome for the Jubilee and would have attended Francis' Angelus prayer in St. Peter's Square on Sunday if he had delivered it as usual. Instead, they went to Gemelli. 'It seemed good to us to come here to express our closeness, especially of these teenagers, to be close to the Holy Father to pray for him, to pray for this moment of illness,' he said. Cancer patient Antonino Cacace was also arriving Sunday at Gemelli from Milan for his own treatment, saying he has to undergo surgery in the coming days and was counting on Francis' prayers. 'I am glad the pope is giving me help,' he said. 'I am on the ninth (floor) and he is on the 10th (floor). I hope to meet him and see him,' he said. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Sanctuary city mayors to testify before House Oversight Committee	(NewsNation) — Four Democratic mayors from sanctuary cities are set to testify Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee in what observers expect will be a contentious hearing focused on immigration policies. Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu will appear as the Trump administration intensifies its mass deportation efforts, putting sanctuary city policies under increased scrutiny. The four cities have struggled to manage the influx of migrants from the southern border, collectively spending billions of dollars on shelter and support services. Pentagon sending combat troops to southern border Republican committee members are expected to criticize the mayors for not cooperating with federal immigration authorities, likely citing crimes allegedly committed by migrants and questioning whether the mayors are adequately protecting their constituents. Mayor Adams may face less criticism from Republicans after recently meeting with Trump's border czar Tom Homan and agreeing to assist federal authorities in apprehending undocumented migrants with criminal records in New York City. However, Adams' cooperation comes after the Justice Department moved to drop corruption and bribery charges against him, raising questions about potential political motivations. Adams has denied any quid pro quo, stating he is 'not beholden to the Trump administration' but is 'just doing what he thinks is right.' Meanwhile, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced his candidacy for New York City mayor, planning a rally in lower Manhattan where he is expected to receive his first labor endorsement from the Carpenters' Union. Extradition of 29 capos shows Mexico 'can do more' A recent poll conducted by NewsNation affiliate WPIX, Emerson College and The Hill shows Cuomo leading in the Democratic primary race despite the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation as governor in 2021. Critics are organizing counter-demonstrations to remind voters of the accusations made against Cuomo by nearly a dozen women. During the early pandemic, Cuomo had a complex relationship with then-President Trump, occasionally cooperating with the administration but also publicly challenging federal policies when he disagreed with them.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/sanctuary-city-mayors-house-committee/	2025-03-02T16:41:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-1.jpg?w=900
Private lunar lander Blue Ghost aces moon touchdown with a specia...	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A private lunar lander carrying a drill, vacuum and other experiments for NASA touched down on the moon Sunday, the latest in a string of companies looking to kickstart business on Earth's celestial neighbor ahead of astronaut missions. Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon’s northeastern edge of the near side. Confirmation of successful touchdown came from the company's Mission Control outside Austin, Texas, following the action some 225,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away. 'You all stuck the landing. We’re on the moon,' Firefly’s Will Coogan, chief engineer for the lander, reported. An upright and stable landing makes Firefly — a startup founded a decade ago — the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Even countries have faltered, with only five claiming success: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. A half hour after landing, Blue Ghost started to send back pictures from the surface, the first one a selfie somewhat obscured by the sun's glare. The second shot included the home planet, a blue dot glimmering in the blackness of space. Two other companies’ landers are hot on Blue Ghost’s heels, with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week. Blue Ghost — named after a rare U.S. species of fireflies — had its size and shape going for it. The squat four-legged lander stands 6-foot-6 (2 meters) tall and 11 feet (3.5 meters) wide, providing extra stability, according to the company. Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It’s the third mission under NASA’s commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade. Firefly’s Ray Allensworth said the lander skipped over hazards including boulders to land safely. Allensworth said the team continued to analyze the data to figure out the lander's exact position, but all indications suggest it landed within the 328-foot (100-meter) target zone in Mare Crisium. The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down. It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet (3 meters) below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust — a scourge for NASA’s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment. On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers. The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business. Another lander — a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines — is due to land on the moon Thursday. It’s aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That’s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over. Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972. A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route. Like Intuitive Machines, ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time. Its first lander crashed in 2023. The moon is littered with wreckage not only from ispace, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades. NASA wants to keep up a pace of two private lunar landers a year, realizing some missions will fail, said the space agency's top science officer Nicky Fox. 'It really does open up a whole new way for us to get more science to space and to the moon,' Fox said. Unlike NASA’s successful Apollo moon landings that had billions of dollars behind them and ace astronauts at the helm, private companies operate on a limited budget with robotic craft that must land on their own, said Firefly CEO Jason Kim. Kim said everything went like clockwork. 'We got some moon dust on our boots,' Kim said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Trump announces US crypto reserve	President Trump announced Sunday that the U.S. would be creating a crypto reserve, to boost the growing industry. 'A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,' Trump posted to Truth Social. Trump said he will make the United States the 'Crypto Capital of the World.' His announcement comes just after the White House announced it would be welcoming cryptocurrency industry professionals on March 7 in a first-of-its-kind summit. Attendees will include founders, CEOs and investors from the industry. Hegseth directs civilian workers of DoD to reply to OPM email One of Trump’s first executive orders said he plans to make 'responsible growth' and use of 'digital assets' and technologies to bolster the economy. Trump’s digital assets working group has a deadline of six months to submit recommendations on regulatory and legislative proposals to the president surrounding the industry. While Trump previously dismissed crypto as a scam, he’s embraced the industry throughout his most recent campaign.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/trump-announces-us-crypto-reserve/	2025-03-02T12:41:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/trumpdonald_022825gn06_w.jpg?w=900
Why Trump wants 'gold card' to replace EB-5 visa	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has a new means of making the United States trillions of dollars. The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would be revamping the U.S. investor visa, also known as the EB-5, increasing the funds required to secure the status while dubbing the new option a 'gold card.' 'It's sort of a green card plus, and it's a path to citizenship,' Trump said this week. 'We're going to call it the 'Gold card,' and I think it's going to be very treasured. I think it's going to do very well. And we're going to start selling, hopefully in about two weeks. Now, just so you understand, if we sell a million, right? A million, that's $5 trillion.' Non-citizens can fast-track their visa status and potentially become citizens down the line for a price of $5 million. What is a golden visa, and where can you get one? While President Trump has boasted the new visa would be a boost for the economy, some experts NewsNation spoke with say Congress controls the budget and immigration policy, and so new legislation might need to be passed to overhaul the current program. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says the new gold card would replace the current EB-5 program. The EB-5 visa allows qualified investors to become eligible for green cards if they invest between 800,000 to a million dollars in a commercial enterprise and also create at least 10 jobs. The program began in the 1990s to encourage investments in rural and economically depressed areas. Matt Gordon, CEO of E3IG who advises EB-5 visa applicants, says it would be a mistake to simply replace the program. 'You're talking three, $4 billion a year for rural communities,' he told NewsNation. 'You know, we've done projects which are opioid addiction clinics.' However, Ishaan Akanna of the American Immigrant Investor Alliance, says the gold card could be a brilliant idea if implemented in conjunction with the existing EB5 visa program. Crisis at the Border: On the Frontlines 'There is an opportunity here to really kind of take this forward,' he said. 'I mean, 'The fact that this administration does and has claimed to support legal immigration. This is a fantastic way to do it.' President Trump said Tuesday that the gold card would not have any requirements for job creation like the EB-5 program has. And while some of the experts NewsNation spoke with argued that fewer people would be willing to pay for this kind of visa if it increases by $5 million. Trump says that Apple or other companies like it, could buy gold visas and then get highly qualified foreign workers in return.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/why-trump-gold-card-replace-eb-5-visa/	2025-03-02T08:56:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201498755.jpg?w=900
Elite US border unit trains daily to pursue dangerous intruders	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Border Patrol is known for securing the nation’s border, but the agency includes an elite tactical unit that is less visible. The Border Patrol Tactical Unit, or BORTAC, is comprised of highly trained agents with rapid response capabilities. NewsNation received exclusive access to BORTAC’s training facilities in El Paso, Texas, where these men and women constantly train to apprehend the most dangerous individuals, including cartel operatives, who cross illegally into the United States. Crisis at the Border: On the Frontlines NewsNation’s Border Correspondent Ali Bradley and Senior National Correspondent Brian Entin will give you an exclusive look at the border crisis in America and how the nation’s three borders — southern, northern and aerial — are kept safe.

Use our Channel Finder here. 'We train 365 days a year,' Bryan Gru, special operations supervisor, said during a simulated hostage rescue. 'These guys are all invested, they are hand-selected to be here with the national team.' Agents who run through such exercises are striving for 'zero fail' results, explained Chris Voss, the acting commander for the Border Patrol’s Special Operations Group (SOG). At the same time, agents must adjust to changing circumstances, he adds. 'The guys are really good at it. So, it’s something we take very seriously, and we train constantly,' Voss said. The training and selection process for BORTAC agents is modeled on those used for military special forces, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Candidates must train in advanced weapons techniques and 'must demonstrate the ability to function in a team environment under stress and sleep deprivation conditions.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/elite-us-border-unit-pursue-criminals/	2025-03-01T18:07:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot.jpg?w=900
How the Coast Guard intercepts migrants entering the Florida coas...	(NewsNation) — As the Trump administration clamps down on migrant crossings, the U.S. Coast Guard has been working around the clock to secure America's so-called 'third border': the ocean off the coast of Florida. Coast Guard officers keep a close guard by flying over the coast south toward Cuba and over the Bahamas, which is a hotbed for migrant activity. NewsNation's Border Correspondent Ali Bradley and Senior National Correspondent Brian Entin will give you an exclusive look at the border crisis in America and how the nation's three borders — southern, northern and aerial — are kept safe.

Alleged smuggler extradited to US preyed on Asian, African migrants 'We are looking for a number of different things. Vessels moving in a certain direction. If they are moving southbound, that may not be an indicator. If they are moving northbound, it might give us an indication we should probably take a look,' Coast Guard Lt. Bryce Monaco tells NewsNation. 'There are also a lot of people, 20 to 30, maybe even hundreds of people. These are all indicators of what we are looking at.' When officers spot migrants, they dispatch Coast Guard cutters to intervene. The Coast Guard interdicted several migrants attempting to use the Florida coast as an inroad into the country. This includes 31 migrants packed onto a small fishing boat and two dozen Chinese migrants hiding in an engine compartment, according to the agency. While many migrants hail from nearby Cuba and Haiti, there is also a large number that come from as far as China, Coast Guard officers told NewsNation. Cartel luring chemistry students to make fentanyl: Report 'Well, we have had an 8000% increase in the number of Chinese migrants caught on the Florida coast,' Republican Florida Rep. Carlos Gimenez said. 'That is just going to increase because as enforcement becomes harder and tougher to get into the southern border, you are going to see more and more Chinese and other migrants trying to flow into Florida.' However, migrant ocean crossings are not just on the East Coast of the United States. The Coast Guard also spotted 20 migrants on a small boat 21 miles off the coast of California. 'We advise anyone that may think they want to enter the U.S. illegally. Not only are these venues illegal, but they are quite dangerous … and please do not trust these transnational organizations. These smugglers do not care about you,' Eric Rodriguez with the Coast Guard said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/coast-guard-migrants-florida-coast/	2025-03-01T17:00:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/GettyImages-1410153211.jpg?w=900
Texas troopers, US Border Patrol team up to squash smuggling	(NewsNation) — Patrolling the United States’ southern border remains a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week job. That is especially true in areas along the border that are used by smugglers and immigrants who enter the United States illegally to hide from U.S. border agents and other immigration officials. NewsNation's Border Correspondent Ali Bradley and Senior National Correspondent Brian Entin will give you an exclusive look at the border crisis in America and how the nation's three borders — southern, northern and aerial — are kept safe.

Use our Channel Finder here. Mexico extradites cartel figures to US amid Trump tariffs threat NewsNation was given the opportunity to ride along with troopers from the Texas Department of Public Safety along the Rio Grande Valley. The area has seen an uptick in migrants entering the United States illegally and smugglers who are looking to cash in and move people and illegal drugs across the border into the United States. Texas DPS says that smuggling networks are adapting faster, and they are making millions in the process. Even as the number of migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally declines, Texas DPS officials are seeing a small surge in smuggling activity in the Rio Grande Valley. However, as officials try to manage that surge, one agency cannot do it alone. Texas DPS partners with U.S. Border Patrol agents and members of the Texas National Guard to try and track migrants that immigration officials characterize as 'gotaways'. In most cases, the Texas DPS works to determine if it can file state charges against those they encounter and charge them with smuggling people across the border. In other cases, U.S. Border Patrol officials file federal charges for human smuggling. Cartel that killed family should be called terror group: Relative The agencies also work together to stop the flow of illegal drugs being moved across the U.S.-Mexico border. As the effort continues to try to locate and apprehend smugglers, smuggling groups in Mexico are moving in smaller groups, searching for areas that are not being patrolled. Working in conjunction with other agencies like the U.S Border Patrol, Texas DPS relies on tools like drones to monitor what is happening on the ground along the border. 'It’s really a team effort,' Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Guadalupe Cazarez told NewsNation. 'The majority of time, our (Border Patrol) agents are processing individuals, and that’s where we come in. We try to cover that gap so that these people do not get across (the border).'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/texas-border-patrol-team-smuggling/	2025-03-01T17:00:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Texas-DPS-car-door-1.jpg?w=876
Extradition of 29 cartel leaders shows Mexico 'can do more'	EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – The extradition from Mexico of 29 drug suspects on Thursday had a special meaning for the family of an American hero, former U.S. Marshal Robert Almonte says. That’s because one of the individuals walking off the extradition flight was Rafael Caro Quintero. He was the man who allegedly ordered the abduction, torture and murder of former Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena in Guadalajara in 1985, Almonte said. Mexico sends drug lord Caro Quintero and 28 others to the US as officials meet with Trump team The slaying shocked the American public and exposed the brutality and impunity traffickers seemingly enjoy south of the border. In this March 8, 1985, file photo, U.S. Marine Corps pallbearers carry the casket holding the body of slain U.S. Drug Enforcement agent Enrique Camarena Salazar after it arrived at North Island Naval Air Station, in San Diego. Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero was only ever sentenced in Mexico for the killing of Camarena and Mexican pilot Alfredo Zavala Avelar in 1985, but his gang apparently killed as many as six U.S. citizens in the western city of Guadalajara around the same time. (AP Photo/Lenny Ignelzi, File) 'He did a tremendous job locating large marijuana fields and eradicating the marijuana fields with the help of a Mexican pilot,' said Almonte, who also worked as an undercover narcotics detective and is a former deputy chief of the El Paso Police Department. 'The Guadalajara cartel was very upset with Kiki Camarena because he was doing such a great job. So, Caro Quintero ordered the abduction of Kiki Camarena in broad daylight.' Forty years after the murder of US Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena, Mexico agreed to the extradition of the drug lord who allegedly had him killed. (DEA) The drug lord allegedly had the DEA agent brought to a house in the outskirts of Guadalajara. He was tortured nonstop for 36 hours until Caro Quintero allegedly had his men finish him off with a tire iron to the head. Drug lord Caro Quintero to be arraigned in NYC after being transferred from Mexico Trying to pass off the American agent and his pilot as merely missing did not work for Caro Quintero and the other leaders of the Guadalajara cartel – Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo. The 29 extradited ‘narcos’ from Mexico President Ronald Reagan ordered a shut down of the U.S.-Mexico border, impatient with Camarena not being found, Almonte said. The body was located a month after the agent disappeared and was eventually returned to his family. Caro Quintero ended up in a Mexican jail through 2017. Students in Camarena’s native Calexico, California, began wearing a red ribbon to remember the agent. Three years later, Ronald and Nancy Reagan chaired the first national Red Ribbon Week to educate the country’s youth to the dangers of consuming illegal drugs. Terror designation might prompt cartels to target Americans, expert says 'Yesterday was a great day, especially for the Camarena family. They are finally seeing some long overdue justice' with Caro Quintero’s extradition, said Almonte, who keeps in touch with the Camarenas. 'He was, no doubt, a hero.' Caro Quintero on Friday made his first appearance in front of a federal judge in Brooklyn on multiple drug and weapons charges. ‘Mexico could do more' if it wanted to The extradition of Caro Quintero, two brothers who led the Zetas drug cartel, Fonseca’s nephew Vicente Carrillo Fuentes of the Juarez cartel and 25 others came amid President Donald Trump’s threat of imposing a 25% tariff on Mexican imports. Trump says Mexico can do more to stem the flow of migrants and illicit drugs like the deadly fentanyl to the United States. Almonte agrees, at least with the part about the drugs. Border Report Live: US steps up fight against cartels 'In order to eliminate the cartels, the Mexican government has to address something that is the driving force behind the cartels’ existence, and that is the corruption,' Almonte said. 'The corruption from the lowest levels of Mexican law enforcement all the way to state, military and even high-ranking officials. Not until Mexico tries to change the culture of corruption can anything change. 'Don’t get me wrong, we have our own issues with corruption here in the United States, but nowhere near to the extent they have the problem of corruption in Mexico.' Sinaloa cartel boss ‘Neon’ extradited to US, indicted along with ‘El Chapo’ Earlier this month in El Paso, federal officials arrested a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer for allegedly conspiring with a Mexican drug cartel to smuggle migrants and allow drugs to come into the country. In 2023, a U.S. Border Patrol agent in El Paso was arrested for allegedly offering to get a Salvadoran woman 'papers' in exchange for $5,000. Almonte laments that it takes threats from U.S. presidents – Reagan in 1985, Trump in 2025 – for drug lords south of the border to be arrested or extradited. He says the two governments should sit at the table and agree in good faith to go after criminals that are poisoning so many people north of the Rio Grande and killing thousands south of the border. 'We need to go after these cartels, and what’s disappointing to me is that the first thing (the Mexican government) says is 'We're a sovereign national, you can't come, you can't do anything in our country.' How about not saying that and just working together to go after the cartels and eliminate them,' Almonte said. 'Let's go after these cartels, let's eliminate them to make things better for the people in Mexico and in the United States.' Severed head, death threat prompt Tijuana’s Grupo Firme to cancel Mazatlán concert U.S. law allows prosecutors to seek the death penalty in the case of drug lords who commit or order murders while conducting organized criminal activities. But Mexico does not have a death penalty and does not allow the extradition of its citizens if they face such a punishment. Almonte believes the U.S. won't try to execute Caro Quintero but will try to ensure he will spend the rest of his life in an American prison. Border Report Live: US, Mexico put pressure on drug cartels He also opined the Trump administration will not directly attack cartel leaders even after designating them as Foreign Terrorist Organizations because he wants Mexico's cooperation. When asked what's changed in the Mexican drug trafficking scene since Camarena's killing, Almonte said cartels have multiplied and become much more brutal, if that was possible. Visit the BorderReport.com homepage for the latest exclusive stories and breaking news about issues along the U.S.-Mexico border 'They are extremely brutal killing each other off. But not only that. If you’re their enemy, if you cross them, they’re not just going to kill you, they’re going to torture you -- a horrible torture -- and then they’re going to kill you,' he said. 'And then they like to post these videos online as a warning to anybody who’s going to mess with them. You don’t want to mess with them because this is going to happen to you.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/extradition-of-29-cartel-leaders-shows-mexico-can-do-more/	2025-03-01T15:20:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/caro-quitero-2.png?w=897
Zelenskyy embraced by British prime minister a day after White Ho...	LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer embraced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday and told him he had the U.K.'s unwavering support, a day after the blowout at the White House with President Donald Trump. Zelenskyy arrived to cheers from people who had gathered outside of 10 Downing St., where Starmer gave him a hug and ushered him inside. The two leaders met on the eve of a meeting of European leaders in London. Called to discuss how European nations can defend Ukraine — and themselves — if the U.S. withdraws support, it has taken on new urgency following Trump's televised berating of Zelenskyy. 'And as you heard from the cheers on the street outside, you have full backing across the United Kingdom,' Starmer told the leader of the war-torn country. 'We stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take.' Zelenskyy thanked him and the people of the U.K. for their support and friendship. After the meeting, Britain announced it was extending a 2.26 billion pound ($2.84 billion) loan to Kyiv for military procurement, with the money coming from the profits on frozen Russian assets. It's Britain's contribution to a $50 billion package of support pledged by the G-7 group of wealthy industrialized nations. Zelenskyy thanked Britain in a statement on X, saying: 'This is true justice – the one who started the war must be the one to pay.' Starmer spoke to both Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday evening after meeting Zelenskyy, the prime minister's office said. The meeting comes the day after an extraordinary diplomatic meltdown when Trump and Vice President JD Vance blasted Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on live television for not being grateful enough for U.S. support. Zelenskyy had been poised to ink a deal to give the U.S. access to mineral riches as Trump pressures Ukraine to reach a deal to end the war with Russia. But he left town without signing anything. Zelenskyy had been scheduled to meet with Starmer on Sunday before the European summit, but the timetable for their bilateral meeting was apparently sped up in the aftermath of the Washington visit. Zelenskyy will meet with King Charles III on Sunday before the meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-zelenskyy-embraced-by-british-prime-minister-a-day-after-white-house-blowout/	2025-03-01T14:06:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67c3862dd375d3.51455754.jpeg?w=900
Pentagon sending 3,000 troops to southern border: Report	(NewsNation) — The Pentagon has ordered up to 3,000 active-duty troops to the southern border as it looks to increase the United States' border sovereignty. According to the Washington Post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the orders Friday, with 2,500 to 3,000 set to be deployed, alongside Stryker combat vehicles, weighing up to 20 tons. In January, the Pentagon sent up to 1,500 active-duty troops to the border, which already had approximately 2,500 U.S. National Guard and Reserve forces on hand. Crisis at the Border: On the Frontlines Per the Post, the Pentagon would largely be sending soldiers specializing in the public affairs, intelligence, and engineering sectors. They would also be joined by soldiers part of the 4th Infantry Division’s 2nd Stryker Brigade at Fort Carson, Colorado. Mexican National Guard troops are currently patrolling the border in the Tijuana area as part of Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum's pledge amid tariff negotiations with President Trump. In an hour-long special airing at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday, NewsNation will go in-depth on the state of the situation at the border – what’s working, what’s not and why law enforcement on the frontlines say they aren’t letting their guard down.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/pentagon-sending-3000-troops-southern-border/	2025-03-01T10:33:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-2197688179.jpg?w=900
Andrew Cuomo announces he’s running for NYC mayor	Editor’s Note: The video above originally aired on Feb. 7 NEW YORK CITY (PIX11) – Andrew Cuomo announced he’s running for New York City mayor in the upcoming election after months of speculation. The former New York governor will take on incumbent Mayor Eric Adams in the Democratic primary. 'We know that today our New York City is in trouble,' Cuomo said in a 17-minute announcement video posted to social media. 'These conditions exist not as an act of God, but rather as an act of our political leaders, or more precisely, the lack of intelligent action by many of our political leaders,' he continued. Before Cuomo entered the race, many polls showed him as an early favorite for New York City voters. A February poll by PIX11 News, Emerson College and The Hill showed Cuomo was the first choice for 33% of Democratic voters. Some 10% of voters said Adams was their first choice for mayor. Cuomo served as New York governor from 2011 to 2021, when he resigned after an independent investigation found he had sexually harassed multiple women, including state employees. His resignation also came on the heels of criticism and investigations related to his handling of nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. 'New York tough means New York loving, and I love New York and I love you,' Cuomo said at the time of his resignation. 'I would never want to be unhelpful in any way, and I think given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing.' He joins an already crowded pool of candidates for the June 24 primary, including Adams, City Comptroller Brad Lander, State Senators Zellnor Myrie and Jessica Ramos, former Comptroller Scott Stringer, State Assemblymembers Zohran Mamdani and Michael Blake and hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson. Some of the candidates, like Lander, have already taken aim at Cuomo. But Adams has been more measured in anticipation of Cuomo's candidacy. 'There's a lot of time ‘til June,' Adams said just ahead of petitions to get on the ballot being circulated in late February. 'I've talked before about Andrew Yang leading me by double digits in February [last election] and we saw what happened. We're not calling Andrew Yang mayor, we're saying Eric Adams is mayor.' Cuomo began pondering a political comeback less than a year after his resignation, as several of the more serious sexual harassment claims against him did not turn into criminal charges. And, he’s already secured the endorsement of Bronx Congressman Ritchie Torres, who said he is not interested in 'relitigating' the sexual harassment scandal in the upcoming election. 'I represent a working-class district, largely African-American and Latinos, and Andrew Cuomo has immense popularity and credibility with the people I represent, so I’m representing the preferences of the people of the Bronx,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/andrew-cuomo-announces-hes-running-for-nyc-mayor/	2025-03-01T09:52:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/65b44340e0ffe9.21227874.jpeg?w=900

Proposed registry is Trump tool to criminalize migration, advocat...	EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – President Trump vowed during his campaign to deport all criminal immigrants to make American communities safer. Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gang members have been apprehended at the border and some caught committing crimes in the interior of the country are being prosecuted. However, immigration advocates say most individuals illegally present in the country are not criminals. Their status may change if the Trump administration goes through with a proposed rule to criminally charge undocumented individuals who fail to register and allow themselves to be fingerprinted by the federal government. 'The administration is giving itself another tool to use against many immigrants, particularly the threat of criminal prosecution,' said Nayna Gupta, director of policy at the American Immigration Council. 'This will force those who came in without inspection and have had no contact with the government for years a very hard choice. They either register as required and be subject to removal or not registering to avoid mass deportation but then be subjected to criminal prosecution.' Critics blast new ‘report to deport’ order by DHS Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this week announced the administration will enforce a provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act compelling undocumented immigrants to leave the country voluntarily or else register with the government. Failure to register could result in a fine and jail time, she said. The publication of an administrative rule is pending. DHS urges undocumented immigrants to leave or they’ll ‘never return’ if deported On Friday, immigrant advocates said the registry paves the way for Trump to say he’s deporting criminals. 'It’s not a crime to be in the U.S. without authorization. The only people who, by virtue of their presence here are committing a crime, are folks who have been deported and came back,' said David Leopold, former president and general council of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. 'This registration is nothing but a hoax and a pretext to bootstrap criminal liability on folks who are hardworking.' A practicing immigration attorney, Leopold said he’s seeing fear not only in the undocumented community but also among those who have legal immigration status, as they could be in violation of regulations for not carrying their documents. Also, when Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) goes to apprehend criminals, they could come across other undocumented. He calls this collateral damage. 'What is a collateral? It’s a grandmother sitting on her porch when ICE comes to do an arrest. It’s someone worked all day at a meat packing plant or in the fields, comes home and ICE happens to be next door,' he said. Ocasio-Cortez asks DOJ: Am I under investigation? The advocates called on immigrants lawfully here or not to be aware of their constitutional rights. 'For first time I’m giving ‘Know Your Rights’ presentations to major boards of huge healthcare systems and also to the nonprofit community.' Leopold said. 'If we put it all together, it begins to resemble something that is not an open American cultural democracy; it becomes closer to a police state.'

Most have been in the United States for 15 years or more and are part of 'mixed status' households with U.S.-born children or partners.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/proposed-registry-is-trump-tool-to-criminalize-migration-advocates-say/	2025-03-01T08:11:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2195569259-e1738860863526_d5f0b6.jpg?w=800
FedEx plane makes emergency landing after bird strike	(NewsNation) — A FedEx cargo plane caught fire and had to make an emergency landing at Newark Liberty International Airport. It temporarily halted traffic for around an hour after the landing occurred at 8 a.m. ET. Social media footage showed a fire on the underside of the plane as it came to land at the airport. No one was injured. Recent aviation disasters and close calls stoke fears about the safety of flying 'FedEx Flight 3609 from Newark to Indianapolis experienced a bird strike during takeoff,' a FedEx spokesperson said in a statement. 'Our crew declared an emergency and returned safely to Newark. We are thankful for the quick actions of our crew and first responders.' It follows several aviation incidents in recent weeks, most recently including a United Airlines flight making an emergency landing at Newark and smoke being reported on a Delta flight from Atlanta.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/fedex-plane-emergency-landing-bird-strike/	2025-03-01T07:38:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/10/6532f8bfbd6bf3.40405505.jpeg?w=900
Ukrainian president thanks Trump, US on X day after heated meetin...	(NewsNation) — The day after a contentious back-and-forth in the Oval Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly thanked President Donald Trump and the U.S. for its support during the three-year war. 'We are very grateful to the United States for all the support. I’m thankful to President Trump, Congress for their bipartisan support, and American people. Ukrainians have always appreciated this support, especially during these three years of full-scale invasion,' Zelenskyy wrote on X Saturday morning. In a series of 14 posts, Zelenskyy went on to say his country's survival is in part thanks to America's help. 'America’s help has been vital in helping us survive, and I want to acknowledge that. Despite the tough dialogue, we remain strategic partners,' Zelenskyy wrote. EU’s top diplomat: ‘The free world needs a new leader’ Last week, Trump called the Ukrainian president a 'dictator without elections.' The two met Friday to discuss a deal that would give the U.S. revenue from rare earth minerals, but after a heated exchange, they canceled a joint press conference and a planned lunch. The two world leaders were also to explore the possibility of a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine with Russia. At one point, Trump raised his voice, saying, 'You’re gambling with WWIII.' Following the shouting match, Zelenskyy was told to leave by the president and other senior officials. Ukrainians won’t stop fighting, even if US pulls support: Veteran 'It’s crucial for us to have President Trump’s support. He wants to end the war, but no one wants peace more than we do,' Zelenskyy said on X. 'We are the ones living this war in Ukraine. It’s a fight for our freedom, for our very survival.' Zelenskyy said the country is ready to sign the minerals deal and to achieve peace, but it can't happen without assurance. 'Peace can only come when we know we have security guarantees, when our army is strong, and our partners are with us … but we can’t just stop fighting and not having guarantees that Putin will not return tomorrow.' 'Unprepared' Zelenskyy fumbled Trump meeting, Sean Spicer said He ended the social media thread by saying, 'We want only strong relations with America, and I really hope we will have them.' 'Insolent pig': European leaders chime in Other world leaders chimed in online on Friday. 'The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office,' Russian politician Dmitry Medvedev said of Trump. The European Union's top leader, Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas, said, 'Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.' Also showing solidarity with Ukraine following the exchange were leaders of Poland, Spain, Moldova, Sweden, Latvia, Norway, Czechia, Germany and the Netherlands.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/zelenskyy-thanks-trump-on-x-day-after-heated-meeting/	2025-03-01T05:51:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201827238.jpg?w=900
Border czar makes the city of Boston his latest immigration targe...	BOSTON (AP) — As Mayor Michelle Wu prepares to go to Congress to defend Boston's protections of immigrant communities, the city is in a war of words with the Trump administration and Republican representatives over how much police should support deportations. President Donald Trump's border czar Tom Homan teed off against Boston's police commissioner in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, saying there are at least nine accused 'child rapists' in jail who local authorities won't turn over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He promised to come to Boston and 'bring hell with him.' ICE public affairs didn't respond to a request for information about these cases, and Homan didn't elaborate on any travel plans. Boston isn't alone: ICE has accused state and local authorities around the country of failing to cooperate to get people charged with violent crimes deported. At Wednesday's hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Wu will be joined by the mayors of Chicago, New York and Denver, all caught in the crosshairs of what it means to be a 'sanctuary city.' A clash between federal, state and local laws ICE is empowered to enforce immigration laws nationwide but needs help from state and local authorities to achieve deportations on a large scale. It asks police and sheriffs to alert them to certain people it wants to deport and to hold them for up to 48 hours so that immigration officers have time to arrive and take custody. Sanctuary cities limit such cooperation when it involves people accused but not yet convicted of crimes, following state or local laws that prohibit turning people over to ICE merely for lacking legal permission to be in the country. 'If someone’s committed a serious offense, our position is that we want to hold them accountable,' Sussex County District Attorney Kevin Hayden said. 'What you want to do with their immigration consequences or deportation, if any, after we hold them accountable, that’s up to the federal government. That’s up to ICE.' Handing over defendants would make it harder to gain cooperation from immigrants when investigating crimes, and fail to deliver justice for the victims, Hayden argued. Will deporting defendants and witnesses make cities safer? 'We don’t want people’s fear of immigration consequences of a deportation to have a chilling effect on our ability to hold people accountable,' Hayden said. 'Even in this modern day, where we have phones and cameras and recordings and everything, we still need victims and witnesses and people to come in and testify and tell their story in order to prove a case.' Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox told WCVB-TV that police don't have authority to enforce federal immigration laws or hand over people just because they're in the country illegally — their immigration status isn't 'relevant to public safety,' he said. The Boston Trust Act, updated in 2018, allows police to cooperate with ICE on 'significant public safety, such as human trafficking, child exploitation, drug and weapons trafficking, and cybercrimes, while refraining from involvement in civil immigration enforcement.' The city also must follow a 2017 ruling by the state's highest court, which forbids Massachusetts authorities from holding a person otherwise entitled to release from custody based solely on a federal request. How have leaders responded to the pressure? Wu, a Democrat up for reelection this year, said it was 'clueless' and 'insulting' for Homan to attack the commissioner, and that she wants Boston be a welcoming place for immigrants. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey called Homan's comments 'unproductive' and 'not how you engage as a member of law enforcement.' Hayden said he would welcome a 'civil conversation' about immigration but 'if you want to bring hell with you, don't bother coming. Hell is not welcome here in Boston.' Faith leaders met with the mayor and said members of their congregations now fear going to a food pantry or answering their door to receive donations. 'The fear is not for just those who are undocumented, and that’s one of the realities that we hope those in Washington will hear,' Arlene Hall, a native of Jamaica and a minister at the Deliverance Temple Worship Center in Dorchester, told reporters. 'The fear is much deeper and wider because of what is being done.' Wu's mayoral opponent, Democrat Josh Kraft, said in a statement that he supports 'removing violent criminals' but opposes mass deportations and Homan's 'inflammatory rhetoric about a city he does not know.' What could happen to cities that don't comply? An ominous video from the Republican-led committee portrays Wu and several other big city mayors as villains, with Kentucky GOP Rep. James Comer saying: 'If they are going to continue to disobey the law, then I think we should cut as much of their federal funding as we can cut.' The Trump administration has begun taking legal action, accusing Illinois, Chicago and Cook County of violating federal law by not cooperating. Lawmakers in more than 20 states are pursuing legislation against so-called sanctuary cities, The Associated Press found using the bill-tracking software Plural. And some of those communities are striking back: The Boston suburbs of Chelsea and Somerville filed suit accusing the Trump administration of violating their constitutional rights.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/ap-border-czar-makes-boston-his-latest-immigration-punching-bag/	2025-03-01T05:31:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67c309e23d2bd8.40670527.jpeg?w=900
Pope rests after setback in recovery — a bronchial spasm requirin...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis was resting Saturday after an alarming setback in his two-week recovery from double pneumonia: Doctors had to put him on noninvasive mechanical ventilation following a coughing fit in which he inhaled vomit that needed to then be extracted. Doctors said it would take a day or two to evaluate how and if the episode impacted Francis’ overall clinical condition. His prognosis remained guarded, meaning he wasn’t out of danger. In its brief morning update Saturday, the Vatican said: 'The night has passed quietly, the pope is resting.' In the late Friday update, the Vatican said the 88-year-old suffered an 'isolated crisis of bronchial spasm,' a coughing fit in which Francis inhaled vomit, that resulted in a 'sudden worsening of the respiratory picture.' Doctors aspirated the vomit and placed Francis on non-invasive mechanical ventilation. The pope remained conscious and alert at all times and cooperated with the maneuvers to help him recover. He responded well, with a good level of oxygen exchange and was continuing to wear a mask to receive supplemental oxygen, the Vatican said. The episode, which occurred in the early afternoon, marked a setback in what had been two successive days of increasingly upbeat reports from doctors treating Francis at Rome’s Gemelli hospital since Feb. 14. The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into pneumonia in both lungs. Doctors say the episode is alarming The Vatican said the episode was different to the prolonged respiratory crisis on Feb. 22, in that it was an isolated spasm that resulted in Francis aspirating the vomit that he produced. Dr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said the episode as relayed by the Vatican was alarming and underscored Francis’ fragility and that his condition 'can turn very quickly.' 'I think this is extremely concerning, given the fact that the pope has been in the hospital now for over two weeks, and now he’s continuing to have these respiratory events and now had this aspiration event that is requiring even higher levels of support,' he told The Associated Press. 'So given his age and his fragile state and his previous lung resection, this is very concerning,' added Coleman, who is not involved in Francis’ care. Dr. William Feldman, a pulmonary specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said it was a good sign that the pope remained alert and oriented during the episode, but concurred that it marked 'a worrying turn.' 'Often we will use noninvasive ventilation as a way of trying to stave off an intubation, or the use of invasive mechanical ventilation,' Feldman said. Types of noninvasive ventilation include a BiPAP machine, which helps people breathe by pushing air into their lungs. Doctors will often try such a machine for a while to see if the patient’s blood gas levels improve so they can eventually go back to using oxygen alone. Doctors did not resume referring to Francis being in 'critical condition,' which has been absent from their statements for three days now. But they say he isn’t out of danger, given the complexity of his case. Prayers continued to pour in Late on Friday, Francis’ closest friend in the Vatican bureaucracy, Argentine Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernández, led the nightly prayer in St. Peter’s Square to pray for Francis’ health. With other cardinals bundled against the night chill, Fernández urged the crowd to pray not just for Francis but for others, as the pope himself would. 'Certainly it is close to the Holy Father’s heart that our prayer is not only for him, but also for all those who in this particular dramatic and suffering moment of the world bear the hard burden of war, of sickness, of poverty,' said Fernández, the Vatican’s doctrine chief. Also Friday, the Vatican published a document signed by Francis on Feb. 26 'From the Gemelli Polyclinic,' a new official tagline that showed Francis was still working from the hospital. ___ Carla K.

Sean Penn: Zelenskyy-Trump fight shouldn't eclipse Russia's crime...	(NewsNation) — American actor and director Sean Penn hopes the 'chaos' seen in Friday’s Oval Office exchange between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy won't create further division between the nations. 'Remember where we really stand, and what this is really about,' Penn implored on Friday's 'CUOMO.' He points to the people dying on the front lines in Ukraine each day, 'dying honoring the very thing we honor most, which is freedom,' and urges citizens to see through the politicians' 'personality chaos.' Graham: Trump, Zelenskyy meeting an ‘absolute, utter disaster’ On Friday, the pair of presidents met to discuss a mineral deal and the future of American aid to Ukraine. But the leaders' conversation, with some interjections from Vice President JD Vance, quickly turned sour. Trump told Zelenskyy, 'You’re not really in a good position right now' and said the leader was 'gambling with WWIII.' On X, Zelenskyy said what his country needs is peace. 'Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,' he said.

Gene Hackman, wife tested negative for carbon monoxide: Sheriff	(NewsNation) — Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman, 95, and his 63-year-old wife, Betsy Arakawa, tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning and showed no external trauma, preliminary investigation results show. Hackman's pacemaker data revealed the actor's last event was on Feb. 17, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday, adding that it is a 'very good assumption' Hackman was deceased for at least 10 days. Hackman, Arakawa and their dog were all found dead at their Santa Fe, New Mexico, home on Wednesday. Gene Hackman’s death is strange: Steve Wilkos | Morning in America Authorities believe they may have been dead for some time; the cause of death has yet to be revealed. Toxicology and autopsy reports are pending, Mendoza said. Officials collected the following for 'evidentiary' purposes: Two green cellphones Two bottles of medication One bottle of OTC Tylenol Medical records 2025 monthly planner calendar Authorities reiterated Friday that there was no foul play suspected in the couple's deaths, though an earlier search warrant stated that the situation was 'suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation.' Hackman's body was found in the home's entryway, and Arakawa was dead next to a space heater in a bathroom. Pills were scattered next to an open prescription bottle on the bathroom counter, according to a search warrant, The Associated Press reports.

Zelenskyy thanks Trump for visit after Oval Office clash	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked President Trump for hosting his visit to the United States on Friday despite the two leaders’ clash in the Oval Office, which led to the cancelation of further talks and a White House press conference. Zelenskyy’s post on X after the meeting thanked Trump, 'Congress, and the American people.' 'Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,' he said. But the post came after Trump called off negotiations with Zelenskyy on ending the war between Ukraine and Russia following the heated Oval Office exchange over U.S. support. The meeting, which also featured Vice President Vance, began cordially, but tensions escalated after Vance suggested a diplomatic solution could be reached with Russia to end the war. Watch full Trump, Zelenskyy exchange: ‘You’re gambling with WWIII’ Zelenskyy pointed to years of Russian President Vladimir Putin seeking to take Ukrainian territory and violating ceasefires. Vance argued that Zelenskyy had been ungrateful for U.S. support, and Trump told Zelenskyy that he is not in a position to have much leverage in talks. After the meeting, Trump posted on Truth Social that Zelenskyy is 'not ready for Peace' and that he 'disrespected' the U.S. in the Oval Office. 'He can come back when he is ready for peace,' Trump said. The two leaders had been scheduled to take part in a joint press conference and sign a deal giving the U.S. access to Ukraine’s supply of critical minerals. Thune says Senate will consider bill to restrict trans athletes ‘early next week’ The deal was not signed. Trump has alarmed allies and lawmakers from both parties by slamming Zelenskyy in recent weeks, calling him a 'dictator' and accusing him of doing a 'terrible job' as president of Ukraine. He also suggested Zelenskyy was responsible for starting the war, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion in 2022. But Trump had appeared to walk back his comments during a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in response to a reporter’s question about if he still believed Zelenskyy was a dictator. 'Did I say that? I can’t believe I said that. Next question,' Trump said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/zelenskyy-thanks-trump-visit-clash/	2025-02-28T13:34:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25059677855899-e1740768713352.jpg?w=900
Thune says Senate will consider bill to restrict trans athletes '...	Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) says legislation to prevent transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports will go to the Senate floor 'early next week,' potentially fast-tracking a bill on an issue Republicans and President Trump made central to their campaigns. The Republican-led House approved Rep. Greg Steube’s (R-Fla.) Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act in January with the help of two Texas Democrats. If the Senate, where Republicans also have the majority, votes to pass the bill, it will head to Trump’s desk, where it is almost certain to be signed into law. 'We’re going to put that on the floor early next week,' Thune said Thursday, appearing on the 'Ruthless' podcast. 'It’s an issue the House has voted on, and the president issued an executive order. What this would do is codify the executive order.' Trump’s Feb. 5 executive order aims to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports nationwide and directs the Justice Department to take immediate action, including enforcement actions, against schools and athletic associations that allow trans student-athletes to participate in line with their gender identity. Attorney General Pam Bondi warned officials in Maine, California and Minnesota this week to comply with Trump’s order, and the Education Department opened several investigations into states, school districts and athletic associations that have refused to enforce the restrictions. The bill before the Senate next week seeks to amend Title IX, the federal civil rights law against sex discrimination, to prohibit schools from allowing transgender students to compete in athletic events 'designated for women or girls.' Similar to another Trump executive order, it defines sex as 'based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.' 'It’s unfortunate that it’s something that needs to be codified, but we’re going to make sure that the president’s EO endures over time,' Thune said Thursday, the same day he scheduled a procedural vote on the bill for Monday evening. 'My assumption is we’ll get a lot of resistance, obviously, from the Democrats,' he added. 'Clearly, there are partisan issues in our times and things that we deal with legislatively, which create sort of the deep political divide that we have, but this one, to me, it just seems like it’s common sense.' The question of whether to restrict or ban trans athletes from girls’ and women’s sports has been a politically fraught one for Democrats, who were left surprisingly flat-footed by Republican campaign ads last cycle asserting they supported 'men' in girls’ sports. Some Democrats blamed the party’s November election losses on its support for transgender rights, though voters in most exit polls said issues related to the economy and immigration drove their decision at the ballot box. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that Americans have grown more supportive of policies restricting transgender rights, including ones that require athletes to compete on sports teams that match their birth sex. The number of transgender students participating in school sports is unclear. In September, the National Federation of State High School Associations, which does not report how many student-athletes are transgender, said more than 8 million students competed in high school sports last year. Karissa Niehoff, the organization’s CEO, told The Hill an openly trans athlete has never set a national record. Charlie Baker, president of the NCAA, which barred transgender athletes from competing in women’s college sports following Trump’s executive order, told a Senate panel in December that he is aware of fewer than 10 transgender NCAA athletes. Opponents of policies that prevent trans athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports have said such restrictions will inevitably fuel speculation about whether female athletes, transgender or not, look feminine enough to compete in women’s sports without facing questions about their gender. 'Although the authors of the legislation represent themselves as serving the interests of cisgender girls and women, this legislation does not address the longstanding barriers all girls and women have faced in their pursuit of athletics,' more than 400 civil rights groups, including Advocates for Trans Equality and the Human Rights Campaign, wrote last month in a letter to Congress. 'You can sit at your desk and sign a piece of paper and make trans people’s life far more difficult than necessary but you will NEVER erase us or our joy,' middle-distance runner Nikki Hiltz, who is trans and nonbinary, wrote in an Instagram story after Trump signed the executive order on trans athletes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/thune-says-senate-will-consider-bill-to-restrict-trans-athletes-early-next-week/	2025-02-28T12:56:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/thunejohn_020425gn09_w_b4639a.jpg?w=900
Zelenskyy 'weakened his hand' post tense Trump exchange: Sean Spi...	(NewsNation) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lacked diplomacy and preparation in a tense meeting with President Donald Trump, which will undoubtedly hurt him in the war against Russia, Trump’s former press secretary said. 'It went off the rails quick,' NewsNation political contributor and former Trump press secretary Sean Spicer said. 'You don't come into somebody's house asking for something and then let it go off like this.' Spicer, who was a part of Trump’s first administration, attributed Zelenskyy’s demeanor during his meeting with Trump to a lack of 'preparation' and understanding of 'diplomacy.' Trump met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday after calling his Ukrainian counterpart a 'dictator without elections' last week — and the two canceled a joint press conference after a heated exchange at a photo opportunity in the Oval Office. During the meeting, Zelenskyy told Trump that promises of peace from Vladimir Putin can’t be trusted, noting the Russian leader’s history of broken promises. Trump said Putin hasn’t broken agreements with him. Trump said Zelenskyy isn’t acting 'at all grateful' for the aid given to Ukraine from the United States for the war with Russia. Watch full Trump, Zelenskyy exchange: ‘You’re gambling with WWII At one point, Trump, raising his voice, said to Zelenskyy, 'You’re not really in a good position right now.'

Pope had coughing fit, inhaled vomit and his prognosis remains gu...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis suffered an isolated coughing fit on Friday that resulted in him inhaling vomit, requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation, the Vatican said in relaying a setback in his two-week long battle against double pneumonia. The 88-year-old pope remained conscious and alert at all times and cooperated with the maneuvers to help him recover. He responded well, with a good level of oxygen exchange and was continuing to wear a mask to receive supplemental oxygen, the Vatican said. The development marked a setback in what had been two successive days of increasingly upbeat reports from doctors treating Francis at Rome’s Gemelli hospital since Feb. 14. The episode, which occurred in the early afternoon, resulted in a 'sudden worsening of the respiratory picture.' Doctors decided to keep Francis' prognosis as guarded and indicated they needed 24-48 hours to evaluate how and if the episode has impacted his overall clinical condition. The episode, which doctors described as an 'isolated crisis of bronchial spasm' was a coughing fit in which Francis inhaled vomit. The longer respiratory crisis Francis suffered on Feb. 22 was a crisis in actually breathing, the Vatican said. Doctors did not resume referring to Francis in 'critical condition,' which has been absent from their statements for three days now. But they have been cautious in declaring him out of danger entirely, given the complexity of his case. The Vatican has already made alternative plans for Ash Wednesday next week, making clear Francis still had a long road ahead. Cardinal Angelo De Donatis, a Vatican official and former vicar of Rome, will preside over the March 5 ceremony and procession that inaugurates the church's solemn Lenten season leading up to Easter in April. Earlier Friday, Francis had spent the morning alternating high flows of supplemental oxygen with a mask and praying in the chapel. He had breakfast, read the day's newspapers and was receiving respiratory physiotherapy, the Vatican said. The Vatican also published a document signed by Francis on Feb. 26 'From the Gemelli Polyclinic,' a new tagline that showed Francis was still working from the hospital. Prayers continued to pour i n In Mexico City, a few dozen people gathered Thursday night at the cathedral to pray for Francis’ recovery. 'He is like part of the family,' said Araceli Gutiérrez, who treasures the time she saw the pope during his trip to the country of nearly 100 million Catholics in 2016. 'That’s why we feel so concerned for him.' María Teresa Sánchez, who was visiting from Colombia with her sister, said that she has always felt close to Francis — the first Latin American pope. 'That’s like having a relative within the higher-ups, with God,' she said. 'He has done so much for religion; he’s such a humble person.' Upcoming calendar in question Given his continued hospitalization, Francis’ near-term upcoming calendar of events was being changed: The Vatican canceled a Holy Year audience scheduled for Saturday, and it remained to be seen if Francis would skip his Sunday noon blessing for the third week in a row. With Ash Wednesday now delegated to a cardinal, the next major events come during Holy Week and Easter, which this year falls on April 20. In past years, when Francis has battled bronchitis and influenza in winter, he curbed his participation in Ash Wednesday and Holy Week events, which call for the pope to be outdoors in the cold leading services, participating in processions and presiding over prayers in the solemn period in which the faithful commemorate Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection. Beyond that, Francis has a few major events coming up that he presumably would hope to keep if well enough. On April 27, he is due to canonize Carlo Acutis, considered to be the first millennial and digital-era saint. The Vatican considers the Italian teenager, who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, an inspiration for young Catholics. Another important appointment is the May 24 commemoration of the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, Christianity’s first ecumenical council. The spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians, Patriarch Bartholomew I, has invited Francis to join him in Iznik, Turkey, to commemorate the anniversary, which he has called an important sign of reconciliation between the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Before he got sick, Francis said he hoped to go, though the Vatican hasn’t confirmed the trip. ___ Maria Hernandez contributed from Mexico City. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Biden faced 'firing squad' in reelection bid: Karine Jean-Pierre	(NewsNation) — Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre shared insights about her final year in the role, reflecting on the challenges of representing former President Joe Biden during the last weeks of his reelection campaign. She criticized Democratic leaders for undermining Biden’s bid for a second term, calling it a betrayal of a 'true patriot.' Speaking at an event at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University, Jean-Pierre was asked about her experience in the three weeks leading up to Biden’s decision to drop out. She emphasized her full support for whatever choice Biden made, stating, 'It was truly his decision, and I supported that 100%.' Watch the full heated exchange between Trump, Vance, Zelenskyy Jean-Pierre emphasized that the hardest part of that period came from within the Democratic Party itself. She described it as a 'firing squad,' adding, 'I’d never seen a party do that in the way that they did, and it was hurtful and sad to see that happening, a firing squad around a person who I believe was a true patriot.' When pressed further, Jean-Pierre confirmed she was referring to Democratic leaders who openly criticized Biden, calling the situation 'shocking' and surprising given his accomplishments. She expressed disappointment that instead of uniting, the party turned on him, suggesting it hurt Biden's chances in the election. 'It was truly unfortunate, and I think it hurt us more than folks realized,' Jean-Pierre said. Reflecting on her time as press secretary, she called it 'an honor and a privilege' but admitted, 'I have not missed it at all.' She also highlighted her pride in being the longest-serving female press secretary in history.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-firing-squad-reelection/	2025-02-28T10:52:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/675b903b7c1a92.49183753.jpeg?w=900
Musicians, bus driver caught with 200 pounds of cocaine	McALLEN, Texas (ValleyCentral) — U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested six musicians and a bus driver Monday after catching them with more than 200 pounds of cocaine. The musicians attempted to cross the Hidalgo-Reynosa International Bridge in a white Volvo bus, according to a criminal complaint filed against them. Officers sent the bus to secondary inspection, where an X-ray revealed 'an anomaly' in the gas tank. During a search, they discovered about 80 packages of cocaine. Officers found more than 200 pounds of cocaine hidden in the tour bus. (Photo courtesy of Homeland Security Investigations via X, the social media network formerly known as Twitter.) Agents with Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, questioned the bus driver. The driver, Pedro Edgar Jauregui-Ortiz, said his passengers were part of a band. Jauregui said they frequently traveled from Monterrey, Mexico, to Houston. His story, however, didn’t add up. When pressed, Jauregui admitted he was smuggling drugs. Prince Harry’s immigration status under fire over drugs, possible lies Jauregui 'also stated that the passengers, posing as musicians who were to perform or record in Houston, was a ‘cover’ to conceal the smuggling attempt,' according to the criminal complaint. When they arrived in Houston, he would park the bus at a hotel. Someone would pick up the bus and call Jauregui 'to return back to Mexico,' according to the criminal complaint. Agents also questioned the musicians. Several claimed they had recorded music in Houston during past trips. One said he wasn’t actually a musician and just booked Uber trips for the band when they traveled to Houston. Officers found 80 packages of cocaine that weighed about 94.5 kilograms — about 208 pounds. (Photo courtesy of Homeland Security Investigations via X, the social media network formerly known as Twitter.) Federal workers may get second ‘What did you do last week?’ email A search of government databases showed the bus had started crossing the border in October 2024. The bus crossed the Hidalgo bridge in the 'early morning hours approximately every week to two weeks,' according to the criminal complaint, with Jauregui behind the wheel. After crossing the bridge, the bus would head north. It typically passed through the Falfurrias checkpoint about 90 minutes later. The bus would return to Mexico the next morning. A review of X-ray photos from previous trips 'shows that on each of the trips the same anomaly existed within the gas tank of the vehicle.' Agents charged Jauregui and the six passengers with participating in a conspiracy to import controlled substances. Court records don’t list attorneys for Jauregui or the passengers. They remained in federal custody Wednesday and couldn’t be reached for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/musicians-bus-driver-200-lbs-cocaine-border/	2025-02-28T10:42:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GkuV421WoAAIBqX.jpg?w=576
Those with gender dysphoria can no longer serve in military: Pent...	(NewsNation) — A memo sent to Defense Department leaders Thursday states those with gender dysphoria are no longer eligible for military service. This document, written by Darin S. Selnick, acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, states the department must identify troops who have been diagnosed with, or are being treated for, gender dysphoria by March 26. From there, the Department of Defense has 30 days to remove those troops from service. They will be honorably discharged unless their record warrants otherwise, Selnick said. Gender dysphoria, according to the Mayo Clinic, is 'a feeling of distress that can happen when a person's gender identity differs from the sex assigned at birth.' Not every transgender individual experiences gender dysphoria. Should you expect a check from Elon Musk’s DOGE cuts? Military members with gender dysphoria can get a waiver 'on a case-by-case basis, provided there is a compelling Government interest in accessing the applicant that directly supports warfighting capabilities,' Selnick wrote. To get this waiver, service members have to prove they never tried to transition and demonstrate they have lived in line with their birth sex 'without clinically significant distress' for 36 months. The memo was filed as part of a lawsuit responding to President Donald Trump's executive order banning transgender troops from serving in the military. Selnick, in the memo, claimed that military service by people with gender dysphoria is 'not clearly consistent with the interests of national security.' However, organizations such as the American Medical Association have said there is no 'medically valid reason,' including a gender dysphoria diagnosis, to exclude transgender people from military service. AG Pam Bondi demands ‘full’ Epstein files from FBI, vows investigation A RAND Corp. study from 2016 that was commissioned by the Pentagon found that allowing transgender people to serve demonstrated no negative effect on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness. 'This is an unconscionable ban that forces the removal of talented service members who put their lives on the line for our nation and slams the door on qualified patriots who meet every standard and want nothing more than to serve their country,' Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights at GLAD, said in a statement. Transgender people have been eligible to serve in the military since 2016, but the Trump administration attempted to issue a ban in 2019, though it was reversed in 2021. 'Transgender Americans have served openly and honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for nearly a decade. Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve,' SPARTA Pride, an advocacy group for transgender service members, said in a statement. 'No policy will ever erase transgender Americans' contribution to history, warfighting, or military excellence.'

(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order designating English as the official language of the United States, a White House official confirmed to NewsNation Friday. It will rescind a mandate from the Clinton administration that required agencies and recipients of federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers. While the executive order allows agencies to keep current policies and provide services in other languages, it encourages new Americans to adopt English.

Jeffrey Epstein timeline: Sex trafficking, scandals, Ghislaine Ma...	(NewsNation) — The Jeffrey Epstein case has spread across two decades now, and now there has been increasing pressure to release more information revolving around the case. Epstein was back in the headlines last summer when his accomplice and former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, looked to appeal her 2021 conviction and 20-year prison sentences for helping the late financier sexually abuse teenage girls. Maxwell's appeal came months after a federal judge ordered the public disclosure of the identities of more than 150 people mentioned in a mountain of court documents related to the late financier. Epstein was found dead in his jail cell of an apparent suicide in 2019. He was awaiting trial for allegedly orchestrating a child sex trafficking ring along with Maxwell. Here is a timeline of the criminal cases against Epstein. Florida investigation launched into Epstein March 2005: Police in Palm Beach, Florida, begin investigating Epstein after the family of a 14-year-old girl reported she was molested at his mansion. Multiple underage girls, many of them high school students, would later tell police Epstein hired them to give sexual massages. May 2006: Palm Beach police charge Epstein with multiple counts of unlawful sex with a minor. The county's top prosecutor, State Attorney Barry Krischer, takes the unusual step of sending the case to a grand jury. Who has Jeffrey Epstein been linked to over the years? June 2006: The grand jury hears from only one accuser and indicts Epstein with one count of solicitation of prostitution. Accusations from other victims, many of whom were minors, are not reflected in the indictment. July 2006: The relatively minor charge draws attention, including from Palm Beach Police leaders, who slam Krischer for giving Epstein special treatment.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) 2007: Federal prosecutors prepare an indictment against Epstein. But for a year, the financier’s lawyers engaged in talks with the U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, about a plea bargain that would allow Epstein to avoid federal prosecution. Epstein’s lawyers argued that his accusers are unreliable witnesses. Bill Clinton one of the names mentioned in Epstein documents: Report June 2008: Epstein pleaded guilty to one count of soliciting prostitution and one count of soliciting prostitution from a minor. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail, a year of community service and is registered as a sex offender. Under a secret arrangement, the U.S. attorney's office agreed not to prosecute Epstein for federal crimes. Epstein served most of his sentence in a work-release program that allowed him to leave the jail during the day to go to his office and return to his cell at night. Epstein released from jail July 2009: Epstein is released from jail. For the next decade, multiple women who say they are Epstein’s victims wage a legal fight to get his federal non-prosecution agreement voided, and hold him and others liable for the abuse. Wendy Williams’ manager, son made serious money off docuseries In her lawsuits, one of Epstein’s accusers, Virginia Giuffre, says Epstein and then-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell set up sexual encounters with high-profile individuals starting when she was 17. This included royalty, politicians, academians, businessmen and other rich and powerful men, including Britain's Prince Andrew. All of the men denied the allegations.

Former President Bill Clinton is believed to be among the people named in the redacted filings, which could be released later this week. January 2024: The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York confirmed that the documents will be unsealed on a rolling basis. The first batch of documents was unsealed Jan. 3. More documents were unsealed in the following days. Questions about the millionaire pedophile remain unanswered even after the release of thousands of pages of court records. The documents received a lot of attention, but they shed little new light on the financier’s habitual sexual abuse of underage girls. Metaverse rape, murder could be treated as crime: UK agency The final round of legal documents were released Jan. 9. They added few details to what was already known about Epstein’s crimes. They did not contain the explosive revelations or new identities of abusers that some had predicted. Over 50 pages from Epstein’s passport files were secured by ABC News on Jan. 16 through a public records request to the U.S. Department of State, spanning from the early 1980s to 2019. The newly obtained records show extensive travels and passport requests from Epstein. February 2024: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Feb. 29 signed a bill into law that would make more documents from the 2006 grand jury investigation into Epstein public. House Bill 117, which would become effective July 1, creates a narrowly tailored exception for a judge to order the release of the grand jury records from the 2006 investigation. Grand jury transcripts can be released, according to the new law, if the subject of the grand jury inquiry is dead; if the investigation was about sexual activity with a minor; if the testimony was previously disclosed by a court order; and if a state attorney is notified. Under the law, a judge could release the transcripts sooner than July as part of a lawsuit filed by the Palm Beach Post. In 2019, the newspaper sued the Palm Beach County state attorney and court clerk for a court order to unseal the grand jury proceedings and reveal why it returned only minimal charges. Maxwell seeks to appeal conviction March 2024: A U.S. appeals court in New York heard oral arguments on March 12 in Maxwell’s 2021 conviction and 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls. Maxwell’s defense team will argue she did not receive a fair trial and didn’t testify because she was treated poorly. Grand jury records released July 2024: A Florida judge released transcripts detailing 2006 grand jury testimony that accused Epstein of sexually assaulting numerous underage teenage girls at his Palm Beach mansion. The records, which were under seal for 16 years, revealed that the Palm Beach County prosecutor, who had reinstated efforts to charge Epstein for months, painted the alleged underage victims as prostitutes, drug addicts, thieves and liars. In the transcripts, one of Epstein’s housekeepers stated that 'hundreds of girls' passed through the house, sometimes three a day. Additionally, there are audio recordings and footage of investigators interviewing some of these underage girls, who provided explicit details of their interactions with Epstein. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an order to release the files by July 1, reported the Palm Beach Post, which sued for their release in 2019. More Epstein files released to conservative influencers February 2025: The Department of Justice released files regarding Epstein to a small group of conservative influencers in February. It wasn't initially clear if these files would be released to the press more broadly. Some of those influencers were seen leaving the White House and holding binders labeled 'The Epstein Files: Phase 1.'

Federal workers may get second 'What did you do last week?' email	(NewsNation) — Thousands of federal employees may receive a second 'What did you do last week?' email from the Trump administration, which may require a response, a source confirmed to NewsNation Friday. According to The Washington Post, which first reported the news, the message is set to come from individual agencies rather than the centralized Office of Personnel Management. On Tuesday, Elon Musk gave federal workers 'another chance' to justify their recent accomplishments or risk losing their jobs. It followed an initial email asking federal employees to list five things they accomplished last week by 11:59 p.m. Monday. The directive appeared to contradict guidance from the Office of Personnel Management, which told federal departments and agencies responses were voluntary. Multiple federal agencies had instructed employees to disregard Musk’s initial email, at least temporarily. There is no word yet on how many federal workers complied with the original directive.

Trump to meet with Zelenskyy in DC after tense exhanges	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump will meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after calling his Ukrainian counterpart a 'dictator without elections' last week. Zelenskyy, who recently said Trump is living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space,' is expected to sign a deal in which Ukraine will send revenue from its rare mineral resources to a fund jointly controlled by the United States. Trump has said this is a way for Kyiv to repay the U.S. for aid during its war with Russia. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview that the rare minerals deal could bring in more than $20 billion to the U.S., which could help pay down the deficit. Jeffrey Epstein files released to conservative influencers However, Zelenskyy wants to see security guarantees in the deal. In a Wednesday evening address, he said, 'It's important that the United States' support is not stopped.' 'Strength is needed on the path to peace,' Zelenskyy said. When asked Thursday about his relationship with Zelenskyy, Trump softened his rhetoric. 'We have a lot of respect, I have a lot of respect for him,' Trump said. 'We've given him a lot of equipment and a lot of money, but they have fought very bravely.' When pressed by a reporter about whether he would apologize for calling Zelenskyy a dictator, Trump responded: 'Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question.'

AG Pam Bondi demands 'full' Epstein files from FBI, vows investig...	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Department of Justice released hundreds of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Thursday to a small group of conservative influencers, but Attorney General Pam Bondi says there's still more to be uncovered. In a letter to FBI Director Kash Patel, Bondi demanded the release of the bureau's 'full and complete Epstein files' by 8 a.m. ET Friday. While the declassification of the records brought some support from lawmakers who had been pushing for their release for years, others were not pleased with what little new information they contained. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., posted on social media, saying, 'This is not what we or the American people asked for. Get us the information we asked for instead of leaking old info to press.' Epstein file release may renew interest in his associates: Lawyer Epstein, a defamed financier and convicted sex offender, was indicted on federal charges related to the sex trafficking of young girls in 2019. He died by suicide in his cell one month after his arrest. The more than 300 pages of newly declassified documents contained information such as Epstein’s personal contact list, flight logs for his private plane and a list of victims’ names and phone numbers. The DOJ said the records largely contain information that had already been leaked in the past but hadn't been formally released by the U.S. government. In the letter to Patel, Bondi called for an 'immediate investigation' into the FBI's alleged withholding of some files and ordered a report on the investigation's findings within two weeks. Trump flew in Epstein’s plane; campaign had ‘no idea’: Report Patel took to social media Thursday evening, promising a 'new era' for the FBI and 'no cover-ups' or 'missing documents.' He also said that 'if records have been hidden,' the bureau 'will uncover them.' It’s unclear what this could mean for other famous investigations President Donald Trump has ordered to be declassified, including files on the assassinations of former President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Sr. and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/epstein-files-bondi-fbi-investigation/	2025-02-28T03:56:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/gettyimages-2198561415-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
Pope reaches 2-week mark at hospital with pneumonia and doctors s...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis reached the two-week mark recovery from pneumonia Friday as doctors suggested he had overcome the most critical phase of the infection while holding out on declaring him out of danger entirely. The Vatican’s early Friday update also suggested a level of normalcy and routine as the 88-year-old pope continues recovering at Rome's Gemelli Hospital. 'As in past days, the night was tranquil and the pope now is resting.' In their Thursday evening bulletin, doctors said Francis’ clinical condition had confirmed that he was improving. He was alternating the high-flow supplemental oxygen he had been receiving by a nasal tube with a mask in a sign of improved respiratory function. Additionally, he left his hospital room to go to his nearby private chapel to pray, while continuing with respiratory physiotherapy and work, the Vatican said. For the second day in a row, doctors avoided saying Francis was in critical condition, suggesting he had overcome the most acute phase of the infection. But given the complexity of his lung infection, they said 'further days of clinical stability are needed' before they revise their prognosis officially and say he is out of danger. Francis has been at Gemelli Hospital since Feb. 14 after his bronchitis worsened. He has shown steady, albeit slight improvements since a respiratory crisis and kidney trouble over the weekend sparked fears for his life. The improvements beat back speculation of an imminent death, resignation or a conclave and signaled that he was still very much in charge. Prayers continued to pour in In Mexico City, a few dozen people gathered Thursday night at the cathedral to pray for Francis’ recovery. 'He is like part of the family,' said Araceli Gutiérrez, who treasures the time she saw the pope during his trip to the country of nearly 100 million Catholics in 2016. 'That’s why we feel so concerned for him.' María Teresa Sánchez, who was visiting from Colombia with her sister, said that she has always felt close to Francis -- the first Latin American pope. 'That’s like having a relative within the higher-ups, with God,' she said. 'He has done so much for religion; he’s such a humble person.' Upcoming calendar in question Despite his improvements, Francis’ near-term upcoming calendar of events was being changed: The Vatican cancelled a Holy Year audience scheduled for Saturday, and it remained to be seen if Francis would skip his Sunday noon blessing for the third week in a row. Ash Wednesday next week starts the Lenten season leading up to Holy Week and Easter, which this year falls on April 20. In past years, when Francis has battled bronchitis and influenza in winter, he curbed his participation in Ash Wednesday and Holy Week events, which call for the pope to be outdoors in the cold leading services, participating in processions and presiding over prayers in the solemn period in which the faithful commemorate Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection. Beyond that, Francis has a few major events coming up that he presumably would hope to keep if well enough. On April 27, he is due to canonize Carlo Acutis, considered to be the first millennial and digital-era saint. The Vatican considers the Italian teenager, who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, an inspiration for young Catholics. Another important appointment is the May 24 commemoration of the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, Christianity’s first ecumenical council. The spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians, Patriarch Bartholomew I, has invited Francis to join him in Iznik, Turkey, to commemorate the anniversary, which he has called an important sign of reconciliation between the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Before he got sick, Francis said he hoped to go, though the Vatican hasn’t confirmed the trip. ___ Maria Hernandez contributed from Mexico City. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Wendy Williams exclusive: I feel like I'm in prison	(NewsNation) — Former talk show host Wendy Williams says her guardianship feels like a prison and that she suspects her guardian may be misusing her money. 'I need out of this,' Williams said during a national 'Banfield' exclusive, claiming that even her toiletries are locked away and she must ask permission to use them. 'If I want lotion, they bring me lotion. If I want to take off my nail polish ... if I want to brush my teeth and wash my face, they have to bring it to me,' she said. Epstein files released to conservative influencers Since 2022, Williams has been staying under the direction of court-appointed conservator Sabrina Morrissey. Tune in to NewsNation's 'Banfield' at 10/9c Friday to watch the Wendy Williams national TV exclusive. Wendy Williams' guardianship The former host remains under court-ordered guardianship after being diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia. In 2022, Wells Fargo initiated guardianship proceedings where Morrissey was made guardian after Williams’ show got canceled as a result of her health problems. Morrisey filed lawsuits last year against multiple parties involved in the creation of Lifetime’s controversial documentary, 'Where is Wendy Williams?' saying Williams was 'highly vulnerable and clearly incapable of consenting to be filmed, much less humiliated and exploited,' according to court documents. She described Williams as 'an acclaimed entertainer who, tragically, has been afflicted by early-onset dementia and, as a result, has become cognitively impaired and permanently incapacitated.' While she sought to block Lifetime from releasing the series, a court ruled it could be released as planned. Journalist: Wendy Williams' alleged treatment raises serious concerns Investigative journalist Diane Dimond believes the alleged handling of the situation by Williams’ guardian raises serious concerns. Ryan Reynolds’ image takes hit amid Lively-Baldoni lawsuit; costars speak out 'I believe that criminal things happen within the guardianship system all the time, and we don’t know about it because it’s such a damn secret system,' Dimond said during a previous 'Banfield' interview. Williams continues to say she is not 'cognitively impaired' and has been 'trapped' in an emotionally abusive conservatorship.

Newsom recall supporter ‘not buying’ governor’s 52% approval rati...	(NewsNation) — Actor Mel Gibson, recently named one of President Donald Trump’s special ambassadors to Hollywood, joined an effort to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom following the devastating and deadly Los Angeles wildfires. Randy Economy, who is spearheading the effort to recall Newsom, told NewsNation’s 'The Hill' he doesn’t believe recent polling that shows 52% of Californians approve of the governor’s performance. 'I don't agree with that poll. I just don't,' said Economy. 'I'm here on the ground. I see the pain and the anger.' Epstein files released to conservative influencers Twenty-nine people were killed in the Palisades and Eaton fires, which combined to burn over 37,000 acres and destroy thousands of homes and businesses. Newsom has said that the LA wildfires, which broke out Jan. 7 amid the strongest Santa Ana winds in years, could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. 'We deserve much more and much better, and there is absolutely no adequate excuse the governor or mayor can make for this gross mismanagement and failure to preemptively deal with what they knew was coming,' said Economy. The new recall effort is now the eighth attempt against the governor in six years. Why is Tesla stock down 25% to start the year? 'We've had one recall attempt against Governor Newsom that has hit the ballot,' said Economy. 'It's a long process to be able to get through that actual maze of bureaucracy and to get people to actually.' Economy believes his group still has a shot at booting the governor out of office. Why? 'Because of Gavin Newsom himself,' Economy said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/gavin-newsom-randy-economy-recall-effort/	2025-02-27T17:19:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Gavin-Newsom-e1736783836151.jpg?w=900
Prince Harry's immigration status under fire over drugs, possible...	(NewsNation) — The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, is suing the Department of Homeland Security in an effort to get them to release Prince Harry's immigration paperwork. Harry's immigration status has recently come under fire after the Duke of Sussex admitted in a published memoir to the recreational use of marijuana, cocaine and psychedelic mushrooms. Applications for U.S. visas specifically ask about current and past drug use, and admitting to such behavior typically leads to applications being rejected. Trump says he won’t deport Prince Harry: ‘He’s got enough problems with his wife’ Prince Harry currently resides in Montecito, California, with his wife, Meghan Markle. President Trump on Prince Harry In February last year, President Donald Trump accused former President Joe Biden’s administration of 'protecting Harry,' adding that he wouldn’t do the same if he won the White House. Now, Trump said last week that he is 'not interested' in deporting Harry. 'I don’t want to do that,' Trump told the New York Post. 'I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.' Meghan Markle in ‘precarious’ position; ‘With Love, Meghan’ to debut at messy time Call for Prince Harry's immigration records Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at The Heritage Foundation, joined 'The Hill on NewsNation' to discuss their efforts to obtain Harry's immigration paperwork. 'We're calling for the release of all of Prince Harry's immigration records,' he said. 'Because we believe the American people have a right to know whether or not Harry lied on his US immigration application.' The Heritage Foundation has alleged the DHS 'may have improperly granted' his visa after the royal family member disclosed personal drug use in his memoir, 'Spare.' Prince Harry saves the day (financially) with a whopping $12M settlement 'I think it's important because the application of U.S. immigration law really does matter,' Gardiner said. 'No one should be above the law, whether they're a prince or a pauper, and Prince Harry may have received preferential treatment, he may have lied on his application, and so the rule of law really does, does matter, and it applies everybody, and Prince Harry should be no exception at all.' A federal judge is set to consider the next steps in a slow-moving court case over whether to release some of Harry's immigration documents. JFK, Jeffrey Epstein files: When will they be released? Will Prince Harry get deported? Gardiner said The Heritage Foundation is just calling for the release of all the documents and did not directly address his deportation. 'If someone lies on an immigration application, that's a federal criminal offense, and normally, those individuals would be either deported or prosecuted,' he said. 'So the stakes are certainly very, very high for Prince Harry at this at this stage.'

US wants to end Ukraine war with little involvement: Ex-ambassado...	(NewsNation) — It has been three years since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, and talks to end the war have been advancing between the United States and Europe. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House on Thursday with President Donald Trump, where Starmer made his case to Trump that U.S. involvement would be key to ensuring peace and ending the war. Giving US ownership of Ukraine’s minerals would help keep peace: Hassett Trump has called for the United Kingdom and other European nations to increase their defense spending as the U.S. has already provided billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. Kurt Volker, the former U.S. ambassador to NATO, said talks are coming together and that Trump is focused on ending the war only, leaving France and Britain in charge of leading a deterrence force in Ukraine to prevent further conflict. 'That's part of rebalancing U.S. relations with Europe so Europe is pulling more of the load,' Volker said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with Trump on Friday to sign a rare minerals deal, which Trump believes is a way for the U.S. to regain its investment in Ukraine's defense efforts.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ukraine-russia-war-us-involvement-volker/	2025-02-27T15:11:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201496887.jpg?w=900
NewsNation exclusive catches border smuggling operation in action	EL PASO, Texas (NewsNation) — NewsNation got a behind-the-scenes look at deterrence efforts along the U.S.-Mexico border as illegal crossings continue to plummet during the Trump administration. Our cameras were rolling when two smuggling crews attempted to breach U.S. barriers with ladders. Video shows the smugglers stashing the ladder before one of the groups retreats. Illegal crossings in the El Paso area are down to about 60 per day after once topping 2,700 per day. The Border Patrol says migrants are turning back on their own because of deterrence efforts on the U.S. side. Migrant crossings down but cartel activity evident in Rio Grande Valley It also means the cartels aren’t making the money they once did. Air interdiction agent Taylor Herring told NewsNation that the cartels are down but certainly not out for the count. 'The threat of violence is always in the back of your mind,' he said. 'But by maintaining a constant presence out here, you can pick up on those little changes and those little cues that could maybe keep you informed.' Arizona Gov.

'This is what we signed up to do,' he said. 'This is the oath we took when we came into office: to protect the Constitution, protect our nation's borders, against enemies — foreign and domestic. So for us, it's a proud moment to gain operational control of our nation's borders.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/newsnation-exclusive-border-smuggling/	2025-02-27T13:22:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/snapshot_05f9ba.jpg?w=900
Epstein files released to conservative influencers	(NewsNation) — The Department of Justice released files regarding Jeffrey Epstein to a small group of conservative influencers Thursday. It's not clear if the files will be released to the press more broadly or if they will be available for the public to access. President Donald Trump signed an executive order early in his second term ordering the release of the files along with classified documents related to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. FDA calls off meeting to choose flu vaccine strain The group of influencers was seen leaving the White House with binders labeled 'The Epstein Files: Phase 1.' Attorney General Pam Bondi teased the release of the files earlier in the day, saying there were things included in them that would make people sick. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., who is heading a task force on government transparency, said her group was not given the documents and criticized the administration for the limited release. 'A NY Post story just revealed that the documents will simply be Epstein's phonebook. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR. GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR instead of leaking old info to press,' she said on X. Epstein was charged with sex trafficking but died by suicide while in prison. His girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein traffic minors. Ryan Reynolds’ image takes hit amid Lively-Baldoni lawsuit; costars speak out The new files are said to contain names of Epstein's associates and flight logs for his private plane. It's important to note that someone's name appearing in Epstein's files is not an indicator that they participated in sex trafficking, and the files included people who only had brief contact with the high-profile financier. Previously released files included the names of many political and Hollywood figures, including Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Stephen Hawking, Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael Jackson, Cate Blanchett, David Copperfield and George Lucas.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/epstein-files-conservative-influencers/	2025-02-27T12:00:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/GettyImages-590696434.jpg?w=900
Trump: I 'wouldn't be opposed' to using private forces for deport...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he 'wouldn't be opposed' to using private forces to assist with deportations, but officials like Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and border czar Tom Homan are already doing a 'phenomenal' job. Trump made the remarks in the Oval Office in response to a question from NewsNation correspondent Kellie Meyer during a joint press conference with United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer. According to a report by Politico, a group of military contractors, including former Blackwater CEO Erik Prince, proposed the idea of using a network of 'processing camps' on military bases, a private fleet of 100 planes, and a 'small army' of private citizens empowered to make arrests for mass deportations to The White House. Politico writes that this would be an estimated $25 billion. However, asked about this on NewsNation's 'On Balance,' Prince denied the report. 'This is not some idea of a private army,' Prince said Tuesday. 'It was a memo generated to describe how to achieve the logistics necessary to move the millions of people that they intend to deport.'

Pope Francis continues to improve but his prognosis remains guard...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis continued to improve from double pneumonia Thursday, the Vatican said, working from his hospital room and going to his private chapel to pray, though doctors said he needs more days of 'clinical stability' before they revise their guarded prognosis. The 88-year-old pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was able to begin alternating high-flow supplemental oxygen, delivered by a nasal tube, with a mask in a sign of his improved respiratory condition, the Vatican said in a late update. For the second day in a row, doctors avoided saying Francis was in critical condition. But they said that given the complexity of his lung infection, 'further days of clinical stability are needed' before they revise their prognosis and decide he is out of danger. Catholic faithful attend a nightly rosary prayer service for the health of Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. (AP Photo/Mosa'ab Elshamy) Francis has been in Rome’s Gemelli hospital since Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened. He has shown steady, albeit slight improvements since a respiratory crisis and kidney trouble over the weekend sparked fears for his life. The improvements, as he nears the two-week mark on Friday, beat back speculation of an imminent death, resignation or conclave and signaled that he was still very much in charge. Upcoming calendar in question Nevertheless, his near-term upcoming calendar of events was being changed: The Vatican cancelled a Holy Year audience scheduled for Saturday, and it remained to be seen if Francis would skip his Sunday noon blessing for the third week in a row. Longer term, Ash Wednesday loomed on the horizon March 5, the start of the church's Lenten season leading up to Holy Week and Easter, which this year falls on April 20. In past years, when Francis has battled bronchitis and influenza in winter, he has had to cut back his participation in Ash Wednesday and Holy Week events, which call for the pope to be outdoors in the cold leading services, participating in processions and presiding over prayers in the solemn period in which the faithful commemorate Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. Beyond that, Francis has a few major events coming up that he presumably would hope to keep if well enough. On April 27, he is due to canonize Carlo Acutis, considered to be the first millennial and digital-era saint. The Vatican considers the Italian teenager, who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, as an inspiring role model for today's young Catholics. Another important appointment is the May 24 commemoration of the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, Christianity's first ecumenical council. The spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians, Patriarch Bartholomew I, has invited Francis to join him in what is today's Iznik, Turkey to commemorate the anniversary, which he has called an important sign of reconciliation between the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Before he got sick, Francis said he hoped to go, though the Vatican hasn't confirmed the trip. Prayers nevertheless continue Prayers for his heath continued to pour in from near and far, with a group of Mexican pilgrims in Rome for the Holy Year taking a detour to pray for Francis outside the Gemelli hospital. Lili Iparea Fernandez, from La Cruz, Mexico, had come to Rome with plans to attend Francis' Wednesday general audience this week, but it was cancelled. 'However, we firmly believe that the pope will recover because he is a very strong man,' she said Thursday outside Gemelli. 'So I invite everyone to believe firmly, with certainty, with confidence, with hope that the pope is going to be well.' Francis keeps governing while being treated By now a certain rhythm appears to have emerged from the Vatican’s updates: The pope receives treatments in the morning, including respiratory physiotherapy, receives the Eucharist and resumes work in the afternoon from his hospital room. On Thursday, the Vatican said he had gone to the chapel located down the hall in the papal suite on the 10th floor of Gemelli to pray. It was the first time since Feb. 21, before Francis' weekend respiratory crisis, that he is known to have gone to the chapel. The Vatican said Wednesday that he had appointed four new bishops and approved the creation of a new fundraising initiative to encourage donations to the Holy See, which has been enduring a financial crisis for years. Francis likely approved the bishop appointments a while back and the new norms for the fundraising entity were approved Feb. 11, before he was hospitalized. But the announcements made them official and suggested Francis was still very much in charge and governing.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/pope-francis-continues-to-improve-but-his-prognosis-remains-guarded-vatican/	2025-02-27T10:49:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Pope-vigil-1-e1740654669836.jpg?w=900

(AP) — Oscar-winner Gene Hackman, his wife and their dog were found dead in different rooms of their Santa Fe home, and they had apparently been dead for some time, according to investigators. Hackman, 95, was found dead Wednesday in a mudroom and his 63-year-old wife, Betsy Arakawa, was found dead in a bathroom next to a space heater, Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office detectives wrote in a search warrant. There was an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on a countertop near Arakawa. Denise Avila, a sheriff's office spokesperson, said there was no indication that any of them had been shot or had other types of wounds. The detective who gave the affidavit, meanwhile, called the circumstances 'suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation.'

(AP Photo, File) The New Mexico Gas Co. is working with the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Department in the investigation, spokesperson Tim Korte told The Associated Press. The utility tested the gas lines in and around the home after the bodies were discovered, according to the warrant. At the time, it didn't find any signs of problems. A detective noted that people exposed to gas leaks or carbon monoxide may not show signs of poisoning. Chris Ramirez, spokesperson for the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, which runs the state’s medical examiner operations, declined to comment on whether any conclusions had been reached on the cause and manner of deaths of Hackman and Arakawa. Michelle Trachtenberg, ‘Gossip Girl’ and ‘Buffy’ actress, dead at 39 The gruff-but-beloved Hackman was among the best actors of his generation, appearing as villains, heroes and antiheroes in dozens of dramas, comedies and action films from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s. He routinely showed up on Hollywood lists of greatest American actors of the 20th century. He could play virtually any kind of role, from comic book villain Lex Luthor in 'Superman' to a coach finding redemption in the sentimental favorite 'Hoosiers.' Hackman was a five-time Oscar nominee who won for 'The French Connection' in 1972 and 'Unforgiven' two decades later. His death comes just four days before this year’s ceremony. Tributes quickly poured in from Hollywood. 'The loss of a great artist, always cause for both mourning and celebration: Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity,' director Francis Ford Coppola wrote on Instagram. Hackman met Arakawa, a classically trained pianist who grew up in Hawaii, when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, The New York Times reported in 1989. They soon moved in together, and by the end of the decade had decamped to Santa Fe. Their Southwestern-style ranch on Old Sunset Trail sits on a hill in a gated community with views of the Rocky Mountains. The 2,300 square-foot home on one acre (0.4 hectares) was built in 2000 and had an estimated market value of a little over $1 million, according to Santa Fe County property tax records. It is modest compared to the sprawling estate next door, which was valued at $7.9 million.

Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and their wife were found dead in the home a day earlier. (AP Photo/Roberto Rosales) Hackman also co-wrote three novels, starting with the swashbuckler 'Wake of the Perdido Star' with Daniel Lenihan in 1999, according to publisher Simon &amp; Schuster. He then penned two by himself, concluding with 'Pursuit' in 2013, about a female police officer on the tail of a predator. In his first couple decades in New Mexico, Hackman was often seen around the historic state capital, which known as an artist enclave, tourism destination and retreat for celebrities. He served as a board member of the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in the 1990s, according to the local paper, The New Mexican. In recent years, he was far less visible, though even the most mundane outings caught the attention of the press. The Independent wrote about him attending a show at the Lensic Performing Arts Center in 2018. The New York Post reported on him pumping gas, doing yard work and getting a chicken sandwich at Wendy's in 2023. Aside from appearances at awards shows, he was rarely seen in the Hollywood social circuit and retired from acting about 20 years ago. His was the rare Hollywood retirement that actually lasted. Katy Perry among all-woman crew going to space Hackman had three children from a previous marriage. He and Arakawa had no children together but were known for having German shepherds. Hackman told the film magazine Empire in 2020 that he and Arakawa liked to watch DVDs she rented. 'We like simple stories that some of the little low-budget films manage to produce,' he said. An email sent to his publicist was not immediately returned early Thursday. Fonseca reported from Flagstaff, Arizona, and Melley reported from London.

Suspect arrested in Tesla vandalism, explosives case	(NewsNation) — A woman was arrested in connection to a string of vandalism incidents at a Colorado Tesla dealership believed to be directed against Tesla founder Elon Musk, according to court documents. Lucy Grace Nelson, 40, was arrested Monday in Loveland after returning to the dealership with 'additional incendiary devices' and materials used for vandalism, police said. Nelson faces several charges, including possession of an incendiary device or explosives during a felony, criminal mischief and criminal attempt to commit a class 3 felony. When will the Epstein and JFK files be released? Police are working with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and federal charges are likely. Nelson posted bond and was released from jail Tuesday. Her next court appearance is scheduled for March 7. Police are still investigating her alleged motive. The arrest affidavit suggests a second person is involved, citing surveillance video from one of the six incidents since Jan. 29, in which the suspect seems to have a smaller build than Nelson. However, the affidavit identified Nelson as the suspect in other incidents. Footage captured someone spray-painting an obscenity believed to be aimed at Musk, while other footage captured Molotov cocktails being thrown into a row of Tesla vehicles, causing damage to four cars worth $220,000. Police reportedly found spray paint, gasoline and other materials in Nelson’s car when she was arrested. The incidents are under investigation, and the case is part of growing concerns over Musk’s influence and recent protests at Tesla storerooms across the United States.

Trump, UK's Keir Starmer to meet amid differences on Ukraine	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will visit the White House on Thursday in an effort to convince President Donald Trump that Ukraine and European leaders need a place at the table as the U.S. negotiates an end to the yearslong Russia-Ukraine war. The meeting follows a visit from French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, reflecting a mounting concern felt by much of Europe that Trump’s aggressive push to end the war in Ukraine signals his willingness to concede too much to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Macron called his meeting with Trump a 'turning point,' but no deal to end the war in Ukraine has been reached. Keir Starmer to raise British defense budget Trump has been calling for the U.K. and European nations to increase their spending as the U.S. has provided billions to Ukraine in military aid. Starmer on Tuesday pledged to increase the U.K. defense budget to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 in hopes of persuading Trump to maintain U.S. support for Ukraine and the NATO alliance. The U.K. currently spends 2.3% of GDP on defense, and the government had previously set a 2.5% target without setting a date. Starmer told lawmakers the increase amounts to an additional 13.4 billion pounds ($17 billion) annually. He said the goal is for defense spending to increase to 3% of GDP by 2035. Marco Rubio: US-Ukraine rare minerals deal a 'tush push' away Trump has announced that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also visit the White House on Friday to sign a deal on rare earth minerals. Details of the agreement are vague, but what is known is that the U.S. is requesting revenue from Ukraine’s rare minerals, which are used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. Trump believes this is a way for the U.S. to recoup its investment in Ukrainian defense efforts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the deal is a 'tush push' away — a reference to the Philadelphia Eagles' signature tush-push strategy. Trump floats post-war meeting with Russia's Putin Relations between the U.S. and Russia have grown closer since a meeting earlier this month in Saudi Arabia in which both nations agreed to cooperate beyond the war. Senior Russian and U.S. diplomats are meeting in Istanbul on Thursday to discuss their embassies’ operations and work toward normalizing diplomatic relations. Trump has suggested a potential face-to-face meeting with Putin in Russia after the war in Ukraine ends to discuss a potential peace deal, though he did not specify concessions.

Hackman moved to the area in the 1980s, where he was often seen around town and served as a board member of the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in the 1990s, according to the local paper, The New Mexican. Aside from appearances at awards shows, he was rarely seen in the Hollywood social circuit and retired about 20 years ago. His was the rare Hollywood retirement that actually lasted. In his later years, he wrote novels from the hilltop ranch that provided a view of the Rocky Mountains.

Gene Hackman, wife and their dog found dead in their New Mexico h...	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife were found dead in their New Mexico home Wednesday, authorities said. Foul play is not suspected, however authorities did not release any details of the circumstances of their deaths and said an investigation is ongoing. Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Denise Avila said deputies responded to a request to do a welfare check at the home Wednesday around 1:45 pm local time and found Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and a dog dead. Hackman, 95, was a five-time Oscar nominee who starred in dozens of films and one of the industry's most respected and honored performers. His two Oscar wins, for 'The French Connection' and 'Unforgiven,' were spaced out 21 years apart. News of his death comes just four days before this year’s Academy Awards ceremony. Hackman played a variety of roles, appearing in action movies, thrillers and even appearing in a comedic part in 'Young Frankenstein.' Aside from appearances at awards shows, he was rarely seen in the Hollywood social circuit and retired in his mid-70s. An email sent to his publicist was not immediately returned early Thursday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/entertainment-headlines/ap-gene-hackman-wife-and-their-dog-found-dead-in-their-new-mexico-home-authorities-say/	2025-02-27T01:21:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67c02fd481eec3.46447855.jpeg?w=900
Will the SAVE Act keep married women from voting?	(NewsNation) — Republicans in Congress have reintroduced the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, and experts are warning the law could make it harder for many Americans to vote. What is the SAVE Act? The proposed law would require Americans to prove their citizenship status by presenting specific documentation in person when they register to vote or update their voter registration. Specifically, the law would require certain documents that comply with REAL ID laws to be presented, generally a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport. Should you expect a check from Elon Musk’s DOGE cuts? Roughly half of Americans do not have a valid passport. For those who don't have a copy of their birth certificate on hand, getting a copy can take time and require paying a fee. How would the SAVE Act change voter registration? Driver's licenses, which have traditionally been used to register voters, would no longer be valid. Neither would state ID cards issued to people who can't or don't want to drive but still need ID. That would be true even if the license conforms to REAL ID standards. Military or tribal IDs would also be invalid for voter registration. The documentation would also have to be given in person, which would mean an end to voter registration by mail, online voter registration and voter registration drives. How would the SAVE Act affect married women? To register, the required documents would need to match the voter's current legal name. Trump’s ‘gold card’ can work ‘in theory’: Immigration attorney For married women who take their spouse's name (or husbands who do the same), this could present a problem if they lack a passport. When someone changes their name after getting married, they are not issued a new birth certificate. The law doesn't outright prohibit people whose names don't match from registering, but they would be required to provide additional documentation, like a marriage license, which would create more barriers to registering. How would the SAVE Act affect college students? The law would require documents to be presented in person for registration and changes, like updating a mailing address. Many young people may not have access to the documents they need. US consumer confidence drops by most since August 2021 For college students who attend school in a different city or state, this would remove the option to update their registration online or by mail and require them to travel back home to make any changes. How would the SAVE Act affect transgender Americans? Transgender voters could also face barriers to registering because many states do not allow them to get a new birth certificate with their updated name and gender. As with married women, trans people would have to provide additional legal documentation of a name change to register. The Trump administration has made changes that prohibit people from changing their gender on passports, making it harder for trans people to get one form of suitable ID, and some trans people have reported they are unable to get a passport at all. How would the SAVE Act affect rural voters? Millions of Americans who live in rural areas and rely on mail or online registration would have to register in person, potentially requiring long drives to register. Why are income-driven repayment plan applications closed? That would also affect elderly voters who are unable to drive and live in rural areas with little public transportation. Service members who rely on the ability to register or update registration by mail while deployed would also face difficulty registering to vote under the new law. How would the SAVE Act affect low-income Americans? The SAVE Act requires documents many Americans don't have on hand. Obtaining a passport or birth certificate are both processes that cost money, which creates barriers for low-income Americans who can't afford those fees.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/save-act-married-women/	2025-02-26T18:39:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/pexels-element-digital-1550337.jpg?w=900
Trump’s ‘gold card’ can work ‘in theory’: Immigration attorney	(NewsNation) — A San Diego-based immigration attorney tells NewsNation that President Donald Trump’s idea for a U.S. investor visa 'gold card' could work because it would function much like the existing EB5 investor visa. 'In theory, it can really work because the EB5 program works,' said Saman Nasseri. 'Now, this will just expand on it and bring bigger businesses, bigger people.' While Trump said the new system has 'never been done before, anything like this,' the broad strokes of what was announced sound similar to the existing EB5 investor program, albeit with a higher price tag. Social Security to increase monthly benefits for millions Trump said he’d like the gold card rolled out within two weeks. It’s an estimate Nasseri says isn’t impossible but has hurdles. 'It is possible that this could start in two weeks and get it going,' he said. 'But it all kind of comes down to what that vetting process looks like. The biggest thing with the EB5 process is the source of the funds. Where's the money going, and is it creating jobs?' The current program requires would-be investors to invest a little over $1 million and create at least 10 jobs, and it also puts investors on a pathway to a green card and later citizenship. It’s unclear, however, whether Trump can end the EB5 program without Congress’ blessing, as the investor program was just reauthorized in 2022.

Should you expect a check from Elon Musk's DOGE cuts?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump wants to take some of the savings that come from Elon Musk's government efficiency push and return it directly to taxpayers, but that doesn't mean you should expect a check in the mail anytime soon. Trump recently endorsed the idea — which started on social media — of sending 20% of the Department of Government Efficiency's savings back to taxpayers as a 'DOGE dividend.' 'I love it. A 20% dividend, so to speak, for the money that we're saving by going after the waste and fraud and abuse and all of the other things that are happening,' Trump told reporters last week. When asked how much money it could be, Trump said, 'It could be a lot. If it's 20%, we'd give back a lot of money to the taxpayer.' ‘DOGE dividend’ advisor says $5k checks are ‘reasonable’ Musk also supports the idea, likening so-called 'DOGE dividend checks' to the 'spoils of battle' in a recent interview. But that doesn't mean dividend checks are going to happen. Congress would have to authorize the plan, and so far, even Republican lawmakers have been hesitant to embrace it. It's also unclear how much money DOGE can save to return to taxpayers in the first place. Clear evidence of major savings has been scant, and budget experts doubt DOGE can reach its $2 trillion savings goal on its own. 'I don't think Americans should bet on a big DOGE dividend coming their way,' said Romina Boccia, the director of budget and entitlement policy at the libertarian Cato Institute. Boccia added: 'Politicians love to provide benefits to their constituents, but when it comes to actually curtailing spending and producing deficit reduction, that is much harder to do.' Here's what to know about the DOGE dividend and how likely it is to happen. What is the 'DOGE dividend' check? The idea for a 'DOGE dividend' surfaced on social media last week when 'anti-woke' investor James Fishback posted a four-page proposal and tagged Elon Musk. Fishback suggested sending a 'tax refund check' as a form of 'restitution' that would go out to roughly '79 million tax-paying households.' Those households would receive a $5,000 check — a 20% cut of DOGE's $2 trillion in targeted savings, according to Fishback's formulation. The idea caught Musk's attention, who said he would run it by Trump, and the president has since expressed support for the proposal. Congress would have to approve the checks, and achieving the sort of payout that Fishback proposed would require Musk to hit his target of $2 trillion in spending cuts — a number that has drawn skepticism. DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for 'I think that 2 trillion is likely an overly ambitious target that DOGE by itself will not be able to accomplish,' Boccia said. Achieving that level of savings, Boccia said, would require congressional buy-in and cuts to major entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, which Trump has already taken off the table. DOGE claims it has saved an estimated $65 billion so far, citing a combination of fraud detection, canceled contracts, workforce reductions and other alleged cost-cutting measures. However, several analyses have cast doubt on DOGE's numbers, identifying errors that caused savings to be vastly overstated. A New York Times report found that the single biggest line item on the DOGE website was off by about $8 billion. 'At the moment, we cannot take DOGE at face value,' Boccia said. Fishback told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo that his plan would help DOGE reach its $2 trillion goal because citizens would be incentivized to report wasteful spending. 'Every American can step up, report fraud and abuse to DOGE directly via X, and we’ll see the savings go up, hit $2 trillion, and we’ll see the checks dispersed next summer,' Fishback said. Who would get DOGE dividend checks? In his proposal, Fishback said the checks would only go to households that pay income taxes, meaning tens of millions of lower-income Americans would miss out. An estimated 72.5 million households — roughly 40% — didn't pay federal income tax in 2022, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. For the most part, people don't pay income taxes because they have little income. About 60% of nonpayers make less than $30,000, and another 28% make between $30,000 and about $60,000, per the Tax Policy Center. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? 'While some politicians imply that people somehow are cheating the system by not paying taxes, the reality is quite different. People generally don’t pay federal income tax because, well, they don’t make very much money,' Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, wrote in the report. Of those who paid no federal income tax in 2022, roughly a third were age 65 or older. That means many people who are primarily living on Social Security benefits wouldn't receive DOGE dividend checks under the current plan. Are DOGE dividend checks a good idea? Some experts think DOGE dividend checks would worsen inflation, like when COVID-era stimulus checks helped drive up prices. 'Love what DOGE is doing, but this is a bad idea. There’s no need to send 'dividend checks,'' Preston Brashers, a tax policy research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, wrote on X. 'If the government sends out stimmy checks, inflation will come back with a vengeance,' Brashers warned. Fishback argues that DOGE dividend checks would not be inflationary because 'unlike COVID-stimulus checks which were deficit-financed,' the new round of checks would be 'exclusively funded with DOGE-driven savings.' Could Trump really return DOGE savings to taxpayers? Kevin Hassett, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, echoed that claim, insisting that the dividend checks would not be inflationary during a press briefing last week. 'Imagine if we don't spend government money, and we give it back to people. If they spend it all, then you're even,' Hassett said. Boccia said a DOGE dividend could push up inflation if the government were to borrow and fund the checks based on expected savings rather than savings that have actually materialized. Others don't think the checks will be sizeable enough to matter. 'I can’t imagine they’d be inflationary because I can’t imagine they’d be big enough,’’ Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, told The Associated Press. Kamarck dismissed the DOGE dividend as 'ridiculous' and said there's not enough money to cut that would result in a big contribution to taxpayers. What do lawmakers think about the idea? A DOGE dividend check would have to be approved by Congress, and even Trump-aligned GOP lawmakers seem skeptical. House Speaker Mike Johnson appeared less than enthusiastic when asked about the idea at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week. 'Politically, that would be great for us, you know, you can send everybody a check,' Johnson said. 'But if you think about our core principles, right, fiscal responsibility is what we do as conservatives. That’s our brand.' Speaker Johnson discourages DOGE stimulus checks idea Johnson added: 'We have a $36 trillion federal debt. We have a giant deficit that we’re contending with. I think we need to pay down the credit card, right?' Senator Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., said he loves what Musk is doing to expose waste, fraud and abuse but pumped the breaks on a DOGE dividend. 'I’m always happy to let the American people keep more of their hard-earned money, but DOGE savings should first go toward reducing spending so that inflation doesn’t become the silent tax robbing them of their purchasing power,' Johnson wrote on X. Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he’d 'want to see the details' of the plan, according to Business Insider. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican, told Scripps News that eliminating the debt and curbing inflation would be her main priorities for any savings associated with DOGE. 'If there's money left after we address inflation, and the debt, and the deficit, it's always a good idea to send taxpayers their money back. But when we're $36 trillion in debt, we've dug ourselves a pretty big hole,' Lummis said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/should-you-expect-check-doge/	2025-02-26T16:37:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67abf8d861b6a3.13913445.jpeg?w=900
JFK, Jeffrey Epstein files: When will they be released?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his third day in office that directed the release of records related to the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, but those files haven't been released yet. Trump has been saying he will have classified records related to the assassination of Kennedy released since he was on the campaign trail. This executive order also called for the declassification of the assassination files of former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ashley Judd backs New York bill to protect survivors, target traffickers There has been pressure to release not only these files but also those surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case. Pressure to release Jeffrey Epstein, JFK files In February, the FBI said it found 2,400 new records related to the assassination of Kennedy and is working on transferring those files to the National Archives and Records Administration to be included in the declassification process. Attorney General Pam Bondi is now being pressured to release Jeffrey Epstein's flight log for his private jet and helicopter, according to The Hill. 'The American people deserve to know exactly who was affiliated with this network. As you know, over the course of many years, Jeffrey Epstein built a heinous global sex trafficking network that caused irreparable harm to countless women,' Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said. Democrats have not said much regarding the release of these files. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida, told Chris Cuomo that she wanted the Epstein and Kennedy files to be declassified. Luna said a plan should be presented this week on how to declassify these documents. 'That will lay out the process in which declassification will take place,' she said. 'We met with the National Archives today ... if everything goes as planned, these will be publicly available as soon as we get them. The American people will also be getting them.' Bondi said the files are 'sitting on her desk' and that she is reviewing them. Luna posted on X, saying, 'On Feb 11 &amp; Feb 19, house oversight sent a letter to the DOJ asking for status on releasing the Epstein files as well as JFK etc. The DOJ has not responded.' She then tagged Bondi, asking her the status of these documents. Why is there pressure to release Jeffrey Epstein, JFK files? Many are citing transparency as the reason for releasing these files. Massachusetts sanctuary cities sue Trump, Feds over funding threats Blackburn said Democrats have undercut efforts to 'crack the Epstein trafficking ring wide open.' In a post on X, Blackburn said, 'The time for transparency is now.' Another Republican senator, Mike Lee of Utah, also said on X that it is time for the American people to 'be given access to' these files, according to Yahoo News. Jeffrey Epstein case Investigations against Jeffrey Epstein started in March of 2005 when a 14-year-old girl said she was molested at his mansion. Later, multiple underage girls would tell police Epstein hired them to give sexual massages. Jeffrey Epstein timeline: Sex trafficking, scandals, Ghislaine Maxwell Epstein was found dead in his jail cell of an apparent suicide back in 2019. He had been awaiting trial for allegedly creating a child sex trafficking ring with Ghislaine Maxwell. In December 2023, a federal judge ordered for the court documents to be unsealed, which would reveal the names of dozens of Epstein's associates. In January 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said the documents would be unsealed on a rolling basis.

However, not much was learned from those unsealed documents. In February 2024, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law that made more documents from the 2006 investigation public. Once those documents were released in July 2024, they showed that the prosecutor in the case had painted the alleged underage victims as drug addicts, liars, prostitutes and thieves. Now, it is alleged that there is a 'list of clients' of Epstein that could be released, according to Newsweek. It is rumored that this list could implicate high-profile figures in various sex crimes. JFK's assassination Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, and there are still questions about what happened. He was shot in the back of the head while traveling in a motorcade and was later pronounced dead at Parkland Hospital. Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for murdering a police officer and Kennedy. However, there have been theories that suggest Oswald was a fall guy, and some withheld documents from the government have been fueling speculation that the public doesn't know everything about the 35th president's death.

(RR Auction via AP, File) Trump has said since his election campaign that he would release all remaining documents related to Kennedy's assassination. However, according to The Associated Press in November, even though there are likely many government records that haven't been released, the public should not expect profound revelations. In September 2024, previously unreleased footage showed Kennedy riding in his motorcade right before the video was auctioned off by RR Auction for $137,500. What are the theories related to JFK's assassination? In 2023, actor and director Rob Reiner, who has a podcast series named 'Who Killed JFK,' told NewsNation that he had proof there were four men involved in the assassination. A private investigator who has spent a lot of his life studying Kennedy's assassination told NewsNation he thinks there were two shooters involved. Trump pushes DOGE, tariffs at first Cabinet meeting 'One of those shots was fired too close to the other two to have come from Oswald's rifle,' Josiah Thompson said. He doesn't believe there will ever be a true answer for what happened on that day in Dallas.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jeffrey-epstein-jfk-files-when-release/	2025-02-26T16:21:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201496887.jpg?w=900
Gov. Newsom directs parole board to evaluate Menendez brothers’ c...	Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that he’s ordering the California Board of Parole Hearings to closely examine whether the Menendez brothers pose a risk to public safety if released from prison right now. Newsom made the announcement on his 'This is Gavin Newsom' podcast. 'The question for the board is a rather simple one,' Newsom said during the introductory episode. 'Do Erik and Lyle Menendez pose an unreasonable risk to public safety?' Menendez brothers’ evidence suggesting sexual abuse not credible: LA County DA Public safety experts and forensic psychologists will conduct the risk assessment. According to Eytan Wallace, California Capitol reporter for Nexstar Media, the process starts with experts analyzing what led a person to commit an offense and determining whether they have done the transformational work needed—and gained the skills—to avoid repeating their mistakes. Nexstar Media is the parent company of KTLA 5. Once that’s complete, a hearing will work like a standard parole hearing, providing the District Attorney and the victims a chance to be part of the process. The risk assessment results will be available to the judge presiding over the case and Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman. Newsom’s announcement comes after Hochman announced that his office had issued an informal response requesting the courts deny the brothers’ habeas petition. Chances of Menendez brothers getting out of prison are slim, legal analyst says A habeas petition is a formal challenge to the legality of a conviction. It is often considered a last resort after appeals have been exhausted. If new evidence is deemed sufficient, it could eventually lead to a convict’s release. In October, former DA George Gascón announced that his office would reexamine the case in the light of new evidence, including a letter purportedly written by Erik Menendez just months before he and his brother, Lyle, killed their parents with a shotgun at their Beverly Hills home in 1989. They were 21 and 18 at the time, respectively. The letter details alleged sexual abuse committed by their father, Jose Menendez. Despite the setback from the DA’s office, Newsom has 'unilateral' power to grant the brothers clemency, which would free them immediately. Still, Newsom noted that 'there is no guarantee of outcome here.' Menendez attorney: The ’90s want their DA office back Erik and Lyle Menendez admitted to fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and their mother, Kitty Menendez, after fearing their parents were about to kill them to stop people from finding out that Jose Menendez had sexually abused Erik Menendez for years. The brothers have been in prison for over 30 years after being convicted in 1996. The case has regained national attention since the release of Netflix’s 'The Menendez Brothers' film.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/menendez-brothers-parole-gavin-newsom/	2025-02-26T15:17:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1462355302-1-e1729360247514_b1b20e_99c390.jpg?w=800

The truth is I’m still in shock that such a beautiful young life has come to an end. It seems senseless and unfair. I know your family is brokenhearted as am I and everyone else who knew you. Your spirit moved on to the next phase beyond this life but I know wherever you are there is beauty and light. And the beauty and light you left here will live on forever. Rest in peace, sweet angel… 💔' Guerrero’s family set up a GoFundMe, stating, 'Currently, his family is taking care of his personal belongings and accommodations to bring him home to Houston.' The GoFundMe raised $96,000. Jesus Guerrero’s family shows appreciation After Jenner paid for Guerrero’s body to be flown to Houston (and his funeral), the family noted: 'When this go fund me was set up we created it thinking we would have to take care of all the expenses ourselves. We didn't want to burden any clients with this. Our family deeply appreciates Kylie for later offering to cover funeral expenses and offering up all her help and support. Donations raised through this fundraiser will go toward the costs associated with securing his belongings home. As well as other unexpected expenses to settle his assets. With his death being so unexpected there are many things that weren't set up for a time like this. The next several months will have many hoops we will have to jump through to ensure we honor him in the best way we can. Our mother will be taking time off to ensure that everything gets taken care of and so that she can grieve properly because a mother should never have to bury her child.' Michelle Trachtenberg, ‘Gossip Girl’ and ‘Buffy’ actress, dead at 39 A rep for Jenner and Lopez declined to comment on the record.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/kylie-jenner-jesus-guerrero-jennifer-lopez/	2025-02-26T14:31:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2196370399.jpg?w=900
Ryan Reynolds' image takes hit amid Lively-Baldoni lawsuit; costa...	(NewsNation) — The 'nice guy' in Hollywood may not be so nice after all. Ryan Reynolds has long enjoyed a stellar reputation as a 'good guy,' but with the advent of the 'It Ends With Us' lawsuit he and his wife, Blake Lively, brought against the movie’s producer, director and co-star, Justin Baldoni, that facade is starting to slip. Justin Baldoni's lawsuit takes on Ryan Reynolds with Blake Lively The first shot over the bow came when Baldoni, in his lawsuit against Reynolds and Lively, accused the 'Deadpool' star of becoming unhinged in a meeting. Baldoni claims Reynolds 'berated' him during a heated meeting at the couple's home, where Reynolds 'aggressively' accused Baldoni of a string of offenses against his wife, including 'fat-shaming' her. Hugh Jackman, from left, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Tammy Reynolds, and Brandon Sklenar attend the world premiere of 'It Ends with Us' at AMC Lincoln Square on Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024, in New York. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) According to the lawsuit: 'Baldoni and producers arrived eager to discuss plans for the next day's filming, prepared with their production materials. Instead, they were blindsided by Lively and Reynolds, who presented a list of grievances that were both unanticipated and troubling. 'Reynolds launched into a tirade, berating Baldoni in what Baldoni later described as a 'traumatic' encounter, stating he had 'never been spoken to like that in his life.' Michelle Trachtenberg, ‘Gossip Girl’ and ‘Buffy’ actress, dead at 39 ''When Baldoni resisted apologising for what he had not done, Reynolds became further enraged. Everyone, including the producer Lively had asked production to engage and a representative of Sony that was in attendance, left that 'meeting' in shock. The producer offered that in his 40-year career he had never seen anyone speak to someone like that.' [Reynolds denies he screamed at Baldoni].

Subscribe to her newsletter here. ‘Deadpool’ co-star says Ryan Reynolds was ‘horrifically mean’ Soon after Baldoni’s lawsuit went public, an interview with TJ Miller, Reynolds’ 'Deadpool' co-star, was unearthed. The interview, with Adam Carolla’s podcast, took place two years ago, and in it, Miller accused Reynolds of being 'horrifically mean' during a 'Deadpool 2' shoot and recalled Reynolds telling him: 'Know what's great about you, Weasel? You're not the star, but you do just enough exposition that it's funny, and then we can leave and get back to the real movie.' This image released by 20th Century Studios/Marvel Studios shows Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool/Wade Wilson, left, and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine/Logan in a scene from 'Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.' (20th Century Studios/Marvel Studios via AP) T.J. said at the time, 'Would I work with him again? No. I would not work with him again.' (Miller has since said the two have made up). And then this week, two more damaging interviews came out. Matthew Lawrence on Ryan Reynolds Matthew Lawrence, who starred with Reynolds in 'Boltneck' (1998), said Reynolds had 'creative differences' issues with the Oscar-nominated producers and directors of the movie. Lawrence, on his 'Brotherly Love Podcast,' said: '(Reynolds would) walk out — just kind of wanted to do his thing, and the producers would get really upset.' 'They even told him, ‘Ryan, this is a bad Jim Carrey impersonation. This is not what we hired you to do. You can’t impersonate somebody. You gotta do your own thing.'' This image released by FX shows Ryan Reynolds, left, and Rob McElhenney in a scene from the third season of 'Welcome to Wrexham.' (FX via AP) Reynolds was 'upset' over the criticism and would only say: 'I’m doing my thing.' In 'Boltneck,' Lawrence played a 'science nerd' named Frank Stein, who revives Reynolds’ character’s corpse after he’s killed by a pair of bullies. He claimed the producers wanted the film to mirror a sci-fi thriller like 'Donnie Darko,' but Reynolds was 'trying to ‘Deadpool'' the script. Alec Baldwin’s show ‘The Baldwins’ fails to attract audience 'There was this major pull between one of the lead actors … so that is what my experience with Ryan Reynolds was. … He obviously matured as a human being.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/ryan-reynolds-image-takes-hit-blake-lively-lawsuit/	2025-02-26T14:17:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/12/5095e15c60424fd7ba4a948b1dbe8f7a.jpg?w=900
Brian Laundrie's family calls Gabby Petito documentary one-sided	(NewsNation) — The family of Brian Laundrie says the new Netflix Gabby Petito documentary series is a one-sided look at the relationship of the two young adults. In a statement provided to PEOPLE by the Laundrie family’s attorney, Chris and Roberta Laundrie say the new documentary series 'American Murder: Gabby Petito' did not paint the full picture of what happened. 'The documentary was what we expected. One perspective depicted as the ‘truth’ as seen through their lens. Similar to Republicans and Democrats fighting it out lately. Hard to see through the lens of the other with all the noise and distrust.' Gabby Petito’s parents destroyed her van: ‘We had it crushed’ Petito vanished in 2021 while on a cross-country road trip with Laundrie in a converted camper van. The two became the center of a nationwide investigation after Laundrie returned home without Petito. Petito, a 22-year-old aspiring blogger, documented their journey on social media, specifically through her YouTube channel, before abruptly stopping. Gabby’s Ford Transit Connect was a regular feature in the travel reports she posted online before she disappeared in 2021. Authorities believe she was killed by Laundrie in Wyoming before he killed himself in Florida. Her body was found at a camping area in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming on Sept. 19, 2021, days after a nationwide search was launched. His body was later found near the Carlton Reserve in South Florida on Oct. 20, 2021. The Laundrie family did not participate in the documentary. Gabby Petito’s family speaks with NewsNation ahead of documentary release 'The documentary contained many inaccuracies, incorrect juxtapositions of timelines, and misstatements and omissions of fact — perhaps deliberate to capture their ‘truth’, perhaps due to simple error,' the statement issued to PEOPLE continued. The family, however, acknowledged that Brian Laundrie killed Petito. 'We all know Brian took Gabby’s life and Brian then took his own as well. Let the parents of both Gabby and Brian mourn and remember them in peace.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/gabby-petito-missing-case/brian-laundries-family-calls-gabby-petito-documentary-one-sided/	2025-02-26T14:04:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/02/brian-laundrie-1.jpg?w=900
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy expected to sign minerals deal Frid...	(NewsNation) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is coming to the White House Friday, where he will sign a rare minerals deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday. Trump addressed the deal, which has been a push and pull since the start, before the first Cabinet meeting of his second term on Wednesday. Details are vague but what is known is that the U.S. is requesting revenue from Ukraine's rare minerals, which are used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. Trump has said this is a way for Kyiv to pay back the U.S. for aid sent for the war effort under Democratic President Joe Biden. DOGE’s Elon Musk to visit Fort Knox to ensure gold hasn’t been ‘stolen’ 'The previous administration put us in a very bad position, but we’ve been able to make a deal where we’re going to get the money back and a lot of money in the future,' Trump said. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said at a news conference early Wednesday in Kyiv that a framework of an economic deal had been reached, but it did not yet include the U.S. security guarantees his country sees as vital. The economic agreement 'may be part of future security guarantees, but I want to understand the broader vision. What awaits Ukraine?' Zelensky said. Zelenskyy said he expects a wide-ranging conversation with Trump. 'Today, there has been a lot of international work. Our teams are working with the United States as we prepare for negotiations this Friday,' Zelenskyy said Wednesday on X. 'Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations. I will meet with @POTUS. For me and for all of us in the world, it’s important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace. This comes during a very public feud between Zelenskyy and Trump that initially stemmed from the minerals deal. After Zelenskyy refused the initial framework, Trump called the Ukrainian president a 'dictator without elections.' Zelenskyy, in turn, said Trump is living in a 'disinformation space.' Along with the minerals deal, there's also a push to put an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Trump says the Europeans should provide security — not the United States. Another European leader, French President Emmanual Macron, was in Washington on Monday, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will visit Thursday.

Massachusetts sanctuary cities sue Trump, Feds over funding threa...	(NewsNation) — Two Massachusetts sanctuary cities have filed a lawsuit against several federal officials, including President Donald Trump, alleging the government is attempting to coerce them into the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts. The cities of Chelsea and Somerville filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging the Trump administration’s efforts and arguing that federal officials are threatening to defund local efforts to keep their communities safe. The lawsuit was filed after Trump border czar Tom Homan claimed he was 'coming to Boston and bringing hell with me.' Woman violated in exam room worries medical worker is still on duty The lawsuit, which was filed by city officials who are represented by Lawyers For Civil Rights, argues the administration’s threat of stripping sanctuary cities of federal funding violates the cities’ constitutional rights. 'Public safety is the top priority for the City of Chelsea—we cannot afford to have our residents fear reporting crimes or engaging with local law enforcement, as this undermines the safety of everyone in our community,' Chelsea City Manager Fidel Maltez said in a statement. Chelsea has been a sanctuary city since 2007 and 'is stronger because of our immigrant population, and we will not let fear or misinformation divide us,' the city manager said. Somerville has maintained its sanctuary city status since 1987 and has reaffirmed its commitment to that status three times since 2016, City Council President Judy Pineda Neufeld said. She said the federal government’s attempts to coerce city officials into betraying its immigrant neighbors are 'unconstitutional, morally unacceptable and a danger' to the full community. 'Our city’s values are clear: We will protect the dignity, safety, and rights of all of our residents, regardless of immigration status,' Pineda Neufeld said. 2 people killed by IED; cartel suspected, officials say In fiscal year 2024, Chelsea received about $14.5 million in federal funding, part of which went to education and downtown reconstruction projects. During the same time, Somerville received about $19.4 million in federal money to support a variety of community and public safety services. Those projects include roadway safety initiatives, homelessness prevention services and efforts to address and reduce youth tobacco use and alcohol consumption, the city said. The lawsuit alleges that since taking office in January, Trump’s executive orders have threatened to keep federal funding from sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration agents as part of the mass deportation effort. Homan has visited cities like Chicago, where ICE raids were conducted shortly after Trump’s inauguration, and has targeted cities that push back against federal involvement in immigration enforcement. Maltez, the Chelsea city manager, told GBH News that since Trump took office in January, the city’s downtown district has seen a decline in foot traffic. He said the city received reports of immigration agents being in local businesses. 'And honestly, it created a lot of fear in our community,' Maltez told the local television station. 'We hear from our residents almost every day about how they are scared of walking in our streets.' The lawsuit also names the Department of Justice and Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Kristi Noem and the Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy as defendants. The suit argues Trump’s executive orders have said sanctuary cities will not receive DOJ funding and that the Department of Transportation will deprioritize those cities as well. An email sent from NewsNation to the Department of Homeland Security seeking comment on the lawsuit was not returned. 'The President cannot use federal funding as a weapon to force local governments to undermine public safety and their values and participate in his mass deportation efforts,' Oren Sellstrom, one of the Massachusetts cities’ attorneys, said in a statement. '(The) lawsuit seeks to protect sanctuary and welcoming cities, so they can continue to make public safety decisions that are in the best interests of their residents.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/massachusetts-sanctuary-sue-trump-feds/	2025-02-26T11:25:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP18059615938391-1-e1733323119120_abd0ec.jpg?w=900

Watch live: Elon Musk attends Trump’s first Cabinet meeting	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Elon Musk got a round of applause from President Donald Trump’s Cabinet at its first meeting Wednesday, highlighting the billionaire’s growing influence in the administration. 'We're going to start getting to be at a point where we can think in terms of balancing budgets, believe it or not, something you haven't heard in many many years decades actually,' Trump said to the cabinet. Last year the U.S. deficit almost reached $2 trillion. Trump asked Elon Musk to get up and give some remarks in the cabinet meeting. He said the U.S. cannot continue with $2 trillion deficits and huge amounts of interest on the national debt. 'This is a central' thing. Musk also disclosed he is 'getting a lot of death threats.' Musk said he thinks that there around $1 trillion in savings that can be found. 'We will make mistakes. We won't be perfect,' Musk acknowledged. 'When we make mistakes we will fix it very quickly.' DOGE subcommittee looks at US foreign aid spending 'Some disagree a little bit,' President Trump said of Musk's efforts, but said most are 'thrilled.' Some criticized Musk's presence at the meeting since his role within the administration is nebulous. He was said to be running the Department of Government Efficiency, but the Trump administration said in a legal filing he was not an employee. 'Elon is working with the Cabinet secretaries and their staff every single day to identify waste and fraud and abuse at these respective agencies,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters before the meeting. 'All of the Cabinet secretaries take the advice and direction of DOGE.' Trump won't guarantee Ukraine security The president also told reporters he would not 'make security guarantees beyond very much' for the war-torn country amid its conflict with Russia. 'We're going to have Europe do that because it's in, you know, we're talking about Europe is the next door neighbor,' Trump said. 'But we're going to make sure everything goes well and as you know we'll be making, will be really partnering with Ukraine in terms of rare earth [metals]. We very much need rare earth. They have great rare earth.' Mexico and Canada tariffs are still happening 'I'm not stopping the tariffs' promised for goods from Canada and Mexico, Trump said in response to a question. The 30 day pause on the promised tariffs on both countries ends Monday. The U.S. had paused the implementation of the tariffs as it talked with both countries about what it may be able to do to strengthen border enforcement and drug interdiction. Trump now says the tariffs will begin on April 2. Pentagon to investigate Afghanistan withdrawal Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon is launching an inquiry into the August 201 withdrawal from Afghanistan. 'We are doing a complete review of every single aspect of what happened, the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan,' Hegseth told reporters. Yet-to-be-confirmed nominees face hearings Also on Wednesday, three of Trump’s Cabinet picks — Dean John Sauer, the nominee for Solicitor General; Harmeet Dhillon, nominee for the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights; and Aaron Reitz, nominee for assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s legal policy office — face initial hearings and, if confirmed, would have influence over reproductive health care access nationwide.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-attend-trump-cabinet-meeting/	2025-02-26T09:04:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201499078.jpg?w=900
One person dead as Texas sees worst measles outbreak in 3 decades	(NewsNation) — The number of measles cases across the United States is on the rise, and at least one person with the disease has died in Texas. In Texas alone, the outbreak has grown to 124 cases across nine different counties. The Texas Department of State Health Services said 18 of those patients have been hospitalized. On Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that one person who had been hospitalized with measles died in West Texas. Officials said the death was of an unvaccinated school-aged child, NewsNation local affiliate KXAN wrote. Five of those who have contracted measles were vaccinated, and the rest either were not vaccinated or their status was unknown, according to the department. Social Security to increase monthly benefits for millions Texas health officials are saying this is the worst outbreak the state has seen in three decades. The virus has also been reported in Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Rhode Island. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is providing technical assistance, laboratory support and vaccines as needed, the agency said. What is measles? Measles is an airborne disease caused by a virus that spreads when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It is highly contagious and can cause serious health complications, especially in children younger than 5 years old, the CDC says. Symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, red, watery eyes or a rash. Populations with high vaccination rates, above 95%, have herd immunity, meaning the disease is harder to spread, one pediatrician told NewsNation. No taxes on tips closer to reality with multiple pathways 'I don't think there is a major concern that it's going to be a pandemic like we saw in coronavirus,' said Dr. Joel 'Gator' Warsh. 'Most people are vaccinated or had measles, so the likelihood of it spreading in that way is pretty small. We've had many smaller-ish outbreaks in the last 10 or 20, years, and they generally don't get huge.' Newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has not publicly spoken about the current measles outbreak. Kennedy has been branded a vaccine skeptic, and his positions have sparked concern, particularly due to a growing vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. following the COVID-19 pandemic. Kennedy's supporters, however, say his positions only further the conversation about doing more long-term research on vaccines.

DOGE subcommittee to look at US foreign aid spending	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The House subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency will meet Wednesday to examine U.S. foreign aid spending. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., chairwoman of the subcommittee, said the hearing comes as Americans are 'shocked' to discover how their taxpayer dollars have been spent overseas. The subcommittee has said it will 'expose egregious foreign aid spending that has undermined U.S. interests, review proposed reforms, and aid the Trump Administration’s efforts to rein in America’s bloated bureaucracy.' Social Security Administration closes Office of Transformation The hearing follows the Department of Government Efficiency's downsizing of the U.S. Agency for International Development as the Trump administration works to dismantle the agency that oversees foreign aid and development programs. Democrats are expected to question three witnesses, including Max Primorac, a Heritage Foundation research fellow who formerly served as USAID’s chief operating officer and is expected to argue that foreign aid organizations have weakened the U.S. influence. 'What I will do is show how the woke agenda harmed the American brand name. It made us synonymous with values that are rejected by most of the world,' Primorac told the Daily Signal. The hearing will begin at 11 a.m. ET. Democrats defend aid amid USAID cuts USAID is likely to be a major topic at the hearing. The agency has laid off thousands of workers and cut programs worldwide as the Trump administration continues its efforts to crack down on government spending. A source shared a message with NewsNation that was sent to employees warning them to pack up in 15 minutes and to not bring any weapons. 2 people killed, 1 injured by IED; cartel suspected, officials say USAID has seen its Washington, D.C., headquarters shuttered over the last month as thousands of its programs have collapsed worldwide. While Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have criticized USAID for wasteful spending and pushing a liberal agenda, Democrats argue agencies like USAID play a critical role in maintaining U.S. influence abroad. 'We got the best military in the world, but we also have diplomacy, and we also have our international allies, our friends,' said Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas. 'But also, one big tool that the U.S. has is soft power. That is, being able to provide assistance to countries ... it's in our best interest.' DOGE staffers resign over cuts Amid the turmoil at DOGE, 21 staffers resigned Tuesday in protest of the widespread cuts the agency is spearheading, refusing to comply with the downsizing effort. The employees, formerly with the U.S. Digital Services department, wrote in a letter, 'We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans' sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,' as first reported by the Associated Press. In response, Musk labeled the staffers as 'political holdovers' and claimed they would have been fired if they had not resigned. DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for Federal workers 'do not deserve' a paycheck: Marjorie Taylor Greene Greene has recently come under fire for saying federal workers 'do not deserve' their paychecks. 'Those jobs are paid for by the American tax people who work real jobs, earn real income, pay federal taxes, and then pay these federal employees. Federal employees do not deserve their jobs. Federal employees do not deserve their paychecks,' she said Tuesday during a House committee meeting. Greene earns $174,000 annually as a member of Congress. Amy Gleason named interim DOGE chief Meanwhile, questions remain about the leadership of DOGE. The White House confirmed that Amy Gleason, a former U.S. Digital Services official, is the interim administrator of the agency. A recent court filing indicated that Musk is not in charge but serves as a senior advisor to the president.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-subcommittee-foreign-aid/	2025-02-26T04:41:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Leading-USAID_022119_AP_Fernando-Vergara.jpg?w=900
Palm Beach, Florida hospital attack 'shouldn't have happened:' Nu...	PALM BEACH, Fla. (NewsNation) — Dr. Cindy Joseph, whose mom, nurse Leelamma Lal, was brutally attacked at a Florida hospital, said she's 'really disappointed in the system,' calling the incident preventable. Joseph told NewsNation's Ashleigh Banfield that her own experience working in health care has led her to expect the worst at times, but ultimately, she says, 'This shouldn't have happened.' US consumer confidence drops by most since August 2021 'My mom's been working there for 20+ years; she's devoted her entire career to the hospital. The fact that this happened at a health care facility which should have proper security is beyond me,' Joseph said on 'Banfield.' Suspect facing attempted murder charges after attacking Florida nurse Stephen Scantlebury is facing attempted murder charges after allegedly attacking Lal at the hospital where he was being cared for, essentially breaking every bone in Lal's face, police said. According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, deputies were dispatched to an aggravated battery incident in a patient’s room at Palms West Hospital on Feb. 18. Scantlebury has been arrested and is undergoing medical clearance, NewsNation affiliate WJW reported. On Feb. 20, the sheriff’s department, in an update on social media, wrote that a hate crime enhancement had been added to the existing charge of attempted second-degree murder. New search to begin for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: Reports 'Hate crime enhancements, if proven, can result in harsher penalties upon conviction. They highlight the motive behind the defendant’s actions and their broader impact on the community,' the post said. According to PEOPLE, police affidavits obtained by Florida media outlets described how Scantlebury allegedly jumped on top of his bed and then onto the nurse and attacked her. It went on to state that 'essentially every bone in the victim’s face is broken,' and additionally, the victim would likely lose the use of both of her eyes. 911 calls released after Palm Beach, Florida nurse attacked by patient 'Did he hurt someone with the scissors?' a dispatcher asked. 'Yes,' the caller responded. 'He stabbed a nurse?' the dispatcher asked. 'Yes,' the caller responded, as the dispatcher asked where the nurse was.

Who is Amy Gleason, the new DOGE acting administrator?	(NewsNation) — The White House confirmed Tuesday that Amy Gleason is serving as the acting administrator for the Department of Government Efficiency, the new agency created by President Donald Trump. A White House official said that Gleason, a former U.S. Digital Service official, now leads the department that Trump established via executive order after taking office in January. Questions about DOGE's leadership emerged after the White House stated in a court filing that Elon Musk, despite being widely reported as leading the department's cost-cutting efforts, is technically not part of the agency. According to Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, Musk is an employee of the 'White House Office' and serves as senior adviser to the president.

Gleason has been a senior adviser at the U.S. Digital Service since January 2025, according to her LinkedIn profile. The service, created under the Obama administration to modernize government technology infrastructure, was renamed the U.S. DOGE Service after Trump's inauguration. Per her Linkedin profile, she previously worked as a digital services expert at USDS from October 2018 to December 2021, serving under both the Biden administration and during Trump's first term. According to an archived White House page, Gleason's career began in nursing before she transitioned to health care technology. The Obama administration recognized her as a 'Champion of Change' for her work improving healthcare technology, including the digitization of medical records. Before joining the federal government, Gleason served as vice president for research at the Cure JM Foundation for nearly five years. She was also co-founder, chief operating officer and chief strategy officer for CareSync, per the biography on the White House site. 21 staffers in office overtaken by DOGE resign What is DOGE doing? DOGE was created by Trump under an executive order in an effort to 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. More than 20 staffers who worked in the federal department overtaken by DOGE resigned Tuesday, saying they won’t use their technical skills to jeopardize Americans’ data and compromise essential government systems. Members of DOGE have been going into federal agencies, looking at their budgets and tapping into computer systems. The Associated Press recently reported that DOGE gained access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security systems. DOGE agents also gained access to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency said this month. New York Magazine reported at least one DOGE worker has been to the Commerce Department’s Maryland headquarters, where they gained access to the agency’s IT system. In addition, DOGE took control of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s funding, locked out workers, accessed classified information and removed leadership.

2 people killed by IED; cartel suspected: Officials	(NewsNation) — A 74-year-old Texas rancher and one other person were killed and a third person was injured by what authorities said was an improvised explosive device planted by a cartel close to the U.S.-Mexico border. The rancher died near Brownsville, Texas, but was killed on the Mexican side of the border, said Sid Miller, the Texas Agriculture commissioner, in a statement Tuesday. Miller's office told NewsNation that the incident took place earlier this month. The rancher, Antonio Céspedes Saldierna, ranched on both sides of the border. Saldierna ran over an IED — which authorities suspect was planted by a drug cartel — in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, Miller's office confirmed to NewsNation. The blast also killed Horacio Lopez Peña, and Lopez’s wife, Ninfa Griselda Ortega, sustained injuries and has been hospitalized. 'This shocking act of violence highlights the growing threat posed by cartel activity along our southern border,' Miller said. 'I urge all Texas farmers, ranchers, and agricultural workers who travel to Mexico or operate near the border to exercise extreme caution.' Southwest Airlines plane has near-collision with jet at Midway Airport Miller referred to the incident as 'tragic and alarming.' Miller encouraged everyone working in the agricultural industry in the Lower Rio Grande Valley to remain aware of their surroundings and to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement. In a separate statement, Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham said these violent acts should be condemned at the highest level. She added that officials have been talking about the cartels' use of IEDs for years and warned that they threaten the safety and security of American citizens and must be brought to an end. 'Unfortunately, extreme violence, including the use of IEDs, has become more common over the last few years as cartels were emboldened by weak leadership in Washington, D.C.,' Buckingham, a Republican, said. 'I encourage all Texans to remain vigilant and cautious. Rest assured, the newly elected Trump Administration and the State of Texas will use all means necessary to bring an end to the cartel’s grip over South Texas.' Law enforcement officials in the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas previously acknowledged the existence of IEDs and have warned communities along the border to exercise caution, especially in agricultural fields. Authorities indicated that the threats are linked to criminal organizations operating in the region. Miller called the Lower Rio Grande Valley a 'crucial part' of the state's agricultural industry. He said the safety of those working in the industry is of utmost importance. 'We cannot overlook the rising violence that threatens not only lives but also the security of our farms, ranches and rural communities,' Miller said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/texas-rancher-killed-ied-cartel/	2025-02-25T11:45:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a15d5517b431.86435320.jpeg?w=900
Judge gives Trump administration two days to release billions of ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday gave the Trump administration less than two days to release billions of dollars in U.S. foreign aid, saying the administration had given no sign of complying with his nearly two-week-old court order to ease its funding freeze. The lawsuit was filed by nonprofit organizations over the cutoff of foreign assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development and State Department, which followed a Jan. 20 executive order by President Donald Trump targeting what he portrayed as wasteful programs that do not correspond to his foreign policy goals. Nonprofit groups and businesses that receive federal money for work abroad said the freeze breaks federal law and has shut down funding for even the most urgent life-saving programs abroad. Those USAID and State partners say the administration has stiffed them on billions of dollars in money already owed, forcing them to lay off tens of thousands of staffers and pushing some organizations toward financial ruin. U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali on Feb. 13 had ordered the administration at least temporarily to get funding flowing again, including to make good on its bills. Despite the order, USAID staffers and the businesses and nonprofit groups say they know of no payments that have gotten through. 'I’m not sure why I can’t get a straight answer from you on this: Are you aware of an unfreezing of the disbursement of funds for those contracts and agreements that were frozen before Feb. 13,' the judge asked Indraneel Sur, the lawyer for the government. 'Are you aware of steps taken to actually release those funds?' 'I’m not in a position to answer that,' Sur said. The case had been brought by the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, representing health organizations receiving U.S. funds for work abroad. They had asked Ali to find the Trump administration in contempt of his earlier order. It’s the second time a judge has found the Trump administration did not follow a court order. U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island also found this month that the administration had not fully unfrozen federal grants and loans within the U.S., even after he blocked sweeping plans for a pause on trillions of dollars in government spending.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-judge-gives-trump-administration-two-days-to-unfreeze-funds-for-us-foreign-aid/	2025-02-25T11:23:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67be19ba0e2ca4.37025492.jpeg?w=900

(NewsNation) — A Southwest Airlines plane and private jet almost collided at Midway Airport in Chicago, Illinois on Tuesday morning. Video footage shows the Southwest plane making its way down the runway, when another aircraft comes in front of it. However, the crew of Southwest Flight 2504 initiated a 'go-round,' allowing the plane to avoid hitting the jet, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement to NewsNation. The business jet entered the runway without authorization around 8:50 a.m., the FAA said. It is now investigating. DOGE’s Elon Musk to visit Fort Knox to ensure gold hasn’t been ‘stolen’ The FAA is also looking into a number of other incidents involving planes that happened this year, including the deadly collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and Black Hawk military helicopter. All 67 people on board those aircraft died. A military plane crashed into the San Diego Bay; a plane crashed in Alaska and a medical jet crashed in Philadelphia in the first few weeks of 2025 as well. Six people, including one child, were on board and killed in the Philadelphia crash. One person on the ground died, too. Last Wednesday, a midair collision involving two small planes in southern Arizona killed two people. This story is developing.

Social Security Administration closes Office of Transformation	(NewsNation) — The Social Security Administration announced Monday that it closed its Office of Transformation and that employees who worked there will be put on administrative leave. In a statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek called it a 'redundant' office. 'President (Donald) Trump has mandated the Federal government eliminate wasteful and inefficient offices and the Office of Transformation was a prime example,' Dudek said. Elon Musk gives federal workers ‘another chance’ to justify jobs The Office of Transformation, according to its website, is responsible for 'strategic guidance and oversight of enterprise-wide initiatives, addressing policies, business processes and systems.' It also plans and coordinates projects involving customer service-related systems and projects. NewsNation has reached out to the Social Security Administration’s Press Office for more information, including how many employees are now on leave and what aspects of the office were wasteful. Last week, the Social Security Administration said it did an 'organizational realignment of the functions provided by its Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight. The administration said moving these functions allowed the agency to streamline layers of management; increase data sharing and 'speed the opportunities to identify fraud, waste, and abuse and implement needed solutions.' The Trump administration and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have been working on cutting spending at federal agencies, as well as its workforce, through the Department of Government Efficiency Monday’s announcement by the SSA didn’t specifically mention DOGE, but Dudek did in a Feb. 19 statement after being confirmed by the Senate. He called it a 'critical part' of Trump’s agenda. DOGE has been controversial as some express concern that its cuts have gone too far and warn they could have negative effects on everyday citizens. In addition, experts have criticized DOGE by saying most of the 'savings' it has touted are driven more by ideological views than economic ones. While DOGE claims it found $55 billion in savings, touting layoffs, canceled contracts and lease renegotiations so far, a closer examination raises doubts about these numbers. On its website, DOGE lists these savings but has not provided evidence for approximately $38 billion of that — nearly 75% of its total claim, NewsNation has previously reported. Another analysis by The Associated Press showed that nearly 40% of the federal contracts the Trump administration says its canceled aren’t expected to save the government any money.

Authorities crack down on gun smuggling to cartels	(NewsNation) — As the Trump administration continues to focus on the U.S.-Mexico border, authorities are ramping up efforts to combat gun smuggling. The decision comes just after the State Department officially designated several cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. That has raised fears of military action in Mexico and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has warned the U.S. not to invade. Meanwhile, Mexican cartels continue to rely on American firearms to supply their arsenal. Escobar: Turning bases into deportation hubs hurts military readiness These weapons are purchased and transported even through legal ports of entry before winding up in the hands of cartels. Customs and Border Protection officers in Nogales, Arizona, recently seized 42 AK-47-style rifles in a cargo truck prior to the truck going through the port of entry and into Mexico. The port director there said, 'These powerful weapons were likely headed to cartels to protect their illicit fentanyl labs.' Retired Homeland Security agent Victor Avila told NewsNation that cartels use straw purchasers, individuals with clean records who can legally buy firearms, to purchase the guns and then smuggle them into Mexico. Now that cartels are officially designated as terror organizations those individuals could face harsher legal consequences. Trump to reinstate Title 42 border policy: Report 'Now you're providing weapons to a terrorist, just like if you were buying a gun for ISIS,' Avila said. 'You're now buying it for the Sinaloa Cartel, same exact thing. So those individuals can now be treated very differently.' Also in Arizona, a task force of federal and local authorities arrested two weapons smugglers, seizing nine guns and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition that were set for delivery to transnational criminal organizations in Mexico, according to Tuscon sector Border Patrol agents. Also on the border in Sonora, Mexico, officials are now discovering a scout site use for human smuggling, seizing two rifles and more than 800 rounds of ammunition. With Trump designating cartels as FTOs, Sheinbaum has fired back at the administration, saying U.S. authorities need to step up enforcement in curbing the flow of those firearms headed to Mexico. 14 indicted for alleged role in ‘prolific’ migrant smuggling operation She is now working on constitutional reforms in Mexico to expand and crack down on foreigners involved in gun smuggling. Sheinbaum says those reforms will call for the highest penalties to be applied to foreigners found guilty of gun smuggling. She's arguing that if cartels are terrorists, those supplying the weapons should be held accountable for aiding terrorism. While the majority of guns used by cartels are coming from the U.S., Avila told NewsNation that the military-grade weapons they use are still being acquired through the Mexican military.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/crack-down-gun-cartels/	2025-02-25T09:49:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/672e9e378cefa2.02033843.jpeg?w=900
Terror designation might prompt cartels to target Americans: Expe...	EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – The White House on Feb. 20 designated eight Latin American transnational criminal gangs as foreign terrorist organizations. They include Mexican drug cartels flooding American communities with fentanyl and other drugs, and Central and South American street gangs like MS-13 and Tren de Aragua linked to violent acts in the United States. The designation empowers the Treasury Department and U.S. law enforcement to aggressively target financial resources these groups utilize to produce their product, wage war on each other and authorities, and terrorize civilians in their home countries. Did Elon Musk’s AI tool Grok 3 censor criticism of Trump? But it does not mean the American public will soon see the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division parachuting into mountains in Mexico or the Navy SEALs knocking down doors on cartel leaders’ mansions in Guadalajara, an international security expert says. 'You may have some advisers physically on the ground working with Mexican law enforcement, the military, army, navy, etc. But if they’re good advisers, you won’t even see them or hear about them,' said Michael Ballard, director of Intelligence for Global Guardian LLC. 'You are not going to have (an American) up front, putting the handcuffs on ‘El Mencho.’ It is going to be a Mexican security or law enforcement official doing that.' Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, aka 'El Mencho,' is the founder of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, or CJNG. Nonetheless, the terror group designation and Mexico’s newfound willingness to give U.S. law enforcement more leeway south of the border will weigh heavily on the leaders of criminal organizations. It might even back them into a corner – which could pose risks for American officials and visitors to Mexico. 'You can view it as cooperation by coercion,' Ballard said of news reports, recently confirmed by the president of Mexico, of American drones flying south of the border and U.S. spy planes operating off the coast of Sinaloa. 'Twenty-five percent tariffs on exports were initially levied on Mexico and then suspended for 30 days pending more border security by the Mexican government; they agreed to deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to the border to help shore up security there.' President Claudia Sheinbaum last week emphasized the drones and U.S. planes were authorized by Mexico as part of binational cooperation. She also sent to her Congress a proposed constitutional amendment to criminalize unauthorized foreign incursions or activities in Mexico. 'The threat of tariffs seems to be a very effective kind of bargaining by the Trump administration to get what they want,' Ballard said. 'But I would guess at least for the first year, the drone flyovers, reconnaissance planes, the U.S. assistance with wiretapping, with electronic device intercepts ... that’s going to be the extent of it.' U.S. companies, visitors might get caught in the crossfire Trump’s executive order on cartels stems from statutes dating back to the 9/11 terror attacks, which the George W. Bush administration used to go after Al-Qaida. He targeted bank accounts and other property the group and its wide network of supporters used to launder money, buy weapons, vehicles and food for its operatives. 'It’s going to give FBI, DEA, CIA more levers they can pull going after shell companies and anyone helping them launder money – knowingly or unknowingly,' Ballard said. 'A lot of businesses that operate in Mexico are going to have to be very careful and scrutinize their operations to make sure they are not inadvertently breaking these new laws.' Fines are already in the books to prosecute Americans inadvertently engaging in international money laundering. The terror designation now could mean jail time, he said.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Also, the subsidiaries of American companies in Mexico occasionally have been targeted for extortion by local criminals threatening to disrupt their operations or harm their employees. From now on, giving in to those threats could be interpreted as funding a terrorist organization, Ballard said. Further, if the U.S. and Mexico begin to inflict serious damage on cartel finances or jailing many of its leaders, there’s always the risk that these groups will lash back. Worst-case scenario 'What are the cartels going to do? That is the big question everyone has,' Ballard said. 'My worst-case scenario is these cartels have a lot of money, lot of firepower, a lot of armored vehicles. [….] You could see these groups morph into an insurgency a la FARC and ELN in Colombia. Those groups started as insurgencies, as guerilla groups and used drugs to fund their militancy. You could see the same but in reverse with drug trafficking groups turn into militant groups.' More likely, if backed into a corner and laying low no longer serving a practical purpose, Mexican cartels could experience further fracturing and discard restraints on kidnappings and extortion. 'You could see some of these cartels targeting American businesspeople or travelers in a way they were previously afraid to do,' Ballard said. 'If your assets, your operations get disrupted, you may feel like, ‘What do I have to lose? The attention of U.S. is already here. We are already public enemy No. 1.’' Trump to reinstate Title 42 border policy: Report The private security expert says he has not yet seen indications that will come to pass. But Global Guardian is urging corporations and travelers to monitor the situation in Mexico. 'Be cautious, keep track of what is going on, especially if you’re traveling to cartel heavy areas. Mexico City has its share of crime but no cartels controlling street violence or trafficking. But Guadalajara sits in the CJNG area of influence. If you go there, consider extra security,' Ballard said. Tourist destinations should still be relatively safe during spring break. 'Mexico still depends to a significant degree on foreign dollars,' he said. 'If we start seeing rhetoric that they’re going to start targeting Americans, our messaging will change accordingly.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/cartels-terror-designation/	2025-02-25T08:35:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP21310015365861.jpg?w=900
Republicans have doubts about whether House budget bill can get v...	(NewsNation) — Although President Donald Trump has called it a 'big, beautiful bill,' Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm over a budget plan pursued by the House that could come up for a vote as soon as Tuesday. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., has told reporters it is increasingly likely lawmakers will need to pass a stopgap bill to keep the government funded into the fall. House Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing for the bill — and jokingly asking for prayers as negotiations continue. At an event in Louisiana, however, he maintained confidence that 'we're going to get everyone there.' DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for Still, there are some doubts it can go forward. Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., told NewsNation partner The Hill that 'there’s probably 10 (Republicans) that are really nervous about the situation.' A trio of Republicans, per The Hill, have said they will vote against the proposal. Supporters of the bill say it fulfills Trump's campaign promises and addresses his full agenda — including extending his 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of the year. It would also provide about $300 billion in additional spending for the border and defense. However, the legislation also calls for up to $2 trillion in spending cuts, without laying out exactly what those would entail, along with a debt limit increase. The lack of detail about the potential cuts has some worried Medicaid is not off the table. Trump’s plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be costly 'I know the president has already indicated that he does not want to cut from beneficiaries,' Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., said. 'That's important for me to hear. The speaker has said the same. But then the question remains — how do we get to that $880 billion in savings, and what does it mean for the tax cuts?' Democrats have slammed the tax cuts, saying they would only benefit the wealthy, but they have not put forward alternative legislation. Instead, they are working with the House Appropriations Committee on a bill that would temporarily avoid a government shutdown before the March 14 deadline.

Musk gives federal workers ‘another chance’ to justify jobs	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk on Monday said hundreds of thousands of federal employees have 'another chance' to justify their recent accomplishments or risk losing their jobs. 'Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance. Failure to respond a second time will result in termination,' he wrote on social media, referring to an email asking federal employees to list five things they accomplished last week by 11:59 p.m. Monday. The directive appeared to contradict guidance from the Office of Personnel Management, which told federal departments and agencies responses were voluntary. Multiple federal agencies had instructed employees to disregard Musk's initial email, at least temporarily. There is no word yet on how many federal workers complied with the original directive. Federal workers rattled by Musk's ultimatum Musk, who oversees the Department of Government Efficiency, sent an email to hundreds of thousands of federal employees Saturday, giving them roughly 48 hours to report five specific things they had accomplished during the week prior. In a separate message posted on social media, Musk said any employee who failed to respond by the deadline — set in the email as 11:59 p.m. EST Monday — would lose their job. The OPM issued a memo Monday to federal departments and agencies, clarifying that it was not mandatory for workers to respond to the email. Could DOGE layoffs at the IRS impact your tax return? The office later clarified individual agencies must decide if they require responses and to determine the consequences of those who fail to do so. It added that agencies should consider whether the 'accomplishment bullets' should be integrated into the agency's weekly activity report. President Donald Trump signaled his support of Musk early Monday. Federal workers blast Musk-caused 'chaos' Musk’s unusual demand has faced resistance from several key U.S. agencies led by the president’s loyalists — including the FBI, State Department, Homeland Security and the Pentagon — which instructed their employees over the weekend not to comply. Lawmakers in both parties said that Musk’s mandate may be illegal, while unions are threatening to sue. Amid federal budget cuts, NewsNation has received messages from workers affected by the layoffs, with some departments letting longtime workers go. One federal worker from the Department of Health and Human Services shared an email with NewsNation they received at 5 p.m. ET Monday night. 'No HHS expectation that HHS employees respond to OPM and there is no impact to your employment with the agency if you choose not to respond,' the email read. Federal workers sue Elon Musk over email ultimatum However, if employees did respond, they were advised to tailor their answers as if 'malign foreign actors' might read them. A Veterans Affairs worker told NewsNation that some nurses came in on their day off Monday, bringing their children, to fill out the required bullet points. These workers were unable to access email from home due to firewall restrictions, creating anxiety about possible consequences. One VA worker expressed concern about how these changes could impact veterans’ services. 'Making efficient is one thing, shrinking and crippling is another,' the employee said. 'Ultimately, they are taking away protection and support for Americans. That is what I am most concerned about.'

Menendez brothers' evidence suggesting sexual abuse not credible:...	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman fired back at Mark Geragos, the Menendez brothers‘ attorney, dismissing his criticism and doubling down on his rejection of new evidence in the case. 'These new pieces of evidence add nothing to the self-defense argument. They are only additional information,' Hochman said Monday during an exclusive appearance on 'Banfield.' 'To meet the rigorous standards to get a new trial, this evidence doesn't come close.' What is the new evidence in the Menendez brothers' case? Hochman told reporters the evidence featured in the brothers’ habeas corpus petition had been made public for years prior. Their lawyers filed the petition in May of 2023, asking a judge to consider evidence suggesting they were sexually abused by their father. Last week, Geragos accused Hochman of rehashing outdated prosecutorial platitudes: 'The ’90s were calling, and they wanted their DA’s office back,' he said. A hearing about the resentencing was scheduled for January but postponed until March due to the wildfires in the Los Angeles region. Menendez brothers found guilty of murder in 1989 Lyle and Erik Menendez were found guilty of murdering their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The brothers have spent nearly 35 years behind bars. Erik Menendez (C) and his brother Lyle (L) are pictured, on August 12, 1991 in Beverly Hills.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) At the brothers' original trials, their defense attorneys argued that they had been sexually abused by their father. Prosecutors denied that and accused them of killing their parents for money. In the years that followed, they repeatedly appealed their convictions without success. Since then, the brothers have had the support of most of their extended family, who have said they deserve to be free after decades behind bars. Several family members have said that, in today's world — which is more aware of the impact of sexual abuse — the brothers would not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life.

DOGE's Elon Musk to visit Fort Knox to ensure gold hasn't been 's...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump said during his speech at the CPAC conference that Elon Musk will be reviewing Fort Knox, the depository in Kentucky for American gold reserves, to ensure that gold still exists there. 'We're going to open up the doors. We're going to inspect Fort Knox,' Trump said. 'I don't want to open it and the cupboards are bare.' Inside Texas DPS’ war on human, drug smuggling According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, an audit is done on Fort Knox every year, and 'all the gold is present and accounted for.' What is the Fort Knox depository? The United States Bullion Depository, located at Fort Knox in Kentucky, has stored reserves for the United States since 1937. It is also used as the Army's human resources command center and is where the largest annual training for the Army is held each summer. Fort Knox is about 35 miles south of Louisville, Kentucky, and is over 100,000 acres. It was created during World War I as Camp Knox, an artillery range named after Major General Henry Knox, according to the Kentucky Historical Society Foundation. During World War II, the Army created the Armored Force there, ordering thousands of soldiers to go to Fort Knox and be introduced to the tank. It was known as the 'Home of Cavalry and Armor' for almost 80 years, according to The Associated Press. Elon Musk’s underground digital detective reveals all to NewsNation Then, in 2005, the Armor Center and School was moved to Georgia, and the Human Resource Command Center of Excellence was created in Fort Knox. How much gold is at Fort Knox? According to the United States Mint, the amount of gold holdings at Fort Knox currently adds up to 147.3 million ounces, with half of the Treasury's stored gold being kept there. The only gold that has ever been removed was extremely small to test the purity during the regularly scheduled audits. Those samples are the only gold from Fort Knox that has been transferred to or from the depository for years. The gold's book value is currently at $42.22 per ounce. The depository has about $436 billion worth of gold, according to Forbes. However, the government says the value of gold at Fort Knox is only $6 billion. Is Fort Knox secure? The depository is seen as extremely secure, with no one person having knowledge of every single procedure to open the vault, according to The Associated Press.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images) The only things that are publicly known include when the facility was built and how it was made. In 1936, the depository was made with 16,000 cubic feet of granite, 4,200 cubic yards of concrete, 750 tons of reinforcing steel and 670 tons of structural steel. It is heavily guarded and has only allowed visitors three separate times. One visit was on Sept. 23, 1974, when the vault was opened to journalists and a congressional delegation. Before this, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the only person to access the vaults. The second visit was on Aug. 24, 2017, when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin and congressional representatives visited. Why is Elon Musk visiting Fort Knox? The main reason is to see if the gold is still there. Starting last week, Musk posted on X, questioning if the gold was still present: 'Who is confirming that gold wasn't stolen from Fort Knox? Maybe it's there, maybe it's not. That gold is owned by the American public! We want to know if it's still there.' Federal workers sue Elon Musk over email ultimatum While there has been no evidence of missing gold at Fort Knox up to this point, Musk still posted on X, saying that there should be a live video walkthrough of the depository. Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday that it would be easy to have Fort Knox audited if that's what Trump wants. 'The gold was there when I visited it, and I hope nobody's moved it. I'm sure they haven't,' he added. Is this visit part of Elon Musk's DOGE initiatives? This visit doesn't seem directly related to the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) initiative to cut government spending.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-elon-musk-fort-knox-visit/	2025-02-24T14:21:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-515113728.jpg?w=900
Vivek Ramaswamy announces campaign for Ohio governor	(NewsNation) — Tech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy launched his campaign for Ohio governor on Monday. The Cincinnati native joins Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and Heather Hill in the 2026 GOP primary race to succeed term-limited Gov. Mike DeWine. The candidates are running the former bellwether state that has shifted red in recent years, having voted for President Donald Trump in the last three elections. On Monday Trump gave Ramaswamy his 'COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT' in a Truth Social post that reads in part: 'I know him well, competed against him, and he is something SPECIAL. He's Young, Strong, and Smart!' DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for Ramaswamy has never run for public office in Ohio but is positioned to be a party favorite for the governor's seat with his connections to Trump and Vice President JD Vance, formerly an Ohio senator. Ramaswamy has already received support from many politicians including Republican Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose. Ramaswamy sought the 2024 GOP nomination for president before dropping out to endorse Trump. Musk’s DOGE moves will ‘turn out more Democrats than Obama’: Carville He was later tapped to co-chair the Department of Government Efficiency with Elon Musk but then withdrew from the position, saying the job would hold him back from campaigning.

Could DOGE layoffs at the IRS impact your tax return?	(NewsNation) — The IRS has laid off 6,700 workers as part of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's goals with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These aren't the only federal workers that have been laid off, but one of the biggest questions Americans have right now is, 'Will the IRS layoffs impact my tax returns?' It is hard to know for sure. Adam Brewer, a tax attorney with AB Tax Law, told NewsNation that it's 'not an ideal time for layoffs.' However, he doesn't believe that it will affect many Americans, especially those who file electronically. Federal workers sue Elon Musk over email ultimatum These layoffs are happening as IRS employees who were involved in tax season were told earlier in February that they would not be allowed to accept the buyout offer from the Trump administration until mid-May, after the taxpayer-filling deadline. How could your tax return be impacted by IRS layoffs? If you file your return electronically, instead of by paper, then these layoffs might not affect your returns. 'Those taxpayers who always file by paper, I would say this is the year to cut that out,' Brewer said. 'You need to get with the times, so to speak.' Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told reporters that this could be a 'disaster for revenue.' According to the Associated Press, Williamson said, 'When you underpay and understaff the IRS, the agency doesn't have the power or the resources it needs to go after wealthy tax evaders with their high-priced lawyers.' Former President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, giving the IRS $80 billion and the ability to hire thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement. Are tax refund delays possible after IRS layoffs? Democrats from the Senate Finance Committee have warned about possible tax refund delays. In a statement, they said, 'Staffing reductions at the IRS resulting from Trump's hiring freeze and potential layoffs would likely delay tax refunds, harm taxpayer service and undermine law enforcement efforts.' Idaho judge unseals Bryan Kohberger closed hearing transcripts On the other hand, Brewer told NewsNation that, if you are someone who files electronically and receives your refund through direct deposit, there most likely won't be a delay. 'But, let's not take our eye off the ball. There's also a government shutdown that is possible mid-March. And so, should that happen, you know, that's really above my pay grade,' Brewer said. He also said he is more worried about the potential government shutdown causing delays.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/could-doge-layoffs-irs-impact-tax-return/	2025-02-24T09:30:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/6785723cca55f6.01223281.jpeg?w=900
Trump, Macron expected to discuss Russia-Ukraine war, tariffs	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday amid uncertainty regarding the future of longstanding alliances between the United States and European countries. Trump campaigned on quickly ending the war in Ukraine and has shifted the foreign policy landscape by speaking directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin in defiance of international efforts to freeze Putin out. Trump is conducting the negotiations without input from European leadership or Ukrainian officials and set up a meeting with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia. He has also repeatedly attacked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling the elected leader a dictator. Federal workers sue Elon Musk over email ultimatum Trump has falsely said Ukraine started the war, when it was Russia that invaded the country in February of 2022. Trump has made unprecedented demands on other European countries, including a desire to take over Greenland, which is currently under the control of Denmark, and demanding half of Ukraine's rare earth minerals in exchange for American support in the war and as back pay for previous assistance. He has also made demands in other areas of the world, suggesting the U.S. take over Canada, Gaza and the Panama Canal. There are fears those desires could shift the geopolitical landscape and bring an end to the country's role as a leading force for global stability and as an economic and moral leader. Pentagon investigating UFO whistleblower claims 'The only conclusion you can draw is that 80 years of policy in standing up against aggressors has just been blown up without any sort of discussion or reflection,' said Ian Kelly, a U.S. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administrations and now a professor at Northwestern University. Macron is expected to tell Trump that the U.S. and Europe should not show weakness to Russia and that how the negotiations are handled could impact future U.S. relations with China. However, Trump has long shown a level of respect and support for Putin that separates him from other Western leaders. He has often repeated Russian talking points in his campaign rallies and statements as president. Agriculture secretary will ‘do something’ about egg prices: Trump That has led to fears the European-U.S. alliance could be in jeopardy and sparked concerns of cracks in NATO with global consequences. European leaders meeting with Trump hope to shore up traditional ties and persuade Trump to include them in negotiations regarding Ukraine. Another topic likely to be addressed is Trump's plan for 'reciprocal tariffs' on goods, which his administration is expected to determine on a country-by-country basis. On Thursday, Trump is set to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Inside Texas DPS' war on human, drug smuggling	(NewsNation) — With migrant encounters continuing to trend downward on the border and President Trump pressuring Mexico to crack down on illegal immigration, the southern border isn’t seeing the thousands of migrants arriving like it did just a year ago. But that doesn't mean the crisis is over. There are still thousands of migrants in Mexico stuck in limbo after President Trump ended the CBP One Program. Now, smugglers in Mexico are capitalizing on the desperation of migrants and charging up to $18,000 to be smuggled across the Rio Grande. CBP credits Trump administration for 94% drop in border crossings NewsNation rode along with Texas State Troopers in the Rio Grande Valley, an area seeing an uptick in smuggling with migrants now trying to enter the U.S. undetected while smugglers look to make a sizeable profit. Within NewsNation's first hour with Texas Trooper Guadalupe Casarez, he received an alert from a camera showing individuals entering the U.S. illegally and attempting to hide in the brush. Border Patrol agents and Texas National Guard troops also arrived on the scene. NewsNation followed Casarez as he and BP agents cleared the brush and tracked the individuals' footsteps, eventually leading him to two Mexican nationals lying on the ground, attempting to hide from authorities. The men were handcuffed and said they planned to head to San Antonio. Instead, they could now face charges for smuggling. Border Patrol checked the two migrants closely — looking for tattoos or other signs that could link them to a gang or criminal group. Smugglers in Mexico are now moving in smaller groups, looking for areas not patrolled by Texas Troopers, the National Guard, or Border Patrol — all working together to deter smugglers. Plan for bounty hunters to pursue migrants has controls: Lawmaker In the Rio Grande Valley, Texas DPS troopers and Border Patrol are also working to stop drugs from entering the U.S. Last week, the two agencies intercepted 187 pounds of narcotics, arresting three Mexican nationals in Cameron County. The three men now face prosecution. Texas National Guard troops have arrested and processed migrants who attempted to enter near Roma, Texas, a location that has become a hotspot for migrant and drug smuggling in recent weeks. The goal for authorities here on the border is to stay one step ahead of smugglers in Mexico, who are now seeking to capitalize on the desperation of migrants still in Mexico looking for a way to enter the U.S.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/texas-dps-war-on-smuggling/	2025-02-24T08:05:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Texas-DPS-mounted-1.png?w=900
Idaho judge unseals Bryan Kohberger closed hearing transcripts	(NewsNation) —Transcripts from a closed hearing conducted by attorneys representing the University of Idaho killing suspect Bryan Kohberger were unsealed by an Idaho judge Monday. Ada County Judge Steven Hippler unsealed the 175-page partially redacted transcript of several witness interviews including law enforcement. The deaths of Madison Mogen, Kaylee Gonclaves, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin on Nov. 13, 2022, shocked the small town of Moscow, Idaho. The four students were stabbed in their home, with two of their surviving roommates finding them in the morning. Initially, investigators had few leads and spent considerable time tracing the activities of the four students in the hours prior to their deaths. However, after a little over a month, police arrested Kohberger for the crimes. Kohberger, accused of killing the four University of Idaho students, could face the death penalty if convicted, a judge ruled last November. Attorneys for Kohberger claimed local police detectives were too broad in the search warrant that gave them access to Kohberger’s apartment, car and electronic devices. Those searches led to the discovery of evidence that police say connects Kohberger to the killing of the four students.

Western leaders visit Kyiv and pledge military support against Ru...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — More than a dozen Western leaders attended events in Ukraine on Monday marking the third anniversary of the country's war with Russia, many pledging more military aid in a conspicuous show of support for Kyiv as uncertainty deepened over the commitment of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to helping it fend off Russia’s invasion. The fourth year of fighting could be pivotal, as Trump uses his return to office last month to press for a peace deal. But Ukrainian and European officials have been rattled by his cordial approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his tough words for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. World security is at stake in talks over how the war ends, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned. 'The autocrats around the world are watching very carefully whether there’s any impunity if you violate international borders or invade your neighbor, or if there is true deterrence,' she told a conference in Kyiv. Some observers say Russian success in Ukraine could embolden China’s own ambitions. Just as Moscow claims that Ukraine is rightfully Russian territory, China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own. In a cascade of unwelcome developments for Kyiv, Trump has in recent days called Zelenskyy a dictator, suggested Ukraine is to blame for the war and ended Putin’s three-year diplomatic isolation by the United States. U.S. officials have also indicated to Ukraine that its hopes of joining NATO are unlikely to be realized and that it probably won’t get back the land that Russia’s army has occupied, amounting to nearly 20% of the country. Meanwhile, Putin’s troops are making steady progress on the battlefield while Ukraine is grappling with shortages of troops and weapons. Some of Ukraine’s most important backers, including European leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were among the stream of dignitaries arriving by train in Kyiv. Others spoke at a conference via video link. The guests had similar messages: Ukraine and its European partners must be consulted in any peace negotiations, Putin’s ambitions must be thwarted, and Europe must take on more of the burden for its own defense. Alarm bells sound in Europe as Washington changes course The shift in Washington's policy has set off alarm bells in Europe, where governments fear being sidelined by the U.S. in efforts to secure a peace deal and are mulling how they might pick up the slack of any cut in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The changes have also placed strain on transatlantic relations. European Council President Antonio Costa on Sunday announced that he would convene an emergency summit of the 27 EU leaders in Brussels on March 6, with Ukraine at the top of the agenda. 'We are living a defining moment for Ukraine and European security,' he said in a post on social media. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are to both visit Washington this week. EU foreign ministers on Monday approved a new raft of sanctions against Russia. The measures target Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet' of ships that it uses to skirt restrictions on transporting oil and gas, or to carry stolen Ukrainian grain. The EU said 74 vessels were added to its shadow fleet list. Asset freezes and travel bans were imposed on 83 officials and 'entities' — usually government agencies, banks or companies. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country would provide a 1 billion-euro ($1.04 billion) military systems package to Ukraine this year. Starmer said Ukrainians’ voices 'must be at the heart of the drive for peace,' while Trump’s intervention had 'changed the global conversation' and 'created an opportunity.' 'Russia does not hold all the cards in this war,' he said. Coming off a victory in Sunday’s German elections, conservative leader Friedrich Merz — also a staunch backer of Ukraine — posted on X Monday: 'More than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength.' 'For a fair peace, the country that is under attack must be part of peace negotiations,' he wrote. Diplomacy ramps up after record Russian drone attack On Sunday, Russia launched its biggest single drone attack of the war, pounding Ukraine with 267 drones. The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, insisted that the U.S. cannot seal any peace deal to end the war without Ukraine or Europe being involved. She highlighted what she claimed were pro-Russian positions being taken up by the Trump administration. 'You can discuss whatever you want with Putin. But if it comes to Europe or Ukraine, then Ukraine and Europe also have to agree to this deal,' Kallas told reporters in Brussels, where she was chairing a meeting of EU foreign ministers. Kallas travels to Washington on Tuesday for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Washington and Moscow draw closer U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the third anniversary was 'a grim milestone.' 'More than 12,600 civilians killed, with many more injured. Entire communities reduced to rubble. Hospitals and schools destroyed,' he said in Geneva. Russia's foreign ministry said Saturday that preparations for a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin were underway, and U.S. officials have said that they had agreed with Moscow to reestablish diplomatic ties and restart economic cooperation. Kallas rejected Trump’s earlier inflammatory assertion that Zelenskyy was a dictator for not having held elections after his regular term expired last year, saying, 'Russia hasn’t had elections in 25 years.' Ukrainian law prohibits elections being held while martial law is in place, and Zelenksyy said as recently as Sunday that after martial law is lifted, 'there will be elections and people will make their choice.' ___ Associated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-foreign-leaders-visit-ukraines-capital-to-mark-3rd-war-anniversary/	2025-02-24T05:20:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67bc726ddd5989.49597104.jpeg?w=900
DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — As Elon Musk and the Trump administration increase efforts to reduce the federal government workforce, critics are voicing concerns over the chaotic and seemingly random cuts being made across Washington. However, some Republicans argue this is what voters want from the administration. But as the Department of Government Efficiency announces billions in government budget cuts, the question remains: is it actually saving as much money as it claims? Some of the items listed on DOGE's public listing of the billions of dollars in purported savings don't seem to add up as the agency suggests. DOGE receipts aren't adding up DOGE claims it has found $55 billion in savings, touting layoffs, canceled contracts, lease renegotiations and fraud detection in the first month of the second Trump administration. However, a closer examination of the numbers raises doubts about these claims. The website's listing mentions USAID and the Department of Education as the two largest agencies contributing to contract savings. It even features a 'wall of receipts' showing the reported spending slashes. How much federal data has Trump really purged? Despite claiming billions of dollars in savings, DOGE has not provided evidence for approximately $38 billion of that — nearly 75% of its total claim. For example, DOGE claims to have saved $8 billion by canceling a tech support contract for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Office of Diversity and Civil Rights. However, that contract value was worth just $8 million, with the $8 billion figure likely due to a clerical error from when the government first filed the contract. Despite apparent accounting issues, Republicans continue to voice their support for Musk and DOGE. 'I think American voters like the intensity and focus that they've seen from 30-some days of this administration — going about doing the things they told voters they were going to do. Doing the things they were elected to do,' Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said on 'FOX News Sunday.' 'When you're staring down $36 trillion in debt and counting, obviously something has to give, and I think that's what we're seeing right now. A comprehensive forensic audit of every department and agency in the federal government,' Rep. Mike Lawler, R-NY, said on ABC's 'This Week.' DOGE has stated it will update its savings website twice a week, so corrections could be forthcoming. Poll: Just 37% of Americans think DOGE is cutting waste Several new polls suggest Americans are growing uneasy about DOGE and its results. A poll from Emerson College and the Washington Post shows more Americans disapprove of Musk's handling of DOGE. That's in line with a Pew Research Center poll that puts Musk's favorability rating at 42%. The Washington Post found that just 37% think DOGE is cutting wasteful spending. Elon Musk responds to ‘DOGE check’ suggestion A Morning Consult Pro poll shows that number is even lower, reporting that 31% think shrinking the government should be a top priority for the administration. Musk, Trump float DOGE stimulus checks idea However, that sentiment could change if the administration's proposed plan for DOGE stimulus checks becomes a reality. The plan claims to put as much as 20% of whatever the agency cuts from the federal budget directly into Americans' pockets.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-claims-saved-billions-38b-unaccounted-for/	2025-02-24T04:34:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67abd7fbe34323.91974328.jpeg?w=900
Pope Francis awake, resting after 10th night in hospital	(NewsNation) — Pope Francis woke Monday morning and is resting after spending a 10th night at Gemelli Hospital in Rome, battling early signs of kidney failure, the Vatican said. 'The night went well; the Pope slept and is resting,' the Holy See Press Office said in a one-line statement Monday. The 88-year-old pontiff was hospitalized for bronchitis Feb. 14 and subsequently treated for double pneumonia. He received blood transfusions and high levels of oxygen over the weekend and remains in 'critical condition.' Pope Francis has ‘mild’ kidney failure: What is it? This hospital stay is tied for the longest hospitalization of his papacy. In 2021, Francis spent 10 days at Gemelli Hospital for a partial colon removal, according to the Associated Press. Doctors said their biggest concern now is the risk of germs that could enter his bloodstream and cause sepsis, a life-threatening infection. Medical staff said he will stay hospitalized at least through next weekend.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/pope-francis-10th-night-hospital/	2025-02-24T03:08:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6766d67e66a947.38047520.jpeg?w=900
2,000 USAID staff to be cut, others put on administrative leave	The Trump administration is putting all civil servants employed by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on administrative leave beginning Monday at midnight, according to a notice reviewed by The Hill. At the same time, 2,000 staff are expected to be cut from the agency in the U.S., part of a 'Reduction-in-Force,' reads the notice delivered from the Office of the Administrator. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is the acting USAID administrator, but no name is on the order. The notice comes following a federal judge on Friday refusing to renew a temporary block against the Trump administration and its intent to fire or place on 'administrative leave' thousands of employees. Musk doubles down on email ultimatum after agencies push back Following the order, hundreds of employees contracted to work with USAID were fired. In one bureau providing lifesaving humanitarian assistance, one USAID official estimated the firing of contractors cut staff by between 40 and 60 percent. 'There is no one left to do any work,' the USAID official said, requesting anonymity to protect against retaliation. The move to eliminate thousands of USAID’s workforce marks another chapter in the Trump administration’s attack on the independent agency, the primary venue for America’s distribution of lifesaving humanitarian and developmental assistance. The Trump administration first ordered all staff be put on administrative leave Feb. 2, which was initially blocked by a court order six days later. President Trump and his officials have focused on dismantling the agency in the wake of an initial blanket freeze on all U.S. foreign assistance. While Rubio said he is approving waivers to exempt lifesaving humanitarian assistance and allow that USAID work to continue, the mass reductions in staff are eliminating key roles for carrying it out. Trump delegated tech billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency to root out what he and his supporters describe as wasteful and fraudulent spending and accused USAID of operating with a liberal bias. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? The administrator’s order putting staff on administrative leave impacts all USAID staff in the U.S. and around the world. Some staff are expected to be notified by 5 p.m. Feb. 23 that they are exempt, with their positions deemed 'mission critical,' part of 'core leadership and/or specially designated programs.' The administration further is recalling overseas personnel, providing a 'voluntary Agency-funded return travel program and other benefits,' according to another notice reviewed by The Hill. In the court ruling issued Friday, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols said USAID employees 'overstated' the harm those employees stood to face if put on administrative leave. 'The record now reflects that no USAID employee stationed abroad has been or imminently will be required to return to the United States within thirty days,' Nichols wrote. 'Rather, as matters presently stand, USAID employees stationed abroad have been given a choice.' The administrative leave order likely impacts the agency's civil servant workforce, staff who undergo thorough and exhaustive hiring procedures, are vetted for classified security clearances, are highly educated and experienced, and are put in the system with an expectation of decades of service. Trump suggests Musk needs to be ‘more aggressive’ One USAID official, who requested anonymity to protect against retaliation, described the past month as 'psychological torment.' While staff on administrative leave may retain access to their emails and USAID systems, they are not permitted to do work. 'If most civil servants in D.C. go back on admin leave tonight, you will have a few handfuls of civil servants left and they cannot do the work — in skill set or in numbers — of the bureau,' the USAID official said. 'We are, for now, dead. Last night and all week we lost centuries of collective experience.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/usaid-staff-cuts/	2025-02-23T15:27:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25053685599397-e1740253277560.jpg?w=900
Pope Francis has 'mild' kidney failure: What is it?	(NEXSTAR) — Doctors revealed Sunday that blood tests for Pope Francis, the 88-year-old pontiff who has been hospitalized since Valentine's Day after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened, show early kidney failure. Every day, roughly 360 people in the U.S. begin treatment (either dialysis or a transplant) for kidney failure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A patient is considered to be experiencing kidney failure if under 15 percent of their kidney is 'working normally,' the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases says. Pope Francis remains in ‘critical condition’ with signs of early kidney failure Some of Pope Francis' blood tests showed 'initial, mild, kidney failure,' but doctors said it was under control. The Vatican did not provide any details about Pope Francis' condition or what treatment, if any, he was receiving for his kidney failure.

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) There are some early warning signs of kidney failure — fatigue, nausea, vomiting, confusion, difficulty concentrating, swelling, change in urination frequency, cramps, dry skin, and food tasting metallic among them — but they may go unnoticed early on, per the Cleveland Clinic. During kidney failure, one or both of a person's kidneys will no longer function well on their own, the Cleveland Clinic explains. In some cases, kidney failure is temporary and develops quickly. In others, it can be a long-term condition that worsens over time. Should the condition worsen, it can reach end-stage kidney disease, or ESKD. This stage, according to the Cleveland Clinic, is deadly without the proper treatment. With it, however, patients can 'have a good quality of life while [they] manage kidney failure.' While doctors did not indicate what may have caused Francis' kidney failure, the National Kidney Foundation says diabetes and high blood pressure comprise roughly two-thirds of cases. Other potential causes include various forms of kidney damage and genetic disorders. Prebiotic sodas: What are they, and why are they everywhere? Those experiencing kidney failure may be at a higher risk of experiencing heart disease, stroke, and anemia, among other complications. Francis developed anemia and, during blood transfusions on Saturday, was given hematin, a treatment designed to increase the level of hemoglobin in his blood, which in turn helps the blood carry more oxygen. Doctors reported Sunday that the therapy had been beneficial. The National Kidney Foundation notes that high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke can both cause kidney disease and occur as a result of it. There is no cure for kidney failure but treatment plans, medications, eating plans, and an active lifestyle can help those living with it, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases explains. The life expectancy of someone experiencing kidney failure can vary depending on 'many things,' the American Kidney Fund says, including age and treatment plan. When will this cold winter end? NOAA releases hopeful outlook The Vatican described Francis as remaining in critical condition but alert and 'well-oriented' on Sunday, adding that he attended Mass. He had also not experienced any more respiratory crises since Saturday night but was still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen. 'The complexity of the clinical picture, and the necessary wait for drug therapies to provide some feedback, dictate that the prognosis remains guarded,' Francis' doctors concluded.

ROME (AP) — An American Airlines flight from New York to New Delhi, India, landed safely in Rome on Sunday after it was diverted due to a security issue, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA did not elaborate on what the security issue was, but said it was reported by crew aboard American Airlines Flight 292. American Airlines did not return multiple messages seeking comment. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. ROME (AP) — An American Airlines flight en route from New York to New Delhi turned around over the Caspian Sea on Sunday and landed in Rome, a spokesman with the Leonardo da Vinci International Airport said. The spokesman, Francesco Garibaldi did not give the reason for the change in flight plans. He said security checks would be performed as soon as the 199 passengers on board, plus the crew, leave the plane. An Associated Press reporter filmed two fighter jets flying over the airport shortly before the unscheduled landing. Fire trucks were visible on the landing strip on one side of the plane after it landed. The airport continue to operate normally, the spokesman said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/american-airlines-flight-from-new-york-to-delhi-makes-unscheduled-landing-in-rome/	2025-02-23T09:57:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25054621687537-e1740331890966.jpg?w=900
Surviving Hamas: The story of Keith Siegel, an Israeli American h...	(NewsNation) — Tortured, starved and holding onto life without lights or water, Keith Siegel’s story is one of survival. In Hamas captivity for 484 days during the war in Gaza, the Israeli American was released Feb. 1, along with two other hostages that day. He was the first American to be freed. Though he’s doing 'OK' now, Keith didn’t think he would live to see freedom, his wife told NewsNation's 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' Sunday morning. This undated photo provided by Hostages Family Forum shows Keith Siegel, who was abducted and brought to Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023. (Hostages Family Forum via AP) 'He went through so many days of torture and so many times of minutes that he didn't think that he would survive,' said Aviva Siegel, a survivor herself. American-Israeli hostage ‘born again’ after Hamas release: Father In the beginning of Keith's transition to freedom, he wanted to be alone, Aviva said, but she understood. A redeeming moment following the tragedy was meeting his grandchildren. 'They all cried. And to see my grandson that's 10 years old crying and just hugging kids and not letting go,' Aviva said. 'We are just the happiest people in Earth to have him back.' Surviving Hamas A man, identified as Keith Siegel, 64, speaks in a video released by Hamas on April 27, 2024, that appeared to show two Israeli hostages who have been held in the Gaza Strip since the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in this screen grab taken from a handout video. (Credit: Hamas Military Wing/Handout via Reuters) Hamas militants paraded him in front of a crowd, a consistent feature of the hostage releases in which some smiled and waved despite appearing physically weak. 'For the last half a year, he was lying on the mattress on the floor. And he was alone most of the time. He didn't have anybody to talk to anybody to feel that he's with somebody, just with the Arabs and with the Hamas terrorists.' He lost 50 kilograms – 110 pounds. 'We're going to bring back the hostages': Ex-Israeli PM Keith recorded a message about his experience after he was released. 'I was starved and I was tortured, both physically and emotionally,' Keith said in the video. 'When the war intensified, the terrorists who helped me treated me even worse than usual. Terrorists kicked me, spat on me and held me with no water, no light and no air to breathe.' Now that her husband is home, Aviva said she feels 'like a different person,' but she is heartbroken for the families who haven’t been reunited with their loved ones, saying captivity is like 'going through hell.' 'Nobody in this world should go through with what I went through and what Keith went through,' she said. She was held hostage for nearly two months, released long before her husband.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admonished Hamas’ actions, calling the charades 'disgraceful ceremonies.' Hamas has said it would release four hostages next week. Netanyahu’s ultimatum puts the phase-two negotiations and the fate of the remaining living hostages into question as the war drags on past 500 days. Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas’ body returned to family after ID mix-up On Saturday, six hostages were liberated in the final release of the first phase of the three-part ceasefire deal. Last week was an unexpected rollercoaster of emotions when it came to another family, the Bibases. Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas’ body was supposed to be returned last week, along with the bodies of her two sons and another hostage, Oded Lifshitz. Hamas had turned over the wrong body to Israel, now determined to be that of an unidentified Palestinian woman. Days later, Bibas' body was returned to her family. Hearing the news, 'just broke my heart ... I think it's just a slap in the face,' Aviva said. 'I didn't even think that they're able to do something so cruel. But they did.' Her message to the Israeli government: 'Get them out now. Don't even think of (causing) any problems because we need them back now. We need them back alive.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/surviving-hamas-keith-siegel-israeli-american-hostage/	2025-02-23T08:35:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2040411422.jpg?w=900
Musk doubles down on email ultimatum; Patel tells FBI staff to wa...	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk has reiterated the need for federal government employees to explain their weekly tasks as he and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) look to scale back operations. Musk, who was hand-picked by President Trump to examine and cut federal spending, explained why he believes it is necessary on X on Sunday. 'The reason this matters is that a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!' he said. 'In some cases, we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks. In other words, there is outright fraud.' Hegseth defends Trump’s firings of Pentagon leaders and says there may be more dismissals Musk announced on Saturday that civil servants will be asked to send an email explaining what they accomplished last week. Those who don’t comply will be fired, he said. Newly-appointed FBI Director Kash Patel sent a message to the FBI workforce on Saturday night telling them not to reply to the emails. 'The FBI through the Ofice of the Director, is in charge of all our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,' Patel wrote. 'When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-doubles-down-fed-workers-explanation/	2025-02-23T08:10:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2187754492.jpg?w=900
Trump directs ICE agents to find, deport unaccompanied migrant ch...	WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The Trump administration is directing immigration agents to track down hundreds of thousands of migrant children who entered the United States without their parents, expanding the president's mass deportation effort, according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo outlines an unprecedented push to target migrant children who crossed the border illegally as unaccompanied minors. It lays out four phases of implementation, beginning with a planning phase on January 27, though it did not provide a start date for enforcement operations. More than 600,000 immigrant children have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without a parent or legal guardian since 2019, according to government data, as the number of migrants caught crossing illegally reached record levels. Tens of thousands have been ordered deported over the same time frame, including more than 31,000 for missing court hearings, immigration court data show. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to a request for comment about the memo and the Trump administration's plans. During his first term, Trump introduced a 'zero tolerance' policy that led to the separation of migrant children from their parents at the border. The children were sent to children's shelters run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), a government agency housed within the Department of Health and Human Services, while their parents were detained or deported. The separation of families, including babies from nursing mothers, was met with widespread international outrage. Trump halted the policy in 2018, though up to 1,000 children may still remain separated from parents, according to Lee Gelernt, the lead American Civil Liberties Union attorney in a related legal challenge. As well as enforcing immigration laws, the memo, headlined the 'Unaccompanied Alien Children Joint Initiative Field Implementation,' said the initiative aims to ensure that children are not victims of human trafficking or other forms of exploitation. The memo said the children would be served a notice to appear in immigration court or deported, if deportation orders were pending against them. In the memo, ICE said it had collected data from a number of sources on unaccompanied minors and sorted them into three priority groups, 'flight risk', 'public safety' and 'border security.' It directed agents to focus on children deemed 'flight risks' - including those ordered deported for missing court hearings and those released to sponsors who are not blood relatives. The agency uses several databases and government records to track down targets. DNA tests Under the law, migrants who have exhausted their legal options to stay can be removed, even if they are children. But the U.S. government has limited resources and typically prioritizes arresting adults with criminal records. Unaccompanied children began arriving in large numbers a decade ago due to violence and economic instability in their home countries - and U.S. immigration policies that enabled them to enter and often remain. The majority are from Central America and Mexico. Some migrated to join parents already in the United States; many traveled with family members or smugglers. From ORR custody, children are released to sponsors, usually parents or relatives, as immigration authorities weigh their cases to remain in the country. Trump's border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly claimed that some 300,000 unaccompanied children went missing during Biden's presidency and were at risk of trafficking and exploitation. Beyond initial follow-up calls, ORR was not obligated to track the whereabouts of the children after they left custody. Many are now adults or living with their parents. Individual ICE field offices will determine 'how to best locate, make contact, and serve immigration documents as appropriate for individual targets, when conducting enforcement actions,' involving unaccompanied children, the memo said. Because the children often live in households with adults without authorization to be in the United States, their addresses could also help ICE boost its overall arrest numbers. During his first administration, Trump used data gathered to vet sponsors of unaccompanied children to target them for arrests. Since taking office on January 20, Trump has taken steps to tighten vetting of sponsors. These include requiring sponsors and adult household members to submit fingerprints for background checks, according to guidance issued last week. The Trump administration has also expanded its access to ORR's database of children and their sponsors, two sources familiar with the matter said. Mellissa Harper, a former ICE official who now heads ORR, told a staff meeting on Thursday that the agency plans to use DNA tests to establish familial relationships, one of the sources said. It was unclear whether DNA tests would be used only on cases that raised a red flag, or on a routine basis. Harper said at the meeting that ICE was pursuing 247,000 tips related to fraud, trafficking and smuggling of unaccompanied minors and referring cases to the FBI for further investigation, the person said.

Pope Francis remains in 'critical condition' after blood transfus...	(NewsNation) — Pope Francis had a 'peaceful night' Saturday after receiving blood transfusions and high levels of oxygen to treat his double pneumonia, the Vatican said Sunday, but remains in 'critical condition.' Francis took to social media to express his gratitude to supporters, writing, 'I've recently received many messages of affection, and I've been particularly struck by the letters and drawings from children. Thank you for your closeness, and for the consoling prayers I have received from all over the world.' The pontiff, who entered the papacy at age 76 in 2013, is being treated at Gemelli Hospital in Italy where he was initially admitted for bronchitis on Feb.14. He has missed Sunday Mass in back-to-back weeks after suffering a severe and prolonged respiratory crisis requiring oxygen. Pope Francis’ health ‘looking very serious’: Vatican reporter Though not on a ventilator, Francis is struggling to breathe and is keeping his movement limited, according to officials. Still, he remains alert, sitting upright, working and joking, though a bit more fatigued than the day before. The pope also received blood transfusions after tests revealed thrombocytopenia, a condition of abnormally low levels of platelets in the blood. Doctors said their biggest concern now is the risk of germs that could enter his bloodstream and cause sepsis, a life-threatening infection. His medical team says he's expected to return to the Vatican, which may be unsurprising, as he has said previously that the position of pope is a lifelong commitment. Tens of thousands attend funeral of late Hezbollah leader Despite his illness, Francis mentioned the war in Ukraine, saying 'Tomorrow (Feb. 23) will be the 3rd anniversary of the large-scale war against Ukraine. A pain. And shameful occasion for the whole of humanity,' going on to call for the 'gift of peace in all armed conflicts around the world.' Doctors said he will stay hospitalized at least through next weekend. A mass for the pope in his native city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, is expected at 9:15 a.m. Sunday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/pope-francis-peaceful-night-blood-transfusions-pneumonia/	2025-02-23T06:40:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6744708927ada3.30930926.jpeg?w=900
Pope Francis rested during a peaceful night following respiratory...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis, in critical condition with a complicated lung infection, rested well during a peaceful night following a respiratory crisis and blood transfusions, the Vatican said Sunday. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni's one-line statement didn't mention if Francis was up or eating breakfast. 'The night passed quietly, the pope rested.' The brief update came after doctors said the 88-year-old pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was in critical condition. On Saturday morning, he suffered a prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis while being treated for pneumonia and a complex lung infection. The pope received 'high flows' of oxygen to help him breathe. He also received blood transfusions after tests showed low counts of platelets, which are needed for clotting, the Vatican said in a late update. The Saturday statement also said that the pontiff 'continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday.' Doctors said the prognosis was 'reserved.' Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. The main threat facing the pope is sepsis They have warned that the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition. Saturday’s blood tests showed that he had developed a low platelet count, a condition called platelopenia or thrombocytopenia. Platelets are cell-like fragments that circulate in the blood that help form blood clots to stop bleeding or help wounds heal. Low platelet counts can be caused by a number of things, including side effects from medicines or infections, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Francis, who has chronic lung disease and is prone to bronchitis in winter, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed 'absolute rest' and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Vatican hierarchy tamps down speculation Francis might resign Meanwhile, the Vatican hierarchy went on the defensive to tamp down rumors and speculation that Francis might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The pope remains fully conscious, alert, eating and working. The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to speculation and rumors about a possible resignation. It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret. Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat-out denied that any such meeting occurred. Parolin said such speculation seemed 'useless' when what really mattered was the health of Francis, his recovery and return to the Vatican. 'On the other hand, I think it is quite normal that in these situations uncontrolled rumors can spread or some misplaced comment is uttered. It is certainly not the first time it has happened,' Parolin was quoted as saying. 'However, I don’t think there is any particular movement, and so far I haven’t heard anything like that.' Holy Year celebrations continue without pope Deacons, meanwhile, were gathering at the Vatican for their special Holy Year weekend. Francis got sick at the start of the Vatican’s Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. This weekend, Francis was supposed to have celebrated deacons, a ministry in the church that precedes ordination to the priesthood. In his place, the Holy Year organizer was to celebrate Sunday’s Mass, the Vatican said. And for the second consecutive weekend, Francis is skipping his traditional Sunday noon blessing, which he could have delivered from Gemelli if he were up to it. 'Look, even though he’s not (physically) here, we know he’s here,' said Luis Arnaldo López Quirindongo, a deacon from Ponce, Puerto Rico, who was at the Vatican on Saturday for the Jubilee celebration. 'He’s recovering, but he’s in our hearts and is accompanying us, because our prayers and his go together.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Plan for bounty hunters to pursue migrants has controls: Lawmaker	(NewsNation) — A Missouri state lawmaker says his proposal to have bounty hunters track down undocumented immigrants includes guardrails. Under Republican Sen. David Gregory’s bill, state authorities would create a program to certify bounty hunters 'for the purpose of finding and detaining illegal aliens' in Missouri. Gregory said only migrants for whom arrest warrants have been issued would be targeted by the state system. 'It’s not allowing anyone to determine for themselves who to investigate. It’s not allowing any bounty hunters to kick in doors and demand papers — that’s not what this is,' Gregory, said Saturday during an appearance on 'NewsNation Prime.' How ICE finds criminal suspects living illegally in US He said his plan would effectively be a state version of what U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is doing under the Trump administration — going after criminal migrants who pose a threat to local communities. The ACLU of Missouri has promised legal challenges and a former top official with U.S. ICE under President Joe Biden called Gregory’s proposal 'absurd.' 'It puts the communities at risk,' he said Saturday. 'It will build fear into the system. It’ll create these blurred lines between actual law enforcement work by state and locals, by the cities, by the federal government, and blend it with untrained individuals going into homes or doing arrests.' The Missouri bill also would create a telephone hotline and other reporting methods for people to alert authorities about illegal aliens. Informants would be eligible to receive rewards of $1,000.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/bounty-hunters-to-pursue-migrants/	2025-02-22T19:51:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/E7F87C963E210A1C7E650BBB4266A18C.jpg?w=574
Pope Francis' health 'looking very serious': Vatican reporter	(NewsNation) — When EWTN Global Catholic TV Network Vatican correspondent Colm Flynn last saw Pope Francis, the Holy Father was 'in good spirits' but visibly 'struggling to catch his breath.' Flynn pointed to the Pope's compromised lungs — part of his right lung was removed in his youth after a bout of pneumonia — and advanced age as potential cause for concern. 'Things are looking very serious here in the Eternal City today,' Flynn said Saturday on 'NewsNation Prime.' Flynn last saw the Pope on Wednesday, Feb. 12, just two days before he was admitted to the hospital. The Vatican said in a Saturday statement that the 88-year-old is in 'critical condition' after suffering a long asthmatic respiratory crisis that required high flows of oxygen.

'The Holy Father continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday. At the moment the prognosis is reserved,' the statement said. While it's not Pope Francis' first health scare, Flynn said the general feeling in Rome is that this one might be his last. 'This time, there is a feeling that it's more serious, because that press conference that they held yesterday at the Gemelli Hospital, that was the first time that his doctors, his own personal doctors, spoke to us journalists,' Flynn said.

The IRS is firing thousands of workers. Will it affect your tax r...	(NEXSTAR) – With the IRS laying off thousands of employees Thursday, many Americans may be wondering if their tax returns — or their refunds — will be affected. A government official who asked to remain anonymous confirmed news of the IRS culling 6,700 employees to Nexstar's NewsNation. It represents the latest mass termination amid an ongoing purge of federal workers by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's DOGE. 'If you asked me a month ago if the IRS would reduce their staffing, I would say yeah, I think it'll happen, but probably not until April 16 (the day after tax season ends),' tax expert Adam Brewer, of AB Tax Law, told Nexstar. 'Practically speaking, it doesn't make any sense, but here we are.' The firings are happening despite IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season being told earlier this month that they would not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until mid-May, after the taxpayer filing deadline. Social Security given $205 billion boost due to COVID deaths It's not entirely clear how dismissing nearly 7,000 of the roughly 90,000 IRS workers will affect the filing process, but Brewer has been advising clients to safeguard themselves by doing the following: File and pay any owed taxes electronically Make sure your refund can be deposited directly Take care to make sure the return is accurate and complete If you need to request payments by installment, do so online 'If you send in a paper return, at a minimum someone at the IRS has to be there to open the envelope, and we saw in the pandemic that doesn't get done when they get really far behind,' Brewer said. 'We've had situations where people send in payments, they never get cashed, and all of a sudden there's additional penalties and interest.' Taxpayers can check the status of their refunds using the IRS' Where’s My Refund? tool and via the IRS2GO app. Eggs seized at border as prices hit record highs in US Who was fired? The layoffs affect probationary employees with roughly one year or less of service at the agency and largely include workers in compliance departments, according to the person, who was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday. Compliance work includes ensuring that taxpayers are abiding by the tax code, filing their returns and paying their taxes, among other duties. Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said on a Thursday call with reporters that the layoffs at the IRS will disproportionately harm enforcement efforts. 'When you underpay and understaff the IRS, the agency doesn’t have the power or the resources it needs to go after wealthy tax evaders with their high priced lawyers,' she said, adding, 'The result is, of course, a disaster for revenue.' Charitable donations: What’s tax-deductible? The layoffs are part of the Trump administration's intensified efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection. In addition to the planned layoffs, the Trump administration intends to lend IRS workers to the Department of Homeland Security to assist with immigration enforcement. In a letter sent earlier this month, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to borrow IRS workers to help with ongoing immigration crackdown efforts.

Vance is overwhelming favorite to be Trump's successor in CPAC st...	Vice President Vance emerged as the clear favorite to be President Trump's successor in the MAGA movement in a new straw poll conducted at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Saturday. Sixty-one percent of CPAC's 1,022 attendees said they would support Vance as the future GOP standard bearer. Twelve percent said they would support Trump’s former adviser and right-wing media personality Steve Bannon, while seven percent said the same about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R). Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s UN ambassador nominee Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) each received three percent support. Donald Trump Jr., Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Vivek Ramaswamy, who is expected to launch a gubernatorial bid in Ohio next week, all got two percent support. Trump fires top US general in unprecedented Pentagon shakeup Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders (R), Florida Sen. Rick Scott (R ), Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Trump’s former GOP presidential primary rival Nikki Haley all received one percent support. Four percent said they were undecided. CPAC’s straw poll was conducted by Republican pollster Jim McLaughlin. The same poll unsurprisingly showed Trump with a 99 percent approval rating with the staunchly pro-Trump crowd, with 95 percent saying they strongly approved. Vance was the first speaker at this year’s CPAC, while Trump is set to close the annual gathering on Saturday. Earlier this month Trump told Fox News declined to name Vance as his automatic successor, saying it was 'too early.' However, Trump praised his vice president as 'very capable' in the interview.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/vance-is-overwhelming-favorite-to-be-trumps-successor-in-cpac-straw-poll/	2025-02-22T13:25:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/vancejd_022025gn09_w.jpg?w=900
Trump chides Maine governor at CPAC after clash at White House	National Harbor, Md. – President Trump chided Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday after the two clashed the day before at the White House over transgender athletes in women’s sports. 'You saw Maine yesterday, right? The governor of Maine,' Trump said, eliciting boos from the audience. 'She’s fighting to keep men in women’s sports. You ever see what happens to a woman when a woman boxes a man who transitioned to womanhood? You ever see what happens? It’s not pretty.' 'Let her do that fight. Let them all do that fight,' Trump said. Trump suggests Musk needs to be ‘more aggressive’ Mills went head-to-head with Trump at the National Governors Association session at the White House on Friday after the president told a group of Republican governors that he would withhold funding from the state over its refusal to comply with an executive order barring transgender athletes from competing in women and girls' sports. Trump directly asked the governor during the session whether the state would follow the order, to which Mills responded, 'I’m complying with state and federal law.' 'We are the federal law. You better do it because you’re not going to get federal funding,' Trump said. 'See you in court,' Mills responded.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-cpap-maine-governor-janet-mills/	2025-02-22T13:21:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/TrumpDonald_CPAC1.jpg?w=900
Social Security given $205 billion boost due to COVID deaths	(NewsNation) — Almost five years on from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Social Security trust fund has financially benefited following the deaths of more than a million Americans. More than one million Americans died from the coronavirus between 2020 and 2023, meaning those premature deaths saved billions and billions in Social Security payments. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, around $294 billion has been saved as a result. The figure would have been higher if not for lost tax revenue offsetting the total by approximately $205 billion. Survivor benefits to children and spouses of the deceased contributed to the money saved by the Social Security trust. Trump suggests Musk needs to be ‘more aggressive’ The researchers did note that COVID can have other impacts on Social Security, with long-COVID sufferers or others affected by the pandemic, may dip into their benefits more prematurely than pre-pandemic. Jeff Williams, U.S. president and CEO of benefits administration company, Aptia, tells NewsNation that Americans should have a multi-faceted plan before retiring. 'It’s understandable to worry about Social Security, but a strong retirement plan goes beyond just one source of income,' Williams said. 'Taking a proactive approach—factoring in healthcare costs, savings, and available benefits—can help provide long-term financial security and an easier transition into retirement,' he added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/social-security-given-205-billion-boost-thanks-to-covid-deaths/	2025-02-22T11:08:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67afb3eedf8867.99034960.jpeg?w=900
Pope Francis is in critical condition after long respiratory cris...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis was in critical condition Saturday after he suffered a long asthmatic respiratory crisis that required high flows of oxygen, the Vatican said. The 88-year-old Francis, who has been hospitalized for a week with pneumonia and a complex lung infection, also received blood transfusions after tests showed low platelet counts associated with anemia, the Vatican said in a late update. 'The Holy Father continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday. At the moment the prognosis is reserved,' the statement said. Doctors have said Francis' condition is touch-and-go and that he is by no means out of danger. They have warned that the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition. Francis, who has chronic lung disease, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed 'absolute rest' and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Dr. Sergio Alfieri, the head of medicine and surgery at Rome’s Gemelli hospital, said the biggest threat facing Francis was that some of the germs that are currently located in his respiratory system pass into the bloodstream, causing sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ failure and death. 'Sepsis, with his respiratory problems and his age, would be really difficult to get out of,' Alfieri told a news conference Friday at Gemelli. 'The English say ‘knock on wood,’ we say ‘touch iron.’ Everyone touch what they want,' he said as he tapped the microphone. 'But this is the real risk in these cases: that these germs pass to the bloodstream.' 'He knows he's in danger,' Alfieri added. 'And he told us to relay that.' Meanwhile, the Vatican hierarchy went on the defensive to tamp down rumors and speculation that Francis might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The pope remains fully conscious, alert, eating and working. The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to speculation and rumors about a possible resignation. It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret. Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat-out denied that any such meeting occurred. Parolin said such speculation seemed 'useless' when what really mattered was the health of Francis, his recovery and return to the Vatican. 'On the other hand, I think it is quite normal that in these situations uncontrolled rumors can spread or some misplaced comment is uttered. It is certainly not the first time it has happened,' Parolin was quoted as saying. 'However, I don’t think there is any particular movement, and so far I haven’t heard anything like that.' Deacons, meanwhile, were gathering at the Vatican for their special Holy Year weekend. Francis got sick at the start of the Vatican’s Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. This weekend, Francis was supposed to have celebrated deacons, a ministry in the church that precedes ordination to the priesthood. In his place, the Holy Year organizer will celebrate Sunday’s Mass, the Vatican said. And for the second consecutive weekend, Francis was expected to skip his traditional Sunday noon blessing, which he could have delivered from Gemelli if he were up to it. 'Look, even though he's not (physically) here, we know he's here,' said Luis Arnaldo López Quirindongo, a deacon from Ponce, Puerto Rico, who was at the Vatican on Saturday for the Jubilee celebration. 'He's recovering, but he's in our hearts and is accompanying us, because our prayers and his go together.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Trump suggests Musk needs to be 'more aggressive'	(The Hill) -- President Trump suggested in a new post that tech billionaire Elon Musk, one of his closest allies, needs to be 'more aggressive' — presumably referring to his efforts to slash spending, downsize the federal workforce and eviscerate fraud via the newly-formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 'ELON IS DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE,' Trump wrote Saturday in a post on Truth Social. 'REMEMBER, WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO SAVE, BUT ULTIMATELY, TO MAKE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. MAGA!' Musk, who leads six major companies, and DOGE staffers have gone after several federal agencies over the past month looking to overhaul the federal workforce — including initiatives that would nearly dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Education Department. The commission said earlier this week that it saved the government $55 billion by canceling grants, selling assets, reducing teams and by axing contracts and leases. The Trump administration has offered buyouts to many civil service workers. So far, more than 75,000 government employees have accepted the offer. DOGE has been under fire from Democrats and various organizations for the actions it's taken during the president's first month back in office. Critics have urged the advisory board to shed more transparency into their conduct. The group has faced lawsuits, with 14 states saying the board’s cuts are unconstitutional, and others questioning the commission's access to payment systems at the Treasury Department, which has since been blocked. Musk's influence over the administration has also been under the microscope, with many citing his potential conflicts of interest. Trump has consistently defended Musk, whom he recently called a 'patriot.' 'I’m just hearing about it and if there is … obviously I will not let there be any conflict of interest. He’s done an amazing job,' he said earlier this week. 'I told Elon, any conflicts you can’t have anything to do with that. So, anything to do with possibly even space, we won’t let Elon partake in that.' The president and White House have also suggested Musk is not actually part of DOGE. Instead, he is considered a senior adviser to Trump and a 'White House Office' employee, a court filing from the White House Office of Administration shows. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has 'has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,' Joshua Fisher, the director of the office, wrote. Musk defended DOGE’s work during a briefing alongside Trump earlier this month, emphasizing that voters 'voted for major government reform and that’s what the people are going to get.' Trump lauded the tech entrepreneur in early February for doing a 'very good job' and predicted that DOGE’s aides would discover more fraud and waste within the government. 'He’s got a staff that’s fantastic, he’s wanted to be able to do this for a long time,' the president said. 'I think we’re going to be very close to balancing budgets for the first time for many years.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-suggests-musk-needs-to-be-more-aggressive/	2025-02-22T08:15:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Donald-Trump-Elon-Musk-02.22-e1740240747705.png?w=800

Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas' body returned to family after ID mix...	(NewsNation) — After an identity mix-up in Hamas' hostage release earlier this week, Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas' body has returned to her family, according to Israeli authorities. Forensic officials confirmed the remains were hers Saturday morning. 'For 16 months we sought certainty, and now that it’s here, it brings no comfort, though we hope it marks the beginning of closure,' the family said, per the Associated Press. 500 days of the Israel-Hamas war, by the numbers Hamas turned over the bodies of four hostages to Israel, one of whom was said to be Bibas, a mother whose sons also died in captivity. But Israel discovered the body was not Bibas. That body remains unidentified but is believed to belong to a Palestinian woman. Two of the bodies were Bibas' two children, Ariel and Kfir, who were 4 years old and 9 months old, respectively, at the time of their Oct. 7, 2023, abduction. The fourth person was Oded Lifshitz, 83. Hamas has released hostages each week since the ceasefire deal with Israel took effect on Jan. 19. On Saturday, six living hostages were freed. This is the final prisoner exchange in the first phase of the three-part ceasefire. Monday marked the 500th day of the war.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/israeli-hostage-shiri-bibas-body-returned-to-family-after-mix-up/	2025-02-22T04:36:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b6e869596378.94194988.jpeg?w=825
Federal judge temporarily blocks Trump DEI executive orders	(The Hill) — A federal judge has temporarily blocked parts of President Trump’s executive orders that sought to end the federal government’s backing of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson, a former President Biden appointee, issued a preliminary injunction on Friday that prevents the administration from altering or ending contracts viewed as DEI-related. The federal judge also ruled that the administration could not 'bring any False Claims Act enforcement action, or other enforcement action, pursuant to the Enforcement Threat Provision, including but not limited to any False Claims Act enforcement action premised on any certification made pursuant to the Certification Provision.' Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump penned two executive orders with hopes of eliminating DEI in the federal government and shrinking its influence in higher education and corporate America. The orders have prompted firings in the federal government while various groups have filed lawsuits in response. In court, the administration has pushed back on the plaintiff’s claims, saying the orders were forged in adherence with the current legislation in place. 'Plaintiffs, who have easily established their standing to bring this case and irreparable harm, have shown they are likely to prove the Termination and Enforcement Threat Provisions are unconstitutionally vague on their face,' Abelson said in a Friday opinion. The judge said it is not just the 'vagueness' of the challenged provisions that makes them unconstitutional, writing later that the most ''blatant' and 'egregious form of content discrimination’ is viewpoint discrimination.' Abelson’s Friday ruling does not prevent the Department of Justice from compiling and probing schools and corporations’ DEI efforts, but it prevents enforcement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-trump-dei-executive-orders/	2025-02-22T04:17:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25043784844149-e1740078012325_817f00-e1740192036836.jpg?w=800
Hamas hands over the first 2 of 6 Israeli hostages to be freed in...	RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas freed the first two of six Israeli hostages due to be released Saturday even as heightened tension between the adversaries clouded the future of the fragile ceasefire deal. The two hostages — Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 39 — were put into Red Cross ambulances after being brought out onto a stage by masked and armed Hamas fighters in front of a crowd in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Soon after, the Israeli military confirmed that the two had been brought into Israel. The latest hostage release, along with the freeing of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, is going ahead after tensions mounted over a grisly and heart-wrenching dispute triggered this week when Hamas initially handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother of two young boys abducted by militants. The remains that Hamas transferred with her sons’ bodies on Thursday were later determined to be those of an unidentified Palestinian woman. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed revenge for 'a cruel and malicious violation,' while Hamas suggested it had been a mistake. On Friday night, the small militant group believed to have been holding Bibas and her sons — the Palestinian Mujahedeen Brigades — said it handed over a second body. On Saturday morning, Bibas’ family said Israeli forensic authorities had confirmed the remains were hers. 'For 16 months we sought certainty, and now that it’s here, it brings no comfort, though we hope it marks the beginning of closure,' the family said. The dispute over the body’s identity raised new doubt about the ceasefire deal, which has paused over 15 months of war but is nearing the end of its first phase. Negotiations over a second phase, in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal, are likely to be even more difficult. The six hostages being freed Saturday are the last living ones to be released under the ceasefire’s first phase. Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, had been held in Gaza since entering on his own in 2014. Watching the handover on Israeli media, Mengistu’s family broke out into a Hebrew song, 'Here is the Light,' as they saw him for the first time in more than a decade. Shoham, from the northern Israeli village of Ma’ale Tzviya, was visiting his wife’s family in Kibbutz Be’eri when Hamas militants stormed into the community during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. The family of Tal Shoham told Israeli media they were 'starting to breathe again' after seeing him on the stage. Shoham’s wife, two young children, and three other relatives who had been abducted with him were freed in a November 2023 exchange. The others to be freed include Eliya Cohen, 27; Omer Shem Tov, 22; and Omer Wenkert, 23. All three were abducted from a music festival during the Oct. 7 attack. Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, who also crossed into Gaza on his own years ago, is also to be returned to Israel as part of the deal. More than 600 Palestinians jailed in Israel will be freed in exchange, the Palestinian prisoners media office said Friday. The prisoners set for release include 50 serving life sentences, 60 with long sentences, 47 who were released under a previous hostage-for-prisoner exchange and 445 prisoners from Gaza arrested since the war began. Hamas has said it will also release four more bodies next week, completing the first phase of the ceasefire. If that plan is carried out, Hamas would retain about 60 hostages, about half of whom are believed to be alive. Hamas has said it won’t release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he’s committed to destroying Hamas’ military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Trump’s proposal to remove about 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. His idea has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries. Trump said Friday that he was 'a little surprised' by rejections of the proposal by Egypt and Jordan and that he would not impose it. 'I’ll tell you, the way to do it is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works. But I’m not forcing it. I’m just going to sit back and recommend it,' Trump said in a Fox News interview. Israel’s military offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza’s population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Lidman from Tel Aviv, Israel. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-family-confirms-body-handed-over-by-militants-overnight-was-israeli-mother-shiri-bibas/	2025-02-22T00:20:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b98926f0c1b7.92013306.jpeg?w=900
Luigi Mangione makes first court appearance since arraignment in ...	NEW YORK (AP) — The man accused of fatally shooting the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in New York City and leading authorities on a five-day search was in court Friday for the first time since his December arraignment on state murder and terror charges. Luigi Mangione, 26, has pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism, in the Dec. 4 killing of Brian Thompson outside a midtown Manhattan hotel. The executive was ambushed and shot on a sidewalk as he walked to an investor conference. Sean ‘Diddy’ Comb’s lawyer quits case ahead of sex trafficking trial Mangione also faces federal charges that could carry the possibility of the death penalty. He is being held in a Brooklyn federal jail alongside several other high-profile defendants, including Sean 'Diddy' Combs and Sam Bankman-Fried. Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. The maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole. A Feb. 24 hearing in Pennsylvania on charges of possessing an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police was canceled.

(Steven Hirsch/New York Post via AP, Pool) In a statement posted on a website for his legal defense, Mangione said: 'I am overwhelmed by — and grateful for — everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support. Powerfully, this support has transcended political, racial, and even class divisions.' The killing prompted some to voice their resentment at U.S. health insurers, with Mangione attracting a cult following as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills. A poll taken in the wake of the shooting showed most Americans believe health insurance profits and coverage denials share blame. A couple dozen members of the public were allowed into Friday's hearing, including one wearing a 'Free Luigi' scarf. The killing also has sent shock waves through the corporate world, rattling executives who say they saw a spike in threats. Judge cancels trial for NYC Mayor Eric Adams but leaves corruption charges intact for now Mangione was arrested in a Pennsylvania McDonald’s on Dec. 9. Police said he was carrying a gun that matched the one used in the shooting and a fake ID. He also was carrying a notebook expressing hostility toward the health insurance industry and especially wealthy executives, authorities said. Thompson, a married father of two high-schoolers, had worked at the giant UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became CEO of its insurance arm in 2021. Defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo argued at his Dec. 23 arraignment that 'warring jurisdictions' had turned Mangione into a 'human Ping-Pong ball.'

Trump fires top US general in unprecedented Pentagon shakeup	(REUTERS) — President Donald Trump on Friday fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General C.Q. Brown, and pushed out five other admirals and generals in an unprecedented shake-up of U.S. military leadership. Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he would nominate retired Lieutenant General Dan 'Razin' Caine to succeed Brown. A former F-16 fighter pilot, Caine was the associate director of military affairs at the Central Intelligence Agency until late last year. Trump will also replace the head of the U.S. Navy, a position held by Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to lead a military service, as well as the air force vice chief of staff and judge advocates general for the Army, Navy and Air Force, the Pentagon said. Trump's decision sets off a period of upheaval at the Pentagon, which was already bracing for mass firings of civilian staff, a dramatic overhaul of its budget and a shift in military deployments under Trump's new America First foreign policy. U.S. Department of Agriculture suspends scholarship program at NC A&amp;T State University, 18 other historically Black colleges, website shows While the Pentagon's civilian leadership changes from one administration to the next, the uniformed members of U.S. armed forces are meant to be apolitical, carrying out the policies of Democratic and Republican administrations. Brown, the second Black officer to become the president's top uniformed military adviser, had been expected to complete his entire four-year term in September 2027. A U.S. official said Brown was relieved with immediate effect, even before the Senate confirms his successor. Reuters in November was first to report that the incoming Trump administration planned a sweeping shakeup of the top brass, with firings including Brown. 'Woke' generals During last year's presidential campaign, Trump spoke of firing 'woke' generals and those responsible for the troubled 2021 pullout from Afghanistan. On Friday, the president did not explain his decision to replace Brown. 'I want to thank General Charles 'CQ' Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I wish a great future for him and his family,' Trump wrote. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had been skeptical of Brown before taking the helm of the Pentagon with a broad agenda that includes eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the military. In his most recent book, Hegseth asked whether Brown would have gotten the job if he were not Black. 'Was it because of his skin color? Or his skill? We'll never know, but always doubt - which on its face seems unfair to CQ. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn't really much matter,' he wrote in his 2024 book 'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.' How much federal data has Trump really purged? Brown, a former fighter pilot with command experience in the Middle East and Asia, recounted his experiences of discrimination in the military in an emotional video posted online after the 2020 killing of George Floyd, which sparked nationwide protests for racial justice. Brown was on official travel when Trump made the announcement. Hours before Trump's post, Brown's official X account had posted images of him meeting troops on the U.S. border with Mexico, deployed in support of Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. 'Border Security has always been critical to the defense of our homeland. As we navigate unprecedented security challenges... we will ensure our troops at the border have everything they need,' Brown posted. A spokesperson for Brown did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Women leaders fired Franchetti was the first woman to command the U.S. Navy. Her 2023 nomination by then-President Joe Biden had been a surprise. Pentagon officials had widely expected the nomination to go to Admiral Samuel Paparo, who at the time led the navy in the Pacific. Paparo was instead promoted to lead the U.S. military's Indo Pacific Command. On his first day in office, Trump fired Admiral Linda Fagan as head of the U.S. Coast Guard. She had been its first female commanding officer. Pentagon says it will cut 5,400 probationary workers starting next week Last month, Trump's Pentagon lashed out Mark Milley, a retired Army general and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by revoking his personal security detail and security clearance. It also removed his portrait from the walls of the Pentagon. Milley, who served as the top U.S. military officer during some of Trump's first presidential term, became a leading critic of him after retiring as a four-star general in 2023 during Biden's administration and has faced death threats.

(NewsNation) — Tom Homan, President Donald Trump's border czar, defended ICE's focus, stating that all illegal entrants into the U.S. are 'absolutely not' treated the same. 'We're prioritizing public safety threats and national security threats,' Homan said on 'CUOMO.' 'We have given ICE instructions. When you look for the bad guy and you find others with him, you will arrest them because they're in the country illegally.' He urged sanctuary cities to allow ICE agents into jails. 'More agents in jail means fewer agents in your neighborhoods.' 'You have forced me into the neighborhoods to find these people. It's safer for the community, and safer for the agents to arrest the bad guy in the jail. And I think the immigrant community is behind me.'

Raids conducted by ICE in cities like Chicago and other cities with high migrant populations began immediately after he took office. Homan said last week that ICE agents arrested about 14,000 migrants during Trump’s first three weeks in the White House, which represented 667 arrests per day. The average was twice that daily in 2024. ICE arrests spiked to about 800-1,200 daily arrests during Trump’s first week in office, but then fell off as migrant detention centers filled up.

Raids conducted by ICE in cities like Chicago and other cities with high migrant populations began immediately after Trump took office. LAFD chief removed over handling of LA fires But amid reports that Trump and his 'border czar' Tom Homan expected between 1,200 and 1,500 arrests to be made per day across the country, the number of migrant apprehensions has diminished in recent weeks. According to reports, the Trump administration was seeking individual ICE offices to make 75 arrests per day. Homan said last week that ICE agents arrested about 14,000 migrants during Trump's first three weeks in the White House, which represented 667 arrests per day. The daily average was twice that being made on a daily basis in 2024. ICE arrests spiked to about 800-1,200 daily arrests during Trump's first week in office, but then fell off as migrant detention centers filled up. Vitello has been reassigned within the agency, multiple media outlets reported on Friday. ICE did not immediately return an email seeking comment from NewsNation on Friday. Vitello has spent more than 23 years with the agency, according to his bio. As acting director, Vitello oversaw a workforce of more than 20,000 people, including federal law enforcement officers, attorneys and mission support personnel, the agency said. Before being appointed the acting director, Vitello most recently served as the assistant director for the Office of Firearms and Tactical programs. The agency said between 2015 and 2020, Vitello earned four ICE Director's Awards in Meritourious Service, Core Value, Protecting the Homeland and Efficiency Through Innovation.

LAFD chief removed over handling of LA fires	(NewsNation) — Kristin Crowley has been removed as chief of the Los Angeles Fire Department, with Chief Deputy Ronnie Villanueva taking over the role on an interim basis. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass cited Crowley's decision-making during the wildfires that devastated the Los Angeles area as the reason for Crowley's removal. 'We know that 1,000 firefighters that could have been on duty the morning the fires broke out were instead sent home on Chief Crowley's watch,' Bass said. 'Furthermore, a necessary step to an investigation was the president of the Fire Commission telling Chief Crowley to do an after-action report on the fires. The chief refused.' Fired USDA worker: We want our country to love us back Villanueva is a 41-year veteran of the LAFD. After seven months of retirement, he is returning as interim chief. He spent 24 of those years in the field on active assignments and also has experience in emergency management. President Donald Trump has been a harsh critic of Bass, the LAFD and California Gov. Gavin Newsom for how the fires were handled and previously suggested he would withhold emergency aid if the state did not take actions he deemed important.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/lafd-chief-fired/	2025-02-21T11:37:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/64e386f3eecae9.19751285.jpeg?w=900
Trump threatens to withhold federal funds from Maine over transge...	President Trump is threatening to withhold federal funds from Maine if it continues allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls’ and women’s sports in defiance of a recent executive order. 'I signed really historic orders to get critical race theory and transgender ideology out of the schools and out of our military. It's all going out. It's no longer,' Trump said Thursday evening in remarks at the Republican Governor’s Association meeting in Washington. 'I heard men are still playing in Maine. Is anybody here from Maine?' Trump said. 'Well, I hate to tell you this, but we're not going to give them any federal money. They are still saying we want men to play in women's sports, and I cannot believe that they're doing that. So, we're not going to give them any federal funding whatsoever until they clean that up.' An executive order Trump signed on Feb. 5 — one of more than 70 issued during his first month back in office — intends to broadly prevent transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports. The order could also complicate the nation’s role as host of the next Summer Olympics because it targets visas for transgender female athletes from abroad. The NCAA, responsible for intercollegiate athletics at more than 1,000 colleges and universities nationwide, barred transgender athletes from women’s college sports because of Trump’s order. The organization’s president, Charlie Baker, a former Republican governor of Massachusetts, previously told a Senate panel that fewer than 10 trans athletes are competing at NCAA member schools. US Army bans transgender people from enlisting But some state athletic associations, including the Maine Principal’s Association, the state’s governing body for high school sports, said it would not comply with Trump’s order, which conflicts with state anti-discrimination laws that include protections for transgender people. 'The executive order and our Maine state Human Rights Act are in conflict, and the Maine Principal's Association will continue to follow state law as it pertains to gender identity,' Mike Burnham, the organization’s executive director, told Maine Public Radio this month. The Education Department has said it is investigating athletic associations in California and Minnesota over their refusal to follow Trump’s order. Trump’s comments at the Republican Governor’s Association meeting come after a Maine state lawmaker criticized a transgender high school athlete on her Facebook page, a move that drew swift criticism from Democratic colleagues, including Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D). The lawmaker, Republican state Rep. Laurel Libby, has called for Maine schools that allow trans athletes to compete in girls’ sports to lose their government funding. 'I think that’s really the only thing that will ensure we have biological females competing in sports against other biological females,' Libby told conservative radio host Todd Starnes on his show this week. 'I don’t think that the Democratic majority is going to listen to reason until money talks, and that includes the federal funding getting yanked for Maine schools.' In a statement, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the state 'will not be intimidated' by Trump’s threat to withhold its federal funds. NJ school board to vote on trans rights vs. parents rights 'If the President attempts to unilaterally deprive Maine school children from the benefit of Federal funding, my Administration and the Attorney General will take appropriate and necessary legal action to restore that funding and the academic opportunity it provides,' she said. 'It is disturbing that President Trump would use children as pawns in advancing his political agenda,' said Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey (D). 'Any attempt by the President to cut federal funding in Maine unless transgender athletes are restricted from playing sports would be illegal and in direct violation of court orders. Fortunately, though, the rule of law still applies in this county, and I will do everything in my power to defend Maine’s laws and block efforts by the President to bully and threaten us.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-threatens-to-withhold-federal-funds-from-maine-over-transgender-athletes/	2025-02-21T11:02:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25050840600604-e1740060734442_25c6c6.jpg?w=900
Judge cancels trial for New York City Mayor Eric Adams but leaves...	NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge on Friday cancelled the corruption trial for New York City Mayor Eric Adams and appointed counsel to advise him on how to handle the Justice Department’s controversial request to drop charges against the Democrat. Judge Dale E. Ho's written order means he won't decide before mid-March whether to grant the dismissal of the case against the embattled mayor of the nation’s largest city. At a hearing Wednesday, Acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove cited an executive order by President Donald Trump outlining his criminal justice priorities as he defended the request to drop charges. Adams confirmed at the hearing that he accepted that charges could later be reinstated, a feature of the request to dismiss charges that has led critics to suggest that the mayor would be required to carry out Trump's plans to round up New Yorkers who are in the country illegally if he wanted to remain free from prosecution. The request is 'virtually unreviewable in this courtroom,' Bove argued. Adams was indicted in September and accused of accepting more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. He faces multiple challengers in June’s Democratic primary. He has pleaded not guilty and has insisted on his innocence. At Wednesday's hearing, Ho raised the possibility that he could appoint a lawyer to advise him on future steps. He did so on Friday when he said he'd appointed Paul Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general and acting U.S. attorney general, as amicus curiae to present arguments on the government's request to throw out the charges. Ho said he wanted all parties and Clement to address the legal standard for dismissing charges, whether a court may consider materials beyond the motion itself and under what circumstances additional procedural steps and further inquiry would be necessary. He also said he wants to know under what circumstances, dismissal can occur without the ability to reinstate charges or with the ability to reinstate charges. He scheduled briefs to be filed by March 7 and, if necessary, oral arguments to occur on March 14. Late Thursday, three former U.S. attorneys — from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — submitted a letter urging Ho to 'hear from parties other than the government and the defendant in deciding about the appropriate next steps.'In court on Wednesday, Adams’ lawyer, Alex Spiro, said no appeals court has ever sided with a judge who rejected an unopposed motion to dismiss a criminal case. Until about 80 years ago, such requests were granted automatically, without a judge weighing in. Adams will not be required to attend future hearings, the judge said. That could help mitigate some political damage for Adams as he could avoid being hauled back to court for hearings while he tries to convince the public that the case isn’t distracting him from running the city. Adams has sought to project calm as questions over his independence have sparked a political crisis in his administration. This week, four of his top deputies resigned and Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that she had for now decided against removing Adams from office but would instead propose legislation to enhance state oversight of City Hall as a way to reestablish trust with New Yorkers Bove's initial request last week to then-interim U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon to drop charges against Adams was rejected and she resigned. Another prosecutor, Hagan Scotten, told Bove in a resignation letter that it would take a 'fool' or a 'coward' to meet Bove’s demand, 'but it was never going to be me.' In all, seven prosecutors, including five high-ranking prosecutors at the Justice Department in Washington, had resigned last week before Bove made the request himself, along with two other prosecutors from Washington, to drop the case. ___ Associated Press Writer Jennifer Peltz and Anthony Izaguirre contributed to this story.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-judge-adjourns-trial-for-new-york-city-mayor-eric-adams-but-appoints-counsel-to-advise-on-next-steps/	2025-02-21T10:55:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP24260589021727-e1727365510874.jpg?w=900
LA County DA to give update on Menendez brothers case	LOS ANGELES (NewsNation) — Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman is expected to provide an update Friday on the Lyle and Erik Menendez case. Hochman met with the brothers’ family in January while he reviewed their bid for freedom 35 years after they were convicted of killing their parents. Hochman, who took office in December, said he had a 'productive session' with the family members, who shared their thoughts on whether the brothers should be released. Luigi Mangione set to appear in NY court in insurance CEO killing Brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez were found guilty of murdering Jose and Kitty Menendez in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Now in their 50s, they began their bid for freedom in recent years after new evidence of their father’s sexual abuse emerged in their case. Their lawyers filed a habeas corpus petition — a request for a court to examine whether someone is being lawfully detained — in May 2023, asking a judge to consider the evidence. The brothers have the support of most of their extended family, who have said they deserve to be free after decades behind bars. Several family members have said that in today’s world — which is more aware of the impact of sexual abuse — the brothers would not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life. At the brothers’ original trials, their defense attorneys argued that they had been sexually abused by their father. Prosecutors denied that and accused them of killing their parents for money. In the years that followed, they repeatedly appealed their convictions without success. The brothers are being held at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/la-county-update-menendez-brothers-case/	2025-02-21T10:37:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-1462340490.jpg?w=900
MLB tests robot umpires ahead of possible integration by 2026	(NewsNation) — MLB's robot umpires won't be rolled out for every game this spring, but they will be in play for Friday's matchup between the Tampa Bay Rays and the New York Yankees at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Florida. It’s called the 'automated ball-strike challenge system,' or ABS. Think of it like football — referees make a call, and coaches can challenge it for review. There's still a home plate umpire, but now players can challenge ball-and-strike calls using a computerized system. Connor McDavid scores in OT to give Canada 3-2 win over United States in 4 Nations Face-Off final The batter, pitcher or catcher simply tap their helmet or cap to challenge — but they only have two seconds. If they challenge, the pitch graphic appears on the scoreboard and broadcast, and the umpire updates the count. MLB says this takes about 17 seconds. MLB has been testing ABS challenges in the minors for the past three seasons, and now it's set to use the system in about 60% of spring games to see how it holds up in the big leagues. If all goes well, fans could see it in regular-season games as early as next year. Thirteen spring training ballparks, home to 19 teams, will be using the ABS system, and every team will have a shot at challenging ball-strike calls at some point this spring. Each team gets two challenges per game — and they keep them if they’re correct. The Chicago Cubs have already used the system twice, which is exactly what MLB wants. It's looking for plenty of feedback from players and managers in order to tweak the system. Rookie QB card could be worth $50K if you pull it from new Topps set Rays outfielder Richie Palacios told NewsNation he’s been messing around with the ABS system for the past couple of years and thinks it should work well. Rays starter Ryan Pepiot said he’s curious to see how it plays out batter to batter but is concerned that it might slow the game down. Minor league testing showed a full season with the ABS system did just that — walks went up, and the pace slowed — but fans and players have said they prefer the challenge system.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/mlb-robot-umpires-spring-games/	2025-02-21T07:51:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2200917591.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — A group of Chicago students are lending their voices to honor Black History Month and learning about the significance of Black culture along the way. Change, power and resilience — that's the message these young voices are spotlighting while coming together to represent Africana music and culture. Uniting Voices Chicago is an afterschool program made up of 3,000 students across 88 Chicago public schools who perform free public shows at the Chicago Symphony Center. Lincoln Park High School student Daelyn Calloway is one of the voices involved. 'Singing songs like this is really exciting because I get to learn more about my culture personally and things that I wouldn't learn about in school about key songs in history, and seeing people gather together is so exciting, seeing stuff that has to do with me,' Calloway told 'Morning in America.' Black-owned barbershop thrives for 50 years as community hub The group’s annual Black Futures Concert series, titled 'Afrofuturism: The Freedom Metropolis,' takes the audience through a journey of Black history, led by conductor Lonnie Norwood. 'We are putting forth the people, the civilization, the ways of knowing, the practices, the momentum. And the memory of those things make us tell their story the way that it's intended to be told,' Norwood said. The show features various genres of music and includes songs such as the 'Black National Anthem' and 'Swing Low.' During the show, the audience is introduced to the character Kendrick and his dream world, where he explores and finds healing through Afrofuturism. Uniting Voices Chicago has been performing for more than 60 years, and Norwood said the group takes pride in knowing diversity still plays a present role in its mission. 19 Black trailblazers that may not have been in your history book 'It was intentional to bring people of diverse backgrounds together to show those adults in the world who didn't know how to live together in harmony,' Norwood said. He said he is excited for the program to grow further and for the impact it will have on generations to come. 'This is really a love letter to the students to let them know that you have the ability right now — not later, but now — to start making real change in your world,' Norwood said. 'You have to start using your imagination and tapping into it. Start being critical thinkers. And we want to just challenge them to see the world first that they want to live in and then just make it happen.' That message has resonated with its students.

Luigi Mangione set to appear in NY court in insurance CEO killing	(NewsNation) — Luigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is set to appear at a court hearing in New York City on Friday.

Luigi Mangione case timeline, from UnitedHealthcare CEO killing to court dates This will be Mangione's first court appearance since December, when the 26-year-old was charged with first-degree murder and killing as an act of terrorism. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. In addition to the state charges, Mangione faces federal charges that could carry the possibility of the death penalty. Authorities say Mangione shot and killed Thompson as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan on Dec 4. He was arrested in Pennsylvania after a five-day search and was extradited to New York City. He is currently being held at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center.

How many people over 100 receive Social Security benefits? 'Powerfully, this support has transcended political, racial, and even class divisions, as mail has flooded MDC from across the country, and around the globe,' Mangione said. Mangione got one of his largest donations from an anonymous donor, citing President Donald Trump’s executive order on the death penalty as their reason for giving. The donor said the death penalty should 'not be politicized.'

Senate adopts budget resolution after marathon overnight vote-a-r...	The Senate on Friday adopted a budget resolution intended to serve as a blueprint to deliver the first part of President Trump’s agenda. Senators voted 52-48 along party lines on the resolution after a marathon overnight voting session. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) voted against the measure. The so-called vote-a-rama lasted about 10 hours, as Democrats sought to dial up the heat on Republicans with dozens of amendments needling the party on taxes and Medicaid. Republicans overwhelmingly voted to turn away or reject the proposals. But Democrats were able to peel off one or two GOP defections as some Republicans bucked their party on a few proposals, including measures aimed at preventing healthcare cuts and reinstating federal workers affected by mass layoffs. The resolution helps pave the way for Republicans to pass roughly $340 billion in funding, including $175 billion in for border operations and immigration enforcement and to carry out Trump’s ambitious deportation plans, as well as $150 billion in defense spending. The vote serves as a marker for Senate Republicans in their ongoing battle with the House GOP over the best way to deliver on Trump’s top priorities. 'This budget resolution is a complete game changer when it comes to securing our border and making our military more lethal. It will allow President Trump to fulfill the promises he made to the American people — a very big deal,' Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a statement after the vote. 'I hope the House can pass one big bill that meets President Trump’s priorities. But this approach provides money that we needed yesterday to continue the momentum on securing our border, enforcing our immigration laws, and rebuilding our military. Time is of the essence.' Trump this week endorsed the House’s one-track plan that includes border and defense spending, combined with an extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and a debt ceiling increase. But GOP leadership in the Senate, backed by a large swath of their conference, are barrelling forward with their preferred two-track process. Senate Republicans say their plan would put key points on the board during Trump’s first 100 days, and point out that 'border czar' Tom Homan and other key officials have been clamoring for an infusion of funds for border and defense. They are also not oozing with optimism that the House will be able to shepherd through what Trump and members have dubbed 'one big, beautiful bill' given the slim margin in the lower chamber and the fractious nature of the House GOP conference. 'I think the probabilities of them running into a roadblock are more than 50-50,' said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). 'It makes it a whole lot easier if we’ve only got one bill to go through. We hope it’s doable for them. But if it’s not, then this is the next best deal. We don’t want to be stuck without any other alternatives. This doesn’t hurt.' 'One of the reasons why we’re doing ours is just in case they can’t get a consensus on their big, beautiful bill, we may have to do it in small, really beautiful bills,' he added. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said ahead of the Thursday night vote that he had previously planned to vote against the measure following Trump’s comments. But he said he switched to a 'yes' after speaking directly with Trump, whom he noted gave 'a nod' toward the Senate plan. 'He made clear to me, however, he wants one big, beautiful bill. He said that two or three times on the phone,' he said. 'So, you know, I think this is maybe better than nothing.' Trump sent out a message on Thursday thanking Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) for working to fund his border agenda on Truth Social as senators began to hunker down for the overnight voting session. 'We are setting records, the likes of which have never been seen before, on stopping criminal illegals aliens from entering our Country,' he said, adding, 'Your work on funding this effort is greatly appreciated!' 'I wasn't going to vote for this unless he supported moving forward,' Hawley later told The Hill. '[Trump] issued a statement in which he said he was in support of the border funding. So, that's good enough for me.' Johnson has laid out an expeditious timeline to pass the single, massive package out of the House by early April with the hopes of it reaching the Resolute Desk by sometime between late April and Memorial Day. Senate Republicans have consistently dubbed that plan as overly ambitious and have cautioned that the single-bill plan will likely take more time. There are also major issues on the tax side that members will be forced to contend with, including whether the cuts that go into effect will be made permanent, which Thune and a number of Senate GOP members have laid out as a red line. The House’s budget resolution currently lays out a $4.5 trillion limit in tax cuts, which would not be enough to cover making those cuts permanent. Questions have also surrounded how Republicans will be able to win these levels of cuts without digging into popular programs, including Medicaid, as hardline conservatives have pressed for spending cuts and taxes to go hand in hand. The House’s budget has called for about $2 trillion in spending reductions, but with the committee charged with overseeing the healthcare program tasked with finding nearly $900 billion in cuts – fueling concerns from even some GOP moderates about potential Medicaid cuts in the lower chamber. Many of those cuts could be aimed at what has become the U.S.’s biggest health insurance program, which has been expanded in 41 states since the Affordable Care Act was passed almost 15 years ago. Fears of potential cuts dominated a chunk of the marathon voting session late Thursday, with Democrats sounding alarm over the program and offering multiple proposals aimed at preventing potential cuts. While most Republicans opposed those measures, a majority of the party voted to back an amendment offered from Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) that he said is aimed at strengthening Medicaid and Medicare. 'People rely on Medicare and Medicaid. Alaskans rely on Medicare and Medicaid, and we are here to strongly support them,' Sullivan said. 'So, we should all agree that we want to weed out waste, fraud, abuse in our healthcare system, including in Medicare and Medicaid, and we must maintain our safety net programs.' However, Democrats roundly rejected the amendment, which called for a deficit neutral reserve fund related 'to protecting Medicare and Medicaid.' Sen. Ron Wyden (R-Ore.) argued the language in the amendment 'is code for kicking Americans with Medicaid coverage off their health insurance if they’re not sick enough, not poor enough, or not disabled enough.' In their race with the House, Senate GOP members are largely for whichever item they are able to pass. They also see value in going through the two-bill exercise to keep the pressure on their colleagues in the lower chamber. 'I’m for whatever can get the 218 [votes] in the House and 51 in the Senate,' Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said about those concerns on Thursday. 'What we’ve been doing in the Senate has been an impetus for the House to take more action.' The House Budget Committee advanced its budget resolution last week and the full chamber is expected to vote on it in the coming days. 'What we’re doing here is responding to the needs that we’re hearing from the president, Tom Homan, [Homeland Security Secretary] Kristi Noem. They need the money to secure the border. They need it now. We need to rebuild the military now. We need to unleash American energy now,' Barrasso continued. 'These are the immediate needs,' he added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/senate-adopts-budget-resolution-after-marathon-overnight-vote-a-rama/	2025-02-21T02:08:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25042747531987-e1740084347233.jpg?w=900
VA Sec. Doug Collins defends veteran’s care, benefits amid layoff...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins said Democrats are trying to 'scare' voters by claiming the agency is 'cutting veterans benefits.' 'No critical services cut. And they keep saying that to scare people because that's the only tool they have left, is to try and scare people,' said Collins. Top Republicans say they trust Collins to lead the department. Democrats, however, have not expressed faith that cutting $98 million through dismissals won’t harm veterans. 8 cartels designated as foreign terror organizations by State Department 'We're not cutting critical health care, we're not cutting health care benefits. We're not cutting benefits,' Collins said on NewsNation’s 'The Hill.' U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth said Wednesday she is seeking answers about how the layoffs may have affected efforts to prevent suicide through the confidential Veterans Crisis Line. In a call with journalists, the Illinois Democrat said her staff heard from VA employees who worked for the crisis line or supported the VA claims process. She said two from Illinois may have been reinstated after she intervened, 'but they’re still locked out of their portal, so I don’t know if they actually have been rehired.' Mangione receives large donation after Trump death penalty order Collins vehemently denied that veteran care was impacted. 'We did not cut any veteran crisis line responders who actually pick up the phone and talk to those who need to talk to a veteran crisis line,' he said.

Judge rules Trump administration can move ahead on mass governmen...	A federal judge Thursday refused a group of government employee unions’ request to block the Trump administration from moving ahead with plans to dramatically reduce the federal workforce. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper ruled that federal law mandates the unions bring their challenge before the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), which adjudicates labor relations within the federal bureaucracy, rather than a federal district court. The decision notches another victory for Trump’s Justice Department, which is defending against dozens of lawsuits challenging a broad range of the president’s executive actions, including the administration’s efforts to slash spending and reshape government agencies. 'The first month of President Trump’s second administration has been defined by an onslaught of executive actions that have caused, some say by design, disruption and even chaos in widespread quarters of American society,' wrote Cooper, an appointee of former President Obama. 'Affected citizens and their advocates have challenged many of these actions on an emergency basis in this Court and others across the country,' he continued. 'Certain of the President’s actions have been temporarily halted; others have been permitted to proceed, at least for the time being. These mixed results should surprise no one.' The unions’ lawsuit challenged mass terminations of probationary employees, the administration’s plans for additional mass layoffs, known as a reduction in force (RIF), and its offer for most federal employees to accept a buyout. Another federal judge previously rejected an attempt to block the buyouts in a separate lawsuit, but litigation against the probationary employee firings remains ongoing after a coalition of unions filed yet another lawsuit Thursday. The case at hand was brought by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), the National Federation of Federal Employees, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the International Federation of Professional &amp; Technical Engineers and United Auto Workers. The unions argued that the administration’s plans violates the separation of powers and regulations for how the federal government can carry out RIFs. Cooper took no position on those issues, instead ruling that the unions brought their challenge in the wrong forum. 'The Court acknowledges that district court review of these sweeping executive actions may be more expedient. But NTEU provides no reason why it could not seek relief from the FLRA on behalf of a class of plaintiffs and admits that it would ask other agencies to follow an administrative judge’s ruling in its favor,' Cooper wrote. Trump fired the FLRA’s Democratic-appointed chair, Susan Grundmann, earlier this month, but she is fighting her termination in court Updated 5:30 p.m.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/judge-rules-trump-administration-can-move-ahead-on-mass-government-layoffs/	2025-02-20T16:04:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/NEPA_022125_AP_Rebecca-Blackwell.jpg?w=900
CEO confidence hits highest point in 3 years: Survey	The confidence of CEOs has hit its highest point in three years, according to a new survey. The survey, from The Conference Board, found a 2025 first quarter 9 point rise in the confidence of CEOs, up to 60. The first quarter point marks a three-year high for CEO confidence, per the survey. 'The improvement in CEO Confidence in the first quarter of 2025 was significant and broad-based,' a senior economist at The Conference Board, Stephanie Guichard, said in a press release. Southwest cutting nearly 1,800 jobs, airline says 'All components of the Measure improved, as CEOs were substantially more optimistic about current economic conditions as well as about future economic conditions—both overall and in their own industries.' President Trump and big tech leaders have recently cozied up with each other, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attending his inauguration. Trump and Musk have been especially close in the last year, with the tech billionaire being heavily involved in the second Trump administration. Forty-four percent in The Conference Board survey said economic conditions have become more preferable 'than six months ago,' whereas in the previous quarter it was 20 percent. The Conference Board survey took place between Jan. 27 and Feb 10., featuring 134 CEOs and The Business Council’s partnership.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/ceo-confidence-survey/	2025-02-20T16:02:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/trump-tariffs-market_AssociatedPress_f80725.jpg?w=900
How many people over 100 receive Social Security benefits?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk have spread claims implying that millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments, but publicly available data proves otherwise. Musk started the rumor over the weekend when he posted a chart on X allegedly showing more than 20 million people over 100 years old listed in 'the Social Security database.' 'These are the numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to FALSE!,' Musk said, joking that 'a lot of vampires' are collecting Social Security. He went on to say the apparent discrepancy might be 'the biggest fraud in history.' Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? Trump repeated the falsehood at a Tuesday press briefing in Florida, saying that 'we have millions and millions of people over 100 years old' receiving Social Security benefits. That's not true. The latest data shows about 90,000 beneficiaries aged 99 or older received a Social Security retirement check in December. That's lower than the estimated 101,000 centenarians living in the U.S. and nowhere close to the 'millions' Trump claimed. Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek tried to clear up the confusion Wednesday. 'The reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits,' Dudek said in a statement. Here's how many people in each age group actually get a retirement check and what to know about Social Security fraud. How many people over 100 years old receive Social Security benefits? Nearly 52 million Americans received retired worker benefits in Dec. 2024, according to data from the Social Security Administration. About 90,000 of those payments, less than 0.2%, went to people aged 99 or older. That's far below the millions Trump and Musk warned about. It's also lower than the number of centenarians living in the U.S., estimated at 101,000 in 2024. In other words, Social Security is not sending checks to millions of dead people over 100. Instead, Musk and Trump appear to be referencing a well-known, longstanding issue with a Social Security system called the 'Numident.' That database listed nearly 19 million Social Security numbers of people 100 or older but not dead, according to a 2023 agency inspector general report. Social Security head resigns following DOGE data request: Reports However, the audit found 'almost none' of those people were receiving Social Security payments. The agency hasn't updated the database because fixing it would cost anywhere from $5.5 to $9.7 million, the report said. There are other safeguards in place to make sure deceased beneficiaries aren't being sent checks. As of 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old. How often does Social Security pay people after they die? Mistakenly paying people after they die does happen, though not nearly to the extent Trump and Musk have suggested. An agency inspector general report from Nov. 2021 found that Social Security issued an estimated $298 million in payments after death to about 24,000 beneficiaries. Those individuals were mistakenly kept in 'suspended payment status' after they died. The audit said the agency recovered about $84 million, leaving an estimated $214 million unrecovered at the time of the report. But fraud wasn't the problem. The audit attributed the mistake to faults in policy and technician errors. Do I get my spouse's Social Security benefits when they die? '[The Social Security Administration] needs to enhance its policy and controls to identify deceased beneficiaries in suspended payment status and ensure technicians take appropriate action to record correct death information on their records,' the report said. The audit said maintaining better death data would help prevent identity fraud, though the inspector general 'did not identify specific instances of fraud.' Most American taxpayers would probably agree that mistakenly paying people after they died is unacceptable, no matter how much money went out. However, the problem wasn't uncovered by Musk or Trump, and the Social Security Administration agreed with the inspector general's recommended solutions back in 2021. The agency was in the process of implementing some of those changes as of last July. Separately, in January, the U.S. Treasury announced that it had clawed back more than $31 million in federal payments that mistakenly went to dead people across various programs, not just Social Security. How big of a problem is Social Security fraud? Experts Newsnation spoke to said Social Security fraud is rare. 'It's a very small issue in that program,' said Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Nowrasteh commended Musk for trying to root out problems but added, 'I don't think it does us any good to try to exaggerate the amount of fraud because the problems with Social Security are primarily not ones of fraud.' Improper payments, however, are a 'longstanding challenge' for the Social Security Administration, but again, that doesn't mean fraud is the main problem. Trump’s plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be costly A July 2024 report from the agency’s inspector general found that Social Security sent about $71.8 billion in improper payments between fiscal years 2015 and 2022 — most of which were overpayments to living people. That nearly $72 billion total represents 0.84% of the roughly $8.6 trillion paid out over the period. A portion of the overpayments have since been recovered; still, Social Security had a $23 billion uncollected overpayment balance at the end of fiscal year 2023, the audit said. Overpayments can happen for many reasons, such as if a person's income is more than they expected, their marital status changes or they don't report accurate information to the Social Security Administration. Social Security's sub-1% error rate is also fairly low compared to a program like Medicaid, which had an improper payment rate of over 5% in fiscal year 2024. Again, most of that was due to administrative mistakes, not fraud. 'If you had to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, Social Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,' said Charles Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University who specializes in Social Security.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/people-over-100-social-security/	2025-02-20T15:11:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Workforce_021525_Illustration_CJAPAdobe.png?w=900
Luigi Mangione case timeline, from UnitedHealthcare CEO killing t...	(NewsNation) — Luigi Mangione is awaiting trial for the killing of Brian Thompson, the former United Healthcare CEO. According to police, this was a planned shooting, and Mangione came to the city from Pennsylvania to conduct it. As Mangione is awaiting several trials to start, here's a detailed breakdown of what happened, according to multiple sources. What happened before the UnitedHealthcare CEO was killed? According to the indictment from December, Mangione arrived in New York City by bus on Nov. 24, 2024. He allegedly checked into the HI New York City Hostel using a fake ID under the name 'Mark Rosario.' He had extended his stay multiple times. Luigi Mangione speaks out for first time, sends message to supporters Mangione allegedly left his hotel on the morning of the shooting and traveled to Midtown Manhattan on an e-bike. The indictment claimed that Mangione stopped at a Starbucks at around 6:15 a.m. to purchase a water bottle and granola bars. Between 6:38 a.m. and 6:44 a.m., Mangione was seen standing silently against a wall across from the Hilton. The indictment said he was fully masked and wearing a hood. UnitedHealthcare CEO killed on streets of New York City On Dec. 4, 2024, UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, 50, was shot in the back and the leg by a masked gunman just before 7 a.m. It happened in front of a Hilton Hotel in New York City, according to officials. Thompson was taken to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting: Who was Brian Thompson? The suspect, Mangione, had allegedly been waiting for Thompson to arrive at the hotel for an investor's meeting. At the time, the New York Police Department was offering a $10,000 reward for information that led to the suspect's arrest. The FBI also offered a $50,000 reward at the time. This was a 'premeditated, preplanned, targeted attack,' New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch had told reporters. The suspect waited behind a parked car until Thompon passed and started shooting. He then ran through an alley, hopped on a bike, and rode through Central Park, according to officials. On the day of the shooting, UnitedHealth Group released a statement, reading in part, 'Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him.' Thompson had become CEO of the company in 2021 but had been with UnitedHealth Group since 2004. Before becoming CEO, he had led government programs for UnitedHealthcare, including Medicare. Mangione arrested in Pennsylvania After days of search, Mangione, 26, was arrested in Pennsylvania on separate weapon charges. New York prosecutors then filed a second-degree murder charge against him a few hours after his arrest. The arrest happened after a customer alerted an Altoona, Pennsylvania, McDonald's employee that Mangione was in the restaurant. Then, that employee called the police. Mangione denied bail A judge denied bail for Mangione in December as his attorneys were working to contest efforts to extradite him to New York from Pennsylvania. The state of Pennsylvania was pursuing a governor's warrant to transfer him. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 23: Luigi Mangione appears for his arraignment at Manhattan Criminal Court on December 23, 2024 in New York City. Mangione, 26, was arraigned on state murder charges in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a Manhattan street on December 4. (Photo by Curtis Means-Pool/Getty Images) As Mangione was escorted into a Pennsylvania courthouse, he shouted to reporters, 'It's completely an injustice and an insult to the American people.' On Dec. 19, Mangione was extradited back to New York City after he agreed during a hearing. Mangione pleads not guilty in UnitedHealthcare killing On Dec. 23, Mangione pleaded not guilty to state murder and terror charges. The district attorney in Manhattan had charged Mangione with several crimes, including: Stalking - Travel in interstate commerce Stalking - Use of interstate facilities Murder through use of a firearm Firearms offense Federal prosecutors also brought their own charges in New York's state trial court. Those charges could come with the death penalty if Mangione is found guilty. The maximum sentence for the state charges would be life without parole. Viral video shows Indiana police punch man during arrest Mangione's next federal court appearance has been scheduled for March 19, according to Newsweek. He will appear for his New York state case on Feb. 21 and for the Pennsylvania case on Feb. 24. Mangione's alleged manifesto Mangione, who had no prior criminal record, allegedly wrote a manifesto that is two to three pages long and talks about the insurance industry. Some quotes include: 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming.' 'I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done.' 'To the Feds, I'll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn't working with anyone.' 1979 cold case murder of Nebraska mother, son solved: Police According to NewsNation local affiliate WPIX, the words 'deny,' 'depose' and 'defend' were written on the shell casings found at the scene. UnitedHealthcare has the highest claim denial rate among insurance companies as of Dec. 2024. The company rejects 32% of submitted claims compared to the industry average of 16%. Reactions to Mangione's arrest, Thompson's death When word of Mangione's arrest started circulating, people on social media started posting in support of him. Dr. Cliff Lampe, professor of information and associate dean for academic affairs in the School of Information at the University of Michigan, told Forbes, 'It's hard to interpret for every individual what these memes mean to them, but in general they seem to represent a frustration with perceived inequities in the healthcare system and to some extent a much broader discontent with growing wealth inequality.' According to Newsweek, a fundraiser that was set up for Mangione has reached $1 million. This fund is supposed to be used for Mangione's legal defense fees. Many of those who made larger donations did so anonymously. In a statement on his website, Mangione said, 'I am overwhelmed by - and grateful for - everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support. Powerfully, this support has transcended political, racial, and even class divisions, as mail has flooded MDC from across the country, and around the globe.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangione-case-timeline/	2025-02-20T14:36:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Luigi-Mangione-1.jpg?w=900
Live: Elon Musk speaking at CPAC in Washington	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Elon Musk, who has become Trump’s close adviser, is set to meet with Argentine President Javier Milei, who is in Washington to attend the Conservative Political Action Conference. Musk was announced as a speaker for CPAC earlier Thursday by Mercedes Schlapp, a CPAC organizer. The scheduled meeting between Musk and Milei was confirmed by a person who insisted on anonymity to discuss an event that hadn’t yet been announced publicly and said the meeting was private and had been planned for weeks. Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after he won the election but before he took office. He was also invited to the inauguration.

Bird flu vaccine for chickens given conditional license from USDA	(NewsNation) — A New Jersey-based company announced last week that it received a conditional license from the United States Department of Agriculture for a bird flu vaccine that can be used for chickens. The company, Zoetis, said this license was granted on the 'demonstration of safety, purity, and reasonable expectation of efficacy based on serology data.' It noted that the decision to vaccinate commercial poultry flocks rests with national regulatory authorities and the industry itself. Mahesh Kumar, senior vice president of global biologics research and development at Zoetis, said in a statement that scientists began updating their previous bird flu vaccine when a new strain was identified in the U.S. three years ago. Elon Musk responds to DOGE check suggestion. What do we know? 'Our readiness with this most recent vaccine is another example of how we continue to live our purpose to nurture the world and humankind by advancing care for animals, ultimately providing solutions to global animal health challenges,' Kumar said. A USDA spokesperson told NBC News this conditional license doesn’t mean the vaccine has been approved for commercial use and that poultry farmers cannot yet purchase it. 'This is simply a normal step in the research and development phase, not in the implementation of a vaccine strategy,' the USDA spokesperson said. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins is expected 'in the coming days' to announce a new strategy to fight the flu, a USDA spokesperson said to NBC, though they did not say whether vaccines were included in this. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? Bird flu is currently widespread among wild birds worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States, there have been outbreaks in poultry and dairy cows. Currently, there are 69 cases of bird flu in the U.S. and one reported death. There is no person-to-person spread, and the current public health risk is low, the CDC says. However, a recently released report by the CDC said the virus may be going undetected in humans. Specifically, the report suggests the spread of bird flu between dairy cattle and humans has gone unchecked. This news comes as the Trump Administration froze external communications from the agency, which interrupted the agency’s weekly report.

IRS to lay off 6,700 probationary workers	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The Internal Revenue Service will lay off 6,700 workers in Washington, D.C., and around the U.S. beginning Thursday, a government official told NewsNation. As of May 2024, the agency had more than 94,000 employees. About 1 out of every 7 of them have been on the job for a year or less. Another 1 of 7 have been employed there for one to two years. Making fast money on vending machines: Is it that easy? The layoffs are part of the administration's intensified efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection. They come despite IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season being told earlier this month that they would not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until mid-May after the taxpayer filing deadline. It's unclear how the layoffs may affect tax collection services this year. As the nation's revenue collector, the IRS was tasked during the Biden administration with targeting high-wealth tax evaders for an additional stream of income to the U.S., which is $36 trillion in debt. By the end of 2024, the IRS collected over $1.3 billion in back taxes from wealthy tax dodgers. Vance at CPAC: Europe ‘on the cusp of peace’ amid US talks with Russia In addition to the planned layoffs, the Trump administration intends to lend IRS workers to the Department of Homeland Security to assist with immigration enforcement. In a letter sent earlier this month, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to borrow IRS workers to help with ongoing immigration crackdown efforts. Representatives from the IRS and U.S. Treasury did not respond to requests for comment from NewsNation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/irs-layoffs-probationary-workers/	2025-02-20T11:54:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6724fb5ea2d7f2.14471130.jpeg?w=900
Senate confirms Kash Patel to lead FBI	The Senate on Thursday confirmed Kash Patel to serve as the head of the FBI, approving a pick with a string of controversial statements who has been accused by Democrats of directing a purge of bureau employees. Patel was confirmed in a 51-49 vote. Two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Main) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), voted against confirmation. Patel has said he would 'shut down' FBI headquarters on his first day in office and turn it into a 'museum to the deep state.' He’s alarmed Democrats by including a list of 'government gangsters' in a book he wrote by the same name. And Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Patel 'likely committed perjury' when he denied having insight into FBI firings that came the very next day. Durbin in a lengthy floor speech at turns called Patel 'vindictive,' 'dangerously politically extreme,' and warned Republicans 'will come to regret this vote, probably sooner rather than later.' 'When I think of giving this man a 10-year tenure as director of the leading criminal investigative agency in the world, I cannot imagine a worse choice. You want the person has that job and that power to destroy people simply by investigation to show some temperament and some judgment,' Durbin said. 'Kash Patel shows just the opposite.' FBI directors are confirmed to a 10-year term, but Patel was nominated shortly after President Trump was re-elected, a sign the returning executive planned to fire former FBI Director Christopher Wray ahead of the end of his term in 2027. A former public defender, Patel got his start in the political realm as a staffer to then-House Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). Patel played a key role there in seeking to discredit the committee Democrats’ investigation of Trump’s ties to Russia. That included authoring a report analyzing FBI and Justice Department responses in their own investigations of Russian election interference. That experience also inspired him to write a series of children's books, with a synopsis referencing 'a sinister cabal' that 'plotted to overthrow a president,' while Patel 'reveals how we can defeat the Deep State, reassert self-government, and restore our democracy.' That has sparked accusations from Democrats that Patel was chosen not for his skills but for his loyalty. Durbin referred a whistleblower tip to the Justice Department inspector general he said demonstrates Patel has already taken steps to carry out retribution, pointing to the firing of senior career FBI leaders. The Justice Department has since asked for a detailed list of all FBI employees who had a hand in the more than 1,500 cases brought against those in connection with the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6. Collins cited a purge of FBI staff as part of her rationale for not backing Patel, saying that, as well as his history of politically charged statements, 'cast doubt on Mr. Patel’s ability to advance the FBI’s law enforcement mission in a way that is free from the appearance of political motivation.' Murkowski did the same. 'My reservations with Mr. Patel stem from his own prior political activities and how they may influence his leadership. The FBI must be trusted as the federal agency that roots out crime and corruption, not focused on settling political scores,' she wrote on X amid the vote. 'I have been disappointed that when he had the opportunity to push back on the administration’s decision to force the FBI to provide a list of agents involved in the January 6 investigations and prosecutions, he failed to do so.' Most Republicans, however, see Patel as the right figure to turn around an FBI they’ve accused of being politicized and weaponized against Republicans. 'At the heart of their opposition is a fear that he’ll act like Democrats did when Democrats were in power. These Democrats are afraid the FBI, under Mr. Patel’s leadership, will use lawfare against political opponents, like the FBI used lawfare against President Trump and others,' Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a Wednesday night speech in favor of Patel. 'After reviewing Mr. Patel’s record and listening to his testimony at his hearing, I’m convinced these fears that the Democrats have are unfounded. Mr. Patel’s leadership will not be business as usual at the FBI, as it has been in previous administrations when the FBI – the people on the seventh floor, not the local agents – were used for political weaponization.' Patel served in a number of national security positions under the first Trump administration, taking on roles at the Department of Defense, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Council. But he often butted heads with other members of Trump’s team, with Democrats repeatedly pointing to criticism of Patel from former Attorney General Bill Barr and national security adviser John Bolton, who have both since become frequent Trump critics. Since leaving the Trump administration, he’s appeared on a series of right-wing podcasts and started a foundation that did fundraising for charity alongside a group of jailed Jan. 6 defendants who sold a recording of them singing the national anthem to raise money. Patel denied involvement in the matter during his confirmation hearing, despite previously boasting of helping the group record and distribute the track, including in social media posts. It was one example of many cases in which Patel dodged or demurred when asked about past controversial statements. 'We gave Mr. Patel numerous opportunities to explain, to walk back his threats. He chose not to, nor did he try to explain his so-called Deep State list of former government officials,' Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Thursday. 'He repeatedly misled the committee, dodged questions and claimed ignorance, claimed he didn't remember things he'd said just a few months before. Why would you want someone in the FBI doesn't remember things they said only a few months before? This is irresponsible at best and deceitful at worst.'

Could Los Angeles become the rattiest city in the United States?	(NewsNation) — California is the only state to ban the most lethal type of rat poison, so more rodents are living large these days, especially in Los Angeles. According to pest control experts, the rat population is booming, and service calls are way up. NewsNation headed out with rodent expert Louis Rico, and it took just 30 seconds for him to spot a rat burrow in someone’s front yard. The rodent residents were not home. Michael Strahan leaving GMA by summer: NewsNation exclusive Proponents had pushed for the ban on 'anticoagulant rodenticides' to protect pets and wildlife that might feed off toxic dead rats. When Gov. Gavin Newsom first signed the law, J.P. Rose, Urban Wildlands policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement that it was a 'relief to know the deadliest rat poisons will soon be off the market here.' 'This important legislation shows why California is an environmental leader. We’re willing to fight for wildlife protections,' Rose said in a statement. 'Birds, foxes and pumas shouldn’t be sacrificed every time there’s a pest problem.' However, according to exterminators, other types of extermination techniques just aren’t as effective as anticoagulant rodenticides. As a result, there has been a ballooning rodent population. Some say this could lead to a potential public health crisis. Chicago has claimed the top spot as the United States' rattiest city for 10 years straight, and Los Angeles is at No. 2. New York City is ranked third in cities with the most rats. San Francisco and Washington, D.C., round out the top five. The California rodenticide ban could mean a change is underway. 'My prediction is that probably by the end of the year, we will become the rattiest city in the United States, for sure,' Rico, owner of American Rat Control in Los Angeles, said. 'I’m wishing, hoping that we can get some of the old rodenticide back. That really worked.' The Southern California wildfires are another factor in the booming rat population. Social Security funds under Trump could run out in 6 years: Analysis Many people were displaced during the deadly blaze, and rodents have been as well, so many have made their way into surrounding communities. Rat sightings are up in San Francisco as well, prompting a column just yesterday in SFist on whether that city needs a rat czar like the one in New York City. In a single year, just two rats can produce thousands of offspring. Female rats can start reproducing five weeks after birth, and each can deliver litters of up to 12 every month. This is why many are pushing for more aggressive efforts in rat birth control, along with higher public awareness to combat habits that attract rats, like leaving out bird seed, pet food and garbage.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/los-angeles-rat-population/	2025-02-20T11:18:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-525973077-e1729628605321.jpg?w=800
Trump's executive order on independent agencies: What does it mea...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump’s executive order shifting independent agencies to fall under his authority appears to be a strategic move to put the definition of the president's scope of power in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court, legal experts say. Trump issued an order Tuesday requiring agencies that have long been congressionally authorized to be independent from the White House to now answer to him. This includes the Federal Communication Commission, the Postal Service and the Federal Trade Commission. The move follows a legal idea called the 'unitary executive' theory, which places executive authority on the president at the expense of Congress, according to Cornell University's Legal Information Institute. What has Trump accomplished during the first month of his second term? The Supreme Court has already shown a willingness to embrace the theory, and Trump’s presidency could be what tips the scale, Jeffrey Lubbers, a professor of administrative law at American University's Washington College of Law, told NewsNation. The nation's highest court has been trending towards this doctrine through several recent decisions, most notably its ruling to grant presidents absolute immunity from prosecution for official acts. The case stemmed from the Justice Department’s effort to prosecute Trump for allegedly trying to block the results of the 2020 election. 'It's all part of an overall strategy to take control of these 20 or 25 regulatory agencies that issue some important regulations,' he said. 'But Trump wants to do it sort of as a matter of constitutional law so that he, as president, has control over all of them.' The White House has described Trump’s directive as 'ensuring that all federal agencies are accountable to the American people, as required by the Constitution.'

(Alex Brandon, Associated Press) What will happen to independent agencies in the short term? Trump has already installed Republicans to head many of these agencies, but his order takes control further, Lubbers said. These agencies will likely pull back on regulations that are pending, not enforce laws that were put forth during the Biden administration and act with less regulatory oversight, he argued. 'It's all part of trying to bring these independent agencies under the same control as the Cabinet departments and agencies that fall under the president,' he said. Many of these agencies function as multimember commissions that vote on decisions with both Republican and Democratic-appointed members to ensure fair application of the law. Trump’s plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be costly Several presidents have maintained this boundary for decades. Trump's order aims to do away with that as part of a broader push to assert authority over the government by possibly limiting the spending of congressionally approved funds, which could set up lawsuits and lead courts to step in, Shawn Donahue, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo, said. Under Trump’s order, the White House Office of Management and Budget would set performance standards and management objectives for the heads of independent agencies. The OMB could also change the funding apportioned to the agencies that might be in conflict with the president’s agenda. The heads of independent agencies would need to have special White House liaisons to coordinate with the president’s aides and advisers. Trump has already fired leaders serving terms at several independent agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Federal Labor Relations Authority. These firings have already been challenged in court.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) 'The long-term game [for Trump] is basically that eventually the court's going to start cutting back the powers of these independent agencies, and they signaled that already,' Lubbers said. 'But the short game for him is that he wants to get control right away, and that's why he's acting so fast.' Trump’s order is another road to the Supreme Court Trump’s executive order appears to be a path to the Supreme Court, which will be tasked with deciding how much power the president should have, Donahue said. 'It definitely seems like this is flowing into the unitary executive theory that says Congress really doesn't have that much of a role in setting up independent agencies. It's more up to the executive branch to have those things align with them,' he said. According to the unitary executive theory, the president possesses sole authority over the executive branch. The most controversial aspect of the theory is the president’s removal power, which allows them to remove any appointed subordinate officials of the executive branch. Advancing Trump agenda essential for American dream: Sen. Cassidy Trump likely believes he has a good shot with the Supreme Court ruling in his favor, and this appears to be one of his roads to get to them, Donahue said. The Supreme Court has been more open to expanding executive power, especially under the Trump administration, but also going after 'the administrative state,' Donahue said, referring to a court’s ruling last year that rejected a 40-year-old legal doctrine that effectively reduced the power of executive branch agencies. Some of these departments, like the FTC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, had been set up for almost 100 years to be independent, so this theory would turn that on its head, he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-order-independent-agencies/	2025-02-20T11:11:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a3f8319466e2.45436000.jpeg?w=900
State Dept. designates 8 cartels as foreign terror organizations	(NewsNation) — The Trump administration's immigration plans are shaping up, and this week, the State Department designated eight Latin American groups as foreign terrorist organizations. The groups include Venezuela-based Tren de Aragua, MS-13 from El Salvador and six groups based in Mexico, including the Sinaloa cartel. Billionaire Elon Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has also floated the idea of drone strikes against cartels. Congress would need to sign off on such an operation and give final approval. Democratic rep questions military medical deployment to Cuba The Trump administration may begin dismantling the groups inside the U.S. as they are believed to be active across the country. The Drug Enforcement Agency says the cartel is present in all 50 states. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, said he believes Tren de Aragua is present across the U.S. as well. Now that these groups have been designated as foreign terror organizations, there are legal ramifications for anyone who tries to help them, including U.S. citizens. Family members or associates of FTOs living in the U.S. are also eligible for removal and deportation. The Treasury Department will also be able to block asset transactions from the FTOs. Yesterday, a suspected TDA gang member was arrested in the Denver area for possession of a firearm. With this new designation, retired Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Victor Avila says individuals who are arrested in the U.S. with a connection to one of these groups are likely to wind up in Guantanamo Bay. Asylum-seekers: ‘The American dream is over’ 'This categorizes them, just like ISIS, al Qaeda, the Taliban,' Avila said. 'They're going to get picked up in places with different charges.' Avila said that he knows people will want them removed immediately, but he thinks the government should make an example of individuals found to be connected to an FTO. 'You're a terrorist or financing a terrorist organization. You get picked up under terrorist charges, maybe your next trip is to Gitmo, that's where we keep terrorists,' he said. Avila also said while people think military intervention is the first step in dealing with these groups, it's actually the final step. They have already done a lot of recon missions along the border and have already deployed troops, moving pieces in place to go after cartels. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has been given a month to come up with a plan to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and immigrants to the U.S. CIA expands drone flights over Mexico to locate cartels: Report Mexico has surged about 10,000 troops to the border, and the country is going after fentanyl labs, but Trump has said he wants Mexico to do more. Two generals from the U.S. and Mexico signed a joint statement of agreement to collaborate with each other, creating a pathway for open communication between the two nations. The CIA is also using Reaper drones to covertly hunt for cartels in their fentanyl labs, which Sheinbaum acknowledged was part of a coordinated effort between the U.S. and Mexico that has been going on for years.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/cartels-designated-foreign-terrorist-organizations/	2025-02-20T11:03:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GiWjQD4XEAALF34.jpg?w=360
Mitch McConnell won't seek reelection in 2026	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell is announcing on Thursday that he won’t seek reelection next year, ending a decadeslong tenure as a power broker who championed conservative causes but ultimately ceded ground to the fierce GOP populism of President Donald Trump. McConnell, the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history, chose his 83rd birthday to share his decision not to run for another term in Kentucky and to retire when his current term ends. He informed The Associated Press of his decision before he was set to address colleagues in a speech on the Senate floor. His announcement begins the epilogue of a storied career as a master strategist, one in which he helped forge a conservative Supreme Court and steered the Senate through tax cuts, presidential impeachment trials and fierce political fights. Trump Education pick Linda McMahon clears committee, heads to full Senate 'Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate,' McConnell said in prepared remarks provided in advance to the AP. 'Every day in between I’ve been humbled by the trust they’ve placed in me to do their business here. Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.' McConnell, first elected in 1984, intends to serve the remainder of his term ending in January 2027. The Kentuckian has dealt with a series of medical episodes in recent years, including injuries sustained from falls and times when his face briefly froze while he was speaking. The senator plans to deliver his speech in a chamber the famously taciturn McConnell revered as a young intern long before joining its back benches as a freshman lawmaker in the mid-1980s. His dramatic announcement comes almost a year after his decision to relinquish his leadership post after the November 2024 election. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a top McConnell deputy, replaced him as majority leader. McConnell's looming departure reflects the changing dynamics of the Trump-led GOP. He's seen his power diminish on a parallel track with both his health and his relationship with Trump, who once praised him as an ally but has taken to criticizing him in caustic terms. In Kentucky, McConnell's departure will mark the loss of a powerful advocate and will set off a competitive GOP primary next year for what will now be an open Senate seat. Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, seen as a rising star in his party for winning statewide office in Republican territory, has said he has no interest in the Senate, though he is widely viewed as a contender for higher office. McConnell, a diehard adherent to Ronald Reagan’s brand of traditional conservatism and muscular foreign policy, increasingly found himself out of step with a GOP shifting toward the fiery, often isolationist populism espoused by Trump. McConnell still champions providing Ukraine with weapons and other aid to fend off Russia’s invasion, even as Trump ratchets up criticism of the country and its leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The senator plans to make it clear Thursday that national defense remains at the forefront of his agenda. 'Thanks to Ronald Reagan’s determination, the work of strengthening American hard power was well underway when I arrived in the Senate,' McConnell said in his prepared remarks. 'But since then, we’ve allowed that power to atrophy. And today, a dangerous world threatens to outpace the work of rebuilding it. So, lest any of our colleagues still doubt my intentions for the remainder of my term: I have some unfinished business to attend to.' McConnell and Trump were partners during Trump's first term, but the relationship was severed after McConnell blamed Trump for 'disgraceful' acts in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack by his supporters. A momentary thaw in 2024 when McConnell endorsed Trump didn't last. Last week, Trump referred to McConnell as a 'very bitter guy' after McConnell, who battled polio as a child, opposed vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation as the nation’s top health official. McConnell referred to Trump as a 'despicable human being' and a 'narcissist' in a biography of the senator by The Associated Press' deputy Washington bureau chief, Michael Tackett. Before their falling out, Trump and McConnell pushed through a tax overhaul largely focused on reductions for businesses and higher-earning taxpayers. They joined forces to reshape the Supreme Court when Trump nominated three justices and McConnell guided them to Senate confirmation, tilting the high court to the right. McConnell set a new precedent for hardball partisan tactics in 2016 by refusing to even give a hearing to Democratic President Barack Obama’s pick of Merrick Garland to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Putting the brakes on the Senate's 'advise and consent' role for judicial nominees, McConnell said the vacancy should be filled by the next president so voters could have their say. Trump filled the vacancy once he took office, and McConnell later called the stonewalling of Garland's nomination his 'most consequential' achievement. Later, when liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died weeks before the 2020 presidential election won by Democrat Joe Biden, McConnell rushed Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation through the Senate, waving off allegations of hypocrisy. What is the DOGE check being floated on X? McConnell also guided the Senate — and Trump — through two impeachment trials that ended in acquittals. In the second impeachment, weeks after the deadly Capitol attack by a mob hoping to overturn Trump’s 2020 reelection defeat, McConnell joined all but seven Republicans in voting to acquit. McConnell said he believed Trump couldn’t be convicted because he’d already left office, but the senator also condemned Trump as 'practically and morally responsible' for the insurrection. McConnell over the years swung back and forth from majority to minority leader, depending on which party held power. He defended President George W. Bush’s handling of the Iraq war and failed to block Obama’s health care overhaul. McConnell, the longest-serving senator ever from Kentucky, ensured that the Bluegrass State received plenty of federal funding. Back home he was a key architect in his party's rise to power in a state long dominated by Democrats. He is married to Elaine Chao, and they have long been a power couple in Washington. In his prepared remarks Thursday, the senator referred to her as his 'ultimate teammate and confidante.' Chao was labor secretary for Bush and transportation secretary during Trump's first term, though she resigned after the Capitol insurrection, saying it had 'deeply troubled' her. McConnell's parting words reflected his devotion to the Senate and his disdain for his detractors. 'The Senate is still equipped for work of great consequence,' he said. 'And, to the disappointment of my critics, I’m still here on the job.' ___ Follow the AP's coverage of Mitch McConnell at https://apnews.com/hub/mitch-mcconnell.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-sen-mitch-mcconnell-wont-seek-reelection-in-2026-ending-long-tenure-as-republican-power-broker/	2025-02-20T08:15:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b7556f549ed6.26807974.jpeg?w=900
What has Trump accomplished during the first month of his second ...	(NewsNation) — In the first month of his second term, President Donald Trump has signed dozens of executive orders targeting issues ranging from immigration to gender identity, while his administration has held near-daily impromptu news conferences and multiple meetings with foreign leaders. Sources told NewsNation it feels like it has been 100 days since Trump took office, instead of just over 30. They expect more action in the coming days from the president, including a push to work more closely with Congress. Trump has teased an upcoming meeting with Democrats at the White House. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? Executive orders On his first day in office, Trump signed 26 executive orders. Comparatively, he signed 33 during his first 100 days in 2017. Many of the executive orders Trump has signed so far are aimed at immigration, including one that declared a national emergency at the southern border and directed the Department of Defense to send 1,500 troops to the area, adding to the 2,500 already there. Military helicopters have been deployed to deport migrants, and Immigration and Communications Enforcement officers have been conducting large-scale operations in cities across the United States. 'I think they're doing a great job. You know, you have people that are hiding. We have professionals that hiding,' Trump said of the ICE raids. NTSB investigating midair collision in Arizona The moves come as Trump reportedly expands the CIA’s use of drone surveillance flights over Mexico. The White House recently designated drug cartels and other transnational criminal groups as terrorist organizations. Other executive orders have aimed at diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government and educational institutions. Some private companies have reversed their DEI-related programs as a result. Federal agencies have also been directed to use sex, not gender, in federal policies and documents. Another executive order banned transgender athletes from competing in girls and women’s sports. Efficiency within the government Trump also created the Department of Government Efficiency, which he said would 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy were tapped to lead DOGE after Trump’s reelection. However, Ramaswamy has since left the department, and the White House has said in legal documents that Musk is not actually in charge at DOGE but is instead an adviser to the president. Members of DOGE reportedly gained access to sensitive and classified data, which has sparked concern from lawmakers. The Associated Press recently reported that DOGE gained access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security systems. DOGE agents also gained access to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency said this month. New York Magazine reported at least one DOGE worker has been to the Commerce Department’s Maryland headquarters, where they gained access to the agency’s IT system. Additionally, DOGE took control of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s funding, locked out workers, accessed classified information and removed leadership. Elon Musk responds to DOGE check suggestion. What do we know? A lawsuit filed by 14 Democratic states challenged DOGE’s authority to access sensitive government data. The attorneys general argued Musk has power that can only be given to those elected or confirmed through the Senate. While U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan said there are legitimate questions about Musk’s authority, she refused to issue a temporary restraining order blocking him from accessing government data systems or participating in worker layoffs. With federal cuts have come layoffs and firings. While no official number of those terminated has been made available, the Associated Press estimates that thousands of federal employees have been shown the door in the wake of Trump's directives. About 77,000 federal employees have accepted a deferred resignation offer spearheaded by the Trump administration. Despite court-ordered deadline extensions, U.S. District Court Judge George O’Toole ultimately declined to further pause the program, allowing the government to proceed. Cabinet picks A number of Trump’s picks for his Cabinet have been confirmed by the Senate, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Attorney General Pam Bondi; Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy; Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth; Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Hegseth is headed to Guantanamo Bay on Thursday as the U.S. ramps up migrant detention operations at the military outpost in Cuba. The visit comes one day after House Democrats sent Hegseth a letter asking why military resources such as aircraft and doctors are being diverted to the base.

Making fast money on vending machines: Is it that easy?	(NewsNation) — More Americans are picking up side hustles, and vending machines are being touted on social media as a simple way to generate 'passive' income. How-to videos on TikTok and YouTube show vending entrepreneurs unloading bricks of cash. The short, punchy clips have racked up millions of views and explain how others can turn 'snacks into stacks' with little effort. With roughly 3 million vending machines across the U.S., the sector is worth an estimated $18.2 billion, according to the NAMA Foundation’s 2022-2023 industry census report. Are millions of dead people receiving Social Security benefits? So, how hard is it to get in on the action? Claim: Vending machines are a simple, lucrative side hustle Vending how-tos on TikTok and YouTube have clicky, eye-catching titles that give the impression business is booming: 'He turned vending machines into a $500k business' (TikTok) '6 months in vending business and already made $10k' (TikTok) '2-Day Workweek Earns $700K - Vending Machine Business' (YouTube) One YouTube short with over 58 million views claims to show the start-up process from start to finish. The user says he bought five used vending machines for $4,000, loaded them up with inventory from Costco and then profited $750 per month for two hours of work. How the vending machine side hustle works Social media makes getting started look easy: buy a machine, put it somewhere with foot traffic, stock it with stuff people want and swing by occasionally to collect your cash. The videos follow a similar pattern. Vending entrepreneurs unlock their machines, pull out the cash and see which snacks or drinks are running low. From there, influencers head to big box stores like Costco or Sam’s Club to replenish their machines. Viewers get the sense that there’s little time and energy involved. What they’re not telling you about vending machines The location of the vending machines is everything 'The biggest difficulty is finding a good location and negotiating with the owner,' said Brandon Schlichter, who has two dozen vending machines across central Ohio. What are OASDI taxes? They help fund your retirement Schlichter estimates his machines bring in $3,000 to $3,500 a month — about $100 to $150 each. After factoring in costs like inventory and electricity, he said he makes around $2,000 in profit across all 24 units. 'It’s a nice little side piece of income. I’ve done well with it,' said Schlichter, a serial entrepreneur who shares business tips with nearly 2 million subscribers on his YouTube channel 'Investment Joy.' Schlichter’s machines are spread across laundromats, car washes and rental properties. Negotiating is also important Foot traffic is one factor to consider, but negotiating favorable terms with a building owner is just as important. There is no standard playbook. Some landlords charge rent to host a machine, while others may ask for a commission. 'If you're a good salesperson, you can get a location for free,' Schlichter said. 'It's a sales pitch to a business owner to get more foot traffic.' Manufacturing plants were the most popular location in 2023, making up 40% of the vending machine market, according to Automatic Merchandiser’s State of the Industry report. Offices were the second most common location at 21.5%, followed by colleges and universities at 9.2%. John Talbott, a senior lecturer focusing on retail at Indiana University, recommends scouting out locations and talking with potential landlords before buying a machine. 'Before I would invest, I'd walk around and I'd have 20 deals cut with somebody that said, ‘Yeah, you can bring one in,’' he said. Choose the right product for the vending machine Once you have a location, you’ll have to decide what to put in it. One common mistake is stocking your machine based on what you like, which can be a 'recipe for disaster,' Schlichter said. 'I've run into people that went and bought thousands of dollars worth of product for a vending machine, thinking that they could convert a factory to healthy foods, and then everything expired,' he said. Simple savings: Ways to save money when eating out Cold beverage machines are the most common and accounted for 27% of vending sales last year, the most of any category, according to Automatic Merchandiser’s report. Snacks were the second-largest product category (17%) by revenue, followed by candy (14%). As far as inventory, small operators often buy in bulk at stores like Costco and Sam’s Club. 'I know people that are in high volume, high traffic locations, and they're taking that 25-cent bag of chips, and they're reselling it for $1.50,' Schlichter said. A final point: scale matters. The more machines you have, the more money you’ll make. 'You're not going to really make a lot of money off one machine,' Talbott said. Big picture: How many people are buying vending machines? Vending machines have a relatively low barrier to entry, which makes them competitive. Schlichter said used machines can cost anywhere from $500 to $2,000 on eBay and Facebook Marketplace. New machines are more expensive, costing about $3,500 to $6,800 at Sam’s Club. Small-time operators may be less common than social media makes it seem. The NAMA Foundation found that the 'typical' operator maintains 277 machines. NAMA estimates the typical operator generates around $6,000 in revenue per machine annually, about $500 a month. At the end of the day, Schlichter sees vending machines as a low-risk endeavor that, like any other business, requires hard work and practice. 'The only way that you learn is to go out and do it,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/vending-machines-get-rich-quick-is-it-that-easy/	2025-02-20T06:59:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/image-7.png?w=900

Multiple states pushing to ban or restrict mRNA vaccines	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump's new 'Make America Healthy Again' commission is reviewing certain vaccines and possible links to chronic illnesses as some states push to restrict the use of COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccines using messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology became widespread during the pandemic. With limited long-term studies available, the Trump administration is revisiting these vaccines. RFK Jr. eyes childhood vaccine schedule review, says ‘nothing off limits’ What are mRNA vaccines? Vaccines using mRNA are based on RNA technology that dates back to the 1960s. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Pfizer and Moderna used the technology, which teaches the immune system to fight the virus without containing the virus itself, for their COVID-19 vaccines. Essentially, mRNA vaccines aim to boost the immune system's ability to defend against various diseases. Three states are independently addressing safety concerns related to mRNA vaccines. States considering mRNA vaccine bans In Idaho, lawmakers are considering Senate Bill 1036, known as the Doug Cameron Act, which seeks a 10-year pause on 'gene therapy immunizations to ensure the safety and well-being of all Idahoans.' The bill, named after an Idaho rancher who claims he became paralyzed in 2021 after taking the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, also seeks to ban RNA-based immunizations. On Monday, Idaho's Senate Health and Welfare Committee heard arguments regarding the bill for two hours but did not vote on it. In Montana, lawmakers considered similar legislation, but House Bill 371 failed after 66 representatives voted against it, with 34 in favor. In Florida, State Surgeon General Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo has urged doctors to stop recommending mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. What to know about measles outbreaks in the Southwest He raised concerns about 'nucleic acid contaminants' in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, suggesting these could introduce 'contaminant DNA' into human cells and increase cancer risks. In December, the FDA responded to a letter from Ladapo outlining the same concerns. Officials dismissed the claims as 'quite implausible' and 'misleading.' Doctor: 'You can't hold back science' Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases professor at Vanderbilt University, compared banning mRNA technology to banning artificial intelligence. 'The radio was fine, the telephone was good, the computer is better, but we're not going to do AI; we're going to ban it. So you can't hold back science. Science is constantly advancing and creating newer and better and more effective vaccines. mRNA vaccines are an example of that,' he said. A new experimental mRNA vaccine could help manage the outbreak of bird flu seen in birds and cattle, and also prevent human infections.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/mahas-multiple-states-push-mrna-vaccine-ban/	2025-02-20T05:24:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/10/651aef5172dc16.50093677.jpeg?w=900
Hamas returns bodies of 4 Israeli hostages said to include mother...	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas on Thursday released the bodies of four Israeli hostages, said to include a mother and her two children who have long been feared dead and had come to embody the nation's agony following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. The remains were said to be of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, as well as Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted. Kfir, who was 9 months old when he was taken, was the youngest captive. Hamas has said all four were killed along with their guards in Israeli airstrikes. 'Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters,' Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement. 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely.' Netanyahu appoints an adviser with Trump ties to lead ceasefire talks The militants displayed four black coffins on a stage in the Gaza Strip surrounded by banners, including a large one depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a vampire. Thousands of people, including large numbers of masked and armed militants, looked on as the coffins were loaded onto Red Cross vehicles before being driven to Israeli forces. The military planned to hold a small funeral ceremony, at the request of the families, before transferring the bodies to a laboratory for formal identification using DNA, a process that could take up to two days. Only then will the families be given the final notification. Israeli channels did not broadcast the handover. In Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, where Israelis have gathered to watch the release of living hostages, a large screen showed a compilation of photos and videos of Lifshitz and the Bibas family, including a chuckling baby Kfir and the family dressed up in Batman costumes. Israelis have celebrated the return of 24 living hostages in recent weeks under a tenuous ceasefire that paused over 15 months of war. But the handover on Thursday was a grim reminder of those who died in captivity as the talks leading up to the truce dragged on for over a year. It could also provide impetus for negotiations on the second stage of the ceasefire that have hardly begun. The first phase is set to end at the beginning of March. Infant was the youngest taken hostage Kfir Bibas was just 9 months old, a red-headed infant with a toothless smile, when militants stormed into the family’s home on Oct. 7, 2023. His brother Ariel was 4. Video shot that day showed a terrified Shiri swaddling the two boys as militants led them into Gaza. Her husband, Yarden Bibas, was taken separately and released this month after 16 months in captivity. Relatives in Israel have clung to hope, marking Kfir’s first and second birthdays and his brother's fifth. The Bibas family said in a statement Wednesday that it would wait for 'identification procedures' before acknowledging that their loved ones were dead. Palestinians should be able to leave Gaza if they choose: Israel envoy Supporters throughout Israel have worn orange in solidarity with the family — a reference to two boys' red hair — and a popular children’s song was written in their honor. Like the Bibas family, Oded Lifshitz was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, along with his wife Yocheved, who was freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Oded was a journalist who campaigned for the recognition of Palestinian rights and peace between Arabs and Jews. Hamas-led militants abducted 251 hostages, including some 30 children, in the Oct. 7 attack, in which they also killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. More than half the hostages, and most of the women and children, have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight and have recovered dozens of bodies of people killed in the initial attack or who died in captivity. It's not clear if the ceasefire will last Hamas is set to free six living hostages on Saturday in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and says it will release four more bodies next week, completing the ceasefire's first phase. That will leave the militants with some 60 hostages, all men, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he is committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Trump Gaza plan may hurt national security: Counterterrorism expert Trump's proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it, which has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries, has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. Hamas could be reluctant to free more hostages if it believes the war will resume with the goal of annihilating the group or forcibly transferring Gaza's population. Israel's military offensive killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its records. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to fields of rubble and bombed-out buildings. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza's population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding.

IRS to lose thousands of jobs in small-business division: Reports	(NewsNation) — The Internal Revenue Service is expecting to terminate more than 3,500 employees who work in the small business/self-employed division. CBS News first reported the expected firings, which were announced to managers in the division Wednesday. The terminations are expected to affect probationary hires who are 'not deemed as critical to filing season.' The division helps small businesses and entrepreneurs comply with taxes and assists with debt relief, serving 57 million Americans. USDA proposes ban on buying junk food with SNAP benefits The IRS is experiencing some of the largest numbers of mass firings at an agency across departments even as the peak tax season, which goes from mid-March through mid-April, approaches. Another division, which handles large business and international issues, also received an email requesting managers come into the office Thursday to discuss firings but did not say how many people would lose their jobs. The IRS employs tens of thousands of people and the firings come as the Trump administration has worked to terminate probationary hires across federal agencies. Trump’s plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be costly In some cases, the firings have led agencies to scramble to try to get people back as people in critical roles, including those who safeguard the nation's nuclear weapons and those who play a role in preventing a bird flu pandemic, were fired in mass terminations. The Department of Government Efficiency, headed by billionaire Elon Musk, has been working to access information in federal agencies, including an internal data system at the IRS that has Americans' individual tax information.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/irs-lose-thousand-job/	2025-02-19T16:13:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b0ff7edd3ef6.53568435.jpeg?w=900
Flight simulator shows view of conditions during Toronto crash	(NewsNation) — A flight instructor gave NewsNation a glimpse of what pilots might have seen from the cockpit when a Delta flight flipped over on landing. The flight from Minneapolis to Toronto crashed and flipped upside down, injuring several people at Toronto's Pearson Airport. Pilot Robert Thomas put the weather conditions for that day into a flight simulator to show what the pilots could have experienced. NTSB investigating mid-air collision in Arizona The flight simulator was for a 737, which is larger than the CRJ-900 that flipped. But the view would be similar. As pilots approach, they would have disengaged autopilot, Thomas said, pointing out a view of a runway and lights that they would have seen as they were about five miles away. The pilots would have been landing on a runway more than 11,000 feet long in snowy and windy conditions. 'If I have a lot of wind blowing on my aircraft, it's going to change the amount of wind blowing over my wings, which affects lift,' Thomas said. 'So if I have a gust of wind that hits my aircraft and it dies off, that's going to affect how my aircraft flies.' Winds coming from any direction can also help push the plane's path. There was also a lot of snow on the ground, with Toronto having received 20 inches of snow prior to Monday's incident. Aviation firings a ‘concern’ amid increase in plane crashes The wind would be blowing snow across the runway, potentially creating optical illusions and visibility challenges for pilots. However, Thomas said airports usually do a good job of keeping runways clear. Thomas explained that when coming in for a landing, pilots would be focusing on keeping the wings level and the nose down, correcting for winds with the yoke and rudder pedals to make sure the plane doesn't get pushed off the runway. The investigation into Monday's crash is still underway and it's too soon to say if weather is the cause or what other factors could have come into play. 'The really special thing about the aviation industry is that everybody is working together to make things operate safely,' Thomas said. 'When things do get crazy, do get a little unsafe, everybody works together to make sure the best outcome is possible.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/flight-simulator-conditions-toronto-crash/	2025-02-19T14:29:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/DeltaThumb.jpg?w=900
Trump's plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be co...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump wants to eliminate income taxes on Social Security benefits, but a new analysis shows that plan comes at a steep cost and would worsen the program's financial shortfall. Ending taxes on benefits would reduce government revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7% by 2054, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model. Nixing taxes would also move up the date when the Social Security trust fund is expected to run out. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? As it currently stands, retirees could see their benefits slashed by 21% in roughly a decade if Congress doesn't fix the program, which pays out more than it brings in. Trump's plan to end income taxes on benefits would accelerate the estimated depletion date of the Social Security Trust Fund by two years, from December 2034 to December 2032, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. 'I think it is a bad idea not to tax benefits for people receiving them,' said Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Nowrasteh pointed out that the Social Security Fairness Act, which Joe Biden recently signed into law, will also accelerate the program's financial woes. 'The government is not taking seriously the fiscal problems that Social Security has,' Nowrasteh warned. Social Security head resigns following DOGE data request: Reports Experts previously told NewsNation that Trump's Social Security tax promise would be hard to keep but that hasn't stopped Republican lawmakers from trying. Representatives Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Daniel Webster, R-Fla., recently reintroduced the Senior Citizens Tax Elimination Act, which would end federal income taxes on Social Security benefits and boost the retirement income of older Americans. Who gets taxed on their Social Security benefits? About half of Social Security beneficiaries pay income tax on their benefits, according to the latest estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. The amount of tax owed varies depending on one's income. As of now, individuals who earn more than $25,000 may have to pay taxes on up to 50% of their Social Security retirement benefits. For those who earn more than $34,000, up to 85% of benefits could be taxable. One of the main critiques of the current system is that those thresholds don't go up with inflation, so over time, more retirees have been subject to taxes on their benefits. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits The counter-argument is that taxing benefits helps the government fund Social Security. Income from taxation makes up roughly 4% of what the program brings in, about $50 billion that Social Security would have to find elsewhere. The Penn Wharton Budget Model said 95% of retirees would benefit if Trump's campaign promise was implemented, but 'all future generations would be worse off.' And if taxes on Social Security benefits are eliminated, the biggest gains would go toward high-income retirees. Some high-income households, who currently pay the most in taxes on Social Security benefits, would gain more than $100,000 over their lifetimes, the analysis found. However, households in the lowest two income quintiles would see more modest gains, ranging from $1,000 to $2,000. Meanwhile, those younger than 30 would be worse off, with newborn households losing about $10,000 in lifetime welfare, the analysis said. The report concluded: 'The policy primarily benefits high-income households nearing or in retirement while harming households under thirty and all future generations across the entire income distribution.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/trumps-taxes-social-security-benefits/	2025-02-19T14:22:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67afdf41832241.40142539.jpeg?w=900
President Trump, Elon Musk sit for first TV interview	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk sat down for a joint interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity on Tuesday and defended the administration’s efforts to conduct an expansive overhaul of the federal government. The interview was the latest display of Trump sharing the spotlight with Musk, following an Oval Office appearance by the Tesla CEO last week in which he fielded several questions from reporters while the president sat at the Resolute Desk. The White House says billionaire Elon Musk is not technically part of the Department of Government Efficiency team sweeping through federal agencies, but is rather a senior adviser to the president. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? In the interview, Musk defended DOGE’s work and claimed the department is working to root out 'unelected' bureaucrats in the U.S. government. 'They wouldn't be complaining so much if we weren't doing something useful… What we're really trying to do here is restore the will of the people through the president. And what we're finding is that there's an unelected bureaucracy — speaking of unelected, there's a vast federal bureaucracy that is implacably opposed to the president and the cabinet.' He brushed aside Democratic criticisms of DOGE, insisting the try agency is trying 'to restore democracy and the will of the people.' Musk's exact role could be key in the legal fight over DOGE's access to government data as the Trump administration moves to lay off thousands of federal workers. Defining him as an adviser rather than the administrator in charge of day-to-day operations at DOGE could help the administration as it pushes back against a lawsuit arguing Musk has too much power for someone who isn't elected or Senate-confirmed.
