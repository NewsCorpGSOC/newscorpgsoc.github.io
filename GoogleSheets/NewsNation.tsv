What kind of masks protect from wildfire smoke?	(NewsNation) — With nearly 3000 acres burning in Califonia, health experts say N95 respirator masks offer the best protection against harmful wildfire smoke, provided they are worn correctly and fit properly. The masks, readily available at hardware stores and pharmacies, can filter out fine particles found in smoke that can irritate eyes, nose, throat and lungs, according to public health officials. However, they do not protect against hazardous gases sometimes present in smoke. Health officials emphasize that proper fit is crucial. The mask should have two straps that go around the head, seal tightly to the face, and be certified by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. Rapidly growing Los Angeles wildfire explodes to 1,260 acres in hours Single-strap paper dust and surgical masks do not adequately protect from wildfire smoke. The most effective protection remains to stay indoors and limit outdoor activity during smoky conditions. Those who must be outside should take frequent breaks, as breathing through respirator masks requires more effort. Health officials warn that masks should be discarded when breathing becomes difficult, if they become damaged, or if the inside becomes dirty. They also note that respirator masks are not approved for children and will not work effectively for people with facial hair.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/masks-protect-wildfire-smoke/	2025-01-07T19:25:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/03/Masks-1-1-1.jpg?w=900
Migrant group being held near Acapulco by Mexican officials	(NewsNation) — Nearly 100 migrants who were part of a larger caravan moving from southern Mexico toward the U.S. southern border are being held in the coastal resort of Acapulco as part of an effort to keep them from crossing into the United States illegally. The migrants, who were part of a larger group who began traveling from Tapachula, Mexico, were originally traveling toward Juarez, Mexico, which is located just miles from the border and El Paso, Texas. However, as part of an operation known as 'Operation Carousel,' government officials are now breaking up migrant groups and are negotiating with them to travel to other Mexican states, sources told NewsNation. Facebook to end fact-checking, boost political content The dissolving of migrant caravans comes just two weeks ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. The effort is being carried out to disperse migrants throughout the country to keep them far from the U.S. border, The Associated Press reported. The breaking up of the caravans also keeps large groups from accumulating in any one place. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has addressed the issue of deportations prior to Trump’s second term, making a surprising reversal on previous policy promises. Last month, Sheinbaum said Mexico would push the United States to send non-Mexican deportees to their countries of origin — now, she’s announced that Mexico is open to accepting foreign nationals. The policy of 'dispersion and exhaustion' has moved to the forefront of Mexican government officials’ immigration policy in recent years, according to the AP. Last year, it significantly reduced the number of immigrants reaching the U.S.-Mexico border, a former government official told the AP. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico over the migration of immigrants into the United States illegally. As part of Operation Carousel, Mexican authorities allow immigrants to walk for days before offering them a bus to various cities. Once there, they are promised to have their immigration status reviewed, the AP reported. A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection told NewsNation the agency consistently monitors reports of mass migration to the U.S. southern border and stands ready to address any potential increase in migrant encounters. 11 migrants found locked in U-Haul in rural New Mexico President Joe Biden signed an executive order last year geared at securing the border. Under the presidential proclamation and the securing the border rule, noncitizens who cross into the United States without authorization will generally be ineligible for asylum. Migrants can face significant consequences, including removal from the United States, a five-year bar to return to the U.S., and potential additional criminal penalties that remain on their permanent record for years. 'We are aware of recent reports of a migrant caravan that has materialized in Southern Mexico, as we hear about several times per year,' the CBP spokesperson said. 'These reported caravans generally travel very slowly and often splinter before they make progress moving northbound towards the southwest border. The spokesperson said that the agency will continue to monitor developments in coordination with our foreign and interagency counterparts as we have with previous movements of migrants.' Although there has been a drop in encounters between illegal immigrants and immigration officials, smugglers and other 'bad actors' are continuing to spread false information that disregards the safety of vulnerable migrants, CBP officials said. 'The fact remains: the United States continues to enforce immigration law, and our borders are not open for those without a legal basis to enter the country,' the spokesperson said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/migrant-group-acapulco-mexican-officials/	2025-01-07T16:13:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/66a04fc3be0966.69928705.jpeg?w=900

Actor Steve Guttenberg jumps into action as brush fire burns in P...	LOS ANGELES (KTLA) — A wind-whipped brush fire is burning in Pacific Palisades, and large plumes of smoke can be seen for miles, but one well-known actor is jumping in to help. Residents evacuating the area were met with slow traffic along Palisades Drive and Sunset Boulevard near Highland Village. Numerous fire engines were in the area as crews battled the nearby flames. Rapidly growing Los Angeles wildfire explodes to 770 acres in hours During this time, many have jumped into action, like actor Steve Guttenberg who lives nearby. The actor told NewsNation affiliate KTLA that he has friends who are unable to evacuate because of the traffic jam on Palisades Drive. 'There are people stuck up there. So we're trying to clear Palisades Drive and I'm walking up there as far as I can moving cars,' he revealed, pointing up to the hill where traffic was slowly making its way down. 'There are families up there, there are pets up there. There are people who really need help,' he said with worry in his voice. Wearing a facemask, the 'It Takes Two' actor explained how important it is for everyone to 'band together' during this time of need. Steve Guttenberg at the Golden Gala: A Celebration of Excellence at The Beverly Hilton on January 3, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Gilbert Flores/GG2025/Penske Media via Getty Images) 'Don't worry about your personal property. Just get out. Get your loved ones and get out.' He told KTLA that he's urging people who have left their cars on Palisades Drive to leave their keys behind so they can move the cars to make room for incoming fire trucks. Rapidly growing Los Angeles wildfire explodes to 770 acres in hours 'What's happening is people take their keys with them as if they're in a parking lot. This is not a parking lot. We really need people to move their cars,' the 'Police Academy' actor explained. 'If you leave your car behind, leave the key in there so a guy like me can move your car so that these fire trucks can get up there.' Generally, officials recommend people stay in their cars while evacuating and advise against abandoning their vehicles. How to stay safe during Southern California’s latest Santa Ana wind event The brush fire was first reported at around 10:30 a.m. PT on Tuesday and has burned 200 acres as of 12:30 p.m. The fire comes after the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for much of Southern California on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Los Angeles prepares for ‘most significant windstorm in more than...	Wild weather – including rain, snow, high winds and dangerous fire conditions – is how Southern California is starting 2025, and officials in the L.A. are taking no chances ahead of the adverse conditions. The National Weather Service has described the windstorm hitting SoCal as 'life-threatening,' 'extreme' and 'destructive,' and snow flurries were seen Tuesday morning in mountain communities; further inland, rain showers caused slick roadways. In L.A., Mayor Karen Bass announced Tuesday morning that the city has activated its Emergency Operations Center to a Level 2 to ensure the safety of all Angelenos. Rapidly growing wildfire spreads in Los Angeles area 'Parts of the Los Angeles region will potentially face one of the most significant windstorms in more than a decade, and I urge Angelenos to continue monitoring the storm and stay vigilant and safe,' Mayor Bass said in a statement. 'Power outages as a result of downed power lines, increased fire risk and falling trees and debris should be expected during this time and the impacts and dangers of a windstorm should be taken seriously.' The mayor’s office released a list of resources and helpful information for residents to use during the windstorm: Reporting and tracking power outages: Visit www.ladwp.com/outages or call 1-800-DIAL-DWP (1-800-342-5397) Reporting blocked roadways: Service can be requested through www.lacity.gov/myla311 or by calling 311; Angelenos are also encouraged to download the MyLA311 mobile app Red Flag Warning updates: Check www.lafd.org/redflag for the latest updates; Red Flag parking restrictions have been in place since 8 a.m. Tuesday and are set to last until further notice Outage updates: LADWP will regularly update their X page to inform residents of power outages Weather updates: Click here for the hyperlocal forecast for your community, or visit the National Weather Service for the regional forecast In case of emergency: Dial 911 How to stay safe during Southern California’s latest Santa Ana wind event In addition to downing trees and causing power outages throughout the region early Tuesday morning, the dangerously high winds are already fueling brush fires in the area, including one that erupted and was later contained in the Santa Ana Riverbed in Colton around 5 a.m. A much larger and more rapidly spreading vegetation fire broke out around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday in L.A.’s upscale Pacific Palisades neighborhood. By noon, area residents were being told to prepare to evacuate as it spread to over 200 acres in about an hour.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/los-angeles-windstorm-santa-ana/	2025-01-07T13:03:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25007638542773.jpg?w=900

Ex-President Jimmy Carter's body begins journey to Washington	(NewsNation) — The body of former President Jimmy Carter is scheduled to arrive in Washington on Tuesday, where it will lie in state ahead of Thursday’s funeral at Washington National Cathedral. Carter, who died at the age of 100 last week, had been lying in repose at the Carter Center in Atlanta before the 39th president’s remains were taken to Dobbins Air Force Base on Tuesday. Inclement weather on the East Coast delayed transporting Carter’s body to Washington by about 90 minutes Tuesday. Former President Jimmy Carter’s state funeral: What we know A small ceremony with Carter’s family took place at the Georgia Air Force Base before Carter’s remains were to be flown to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where another ceremony was scheduled to be held. Carter was scheduled to be taken to the U.S. Naval Museum before the former president's remains will be transported to the U.S. Capitol. Carter served in the Navy before he became a Georgia state senator and the state's governor. Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver a eulogy at a ceremony for lawmakers Tuesday afternoon before public viewing at the Capitol Rotunda begins. President Joe Biden will deliver a eulogy at the national funeral ceremony Thursday, which will coincide with a national day of mourning. The most recent national day of mourning was held in 2018 following the death of President George H.W. Bush. Carter will then be returned to his hometown of Plains, Georgia, where he will be buried next to his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn Carter, who died at the age of 96 in 2023.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jimmy-carter-body-washington/	2025-01-07T10:44:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25004778912187.jpg?w=900

Live: Trump speaks after sentencing delay denied in NYC case	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump may pursue a last-minute appeal after the New York judge overseeing his hush money case rejected his effort to delay sentencing, set for Friday. Judge Juan Merchan rejected a request to delay sentencing, keeping it just 10 days before Trump returns to the White House. 'This court has considered defendant's arguments in support of his motion and finds that they are, for the most part, a repetition of the arguments he has raised numerous times in the past,' he wrote in a court filing Monday. Trump's attorneys had sought to postpone sentencing indefinitely, while they appealed. He has already been denied a dismissal in the case, which he argues could mark the 'end of the presidency as we know it' if upheld. Trump is expected to address the case on Tuesday during a news conference at 10 a.m. at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate. Judge signals no punishment for conviction Merchan signaled he is inclined to impose no punishment for Trump’s 34-count felony conviction, given concerns about his immunity from criminal prosecution upon taking the oath of office. Should Selena's killer get parole? Responding sergeant says no He said an unconditional discharge 'appears to be the most viable solution' and would allow Trump to appear virtually. In May, a New York City jury found Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection to payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Daniels was paid during the campaign to keep quiet about an affair she allegedly had with Trump, which he denies. Manhattan DA: Immunity doesn't apply with Trump not yet in office In a court filing this week, Trump's legal team argued for postponing sentencing, stating, 'The court should vacate the sentencing hearing until President Trump's immunity appeals are fully and finally resolved, which should result in a dismissal of this case, which should have never been brought in the first place.' They contend the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity should apply, citing jury evidence like social media posts and testimony from aides from Trump's time as president. NYC subway arson suspect set to be arraigned They also argue that immunity should extend since Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20. However, the Manhattan DA's office opposes delaying sentencing, asserting that immunity shouldn't apply while Trump is out of office. Merchan has previously suggested he is unlikely to sentence Trump to prison.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/trump-investigation/trump-react-judge-denying-delay-hush-money-case/	2025-01-07T06:57:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP24345686164055.jpg?w=900
NYC subway arson suspect set to be arraigned	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — The man accused of burning a woman alive while she was asleep on a New York City subway is set to be arraigned Tuesday on murder and arson charges. Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, will appear in a Brooklyn courtroom around 9:30 a.m. local time. Authorities plan to unseal the indictment Tuesday following his court appearance. NYPD identifies the victim as Debrina Kawam Zapeta-Calil is accused of using a lighter to set a woman's clothes on fire while she was asleep on a stopped F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn around 7:30 a.m. on Dec. 22. Prosecutors say Zapeta-Calil intensified the blaze by fanning it with a shirt before sitting on a platform bench and watching as she burned to death. Officers at the station reportedly smelled and saw smoke and observed the victim in the train car fully engulfed in flames, according to NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The fire was extinguished, and the woman was pronounced dead. Could fandom cause jury nullification in Luigi Mangione trial? The victim was identified as 57-year-old Debrina Kawam, according to the New York Police Department. Zapeta-Calil was arrested on Dec. 23, after being taken into custody the previous day. He’s charged with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and arson. According to police, there is no connection or prior interaction between the suspect and the victim, though the indictment, set to be released later Tuesday, may reveal additional details.

Bill O'Reilly was in a 'Cabinet meeting' during Mar-a-lago visit	(NewsNation) — Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly says President-elect Donald Trump is 'laser-locked' on fulfilling campaign promises and significantly more prepared for the presidency than during his first term following a recent private meeting at Mar-a-Lago. The author, who said he has met nine presidents so far, got a 'summons' from Mar-a-Lago and felt obligated to go as a journalist despite not knowing what he was called for. 'When a president says, 'Hey, come on over,' you go on over,' O'Reilly said Monday on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' O'Reilly described sitting in on a 'literal Cabinet meeting' at Trump's Florida estate, where he observed discussions about tariffs and other policy matters. Bill O’Reilly: ‘Woke movement is anti-American’ O'Reilly, who celebrated his 50th year in journalism, said Trump's grasp of presidential responsibilities has evolved considerably since 2017. 'Eight years ago, Donald Trump really didn't know what he was looking at as President of the United States, and he leaned on people for advice. That's gone. He knows exactly what the job is.' The meeting included former Trump advisers Stephen Miller and Peter Navarro along with Howard Lutnick and others, O'Reilly said. He described detailed discussions about using tariffs to pressure companies like Apple to move manufacturing from China to the United States. While Trump appears more knowledgeable about governance, O'Reilly predicted the next administration would face internal conflicts despite promises of strict discipline from incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. Jimmy Carter ‘wasn’t a good president but tried’ to be: Bill O’Reilly 'The first year of every single presidential administration has been a bloodbath behind the scenes, and this one will be too,' O'Reilly said. 'People are going to try to stab each other to death, not literally, but figuratively.' O'Reilly's observations came from what he described as a three-hour visit to Mar-a-Lago, including both the meeting and dinner with Trump. '[Trump] certainly comes in in a very, very strong position, the strongest position of any president since maybe JFK,' O'Reilly said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/on-balance-with-leland-vittert/bill-oreilly-cabinet-meeting-mar-a-lago-visit/	2025-01-06T17:31:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-2.jpg?w=900
New migrant caravan heads toward US as Trump return draws closer	(NewsNation) — Sources in Mexico tell NewsNation a caravan of migrants has just taken off from Tapachula, Mexico, with hundreds heading north to Chiapas, Mexico, on foot. The majority of migrants are Venezuelan, sources say. The ultimate destination is reportedly Juarez, Mexico, located just miles from the border, and El Paso, Texas. It's the 10th such caravan to form in the southern municipality since October. According to Mexican immigration authorities, they expect even more of these caravans to form and depart in the coming days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump and his 'border czar,' Tom Homan, have promised to carry out mass deportations on a historical scale, decrying sanctuary cities and their leaders who plan to oppose such actions. New international rail bridge ‘milestone’ connecting Laredo, Texas, to Mexico completed The chances of the caravan reaching the United States' southern border are slim to none as Mexican immigration authorities continue to step up their efforts to deter and block migrant groups from even reaching Mexico City. Sources tell NewsNation authorities have dubbed this 'Operation Carousel' and that they are breaking up migrant groups and negotiating with them to travel to other Mexican states. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has addressed the issue of deportations prior to Trump's second term, making a surprising reversal on previous policy promises. Last month, Sheinbaum said Mexico would push the United States to send non-Mexican deportees to their countries of origin — now, she's announced that Mexico is open to accepting foreign nationals. Border patrol to be front and center at inauguration parade The stance shift comes as the Mexican government promises to open 25 new shelters to house deported migrants. Immigration attorney Rolando Vazquez, who primarily represents Venezuelan nationals, said these shelters will lead to self-deporting from Mexico. 'These foreign nationals are going to find it more desirable to be in their home country than it is to be in Mexico, and they'll eventually go back to their home country,' Vazquez said. 'And that's what we've seen in the past in the last Trump administration when they implemented the MPP program.' Sources in Tijuana and Matamoros tell NewsNation they expect migrants to rush the border in the final days before Trump's inauguration, as they fear the CBP One app will end at that point.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/migrant-caravan-tapachula-mexico/	2025-01-06T15:49:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Border-wall-Hidalgo-041423.jpg?w=900
Could fandom cause jury nullification in Luigi Mangione trial?	(NewsNation) — Increasing public sympathy for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, could pose the possibility of jury nullification despite the overwhelming evidence mounted against him, some legal experts say. Mangione faces multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism under federal and state charges in New York and Pennsylvania, after allegedly gunning down Thompson as he was walking to an investor conference in Midtown Manhattan on Dec 4. The federal charges could carry the possibility of the death penalty, while the maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole. Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. Luigi Mangione’s fandom could lead to jury nullification Since his arrest, Mangione’s online fandom has rapidly grown, with supporters posting sympathetic messages, creating fan accounts and even raising thousands on crowdfunding sites to pay for his legal defense fund. To these sympathizers, Mangione’s alleged crime symbolizes a rejection of the American health care system. That, coupled with him being easy on the eyes, has turned Mangione into a 'modern-day Robin Hood,' former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told NewsNation. 'I have never seen a criminal defendant, much less an accused murderer, receive as much sympathy both on traditional media and social media. He is a folk hero of sorts to many,' Rahmani said. Who is UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect Luigi Mangione? Rahmani said there is a 'very high possibility' of jury nullification in his case where a sympathetic juror could hold out for Mangione. This photo, provided by the Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural Resources, shows Luigi Mangione, a suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, receiving a citation for failing to observe a posted closed-area sign, in Honolulu, Sunday, Nov. 12, 2023. (Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural Resources via AP) Jury nullification occurs when a jury returns a not guilty verdict even though jurors believe beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant has broken the law. This may happen when jurors disagree with the law or the punishment. If that happens, there is a high probability of a mistrial, which happens when jurors aren't able to reach the same verdict, Rahmani said. A nullifying juror could also convince other jurors to choose an acquittal. Defense lawyers will lean in Mangione’s defense lawyers, like any defense attorneys, will try to utilize any possibility of nullification, former federal prosecutor Joel Cohen said. 'That’s their job,' he said, to find those nullifiers and keep them on the jury, and in this case, there is a real possibility of it happening. With the seemingly overwhelming evidence against Mangione, jury nullification could be what gets him acquitted or results in a mistrial, so the defense will lean into this, he said. Luigi Mangione classmate: ‘A lot of families are hurting’ In most cases, people come in with some sort of bias, and even when they say they are capable of putting that aside for the case, it still manages to creep in, Cohen said. While a juror does not have the right to nullify, once they are seated, they have the power to do it, he added. 'Most jurors who have that nullifying feeling are not going to be honest about it most of the time, so it's really hard to get into their heart and soul to find out what they're really thinking and what the reason is for wanting to be on the jury,' he said. That’s where judges and prosecutors really need to step up and do their best to weed it out, he said. The evidence will prevail over jury nullification Not all legal experts see nullification as a potential threat. 'I think it's very unlikely that a case like this is going to confront something like jury nullification,' Gregory Germain, a professor at Syracuse University College of Law, said. 'Most of us hate insurance companies and have had difficult experiences dealing with insurance companies, but that doesn't mean we think people should be going around murdering insurance executives in the street.' Germain said it’s unlikely potential nullifiers will be able to hide that level of bias during the jury selection process. He adds that while Mangione does have a large fanbase, most 'people who want to live in a civilized society are not going to find him to be an appealing defendant.' 4 Luigi Mangione documentaries planned The mountain of evidence that appears to be against him will be too great for jurors to fling aside, he said. 'It just sounds like such an overwhelmingly strong case of murder that I just would be shocked if a jury came back with a not guilty verdict.' The larger dangers of jury nullification in Mangione case Jury nullification in the Mangione case could set a dangerous precedent that undermines the legal system, Rahmani said. 'If we can't convict murderers who are caught in broad daylight in Manhattan because of the nature of the victim, it's going to be a problem,' Rahmani said. Our legal system is based on fair, impartial juries, so anything that threatens that will pose issues. The sentiment is shared by Cohen, who said there are several 'dangers' of jury nullification, especially if it was done through deception during the jury selection process. If people think they will get off the hook because a victim is unsympathetic, that may lead to similar attacks, he said. In the Mangione case, it’s even more concerning because this appears to be a planned attack.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/fandom-jury-nullification-luigi-mangione-trial/	2025-01-06T14:48:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6769efd59b9de0.24500426.jpeg?w=900
First US bird flu death confirmed in Louisiana	(NewsNation) — The Louisiana Public Health Department has reported the first bird flu-related human death in the United States. The patient, who was over 65, contracted bird flu after coming in contact with both a backyard bird flock and wild birds. That person was the first to contract a severe case of the illness in the nation, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The patient was 'reported to have underlying medical conditions,' health officials said in the release. Feeling sick? Here’s what you might have 'The Department expresses its deepest condolences to the patient’s family and friends as they mourn the loss of their loved one.

Trump pitches 'merged' US, Canada after Trudeau resignation annou...	(The Hill) - President-elect Trump pitched the idea of a 'merged' United States and Canada after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation, noting there would be no tariffs if the two countries were one. 'If Canada merged with the U.S., there would no Tariffs, taxes would go way down, and they would be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them,' Trump posted to his Truth Social site. 'Together, what a great Nation it would be!!!' Congress formally certifies Trump’s election win Trudeau announced Monday that he would be resigning before general elections later this year. His Liberal Party is polling poorly as tensions with Trump have risen over the issue of tariffs. 'This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I’m having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,' Trudeau said. After Trudeau’s announcement Monday, Trump touted the idea that many Canadians would 'LOVE' the idea of being the '51st State' of the U.S. He said the merger would be beneficial for the U.S., because it would 'no longer suffer' from 'massive Trade Deficits' and subsidies that it provides to Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces resignation 'Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned,' Trump said. Trudeau has served as Canada’s prime minister for nine years and led the Liberal Party for 11. He has faced mounting crises, including the resignation of a top minister and a confrontation with Trump’s 25 percent tariff plan, among other issues.

What is HMPV, and should we fear another pandemic?	(NewsNation) — China has reported a surge in cases of human metapneumovirus, particularly among children, with some online claiming hospitals are overwhelmed. China has pushed back on those claims and said the increase in cases is due to an increased ability to detect and identify HMPV. What is it? HMPV is a virus that causes upper respiratory symptoms, with some cases also leading to lower respiratory symptoms like pneumonia. Woman warning others after accidentally gluing eye shut with nail glue It's part of the same genus of viruses as RSV and the symptoms of the two can be similar. Most people contract HMPV before the age of five, and although it is possible to be infected again, subsequent infections are usually milder. A first-time HMPV infection is more likely to cause severe illness, which is why worse cases are often seen in children. What are the symptoms? HMPV is similar to the common cold for most people. Symptoms include a stuffy or runny nose, coughing, shortness of breath, fever, sore throat, wheezing and a rash. For most people, the illness will be mild. Children are at most risk from HMPV, as well as those over 65 or those with weakened immune symptoms. 19 of 20 US counties with lowest health insurance coverage located in Texas HMPV can also aggravate existing conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. How is the virus spread? Like most viruses, HMPV is spread by coming into contact with an infected person or from objects contaminated with the virus. Coughing, sneezing, shaking hands, kissing and touching easily contaminated objects like doorknobs and phones are all ways the virus can be spread. Proper handwashing, covering your mouth when you sneeze or cough, avoiding touching your face, staying home when sick and social distancing can help avoid spreading HMPV. Masking is also effective in curbing the spread, with China mandating masks in some regions hit hard by the virus. Where is the virus spreading? The majority of cases reported right now come from northern China. In light of the outbreak, some other countries have also stepped up monitoring. Intermittent fasting could slow down hair growth: Study The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does monitor HMPV so an uptick in the U.S. should be caught by scientists. However, it is not on the list of diseases that states are required to report to the CDC. Will this become another pandemic? Experts say there is no need to be concerned about another COVID-19 situation with HMPV. One major reason is that the disease has been circulating for decades and many adults have already been exposed, building up some immunity, something that wasn't the case with COVID. Experts also say there has been no evidence that HMPV has been mutating into a more serious illness, though it will require additional testing to confirm this is the case. What to do if you think you have HMPV? There are no treatments for HMPV, but there may be supportive care for severe cases, including oxygen therapy, IV infusions and corticosteroids. Recall issued for cold and flu medicine sold at some Costco locations In most cases, people can manage symptoms at home by drinking lots of fluids to stay hydrated and using over-the-counter medications. If you or your child experience symptoms lasting more than a few days, call your doctor. If you or your child is having trouble breathing, has blue lips or nails or has a fever above 103, go to the ER immediately.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/what-hmpv-chances-pandemic/	2025-01-06T10:29:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192249820.jpg?w=900
Live updates: Harris to oversee certification of Trump's comeback	Congress on Monday is set to formally certify President-elect Trump's 2024 election victory. Vice President Harris will oversee the process, affirming Trump’s victory as well as her decisive defeat to him after a whirlwind run for commander in chief. Monday also marks four years since rioters stormed the Capitol in an effort to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss, ultimately resulting in the death of several police officers. 'And we should commit to remembering Jan. 6, 2021, every year,' President Biden wrote Monday in an op-ed for The Washington Post. 'To remember it as a day when our democracy was put to the test and prevailed. To remember that democracy — even in America — is never guaranteed.'

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces resignation	(NewsNation) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced he will resign as Liberal Party Leader and prime minister of Canada once the party selects a new leader. The prime minister also announced he had prorogued the current session of Parliament, which has been paralyzed, until March 24. He had served as the party's leader since 2013, having taken the reins when the Liberals were suffering difficulties in the House of Commons. Jan. 6: Security preparations in DC on anniversary of Capitol Riots The prime minister said he discussed his decision with his family last night. In a news conference, he said that it had become clear to him that he can't be the best option for Canada while fighting internal battles within the party. He also said a regret of his time in leadership was his failure to introduce electoral reform, specifically failing to allow Canadians to pick their second and third choices in elections, whe he said would reduce political division. Trudeau's resignation came ahead of a key national caucus meeting set to be held on Wednesday. His departure leaves the party without a permanent leader as polls show it is likely to lose badly to Conservatives in an election set for Late November.

Trudeau's deputy stepped aside in December with harsh words that raised questions about the prime minister's ability to handle the upcoming U.S. administration. Trudeau's decision to step aside is likely to incite calls for a quick election, as the country works to put a government in place to deal with demands from President-elect Donald Trump, who has already threatened tariffs on Canadian imports and has suggested the U.S. could annex Canada.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/justin-trudeau-resigns/	2025-01-06T08:01:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671a74165b5020.50821515.jpeg?w=900
Biden to visit New Orleans after deadly Bourbon Street attack	NEW ORLEANS (NewsNation) — President Joe Biden will visit New Orleans on Monday to 'grieve with the families and community members impacted by the tragic attack.' After signing the Social Security Fairness Act, Biden was asked Sunday by journalists what his message would be to the families he would meet. He responded, 'I’ve been there. There’s nothing you can really say to somebody that’s just had such a tragic loss, my message is going to be personal if I get to get them alone.' First Lady Jill Biden will accompany the president, according to the White House. All victims have been ID'd Investigation continues into what authorities are calling a New Year’s Day 'act of terrorism' in New Orleans’ bustling Canal and Bourbon Streets in which a car drove into a crowd, killing 14 people and injuring at least 35 more. Officials said Thursday that all victims have been identified, and their families have been notified by New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell. New Orleans attack suspect Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, has been identified as the man who was shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year’s Day attack. FBI Special Agent in Charge Lyonel Myrthil said Sunday that Jabbar traveled to New Orleans in late October and in November. During his first trip, Jabar stayed at a rental home for at least two days beginning on Oct. 30, Myrthil said. The second trip took place on Nov. 10 but FBI officials 'are still piecing together details of that trip.'

Jabbar also traveled to Cairo, Egypt, from June 22 to July 3 of 2023, and, a few days later, flew to Ontario, Canada on July 10, returning to the U.S. on July 13. It's unclear if those trips are connected to the attack in New Orleans. Officials still say Jabbar, a U.S. citizen from Houston, acted alone when he killed 14 people early on New Year’s Day.

Congress gears up for snowy certification of Trump's election win	Congress is gearing up for a snowy certification of President-elect Trump’s election win on Monday, as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) vows to plow ahead with the vote despite a snowstorm set to hit Washington, D.C. The House and Senate are scheduled to convene in a joint session at 1 p.m. on Monday to certify Trump’s victory, a process that is mandated by the Constitution and federal law. On Monday, however, the nation’s capital is bracing for as many as 10 inches of snow, a weather event that could make it difficult for lawmakers to arrive at the Capitol. Johnson, however, has said the operation will go on 'whether we’re in a blizzard or not,' citing federal law and Trump’s 'landslide' win. It comes exactly four years after a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and interrupted the certification of President Biden's election win. Also this week, the debate over the best strategy to carry out Trump’s legislative wish list is expected to heat up, after the president-elect endorsed moving one reconciliation bill rather than two — a stance that directly contrasts with that of Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and others. And some of Trump’s cabinet nominees will likely visit the Capitol this week to meet with senators, including Tulsi Gabbard — Trump’s pick to be director of national intelligence — who is slated to speak with Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. For Johnson, the road gets rougher from here Additionally, the late-President Jimmy Carter will lie in state in the Capitol, as Washington begins a days-long commemoration of the 39th president’s life. Congress to certify Trump’s election win amid snowstorm The certification of Trump’s election win is set to take center stage in Washington on Monday, as lawmakers trudge through the snow to participate in the process that is taking place exactly four years after a violent mob descended on the Capitol and interrupted the procedure. Despite the inclement weather — which some forecasts say can include up to 10 inches of snow — Congress is still expected to meet to certify the election. 'The House intends to certify President Trump’s election tomorrow as scheduled in accordance with federal law,' Johnson spokesperson Taylor Haulsee wrote in a statement on Sunday. The House and Senate adopted a concurrent resolution last week that set Jan. 6 as the day Congress would certify the election, in accordance with the Electoral Count Act, which lawmakers passed and Biden enacted in 2022 following the Capitol riot. Both chambers are scheduled to convene in a joint session at 1 p.m. on Monday, kicking off the quadrennial procedure. Vice President Kamala Harris will preside over the House chamber. Trump asks for military aircraft protection amid Iran threat: Reports Because that timeline is laid out in federal law, lawmakers would have to pass another law rescheduling the procedure if needed because of the snow. There is some precedent for such a move: In 2013, Congress voted to certify former President Obama’s election victory on Jan. 4 because Jan. 6 fell on a Sunday. Johnson, however, has indicated that he does not plan to change the date. The Speaker told 'Fox News Sunday' 'I hope we have full attendance,' noting that GOP leaders encouraged their colleagues to remain in Washington over the weekend because of the forecasts. 'President Trump had a mandate, a landslide, you know, so many electoral votes. And we get to count them all. And we cannot delay that certification,' Johnson said. Some lawmakers are vowing to attend no matter the conditions. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), for example, wrote on X: 'I’m here and will walk to the Capitol if I have to.' Monday’s certification is taking place in the shadow of the 2021 riot, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and interrupted the counting of Biden’s electoral victory. In light of the events of four years ago, Democrats have said they do not plan to stage election protests that they have in the past. Reconciliation debate to heat up in the Senate The debate over how to execute Trump’s sprawling legislative agenda is poised to heat up in the Senate this week after the president-elect said he prefers moving one large reconciliation package rather than two — a stance that directly contrasts with that of Thune and conservative House Republicans. Trump officially announced on Sunday night that he prefers a single reconciliation bill, writing on X: 'Members of Congress are getting to work on one powerful Bill that will bring our Country back, and make it greater than ever before.' The package will include border and energy policy and extend the 2017 tax cuts, Trump said. Trump’s statement came one day after Johnson told House Republicans at a retreat that the president-elect preferred the one-track strategy. That stance, however, is not landing well in some Senate GOP circles, where a two-bill approach is preferred. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the chairman of the Budget Committee, said Sunday on Fox News that he was 'very worried' about moving a single bill. 'I'm very worried that, if we don't put border first and get it done, it's going to be a nightmare for our national security,' Graham said, later adding: 'I will try to be a team player here, but I want to tell the American people, from my point of view, the number one job is to secure the nation for the federal government.' Attention will be focused on Thune this week to see how he reacts to Trump’s statement, which runs counter to his strategy. The majority leader laid out a reconciliation plan last month that included two bills: The first would tackle border security and defense, and the other would extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which include a number of provisions set to expire at the end of 2025. Additionally, the House Freedom Caucus is likely to take issue with Trump’s comments. Last month, the conservative group wrote a letter to Johnson endorsing the two-bill strategy. Johnson, for his part, laid out an ambitious timeline to tackle the reconciliation package during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. He said the House will look to pass a budget resolution in early February, then move the entire package the first week of April. 'Everything’s got to move in the right sequence. And along the way, I think we're going to keep those trains moving in the right direction and on time,' Johnson said. 'And if that happens, we will get it out of the House in early April, maybe as soon as April 3, and then move it over to the Senate. That would put that bill on the president's desk for signature by the end of April. That would be fantastic.' Soda manufacturers push to keep sugary drinks on SNAP list Notably, the first week of April is also when Florida is holding two special elections to replace former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and outgoing Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), who is becoming Trump’s national security adviser on Jan. 20 — two likely GOP holds that will give the conference an extra vote in the House. One person who is likely to celebrate Trump's preferred strategy is Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, who had been publicly pushing for one reconciliation bill rather than two. Administration nominees back on Capitol Hill — including Gabbard Trump’s cabinet and administration nominees are expected to be back on Capitol Hill to meet with senators this week, as the picks gear up for their confirmation hearings and eventual votes. That group includes Gabbard, Trump’s selection to be director of national intelligence, who is slated to meet one-on-one this week with Warner, the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Gabbard is seen as one of the more controversial nominees Trump has put forward, with questions being raised about her 2017 meeting with Bashar al-Assad, and comments she has made about the Russia-Ukraine war that echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s talking points. Aside from meetings with nominees, the Senate is expected to adopt an organizing resolution this week, as the 119th Congress gets underway. Senators were sworn into office last week, and Thune officially began his tenure as majority leader. President Carter to lie in state The late-President Jimmy Carter will lie in state at the Capitol this week, as Washington honors the life and legacy of the 39th president. An arrival ceremony for Carter’s remains is scheduled for Tuesday at 2:45 p.m., followed by a Congressional tribute for the late-president, which Johnson, Thune and other members of leadership are slated to take part in. Then, beginning Tuesday, a viewing period will begin in the Capitol Rotunda for members of the public to pay their respects to Carter. The first viewing period is on Tuesday from 7 p.m. through midnight, then another beginning on Wednesday at 7 a.m. through Thursday at 7 a.m. Thursday morning, congressional leaders will attend a ceremonial departure for Carter’s remains. The late-president’s state funeral is scheduled for Thursday at Washington National Cathedral. Biden is expected to give a eulogy after he said Carter asked him to deliver one.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/congress-trump-certification-election-win/	2025-01-06T05:01:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/dome_capitol_060721gn3_w.jpg?w=900
This is just the beginning': Gov. Beshear urges Kentuckians to s...	Video note: Despite this article's time stamp, the above video is the latest forecast from The Weather Authority. FRANKFORT, Ky. (FOX 56) — Winter Storm Blair has brought what The Associated Press deemed the 'heaviest snowfall in a decade.' On Sunday evening, Gov. Andy Beshear issued an update regarding the storm's impact on the Commonwealth. First major winter storm of 2025 hits US, heavy snow moving east 'This next period of time where we're going to see ice across the Commonwealth is perhaps the most concerning,' Beshear said. Over 38,600 homes and businesses are without power as of 8 p.m., and this number is expected to rise as snow turns to ice across the bluegrass. 'This is just the beginning,' Beshear cautioned, noting that the most dangerous phase of the storm is still ahead. On Sunday, the governor's office stated Kentucky saw anywhere from six to eight inches of snow. Central Kentucky, including Louisville, Lexington, and Frankfort, faces the highest risk through Sunday evening, with ice accumulations potentially reaching dangerous levels, up to three-quarters of an inch. ‘Multiple traffic crashes’ close I-70 in Illinois Beshear emphasized that the storm is expected to persist through Monday night, piling a blanket of snow on top of a glaze of ice in central Kentucky that's expected to stick around due to an 'arctic blast' that's expected midweek. More than 2,300 state transportation workers and over 100 National Guard members have been deployed, with the Guard presence expected to grow up to 400 as the situation develops. 'Each one of those individuals has a family that they left to try to protect us,' Beshear said. 'So please stay home, let them clean the roads, and be really careful. Residents are advised to prepare for extended power outages, stock emergency supplies, and locate nearby warming centers if needed.

Man behind New Orleans attack visited the city twice before: FBI	The man behind the New Orleans attack visited the city at least twice in the months before the attack, FBI Special Agent in Charge Lyonel Myrthil said in an update on Sunday. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who was identified as the man shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year’s Day attack on Bourbon Street, traveled to New Orleans in late October and in November. New Orleans attack victims: What we know so far During his first trip, Jabar stayed at a rental home for at least two days beginning on Oct. 30, Myrthil said. While in New Orleans, Jabbar used Meta glasses to record video of the French Quarter as he rode on a bike through the neighborhood. The FBI showed video of Jabbar on the trip with his glasses and encouraged the public to contact them if they saw or interacted with him on that trip. 'Meta glasses appear to look like regular glasses, but they allow the user to record photos and videos hands free. They also allow the user to potentially live stream their video,' Myrthil said at the briefing, adding that Jabbar was wearing the glasses during the attack but did not live stream footage from that day. The second trip to New Orleans, Myrthil said, took place on Nov. 10 but FBI officials 'are still piecing together details of that trip.' Jabbar also traveled to Cairo, Egypt from June 22 to July 3 of 2023, and, a few days later, flew to Ontario, Canada on July 10, returning to the U.S. on July 13. 'Our agents are getting answers as to where he went, who he met with, and how those trips may or may not tie into his actions here in New Orleans,' Myrthil said at the briefing. Officials still say Jabbar, a U.S. citizen from Houston, acted alone when he killed 14 people early on New Year’s Day. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

We have not seen any indications of an accomplice in the United States, but we are still looking into potential associates in the U.S. and outside our borders,' said FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia of the counterterrorism division. 'In any complex terrorism investigation, as we uncover new leads, receive tips from the public, examine electronic devices, and interview witnesses, the information as we know it evolves into a clearer picture and provides more answers,' he continued. 'We are much further along than we were just two days ago and continue to develop a more detailed picture of exactly who Jabbar was.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/new-orleans-attack-suspect/	2025-01-05T13:19:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/new-orleans_attack_01012024_GettyImages-2191517913.png?w=900
Kansas City Chiefs stuck on tarmac for hours after winter weather...	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (WDAF) — Hundreds of flights have been delayed or all out canceled this weekend as a massive winter storm snarled traffic across the country. Among those impacted were the Kansas City Chiefs, who were trying to leave Kansas City on Saturday ahead of their Week 18 matchup against the Denver Broncos. Severe winter weather was sweeping through Kansas City on Saturday, NewsNation affiliate WDAF reported. That, paired with a broken-down treatment truck, forced Kansas City International Airport to shut down its airfield. Officials cited 'rapid ice accumulation' in a statement shortly before 3 p.m. The shutdown also grounded the Chiefs' flight, which was prepared to take off for Denver, the WDAF sports team confirmed. The Chiefs originally planned to leave before the storm could affect their travel plans, however, the plane they were set to fly aboard was delayed in arriving at KCI. There were initially concerns the Chiefs-Broncos game, scheduled for a 3:25 p.m. CT kickoff on Sunday, would be rescheduled. However, shortly before 5 p.m. on Saturday, City Manager Brian Platt said KCI runways would 'reopen and resume normal operations in about 30 minutes.' The Chiefs were eventually able to take off and later landed in Denver at around 7 p.m. CT — nearly three and a half hours later than scheduled, according to FlightAware.com. The flight likely encountered heavy snow en route as well, as snowy conditions stretched across the central U.S. from both coasts. While the Chiefs have already clinched the top seed in the AFC, Sunday's game in Denver could have big playoff implications. The Cincinnati Bengals, who kept their playoff hopes alive with a 19-17 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Saturday, need the Patrick Mahomes-less Chiefs to beat the Broncos and for the New York Jets to secure a win or tie against Miami Dolphins to grab the final playoff spot in the AFC. On the other side of the field, the Broncos will be playing for their first playoff spot since 2015.

Jan. 6: Security preparations in DC on anniversary of Capitol Rio...	(NewsNation) — Congress is expected to certify the election results on Monday, Jan. 6, officially granting Donald Trump a second non-consecutive term as president four years since the 2021 Capitol riots. The counting of ballots is now considered a national security event, and police are preparing for potential unrest on the fourth anniversary. The anticipated day comes after two other violent events occurred on New Year's Day. In New Orleans, a man, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, drove his car into a crowd of tourists on Bourbon Street on New Year’s Day, killing 14 and injuring dozens of others in what the FBI deemed a terrorist attack. Protective barriers were not in place on the streets. Also on New Year’s Day, Army veteran Matthew Livelsberger caused a Tesla Cybertruck to explode outside of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas as a 'wakeup call' to society. Seven people nearby were injured, and the suspect died. With the two attacks, protests during Trump’s first inauguration in 2017, the Capitol riots and Trump’s two assassination attempts in mind, the Secret Service and other security officials are on high alert. Judge denies Jan. 6 rioter’s bid to attend Trump inauguration NewsNation national security contributor Tracy Walder joined 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' Sunday morning to discuss the possible security preparations. 'One of the things that they will have is an extra police presence and sort of a heightened presence, which we have already seen in the nation's capital as a result of this,' said Walder, a former CIA officer and FBI special agent. Walder said she expects the perimeter will be farther back than in the past. Trump will hold a celebratory victory rally on the eve of his inauguration. The inauguration ceremony will be Jan. 20. Unlike in New Orleans where bollards were not in place, there will likely be ones in D.C. for the upcoming presidential events. Why bollards weren’t in place before New Orleans deadly attack 'I think you're going to have more than one security checkpoint. You may have a metal detector entering, then in the original perimeter, the farthest out one. And then you're going to have ones once people enter the arena as well,' Walder said. 'And I do think the bulletproof glass in this case, we have to remember there's been two assassination attempts against President Trump. I think that's a good idea here.' The FBI warned law enforcement last week of potential copycat attacks in an internal bulletin. 'I suspect that there will be copycats,' Walder said. The dead suspect in the New Orleans attack supported the terrorist organization ISIS, according to the FBI. 'The former director of the FBI has been talking a lot about these vehicle-type attacks that ISIS was engaging in, and ISIS told us that they were going to do it back in 2015,' Walder said. 'I think we just sort of forget that they really are encouraging individuals to do this because it's very cheap, it requires basically no training, and it doesn't require individuals who have to go overseas to take part in training.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/january-6-capitol-riots-anniversary-security-preparations/	2025-01-05T10:08:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/677966b713d2e8.37640597.jpeg?w=900
Feeling sick? Here's what you might have	(NewsNation) — Mild sicknesses tend to spike during the winter months, but this season, public health experts are warning of a 'quad-demic.' The unofficial term 'quad-demic' encompasses four infectious diseases: influenza, COVID-19, RSV and norovirus coexist in high numbers. Add in whooping cough, walking pneumonia and bird flu, people are getting sick and may not know how to distinguish among overlapping symptoms. Here's what to know. Are mask mandates making a comeback? Flu Cases of influenza, or the flu, reached 40 million between 2023-2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Most people recover from the flu within days to a couple of weeks, but some cases can become severe. 28,000 people died last flu season. Symptoms include: Fever (some, not all) or feeling feverish/chills Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue (tiredness) One cigarette can decrease life expectancy by 20 minutes: Data COVID-19 COVID-19 has become a part of life just as the flu did. Cases are nowhere near as high as they were when the virus was first introduced, but the U.S. is still seeing positive tests, hospitalizations and deaths. Between Oct. 1, 2024, and Dec. 14, 2024, the CDC estimates there were between 2.7 to nearly 5 million illnesses. Symptoms include: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Sore throat Congestion or runny nose New loss of taste or smell Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea COVID-19 and flu symptoms are similar, but they are caused by different viruses. 'You cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 by symptoms alone because some of the symptoms are the same,' according to the CDC. Anyone experiencing symptoms should take a COVID-19 test, either at a testing site, doctor's office or over-the-counter sold at pharmacies. Testing mice revealed this about getting older: Study RSV RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs, usually peaking in December and January. The symptoms are similar to the common cold and other respiratory infections like the flu and COVID-19. Infants and older adults are most susceptible. RSV can cause other illnesses like bronchiolitis, which is inflammation of the lungs' small airways, and pneumonia. Symptoms include: Runny nose Congestion Decrease in appetite Coughing Sneezing Fever Wheezing The CDC warns that not all symptoms will appear at once and may come in stages. Infants may experience only irritability, decreased activity and breathing difficulties without the other symptoms. University of Michigan lab develops blood test to identify HPV-related cancers Norovirus The stomach bug is striking again. Norovirus is highly contagious spread through contact and causes inflammation of the stomach and intestines. The CDC reports about 19 to 21 million annual cases. People of all ages can get norovirus, but more severe infections occur in children younger than five years old, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. US surgeon general urges cancer warnings on alcohol labels Symptoms typically develop within 12-48 hours of exposure. They include: Diarrhea Vomiting Nausea Stomach pain Fever Headache Body aches Dehydration Other illnesses to watch this winter Bird flu, walking pneumonia and whooping cough are also on doctors' radars. Bird flu: An outbreak of bird flu, or H51N avian influenza, popped up in poultry and dairy cows. The disease is common in wild birds worldwide, but it was recently diagnosed in humans. The CDC confirmed 66 reported cases in the U.S. since last April, detecting the first severe human case in Louisiana on Dec. 13. ‘Bird flu symptoms’: Online searches spike after first severe case in US Infected people may not experience any symptoms, but if they do, symptoms can include an eye infection on the mild side to pneumonia and death in more severe instances. No person-to-person spread has occurred, according to the CDC. Walking pneumonia: Atypical, or walking, pneumonia is a mild lung infection that can develop from bacteria, viruses or mold. Its name comes from the idea that people often don't know they have it and can carry on with daily activities despite the symptoms. People typically are not hospitalized, unlike with severe cases of pneumonia. The CDC reports about two million infections each year, with cases increasing in the later months of last year. Symptoms, similar to those in a bad common cold or the flu, include: Sore throat Fatigue Chest pain or discomfort Low-grade fever (less than 101 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) Mild chills Cough Sneezing Headache What is ‘walking pneumonia’? Whooping cough: Lastly, whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is especially concerning for children who are too young to have completed vaccinations. The highly contagious respiratory tract infection causes a severe hacking cough, following by a 'whoop' sound with an intake of breath, according to the Mayo Clinic. More than 10,000 cases are reported annually, according to the CDC. Symptoms, which begin about five to 10 days after exposure and occur in stages, include: Runny or stuffed-up nose Low-grade fever (less than 100.4°F) Mild occasional cough Vomiting during or after coughing fits Fatigue in between coughs Difficulty sleeping Struggle to breathe	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/infectious-diseases-winter-season-flu-rsv-covid/	2025-01-05T10:05:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-1124732633-1-e1700596920935.jpg?w=800
First major winter storm of 2025 hits US, heavy snow moving east	(NewsNation) — Millions of Americans woke up Sunday morning to winter storm and blizzard warnings -- a system that forecasters are calling one of the strongest winter storms in more than a decade. The storms span from Colorado to Washington, D.C., and the worst of it is still to come across the Midwest and Mid-South before heading east toward Philadelphia and the I-95 corridor. Heavy snow from the Central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic will bring 'damaging ice' and 'freezing rain' through late Monday night, according to the National Weather Service. Snow started falling in Utah Saturday, and then began moving east through the Rockies. Salt Lake City picked up more than a foot of snow in a matter of hours. The first few bands of winter weather caused travel disruptions from Denver through Kansas, creating a bit of a headache for the Kansas City Chiefs football team, whose plane got stuck on the tarmac Saturday for more than three hours due to icy conditions. What to know as snow, freezing rain and bitter cold heads through much of the US The Chiefs landed in Denver late Saturday night ahead of their game Sunday afternoon against the Denver Broncos. Crews were working in Kansas City to get the roads ready as people rushed to the stores to stock up on groceries, water and other essential items. As much as 20 inches of snow is forecast around the Kansas City metro area. 'Shelves are empty. These lines are long. Honestly, all we’re trying to do out here is be as nice to each other as possible because we’re all doing the same thing,' said Caitlynn O’Hara, an Instacart shopper. 'I'm telling you, when the milk truck showed up, we were doing everything in our power to get it stocked,' said Karla Quandt, store director of Hy-Vee Grocery Store in Shawnee, Kansas. 'The refrigerated truck with the eggs, we were literally pulling that and just stocking as fast as we can.' Should you set your thermostat to ’emergency heat’ when weather is very cold? Blizzard warnings are in effect for Kansas City and points west until 3 a.m. local time Monday, and winter storm warnings are in effect for parts of 15 states. The storm system stretches from the Kansas-Oklahoma border to the Atlantic and is only just ramping up. State officials as far east as Virginia are already urging residents to prepare for a long week. The winter storm will not directly impact any major airline hubs, so cities like Chicago, Minneapolis and Atlanta will they spared, although conditions at the smaller regional airports may create a trickle-down effect. Other areas are seeing flight cancellations, however. Across the Midwest, more than half of all flights into and out of Kansas City and St. Louis are canceled Sunday. Cincinnati, Ohio, is also seeing delays piling up. States of emergency are in effect in Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana as many kids are returning to school from winter break.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/major-winter-storm-blizzard-warnings/	2025-01-05T10:00:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/6779d285a733d9.18901221.jpeg?w=900
Higher Social Security payments coming for millions of people fro...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Sunday plans to sign into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees, affecting nearly 3 million people who receive pensions from their time as teachers, firefighters, police officers and in other public service jobs. Advocates say the Social Security Fairness Act rights a decades-old disparity, though it will also put strain on Social Security Trust Funds, which face a looming insolvency crisis. The bill rescinds two provisions — the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset — that limit Social Security benefits for recipients if they get retirement payments from other sources, including public retirement programs from a state or local government. The Congressional Research Service estimated that in December 2023, there were 745,679 people, about 1% of all Social Security beneficiaries, who had their benefits reduced by the Government Pension Offset. About 2.1 million people, or about 3% of all beneficiaries, were affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in September that eliminating the Windfall Elimination Provision would boost monthly payments to the affected beneficiaries by an average of $360 by December 2025. Ending the Government Pension Offset would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, according to the CBO. The increase would be an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit. Those amounts would increase over time with Social Security’s regular cost-of-living adjustments. The change is to payments from January 2024 and beyond, meaning the Social Security Administration would owe back-dated payments. The measure as passed by Congress says the Social Security commissioner 'shall adjust primary insurance amounts to the extent necessary to take into account' changes in the law. It's not immediately clear how this will happen or whether people affected will have to take any action. Edward Kelly, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, said firefighters across the country are 'excited to see the change — we've righted a 40-year wrong.' Kelly said the policy was 'far more egregious for surviving spouses of firefighters who paid their own quotas into Social Security but were victimized by the government pension system.' The IAFF has roughly 320,000 members, which does not include hundreds of thousands of retirees who will benefit from the change. 'Now firefighters who get paid very little can now afford to actually retire,' Kelly said. Sherrod Brown, who as an Ohio senator pushed for the proposal for years, lost his reelection bid in November. Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees labor union, thanked Brown for his advocacy. 'Over two million public service workers will finally be able to access the Social Security benefits they spent their careers paying into,' Saunders said in a statement. 'Many will finally be able to enjoy retirement after a lifetime of service.' National Education Association President Becky Pringle said the law is 'a historic victory that will improve the lives of educators, first responders, postal workers and others who dedicate their lives to public service in their communities.' And while some Republicans such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins supported the legislation, others, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, voted against it. 'We caved to the pressure of the moment instead of doing this on a sustainable basis,' Tillis told The Associated Press last month. Still, Republican supporters of the bill said there was a rare opportunity to address what they described as an unfair section of federal law that hurts public service retirees. The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, receive Social Security benefits. The policy changes from the new law will heap more administrative work on the Social Security Administration, which is already at its lowest staffing level in decades. The agency, currently under a hiring freeze, has a staff of about 56,645 — the lowest level in over 50 years even as it serves more people than ever. The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released last May said the program’s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. The new law will hasten the program’s insolvency date by about half a year. ___ Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-higher-social-security-payments-coming-for-millions-of-people-from-bill-that-biden-is-signing/	2025-01-05T09:54:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/677ac8a082ac39.21103709.jpeg?w=900
Johnson tells House GOP Trump wants one reconciliation package	Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told House Republicans on Saturday that President-elect Trump wants to pass one reconciliation package, a strategy that runs counter to the two-bill effort several other GOP lawmakers had been pushing for. Johnson made the announcement during a private House GOP meeting at Fort McNair, five sources in the room told The Hill, as the conference gathered to discuss plans for moving legislation through the budget reconciliation process. The Republican trifecta — taking full control of the White House and both chambers of Congress in the 2024 election — is looking to use it to bypass Democratic opposition and pass many of its priorities. Johnson told lawmakers that the president-elect wants to pass 'one big beautiful bill,' according to two of the sources. Biden to award Medal of Freedom to 19 people, including Pelosi, Gore, Ledecky and Bloomberg Trump’s stance directly contrasts with the preference of many Republicans up on Capitol Hill, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), who laid out a plan last month that includes two reconciliation packages. The first would focus on border security and defense, and the other centered on extending the Trump-era tax cuts, which have some provisions that are set to expire at the end of 2025. Additionally, the conservative House Freedom Caucus endorsed the two-track plan in December, writing in a letter to Johnson that the House should move on one package focused on the border, and a second encompassing taxes and other matters. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, reiterated that position as recently as Saturday morning. 'There are a group of us who support breaking it up into two pieces,' Harris told Fox News in an interview. 'The first piece, a very small border piece where we give the president the money that he needs to secure our southern border and start deporting illegal, criminal aliens.' 'The president needs some funds now and that’s the quickest way to do it, and that’s the way, again, a group of us think we should do that,' he added later. 'Saving the large, big, beautiful bill till the summer because it will take time to iron out.' Judge denies Jan. 6 rioter’s bid to attend Trump inauguration Stephen Miller, Trump’s incoming deputy chief of staff for policy, has also endorsed the two-package approach. Trump’s position, however, does align with that of House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.), who has been adamant that Congress should plan for one reconciliation package, not two, citing previous legislative undertakings and the razor-thin margin Republicans have in this Congress. 'There have not been two reconciliations that have been signed into law in the same year,' Smith said last month. 'And why would we think in a majority of 219 to 215 that we would over perform?' Emily Brooks contributed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/johnson-trump-one-policy-bill/	2025-01-04T15:36:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25004023957093-e1736018855910.jpg?w=900
Hillary Clinton, George Soros and Denzel Washington received the ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — In the East Room of the White House on a particularly frigid Saturday afternoon, President Joe Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 19 of the most famous names in politics, sports, entertainment, civil rights, LGBTQ+ advocacy and science. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton aroused a standing ovation from the crowd as she received her medal. Clinton was accompanied to the event by her husband former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea Clinton and grandchildren. Democratic philanthropist George Soros and actor-director Denzel Washington were also awarded the nation’s highest civilian honor in a White House ceremony. 'For the final time as president I have the honor bestowing the Medal of Freedom, our nation’s highest civilian honor, on a group of extraordinary, truly extraordinary people, who gave their sacred effort, their sacred effort, to shape the culture and the cause of America,' Biden said in his opening remarks. 'Let me just say to each of you, thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’ve done to help this country,' Biden said Saturday. Four medals were awarded posthumously. They went to George W. Romney, who served as both a Michigan governor and secretary of housing and urban development; former Attorney General and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy; Ash Carter, a former secretary of defense; and Fannie Lou Hamer, who founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and laid the groundwork for the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Kennedy is father to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for health and human services secretary. Biden said, 'Bobby is one of my true political heroes. I love and I miss him dearly.' Romney is the father of former Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, one of Trump's strongest conservative critics. Biden has days left in the Presidential office and has spent the last few days issuing awards and medals to valiant military veterans, courageous law enforcement officials and exceptional Americans. The White House said the Medal of Freedom recipients have made 'exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors.' Major philanthropists receiving the award include Spanish American chef José Andrés, whose World Central Kitchen charity has become one of the world's most recognized food relief organizations, and Bono, the front man for rock band U2 and a social justice activist. Soros' son Alex Soros accepted the medal on his father's behalf. In an emailed statement, Soros said: 'As an immigrant who found freedom and prosperity in America, I am deeply moved by this honor.' Sports and entertainment stars recognized include professional soccer player Lionel Messi, who did not attend the event; retired Los Angeles Lakers basketball legend and businessman Earvin 'Magic' Johnson; actor Michael J. Fox, who is an outspoken advocate for Parkinson’s disease research and development; and William Sanford Nye, known to generations of students as 'Bill Nye the Science Guy.' Other awardees include conservationist Jane Goodall; longtime Vogue Magazine editor-in-chief Anna Wintour; American fashion designer Ralph Lauren; American Film Institute founder George Stevens Jr.; entrepreneur and LGBTQ+ activist Tim Gill; and David Rubenstein, co-founder of The Carlyle Group global investment firm. Lauren is the first fashion designer to receive the honor. Last year, Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on 19 people, including the late Medgar Evers, House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina and actor Michelle Yeoh. The Presidential Medal of Freedom was awarded 654 times between 1963 and 2024, according to the Congressional Research Service. Notable Medal of Freedom recipients from the past include Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Maya Angelou and Mother Teresa. ___	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-hillary-clinton-george-soros-and-denzel-washington-will-receive-the-highest-us-civilian-honor/	2025-01-04T15:36:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/6779c6d278c895.89390030.jpeg?w=900
Carville reflects on failed prediction that Harris would defeat T...	Democratic political strategist James Carville, who has been openly critical of the Harris campaign since Democrats' 2024 election losses, reflected on his failed prediction that Vice President Harris would win against President-elect Trump, calling it 'very depressing.' In an interview Saturday with CNN's Michael Smerconish, Carville was asked about a recent op-ed in The New York Times in which he blamed the economy for the vice president's defeat, leaning heavily on his famous catchphrase: 'It's the economy, stupid.' The news host read a comment from a reader in response to the essay, who argued that the U.S. doesn't seem to base its vote on the character, honesty or decency of the candidate. The veteran strategist concurred. 'I totally agree with that person. It’s very depressing,' Carville, who spent much of his career as an adviser to former President Clinton, responded in the interview, highlighted by Mediaite. 'But if you’re doing political strategy, you know, if you have an airplane crash, you’ve got to go back and find out what went wrong. You don’t say, well, let’s just forget about it and move on.' 'No, was the flap set in the right setting or, you know, was there something that the pilot didn’t pay attention to? I don’t know, but it is sort of depressing,' he continued. 'But, you know, Michael, there’s the simple, basic rule of politics is voters want an election about them. They don’t want an election about you or your opponent. And for too much, we lost that. I lost it myself.' Carville argued that Democrats gave Trump too much of the spotlight, leaving voter concerns and desires in the dark. 'We didn’t make it about voters. And that’s all. It’s never a good idea. And how could I, at 80 years old, been doing this for 50 years, lapse into that level of stupidity? You know, I’ve got to ask myself,' he said. 'But I think we did. And, you know, let’s learn from this. It’s a disaster,' Carville continued. 'I agree, it’s depressing, but to have an event like this and not learn from it, I think is the biggest mistake we can make.' In a recent interview with The Hill's 'Rising' show, Carville also slammed Democrats for bucking what he called 'NPR language' — referring to language previously deemed 'politically correct' — during the campaign cycle. These phrases, such as 'defund the police' and 'LatinX' were memorable. 'What you look for with politics revolves around things we call sticky, things that you remember, like ‘Defund the police,’ three stupidest words in the history of the English language,' he told guest host Niall Stanage. 'But it stuck.' The Louisiana Democrat has also been critical of the Harris campaign for its 'unfathomable spending' which has been under scrutiny since she conceded the race to Trump.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/james-carville-harris-trump-election/	2025-01-04T11:45:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/James-Carville-Kamala-Harris-01.04.png?w=900
Hillary Clinton, George Soros and Denzel Washington will receive ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Democratic philanthropist George Soros and actor-director Denzel Washington will be awarded the nation's highest civilian honor on Saturday in a White House ceremony. President Joe Biden will bestow the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 19 of the most famous names in politics, sports, entertainment, civil rights, LGBTQ+ advocacy and science. The White House said the recipients have made 'exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors.' Four medals are to be awarded posthumously. They are going to Fannie Lou Hamer, who founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and laid the groundwork for the 1965 Voting Rights Act; former Attorney General and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy; George W. Romney, who served as both a Michigan governor and secretary of housing and urban development; and Ash Carter, a former secretary of defense. Kennedy is father to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for health and human services secretary. Romney is the father of former Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, one of Trump's strongest conservative critics. Major philanthropists receiving the award include Spanish American chef José Andrés, whose World Central Kitchen charity has become one of the world's most recognized food relief organizations, and Bono, the frontman for rock band U2 and a social justice activist. Sports and entertainment stars being recognized include professional soccer player Lionel Messi; retired Los Angeles Lakers basketball legend and businessman Earvin 'Magic' Johnson; actor Michael J.

James Clyburn of South Carolina and actor Michelle Yeoh.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/hillary-clinton-george-soros-and-denzel-washington-will-receive-the-highest-us-civilian-honor/	2025-01-04T11:29:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25004449312937-e1736012598736.jpg?w=800
Johnson faces tough road on Trump agenda after dramatic Speaker v...	Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) kept his gavel amid a threat from the right flank of the House GOP, but managing the House GOP is not going to get any easier from here. The dramatic Friday Speaker vote on the House floor – in which three Republicans nearly kept Johnson from the gavel before two of them reversed course to support him – showcased the challenges ahead as Johnson aims to usher President-elect Trump’s ambitious legislative agenda through a razor-thin House majority. Around a dozen Republicans had withheld support for Johnson ahead of the vote, demanding that Johnson make commitments on spending reductions and a more open process for crafting major legislation. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who had withheld support for Johnson up to the vote, referenced widespread frustration with how Johnson handled a December short-term spending bill while issuing a warning. 'If anything happens like happened before – right before Christmas, there will be consequences,' Roy told reporters after Johnson’s election. The point of a number of members initially withholding votes for Speaker, Roy said, 'was about making clear to the conference that there's a block of folks who are going to want to make sure that we actually deliver.' Johnson, for his part, did release a public statement shortly before the vote making commitments on working groups to implement government-reducing reforms. And after securing the gavel, he projected openness to scrutiny from members. 'It’s a very different situation than the last Congress was, and they can hold me accountable for that,' Johnson told reporters after the vote. 'We’re going to have a member-driven, bottom-up process for this really important legislation, and we must succeed. We have no margin for error.' Johnson’s top priority, now, will be crafting one or two bills jam-packed with Trump agenda items – such as extending Trump’s tax cuts and addressing border security – which they aim to pass through a party-line 'reconciliation' process that bypasses the threat of a Democratic filibuster. But getting the fractious House GOP behind the package could prove to be as tall of a task for Johnson as it was to secure the votes to be reelected Speaker. In the razor-thin House majority, opposition from just a member or two can sink any party-line measure. The House currently has 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats, with that margin set to get even slimmer when a number of House members join the Trump administration. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), in an interview with NBC’s Kristin Welkerfor 'Meet the Press' that was conducted as the House was choosing its Speaker, said that Johnson has 'a really, really tough job' with that margin. 'He's got a lot of folks that are headed in different directions,' Thune said. 'I mean, as you know, that with a narrow margin like that, any individual member of the House of Representatives can have a huge impact.' 'We will need to be as a Senate and with the White House working closely as a team, if we're going to get an agenda done that we want to accomplish for the American people,' Thune said. Plans for that massive bill of Trump priorities also got a new wrinkle last week of Trump’s surprise demands last month to raise the debt ceiling. To meet Trump’s request, House Republicans in December struck a handshake agreement to raise the debt ceiling in the reconciliation bill by $1.5 trillion while pairing it with $2.5 trillion spending cuts. But figuring out those cuts and meeting those steep spending demands will be very tough, as forecasted by Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) – one of the Republicans who voted for a candidate other than Johnson before switching to support him. 'When the reconciliation bills come up and people have to sacrifice, because every dollar spent up here has got an advocate, fight for it,' Norman said of what he expects from the Speaker. 'If the cut is defined as a reduction of the increase, that's not going to sit well for a lot of us, and we're not putting up with that,' Norman added. Rep. Keith Self (Texas), the other Republican who switched his vote from another candidate to Johnson, said that commitments from Johnson on who will be designing that massive bill helped win him over. 'We shored up the reconciliation team, because we know this will be a heavy lift to get the Trump agenda across the line in the reconciliation package,' Self said. 'So, we shored up the negotiating team. That’s all we did.' Self declined to elaborate on who the negotiating team would be, but said that it would include members beyond the leadership, including members of the House Freedom Caucus. House Republicans are set to hold an all-day planning session for that Trump agenda bill on Saturday. Johnson’s struggles do not stop there. Eleven board members of the hard-line conservative group, including Roy, also sent a warning shot to Johnson in the form of a letter. The members said that while they voted for Johnson to be Speaker 'because of our steadfast support of President Trump and to ensure the timely certification of his electors,' they had 'sincere reservations regarding the Speaker’s track record.' The members made a number of requests in the letter, including that the reconciliation package should reduce spending and the deficit, that members must be allowed to offer amendments to legislation, and that leadership should abide by a 72-hour rule to give members time to read and debate proposed legislation. The number of members on that letter is notable given the new 9-member threshold on triggering a snap vote on ousting the Speaker, known as the 'motion to vacate.' If the 11 banded together, they could force Johnson out of the Speakership. Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.), one of the 11 who signed that letter, said that the threat of ouster is an important accountability measure. 'You got to be careful. Nobody wants to have, you know, sword over their head, but we have a motion to vacate for a reason,' Ogles said of Johnson. 'He's been given a job. He's got to go do that job.'

TIME TO WAKE UP!' Tesla Cybertruck driver left messages before L...	LAS VEGAS (KLAS) -- 'This was not a terrorist attack, it was a wake up call,' a note found on a phone inside the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded on New Year’s Day outside the Las Vegas International Trump Hotel said, according to police. At a news conference Friday, law enforcement officials gave additional details on the events that led up to Matthew Livelsberger, 37, driving a Tesla Cybertruck to the hotel and detonating explosive materials inside it. Livelsberger died from a gunshot wound to the head just before the explosion, the coroner's office ruled Thursday. LVMPD Sheriff Kevin McMahill said Livelsberger was positively identified by a number of things, including tattoo comparisons, showing a tiger arm tattoo on a photo of Livelsberger that matched one found on his body. Photos provided by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department are shown comparing the tattoos of the person found at the scene of the explosion at Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, and those of Matthew Livelsberger.Photos provided by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department show the tattoos of the person found at the scene of the explosion at Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.Photos provided by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department are shown comparing the tattoos of the person found at the scene of the explosion at Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, and those of Matthew Livelsberger. 'While the body was still in the vehicle, we were unable to identify those specific tattoos until we were able to remove some of it,' McMahill said. Additionally, the Department of Defense provided Livelsberger’s dental records to the LVMPD and the Clark County coroner’s office used those to positively identify him. Livelsberger’s family also provided DNA to the LVMPD which also positively matched him to the body. A surveillance photo showed Livelsberger in Colorado wearing a distinctive jacket, which police matched to a surveillance video in Las Vegas, law enforcement added. Matthew Livelsberger is shown is a screen capture from security camera video provided by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Video from public areas, call data records, financial records, and Tesla charging station records were used to determine the route Livelsberger took as well as determine that he was the only person in the Cybertruck. 'It’s evident that [Livelsberger] considered, planned, and thoughtfully prepared for this act alone,' FBI Special Agent Spencer Evans said. Evans added that despite the public nature of the incident, it 'ultimately appears to be a tragic case of suicide involving a heavily decorated combat veteran who was suffering with PTSD and other issues.' Livelsberger likely suffered from PTSD and police said they were aware of potential family issues or personal grievances that might have been contributing factors, Evans said. Law enforcement recovered two cell phones from the vehicle and the LVMPD was able to access the data in one of them. Police said as of Friday, there is still a lot of data to go through on the cell phones and an additional laptop recovered, as well as outstanding search warrants, subpoenas, and interviews around the world, but were able to share some of the information found on the phone. A note-taking application revealed a note titled 'surveillance log,' which contained 'a journal of activity' started around 10 days before the bombing, Asst. Sheriff Dori Koren, who oversees the LVMPD counter-terrorism unit, said. In the note, police were able to identify locations on the route Livelsberger took to Las Vegas as well as activity police saw on surveillance video, such as Livelsberger purchasing firearms and camping equipment. Screenshots provided by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department show excerpts of documents found in Matthew Livelsberger devices.Screenshots provided by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department show excerpts of documents found in Matthew Livelsberger devices.Screenshots provided by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department show excerpts of documents found in Matthew Livelsberger devices. In the app, police found two letters, which contained a variety of 'grievances and issues, some political, some personal,' Koren said. Police shared the following excerpt from the first letter: 'Fellow servicemembers, Veterans, and all Americans. TIME TO WAKE UP! We are being led by weak and feckless [sic] leadership who only serve to enrich themselves.' Evans said Livelsberger held no animosity toward President-elect Donald Trump. An excerpt from the second letter read: 'This was not a terrorist attack, it was a wake up call. Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence. What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives? Why did I personally do it now? I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I’ve lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.' Late Friday afternoon, Las Vegas Metro police released the full letters found in the vehicle which are provided below. PO-003a-01-03-25-Livelsbergers-Letters-1Download Law enforcement added that they were 'very well aware of a podcast that is going around today and the contents of a letter in that podcast.' That podcast in question is 'The Shawn Ryan Show,' one hosted by a former Navy SEAL. The podcast released an interview Friday morning with a former intelligence analyst who said he received an email from Livelsberger in the days before the explosion. The analyst said Livelsberger’s letter was about Chinese drones. Special Agent Evans said they had not verified the validity of the email as of Friday.

(LVMPD) The guns found in the Cybertruck were purchased lawfully on Dec. 27 at a gun store in Colorado by Livelsberger, ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge Kenny Cooper said. Livelsberger picked them up alone in the Cybertruck on Dec. 30. Tesla engineers helped Las Vegas police extract a chip from the truck and learned that the vehicle was not in self-driving mode at any time during the incident. There is no evidence that the bombing in Las Vegas and the terrorist attack in New Orleans are connected, Evans said. The only things connecting the two events are 'coincidental similarities,' he added. Those similarities include the vehicles being rented from the same company and both subjects served in the military. 'We’ve identified no telephonic or emails between the subjects,' Evans said. 'No information that they knew each other, that they were assigned in the same unit, that they were ever assigned at the same place at the same time.' He added that there was no connection between Livelsberger and 'any other terrorist organization.' Anyone with information was asked to contact the FBI at 800-CALL-FBI.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/time-to-wake-up-tesla-cybertruck-driver-left-messages-before-las-vegas-bombing/	2025-01-03T18:25:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-01-21h09m10s214_3557d4.png?w=900
Capitol Hill's newest faces ready for bipartisan collaboration	(NewsNation) — Dozens of new lawmakers were sworn in, and Mike Johnson retained his position as House speaker Friday as the 119th Congress convened. Freshman Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, told NewsNation it is a 'real honor to serve the people of Alaska here in Washington, D.C.,' just an hour before he was sworn in Friday, Begich defeated incumbent Democrat Mary Peltola with 48.5% of the vote. The businessman previously lost twice to Peltola in 2022. In the 2024 general election, President-elect Donald Trump endorsed him. 'I think we’ve got a lot of opportunity with a unified House and Senate and presidency,' Begich said. 'We’ve got the trifecta, we’ve got to use that to deliver on the America First Agenda.' The agenda, he said, consists of tightening border security, monitoring inflation and resolving world conflicts. New Year’s Day incidents fuel fears around inauguration security Begich said he spent his first day 'meeting and getting to know a lot of my Republican colleagues,' adding that he has the next two years to interact with Democratic lawmakers. 'At the end of the day, the American people want to see results, and that’s going to take working across the aisle when it makes sense,' Begich said. Across the aisle, the House's youngest female member, Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Ariz., entered Congress with both excitement and apprehension. 'It's been a long journey to get to this point, and after a grueling campaign and immense amount of hard work that went into this, I am really excited,' Ansari said. Ansari won her seat — formerly held by now-Senator Ruben Gallego — with 73.3% of the vote against Republican Jeff Zink. She acknowledged it's a challenging time 'to go into Congress, with a trifecta minority for Democrats. So, my team and I have been working really hard together to prepare on all fronts what we hope to get done legislatively.' Federal appeals court strikes down Biden net neutrality rules The daughter of immigrants, Ansari asserted that the United States' 'pro-immigration' stance is 'what makes us special, that’s what makes us unique, that is what helps our economy thrive.' Ansari will serve as the Democratic freshman class president and has already planned to meet with her Republican counterpart. 'I believe in bipartisanship. I think that if what Republicans have said is important to them — issues like the economy, I’m all in ... I’m ready to work with whoever, I want to make sure at least within my class we can create those bipartisan relationships,' Ansari said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/capitol-hills-newest-faces-collaboration/	2025-01-03T15:01:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2191716265.jpg?w=900
Why conspiracy theories exist over Las Vegas explosion	(NewsNation) — Within hours of a Tesla Cybertruck exploding in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, theories surrounding a former Green Beret's involvement in the blast began to surface on social media. Las Vegas-area investigators say Matthew Livelsberger placed firework mortars and camping fuel canisters in the back of the vehicle, which exploded within 17 seconds after he parked the truck, injuring seven people. The explosion and investigation produced similarities with the deadly attack in New Orleans, which killed 14 people and injured dozens more. At this time, the FBI says no evidence exists to link the two incidents despite Livelsberger and Shamsud-Din Jabbar both renting vehicles from the same company and both serving with the U.S. Army. Diddy’s ‘inner circle’ breaks silence in new documentary But unanswered questions in the Las Vegas case have left some delving into self-investigations about Livelsberger’s motivations. What conspiracy theorists are saying The Clark County, Nevada, coroner determined Livelsberger, 37, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound before the explosion took place. Investigators also said that the explosives found in the back of the Cybertruck, and not the vehicle itself, prompted the explosion. But investigators admitted Friday that they are still struggling to determine Livelsberger's motive. However, people behind X (formerly Twitter) accounts like @EndWokeness pointed to Livelsberger’s military experience as a Green Beret and military bomb expert and wondered online why he would have used 'amateur explosives.' 'Did someone put his corpse in the car? Remember, the car is fully self-driving,' one said. A photo of Matthew Alan Livelsberger is shown as Sheriff Kevin McMahill talks to the news media at Metropolitan Police Department headquarters in Las Vegas Thursday, Jan. 2, 2025, regarding the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded at the Trump International Hotel. (K.M. Cannon/Las Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Elon Musk, who posted to his X account several times in the hours after the explosion, responded directly to the theory, debunking the notion that Livelsberger could have been killed elsewhere. Musk wrote that the Cybertruck’s autopilot function would not have worked as it requires a 'functioning person' in the driver’s seat. Other posters on X questioned why, if Livensberger's body was burned beyond recognition, his passport and military identification card survived the blast. And there are questions about why Livensberger would shoot himself just before he knew the explosion was going to take place. 'The entire narrative makes absolutely ZERO sense to me,' the X poster wrote on their account. Adam Housley, a former journalist and senior television news correspondent, said that based on Livensberger's experience as a Green Beret, investigators' explanation of this week's explosion, 'does not pass the smell test'. Others questioned in social media posts why a veteran with Special Forces experience would use a bulletproof and fireproof vehicle to carry out such a 'mission' and why Livelsberger would reportedly communicate with his ex-girlfriend about the vehicle he had rented.

(AP Photo/Ty ONeil) Some theorists have focused their speculation on politics, including Livelsberger choosing a hotel owned by Trump as the destination for the explosion. His family described him as a 'Rambo-type' who loved Trump. Livelsberger’s uncle, Dean Livelsberger, told The Independent that he believed initially that the Cybertruck’s battery short-circuited. But when he found out what had caused the explosion, Dean Livelsberger said his nephew would have been able to construct a 'more sophisticated explosive' than what was used. Former ‘Home Improvement’ star Zachery Ty Bryan jailed He said that Matthew Livelsberger could have created an explosive that would have destroyed half the hotel if he 'seriously wanted to hurt others.' He added: 'Think of Oklahoma City. (Timothy) McVeigh was just a normal soldier. Not a Tier 1 operator like Matt.' Why conspiracy theories exist Joseph Uscinsky, a University of Miami political science professor who specializes in conspiracy theories, told NewsNation his polling shows that, on average, between 10% and 35% of Americans are conspiracy-minded. Historically, the only event in which at least 50% of Americans believed a conspiracy was at play was the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, he says. But when events like this week’s take place and garner high doses of media coverage, people begin to consider different opinions. 'Some humans are inclined toward conspiracy theories. They just see the world through that lens,' Uscinsky said. 'So when they see the coverage (of an event) they think, 'Ah, this thing happened so it must be a conspiracy where other people will look at it and say. 'Oh, that was incompetence or accident’ or God did it, or angels or demons. Everyone has their own worldview, and that’s what leads them to reach certain conclusions.' Conspiracy theories are not limited to large-scale events. For those who constantly look at daily events and conclude that someone or something that they don’t like is conspiring against them, Uscinsky says an event’s notoriety does not matter. In most cases, conspiracy theories don’t have a great deal of detail or evidence to back them up, Uscinsky said. Current societal norms play a role. Although social media platforms like X and TikTok give voice to certain theories, they don't add to the population of those who believe, the Miami professor said. The shelf life of most conspiracies remains short-lived. The notable exception is the Kennedy assassination, which — 51 years after the fact — remains debated, with at least half of Americans believing Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone. However, in cases like this week’s Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas and deadly attack in New Orleans, the tendency is that prevailing conspiracy theorists will move on when something else happens, Uscinsky said. 'Two people exposed to the same exact information will come to very different conclusions about it simply because of who they are,' Uscinsky told NewsNation. 'That’s all that’s really going on here.'

Motive remains elusive in Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion	LAS VEGAS (NewsNation) — The central question now is why would Matthew Livelsberger rent the Cybertruck in Denver on Dec. 28 and drive 1,000 miles to Las Vegas? It’s a mystery to those investigating the explosion outside of the Trump International Hotel — and those who knew him. Authorities tracked Livelsberger’s movements through Tesla charging stations in Albuquerque on New Year’s Eve and Kingman, Arizona, in the early morning hours of Jan. 1. With fuel canisters and large firework mortars in the back, the Cybertruck was parked for 17 seconds before it exploded, according to investigators. 'I’m comfortable calling it a suicide with the bombing that occurred immediately thereafter,' said Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill. 'I’m not giving it any other labels.' New Orleans attack, Las Vegas explosion share similarities Spencer Evans, a special agent in charge of the FBI's Las Vegas Division, said they’re still investigating a motive. 'Obviously, we're always concerned in these sorts of events to ascertain what the motive is,' he said. 'We understand that's at the forefront of everyone's thoughts. So looking into exactly what the motivation is remains our No. 1 priority.' As federal authorities continue to investigate Livelsberger’s home in Colorado Springs, a neighbor tells NewsNation he seemed a typical family man. 'His wife … we just started working out together at the gym, not intentionally, but just coincidentally,' said neighbor Keni Mac. 'She just had a baby … a newborn. We didn’t see him as much as we saw her, but he is around. All I can say is that they're a very normal family, and so it's very strange to me that this would be the case.' Livelsberger’s LinkedIn profile shows a decorated Army veteran in the Special Forces who enlisted at 18 and spent nearly two decades in the career. Menendez brothers’ family meeting with new LA district attorney The New York Post reports that his wife had recently left him over accusations of infidelity. Livelsberger’s former girlfriend claims he sent her texts out of the blue. 'I rented a Cybertruck. I feel like Batman or Halo,' he texted one, according to The Denver Gazette. She said the texts from Livelsberger were playful and lighthearted. 'I just want everyone to know that Matt was the kindest man I ever knew.' Livelsberger’s former girlfriend said that his behavior changed after he returned from a tour in the Middle East and that he suffered from a traumatic brain injury five years ago.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/las-vegas-cybertruck-explosion-motive/	2025-01-03T12:50:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2191605454.jpg?w=900
Live updates: Memo detailing Johnson 'fails' circulating among Re...	A five-page, 26-point memo detailing 'fails' under Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) leadership is circulating among House Republicans as the first ballot draws near. A copy of the document obtained by The Hill reads: 'The House must be organized to deliver on the historic mandate granted to President Trump and Republicans. It currently is not – as demonstrated many times over the last year and, most recently, the week before Christmas.' Johnson has a narrow margin for error in Friday's Speakership vote. Assuming all members are present and voting for a candidate, Johnson can afford to lose only one GOP vote — and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) is widely seen as an immovable 'no.' Roughly a dozen other conservative Republicans are undecided. The election of the Speaker must be completed before the House can take any other actions, including swearing in its members, adopting a rules package and, eventually, certifying President-elect Trump's victory Monday. On the other side of the Capitol, senators anticipate far less drama but will also see new members sworn in on the first day of the new Congress.

Live: LA district attorney on meeting Menendez brothers' family	(NewsNation) — Family members of Erik and Lyle Menendez met with the new Los Angeles District Attorney, Nathan Hochman, to advocate for a 'fair and just resentencing' for the brothers on Friday. Hochman addressed the public Friday evening in a press conference. 'As we prepare to meet with DA Hochman, our family is hopeful for an open and fair discussion. Despite the abuse they endured as children and the unfairness of their current sentence, Erik and Lyle Menendez have spent the last three decades taking responsibility for their actions and contributing positively to their community through leadership and rehabilitation,' a statement from the family said. Over 20 members of the family are set to speak with Hochman, during which they will 'share their perspective on Erik and Lyle's immense personal growth over the last 35 years and the ways in which we plan to support them in their next chapters,' the statement said. 'We hope that this meeting will put us a step closer to spending next Christmas reunited as a family,' the statement said. Police identify Livelsberger as driver in Vegas Cybertruck explosion Menendez brothers resentencing hearing Jan. 30 The Menendez brothers were convicted in the murder of their parents and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 without possibility of parole. Their first trial ended in a mistrial. While the brothers' attorneys never denied they killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, they argued the pair acted out of self-defense after years of emotional and sexual abuse by their father. A resentencing plea is set to be heard at a hearing on Jan. 30. Los Angeles prosecutors had recommended the resentencing, saying they demonstrated good behavior and rehabilitation in prison. Attorneys presented new evidence of the sexual abuse the brothers said they suffered, and filed a habeas corpus petition in May 2023 asking a judge to consider it. New evidence includes a letter Erik Menendez wrote in 1988 to his uncle about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of his father. In addition, Roy Rossello, a former member of the Latin pop group Menudo, said Jose Menendez drugged and raped him as a teen. Jose Menendez was chief operating officer at RCA Records, where Menudo was signed. New Orleans attack was ‘very traumatic’: Survivor Freedom for the brothers is now possible with a resentencing plea eligible to be heard at a hearing set for Jan. 30. Renewed public interest in the case came after a Netflix drama and documentary were released. Former Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón, who lost re-election to Hochman, asked the judge to give the Menendez brothers a new sentence of 50 years to life which could make them immediately eligible for parole.

Here’s what Congress’s first day will look like	The 119th Congress kicks off Friday as lawmakers return to Washington with a long January to-do list and a packed first day. Confirmation hearings for President-elect Trump’s Cabinet nominees are set to get rolling in the coming weeks, and Trump himself will be inaugurated in less than three weeks. But first, House Republicans have some business to attend to: picking a Speaker. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is in line to lead the House once again, but the path to get there is tricky as hard-line conservatives have thrown up roadblocks and he has almost no room for error. Here’s a quick look at what to expect on Congress’s first day of work in 2025. Electing a Speaker Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) talks briefly to reporters just before a vote on an interim spending bill to prevent a government shutdown after President-elect Trump abruptly rejected a bipartisan plan at the Capitol in Washington, Dec. 19, 2024. The vote failed to pass. (Greg Nash) The first vote of the year in either chamber will take place in the House, and that will be to select a new Speaker. It is scheduled to take place at noon EST. Put simply, no business in the House can take place without selecting a Speaker. Members can’t be sworn in, and they can’t be paid. A rules package can’t be adopted, nor can committees be seated. This became all the more evident after the multiple battles surrounding the Speakership over the past two years. It took 15 ballots over five days for Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to win the gavel — a period during which no business was conducted. Similarly, the House came to a standstill for about three weeks after McCarthy was removed from the top spot, with the chamber unable to consider legislation, among other things, during that stretch until Republicans elected Johnson. At this point, it is unclear whether Johnson can get the requisite 218 votes needed to hold the gavel. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has insisted he will vote for someone other than Johnson, meaning the Speaker cannot lose any other votes from Republicans. There are expected to be 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats, with one vacancy. Trump has thrown his weight behind the Speaker and said that he will lobby conservatives individually 'if necessary.' Notably, it is in Trump’s interest to get the Speaker race over and done with. Why? Because come Monday, a joint session of Congress will convene to certify the results of the presidential election, and without a Speaker that cannot take place. Swearing in members, adopting a rules package Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) gives a speech following his election to Speaker in the House Chamber on Oct. 25, 2023. (Greg Nash) House members will be sworn in en masse on the House floor, but that can’t take place until after the Speaker is elected. All told, there will be 65 new members being sworn into office. After that, lawmakers will need to pass a package of rules that would govern the operations of the House. This would allow the formation of committees and for bills to be debated and considered on the floor, among other things. There are also some notable changes included in the 119th Congress’s rules package. The headliner is that the threshold to trigger a motion to vacate the Speaker is increased from a single member to nine members, giving Johnson more breathing room if he is able to secure the gavel. Additionally, there are a pair of name alterations for committees and language that would greenlight panels to create electronic voting rules. What’s the Senate schedule look like? Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) addresses reporters after the weekly policy luncheon, July 9, 2024. (Greg Nash) The Senate will also kick off the 119th Congress, though without much of the fanfare happening in the House. The upper chamber will officially adjourn the 118th Congress sine die in the morning, before quickly turning around at noon and opening the new Congress. Headlining the day is the swearing in of members. That will officially take place with Vice President Harris on the Senate floor and be done as a group. That will be followed by individual swearing-in ceremonies for members alongside their families inside the Old Senate Chamber. The vice president will also conduct those. The Senate could adopt an organizing resolution as early as Friday that will lay out committee allocations and establish other procedures for the chamber in the next two years. Unlike in the House, Senate leadership elections are handled away from the floor; those are all settled, with Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) set to take on the role of majority leader. The one change that will go into effect on the floor, however, is for Senate pro tempore, which is commonly held by the senior-most member of the majority party. That will happen via a simple resolution. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) will once again helm that role, having done so from 2019 until 2021. He has been in the Senate since 1981. When will confirmation hearings start for Trump’s Cabinet selections? Pete Hegseth, President-elect Trump's nominee to be Defense secretary, is seen at the Capitol in Washington, Dec. 5, 2024. (J. Scott Applewhite, Associated Press file) The bigger question on the Senate side is when Trump’s selections to fill out his Cabinet will appear at hearings as the chamber tries to tee up confirmation votes shortly after the president-elect takes the oath of office Jan. 20. Those are expected to start the week of Jan. 13, with hearings to be notified a week in advance. Pete Hegseth, Trump’s choice to lead the Pentagon, is expected to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee starting Jan. 14.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/heres-what-congresss-first-day-will-look-like/	2025-01-03T06:34:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/johnsonmike_102523gn38_w.jpg?w=900
House Speaker vote: Johnson faces key leadership test	For complete coverage of the Opening Day of Congress and the vote for House Speaker, tune into a Special Edition of The Hill tonight at 6p/5C. WASHINGTON D.C. (NewsNation) — House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., faces a pivotal moment Friday as he fights to retain his position amid growing backlash from conservatives unhappy with his leadership style. Despite Republican control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, Johnson’s chances for a second term rest on a razor's edge, with opposition from within his own party. The House Speaker vote Friday is expected to be a close contest. To remain Speaker, Johnson will need the support of every Republican to secure the position, as he can only afford one 'no' vote from his colleagues. New Orleans attack was an ‘act of terror’: FBI Johnson faces opposition within GOP Ahead of the vote, Johnson is expected to make more phone calls and possibly hold more meetings to try and ease concerns fellow Republicans may have about him keeping the gavel. NewsNation has learned around a dozen Republicans are demanding commitments from Johnson for things like spending cuts and more involvement in negotiations. President-elect Donald Trump endorsed Johnson on Monday, and Johnson expressed confidence about his chances ahead of the vote on Thursday. 'People are talking through process changes they want and those kinds of things and I'm open to that, and I think tomorrow's going to go well,' Johnson said. 'We need to stay unified so we can save the country. and I think that's an important message.' GOP holds slimmest House Majority since 1930 House Republicans have the slimmest majority in nearly a century, meaning Johnson can afford to lose only one Republican vote — assuming all Democrats vote against him and every House member casts a vote. Part of the uncertainty in Friday's vote comes as Rep. Tom Massie, R-Ky., has said he plans to vote against Johnson, criticizing him for approving Ukraine aid and his approach to negotiating government spending. Some of the key people to watch on Friday, include Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy, who has described himself and several other Republicans as undecided, as well as Indiana Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz, who called on Johnson to present a plan for implementing Trump’s agenda. On Monday, Spartz released a list of requirements to earn her vote, including a push for spending audits. Lastly, Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, former Freedom Caucus Chair Scott Perry, and Congressman Andy Biggs remain undecided. Trump tests influence over GOP with Johnson Speakership vote 'It irritates us that these people undermine our leadership and the vast majority of us who want to get things done, but you got to optimize. You got to find consensus. If you had 220 people demanding your way on everything, you're going to get nothing done,' said Nebraska Republican Rep. Don Bacon. The House will remain at a standstill until a Speaker is elected, and Republicans hope to avoid the turmoil surrounding former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who secured the post after 15 rounds of voting over four days in January 2023. The longer it takes to elect the Speaker, the more it could delay the certification of Trump's election win scheduled for next Monday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/mike-johnson-house-speaker-vote/	2025-01-03T04:42:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/johnsonmike_111224gn17_w.jpg?w=900
New Orleans deadly attack: A timeline of what is known	(NewsNation) — Bourbon Street is again open for business just a day after 14 people were killed and 35 injured in a deadly attack. On Thursday, just more than 36 hours after police said Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove a rented truck onto a crowded Bourbon Street, city officials were given back control of the popular tourist destination ahead of the evening's Sugar Bowl as investigators continue to piece together information. As of Thursday morning, all of the victims have been identified and their families notified by New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell. New Orleans attack, Las Vegas explosion share similarities Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said officials hope to provide a detailed timeline of what exactly took place in the deadly attack but said doing so this early into what remains an active investigation would be premature. Here’s what is known thus far. Shamsud-Din Jabbar travels to New Orleans The FBI said that Jabbar rented a Ford truck in Texas on December 30 and began the nearly 350-mile drive between Houston and New Orleans on New Year’s Eve. Turo, an online car rental platform, issued a statement Wednesday indicating there was nothing in Jabbar’s background that would show he was a threat. FBI officials said that while traveling between Texas and New Orleans, Jabbar posted five videos to his Facebook in which he pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State, aka ISIS. In the first video, Jabbar said that he initially planned to harm his family and friends. However, he was concerned that the news headlines would not focus on the war between 'the believers and the disbelievers.' The FBI confirmed Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, has been identified as the man who was shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year's Day attack. The FBI said video footage showed Jabbar placing two coolers, each of which contained an improvised explosive device (IED), along Bourbon Street sometime between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. Investigators initially reported that they had reviewed video footage of two men and a woman placing devices on the street. However, the FBI said that those people were bystanders who stopped to look at the coolers before they walked away. Still, investigators are still hoping to speak with anyone who knew Jabbar and who may have spent time with him in the 24 hours leading up to the attack. Both of the devices located in the coolers were rendered safe, and reports of other devices that surfaced on Wednesday turned out to be misinformation, the FBI confirmed. The FBI said that the videos were posted to Facebook beginning at 1:29 a.m. and 3:02 a.m. The Bourbon Street attack begins New Orleans police said officers responded to reports of a vehicle driving into a crowd on Bourbon Street at 3:17 a.m. Multiple people were struck before the vehicle crashed. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said that the driver, who was later identified as Jabbar, got out of the truck and began firing at police. Two officers were struck by gunfire and were hospitalized. Jabbar was shot and killed by police. New Orleans Police said at a news conference Wednesday that Jabbar drove the rented truck up onto the sidewalk at Bourbon and Canal Streets, which were being blocked off by a police vehicle and officers. A bollard system, which had been installed in 2017 as part of a $40 million safety project, was being replaced at the time of the New Year’s Day attack. Who is Las Vegas explosion suspect Matthew Livelsberger? 'We had a car there, we had barriers there, we had officers there,' Kirkpatrick said. 'And (Jabbar) got around it. She added: 'We did indeed have a plan, but the terrorist defeated it.' Airbnb residents forced to evacuate Residents at an Airbnb property located 1 1/2 miles from the scene of the attack were forced to evacuate around 8 a.m. on Wednesday after a fire broke out at the property. Witnesses told NewsNation that they had seen a white truck parked in the driveway of the property but that no one reported seeing Jabbar.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) The FBI said Thursday that the agency has secured that property and is conducting a search for potential evidence connected to the attack. FBI turns over control of Bourbon Street to New Orleans Cantrell said that the FBI returned control of Bourbon Street to the city late Wednesday night and that city crews began cleaning the street around 2 a.m. on Thursday. The cleaning process was completed by 8 a.m. to ensure that the street could be open as fans began to prepare for Thursday’s College Football Playoff quarterfinal game. 'I want to reassure the public that the city of New Orleans is not only ready for Game Day today, but we’re ready to continue to host large-scale events in our city because we are built to host at every single turn,' the mayor said. Bourbon Street was set to reopen to pedestrian traffic around 2 p.m. Thursday but was opened ahead of schedule as football fans and visitors alike returned. Louisiana Mayor Jeff Landry said that although the memory of the 14 victims will live on, it would be a tragedy for their memory to be 'snuffed out by fear.' 'The city will be back. We’ll be open for family, friends and loved ones who want some time to relax from the pressures of life,' Landry said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/new-orleans-attack-timeline/	2025-01-02T15:00:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25001598416234.jpg?w=900
New Orleans attack, Las Vegas explosion share similarities	(NewsNation) — FBI investigators cannot definitively link the deadly attack that occurred early New Year’s Day in New Orleans with the Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas, but several similarities have been found between the two men involved, officials said Thursday. A NewsNation source identified the driver of the Tesla truck that exploded outside the Trump International Hotel on Wednesday morning as Matthew Livelsberger, an active Army soldier from Colorado. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said at a news conference that they are still not 100% able to confirm the driver’s identity after his body was burnt beyond recognition in the explosion. Dog shot in face after months on run in Denver adopted into foster family But investigators said that tattoos found on the body matched those belonging to Livelsberger. A military identification card and passport belonging to Livelsberger were also found at the scene of the explosion, police said. Investigators believe that he was the only person to be inside the truck, which was rented in Colorado. The FBI, meanwhile, identified the driver of a rented Ford truck that killed 14 people and injured at least 35 others in Bourbon Street as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who also had a military background in the U.S. Army. Here is what is known about the similarities between Livelsberger and Jabbar. Liveslberger and Jabbar served in the United States Army The Department of Defense confirmed that Livelsberger was a Special Operations sergeant with the Green Berets and that he spent much of his time in the Army at Fort Carson in Colorado and in Germany. The Army told NewsNation that Livelsberger was assigned to the 10th Special Forces Group in Stuttgart, Germany. The spokesman also said that Livelsberger received several awards, including the Bronze Star Medal with Valor and other awards and commendations.

(Credit: Alcides Antunes) Livelsberger enlisted as an 18X and served in active duty from January 2006 to March 2011, a spokesman said. He then joined the National Guard from March 2011 through July 2012. After that, Livelsberger was in the Army Reserve until December 2012, when he entered active duty as an Army Special Operations soldier. Las Vegas police said Thursday that Livelsberger served at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Afghanistan in 2009. Investigators said that like Livelsberger, Jabbar also served at Fort Bragg and in Afghanistan in 2009. However, it is not yet known whether the two men were part of the same unit or in the same region of Afghanistan during their deployment. Investigators said Thursday they are working to confirm specific details about the two men's military careers that could place them in the same unit at Fort Bragg. Jabbar was part of the regular Army from March 2007 to January 2015 as a human resource specialist (42A) and information technology specialist (25B) before transitioning to the Army Reserve as an IT specialist from January 2015 to July 2020, an Army spokesperson told NewsNation. The FBI confirmed Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, has been identified as the man who was shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year's Day attack. He deployed to Afghanistan from February 2009 to January 2010 and held the rank of staff sergeant at the time of his discharge, according to the spokesperson. Before serving in the Army, Jabbar enlisted in the Navy in August 2004 under a delayed entry program but was discharged a month later, a Navy official said. Like Livelsberger, Jabbar was the recipient of several Army medals and commendations, including the Global War on Terrorism Medal and two Army Good Conduct medals. Livelsberger and Jabbar rented vehicles from Turo Investigators have confirmed that both the Ford truck used in the New Orleans attack and the Cybertruck that exploded in front of the Las Vegas hotel were rented through Turo, an online car rental app. Las Vegas police said Thursday that Livelsberger picked up the truck in Denver on December 28. Investigators then used Tesla charging station data to track the vehicle’s movements. Police said that the truck was charged in Monument, Colorado, on Dec. 30 and then was charged in Colorado and New Mexico on New Year’s Eve. NYPD presence increased at Trump Tower, Times Square On New Year’s Day, the truck was charged at three locations in Arizona, including in Kingman at 5:33 a.m. before it was first spotted in Las Vegas at 7:29 a.m. The FBI confirmed Thursday that Jabbar picked up the rented truck in Texas on December 30 and then drove the vehicle from Houston to New Orleans on New Year's Eve. Investigators said that during the trip, Jabbar posted five videos to Facebook, pledging his allegiance to ISIS.

(Photo by Matthew HINTON / AFP) (Photo by MATTHEW HINTON/AFP via Getty Images) In a statement issued by Turo, the company said that they are heartbroken by the violence perpetrated in Las Vegas and New Orleans and that the company’s prayers are with victims and their families. 'We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents. We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,' the statement said. The timing of the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion New Orleans police officers responded to Bourbon Street at 3:17 a.m. on New Year’s Day for a report of a vehicle that had driven onto Bourbon Street and struck pedestrians. The FBI said Jabbar’s final video to Facebook was posted at 3:02 a.m., which was just 15 minutes before police were called to Bourbon Street. Investigators determined that Jabbar drove the truck between Houston and New Orleans on Dec. 31, but they did not provide a definite timeline for his arrival into the city. The truck believed to be driven by Livelsberger was first spotted in Las Vegas at 7:29 a.m. Surveillance footage shows the truck pulling into the Trump hotel valet parking area before it left and traveled along Las Vegas Boulevard. It was then spotted parked at a business on the boulevard near Flamingo Road. At 8:39 a.m., the truck was spotted near the Sands Hotel and Casino before it returned to the Trump Hotel valet parking area, where the explosion took place within 17 seconds later, police said.

Who is Las Vegas explosion suspect Matthew Livelsberger?	(NewsNation) — Las Vegas police said the driver of a Cybertruck that exploded in front of a Trump hotel in the city has been preliminarily identified as Matthew Livelsberger. Investigators said they are waiting on DNA to provide 100% identification. How did authorities identify Matthew Livelsberger? Investigators said a military ID, passport and credit cards found in the vehicle belonged to Livelsberger and were used to identify him. New Orleans attack was an ‘act of terror:’ FBI They said there are also photos of Livelsberger driving the Cybertruck from Colorado to Las Vegas. Police also used remnants of tattoos visible on the burned body to make the preliminary identification. Who is Matthew Livelsberger? Livelsberger was a master sergeant in the Army, most recently serving in Stuttgart, Germany, with the 10th Special Forces Group. He was also deployed to Afghanistan in 2009. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives confirmed that all the components of the improvised bomb were made from items that can easily be purchased, including consumer fireworks, fuel enhancers and exploding targets. The two firearms found in the truck were also purchased legally, the ATF said. He has no criminal record, and no information about his background prior to joining the military or his personal life has been released. Matthew Livelsberger's military service Livelsberger enlisted as an 18X and served in active duty from January 2006 to March 2011, according to an Army spokesperson. He then joined the National Guard from March 2011 through July 2012. After that, Livelsberger was in the Army Reserve until December 2012, when he entered active duty as an Army Special Operations soldier. New Orleans attack was an ‘act of terror:’ FBI 'Livelsberger was assigned to the command and on approved leave at the time of his death. USASOC is in full cooperation with federal and state law enforcement agencies, but as a matter of policy, will not comment on ongoing investigations,' the spokesperson said. Livelsberger received a number of awards during his service, including multiple Bronze Stars, Army commendation and achievement medals and a Meritorious Service Medal. What do officials think motivated the attack? Investigators have said they have not ruled anything in or out when it comes to the motivation behind the explosion. Las Vegas police did deem the attack a suicide mission and said the driver had a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head that occurred immediately prior to the explosion. Is Matthew Livelsberger connected to New Orleans suspect Shamsud-Din Jabbar? Both Livelsberger and the suspect in a New Orleans attack on New Year's Day, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, served in the Army. Two stabbings at two NYC subway stations occurred New Year’s Day Both men were stationed at Fort Bragg during their careers, and both were stationed in Afghanistan in 2009. At this time, authorities say there is no evidence the two men were in the same unit at Fort Bragg or that they were even there during the same years. Investigators have also not uncovered any information to indicate the two men were in the same unit or location in Afghanistan during their deployments.

President-elect Trump vows to rid America of 'violent scum'	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump is blaming President Joe Biden and other federal agencies for the nation's violent crime, including the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside a Nevada hotel, and has vowed to rid the country of 'violent scum'. Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that Biden, the Department of Justice and the FBI had devoted too much time focusing their attention on him rather than radical Islamic terrorism and other violent acts. The posts, which appeared on Trump’s Truth Social account after the deadly attack in New Orleans and the truck explosion, said that violent crime has become so bad in America that 'it will become hard to even imagine or believe.' The FBI said Thursday that Shamsud-Din Jabbar posted five videos to his Facebook account while driving from Houston to New Orleans, pledging his allegiance to the Islamic State. What we know about the suspect in the New Orleans attack On Wednesday night, Trump wrote Biden and his 'election-interfering thugs' have done to the country will not soon be forgotten. In the post, Trump accused the Department of Justice, FBI and Democratic state and local prosecutors of not doing their jobs. 'They are incompetent and corrupt, having spent all of their waking hours unlawfully attacking their political opponent, ME, rather than focusing on protecting Americans from the outside and inside violent SCUM that has infiltrated all aspects of our government, and our Nation itself,' Trump wrote. Biden did not respond to questions directed at him as he returned to the White House from the New Year holiday at Camp David on Thursday. Biden met with national security officials on Thursday to be briefed on the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion. The president was also briefed several times during New Year's Day on the incidents. Biden told reporters on Wednesday that his response to the New Orleans attack was 'one of anger and frustration.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-rid-america-violent-scum/	2025-01-02T11:11:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2188144000.jpg?w=900

Sugar Bowl security to equal Super Bowl: New Orleans police	(The Hill) -- The New Orleans Police Department revealed Thursday that the annual Sugar Bowl will feature heightened security after a man drove directly into a crowd on Bourbon Street earlier this week, leaving 15 dead. 'We are going to have absolutely hundreds of officers and staff lining our streets,' New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said Thursday morning in an interview on NBC's 'TODAY.' 'We are staffing up at the same level if not more so than we were prepared for Super Bowl,' she added. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

The teams are now set to square off Thursday afternoon for the quarterfinal game promising to draw a multitude of fans from across the country. Kirkpatrick specifically highlighted Bourbon Street as an area that will be heavily patrolled after 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar reportedly used a truck from car-renting app Turo to complete the attack. Jabbar was fatally shot by police after he opened fire on the officers. The FBI is investigating the event as a 'terrorist attack' after finding an Islamic State (ISIS) extremist group flag on the driver’s car. Little is known about the victims. Police say there was no evidence leading them to believe an attack would have occurred in the French Quarter on New Year’s Day. 'There was no information that we had and so nothing along those lines,' Kirkpatrick said Thursday.

Biden, Trump respond to deadly attack in New Orleans	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — As federal investigators investigate the deadly New Year's Day attack in New Orleans, President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump had starkly different reactions. At least 15 people were killed and dozens more injured after a vehicle drove into a crowd on Canal and Bourbon Streets early Wednesday morning in what the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism. The White House said Biden has held multiple briefings with federal law enforcement and U.S. Department of Homeland Security leaders. The Department of Justice also sent agents and other resources to New Orleans to help investigators. What is Turo? Car rental app used in New Orleans and Las Vegas Biden said there is 'no justification' for what he described as a 'despicable act.' 'I know while this person committed a terrible assault on the city, the spirit of New Orleans will never be defeated. It will always shine forth. We've seen it time and time again throughout its history, and I know we'll see it again,' Biden said during an address from Camp David. Trump also weighed in on the violence, writing on Truth Social, 'Our hearts are with all of the innocent victims and their loved ones, including the brave officers of the New Orleans Police Department. The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!' Lawmakers want answers from DHS, FBI Meanwhile, some lawmakers are weighing in on the security failures that led to the incident, demanding more answers from federal authorities. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is asking the Senate Homeland Security Committee to call on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and outgoing FBI Director Christopher Wray to testify before they leave office. ‘90%’ sure New Orleans attacker was living in Airbnb: Neighbor In a letter sent Wednesday to the incoming chairman of the committee Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Hawley said the Mayorkas and Wray should give a 'full account of this attack' and report any department failures. Hawley added that Biden administration officials 'cannot shirk public accountability' as Biden’s term ends. Meanwhile, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., claims the New Orleans attack shows the need for the Senate to confirm Trump's national security team as soon as possible, adding that lives could depend on it.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-trump-respond-deadly-attack-new-orleans/	2025-01-02T06:38:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2191488826.jpg?w=900
Two stabbings at two NYC subway stations occurred New Year's Day	(NewsNation) — Two stabbings unfolded just minutes apart at two different subway stations in New York City on New Year's Day morning, leaving two hospitalized, police reported. Before 10 a.m. on New Year’s Day, the stabbings occurred on opposite sides of the city. The victims are in stable condition in the hospital. The attacks are part of a recent series of unrelated violent incidents occurring on or near subways. 10 people shot outside Queens night club on New Year’s Day: NYPD On New Year’s Eve, a man was pushed onto the tracks as a train was approaching, leaving him in critical condition. Days before Christmas, a man intentionally set a woman on fire while she slept on a train. The severity of these recent subway attacks has made riders, including tourists and residents, more fearful of the nation's largest transit system. But city officials are quick to point to data that shows the overall number of reported crimes on the subway system is the lowest year-to-date since 2010, exempting the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. There were 10 murders in 2024, which ties for a record 25-year high in 2022. The more violent attacks have typically occurred during peak hours and in nonviolent areas of the transit system.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/nyc-subway-stabbings-new-years-day/	2025-01-02T05:42:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/66291d431b0353.01473606.jpeg?w=900
What is an immersive explosive device (IED)?	(NewsNation) — Improvided explosive devices, or IEDs, were among the weapons found in the vehicle of the suspect in the attack that killed 15 people and injured 30 others in New Orleans on New Year's Day. IEDs are 'homemade bomb(s) and/or destructive devices to destroy, incapacitate, harass or distract,' according to the Department of Homeland Security. Examples include small pipe bombs which can be made to be more sophisticated in order to cause a lot of damage and loss of life. What we know about the suspect in the New Orleans attack Other attacks that used IEDs include the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the Olympic Park bombing in 1996 and the London bombings in 2005. Police suspect Shamsud-Din Jabbar as the person responsible for what the FBI has deemed a 'terrorist attack' after allegedly driving his vehicle into a crowd on the tourist-heavy Bourbon Street early Wednesday morning. Law enforcement is still searching the area for improvised explosive devices, according to the FBI. Other potential IEDs were also located in the French Quarter.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/what-immersive-explosive-devices-ied/	2025-01-02T04:39:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2178157082.jpg?w=900
What we know about the Cybertruck explosion at Las Vegas Trump Ho...	LAS VEGAS (NewsNation) — Firework mortars and camp fuel canisters were found in the back of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside the Las Vegas Trump International Hotel Wednesday, killing one person, injuring seven others, and sparking an intense investigation into possible terrorism. The act was intentional, police said, adding that video shows the vehicle parked next to the hotel’s front doors as it explodes into flames. Police did not find any devices that would have been used to ignite the explosion in the truck and are unsure at this time how it ignited, authorities said. Cybertruck arrived in Vegas one hour before blast Clark County firefighters and Las Vegas Metropolitan police responded to the explosion and fire around 8:40 a.m. in the 2000 block of Fashion Show Drive, across from Fashion Show Mall and just west of the Las Vegas Strip. FBI investigating New Orleans attack as ‘act of terrorism’ Police tracked the truck through cameras at Tesla charging stations and found that it arrived in Las Vegas around 7:30 a.m. The truck then drove up and down Las Vegas Boulevard for about an hour before pulling into the Trump Hotel entrance. The truck sat in front of the hotel for about 15-20 seconds before it exploded, McMahill said. The blast went upwards, so the hotel's glass doors did not break. Have any suspects been identified? The truck explosion came hours after a driver rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter early on New Year’s Day, killing at least 15 people before being shot to death by police. That crash was being investigated as a terrorist attack and police believe the driver was not acting alone. Both the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded in Las Vegas and the pickup truck used in New Orleans were rented from Turo, authorities said. Police have identified the person who rented the cybertruck but have not yet released the name. Social posts including a person’s name were incorrect, a source told NewsNation affiliate KLAS. 'We believe this is an isolated incident. We do not believe that there is a bunch of folks out there supporting this or helping this. We don't believe there's any other danger to the community right now. Over the next few hours and days, we will continue to do our best to research as much as we can and get to the bottom of this. and we won't stop until we're 100% certain as to what happened and why,' said FBI Acting Special Agent-In-Charge Jeremy Schwartz. In a statement, Turo said it was working with authorities. 'We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,' the statement said. Musk: Explosion was caused by fireworks or bomb Tesla founder Elon Musk, who is working with the FBI, said Wednesday afternoon on X that 'we have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself. All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion.' In an earlier post on the platform, Musk said that his entire senior term was investigating the explosion, adding, 'We’ve never seen anything like this.' Musk suggested that the explosion might also be an act of terrorism, noting that the truck involved was rented through the same app used in the New Orleans attack. However, the FBI has not confirmed this theory. What is Turo? The cars in both the Las Vegas explosion and the attack in New Orleans were rented on the app Turo, authorities say. Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing marketplace, often described as the Airbnb for cars. It allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles by listing them on the platform, where they can set rental prices, availability, and specific guidelines. Renters can browse local options, choose a vehicle that suits their needs, and complete the transaction securely through Turo’s system.

90%' sure New Orleans attacker was living in Airbnb: Neighbor	(NewsNation) — A neighbor says he is '90% sure' he encountered the suspect in the New Year's Day Bourbon Street attack at a New Orleans Airbnb that is now an FBI crime scene, just 1.5 miles from where the incident occurred. Wylie Whitesides, who lives two doors down from the rental property in the St. Roch neighborhood, claimed he noticed a suspicious man who matched the description of Shamsud-Din Jabbar days before the attack. Sources told NewsNation investigators believe the Airbnb was rented by the suspect in the Bourbon Street attack and despite heavy law enforcement presence, authorities have not confirmed this detail. 'He was a little bit taller than me, not a big guy, goatee beard, African American or Islamic,' Whitesides said of the man before seeing the suspect's photo. He said the encounter left him with a 'sketchy feeling.' What we know about the suspect in the New Orleans attack A white pickup truck, potentially connected to the suspect, was parked in front of Whitesides' home in recent nights he said. Another neighbor reported seeing someone repeatedly moving garbage cans up and down the street over several days. Early Wednesday morning, a fire broke out at the Airbnb, prompting the evacuation of dozens of residents around 8 a.m. The scene drew a massive law enforcement presence, including FBI special agents, Homeland Security investigators, ATF agents and New Orleans police and fire departments. Approximately 40 law enforcement officials were at the scene throughout the day, according to witnesses. While residents were initially evacuated, authorities began allowing them to return home around 8 p.m. CT, though the Airbnb remains cordoned off as an active FBI crime scene. Officials searching for more IEDs after deadly New Orleans attack The New Orleans Fire Department announced plans for a news conference Thursday morning to provide additional details about the investigation. Whitesides has spoken to the FBI and shared the same information. NewsNation has reached out to Airbnb for more information.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/new-orleans-attacker-airbnb-neighbor/	2025-01-01T19:54:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/8F61C1DA1FE21F798A06DF5AD3493CBC.jpg?w=900
New Orleans attack victims: What we know so far	(NewsNation) — Investigation continues into an overnight 'act of terrorism' in New Orleans' bustling Canal and Bourbon streets after a car drove into a crowd, killing 15 people and injuring at least 35 more. The FBI said it would issue a statement about the victims once all families have been notified. New Orleans attack suspect Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, has been identified as the man who was shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year’s Day attack. In a Wednesday news conference, agency officials said they do not believe Jabbar acted alone. The Associated Press reported that investigators have reviewed video of three men and a woman placing possible explosives in the area where Wednesday’s attack took place. New Orleans attack: Suspect identified, Sugar Bowl postponed New Orleans attack victims Tiger Bech Tiger Bech, 28, died in a hospital following the attack, NewsNation local affiliate KLFY confirmed.

Excellent father, very supportive brother, supportive son, life of the party, great sense of humor, the one that made everybody laugh,' Jackson said. She tells NewsNation it's 'unfair and unjust' for Hunter's life to be taken so early. 'We had heard that he was shot. That's, that's what we were going on. So I'm praying that, you know, maybe they're doing surgery ... that's when the doctors informed us that he succumbed to his internal injuries and that he was deceased.' Hunter died from injuries sustained when he was run over, not by gunshot wounds, Jackson said. At the hospital, she witnessed multiple families receiving similar news about their loved ones who were killed or injured in the attack.

Why bollards weren't in place before New Orleans deadly attack	(NewsNation) — New Orleans law enforcement officials said bollards typically used to prevent traffic on Bourbon Street were not operable when a 42-year-old Texas man entered the popular tourist destination at a high rate of speed early Wednesday, killing 15 people and injuring 35 more. The man, who was identified as Shamsud Din Jabbar, drove a rented Ford truck onto Bourbon Street just after 3 a.m. in what the FBI is characterizing as an act of terrorism. 1 dead, 7 injured in Tesla fire, explosion at Las Vegas Trump International Hotel on New Year’s Day Police officials are now facing questions about why bollards that have been used to close off the street from traffic were not in place on New Year’s Eve and into early Wednesday when the attack took place. What is a bollard? Bollards are short, vertical posts that are used to serve as physical and visual barriers and are typically constructed of stainless steel, aluminum or concrete. According to the New Orleans Department of Public Works, the existing bollards along Bourbon Street were being removed and replaced as part of a project that began in November. Work was scheduled to continue into February and included replacing the current bollards with new removable bollards made of stainless steel. According to Fox 8 in New Orleans, the installation of the bollards in 2017 was part of a $40 million safety plan. The system consisted of four sets of barriers placed on either side of Bourbon Street intersections. The station said that the inner two columns can be pushed back when it is unlocked by a ground-level control panel. The new bollard system would have allowed the devices to be locked behind each crosswalk, the city said. During the recent construction project, the old bollards were removed and replaced by asphalt patches that allowed vehicle access. Bollards were not in place at time of deadly attack Witnesses told NewsNation on Wednesday that barricades were not in place at the time of the attack. At a news conference on Wednesday, New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said that Jabbar drove the truck up onto the sidewalk, which gave him access to Bourbon Street. The bollard replacement project began less than eight years after they were installed. Shortly after being installed, the bollards began to malfunction, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said. The city said that the bollard replacement project began in preparation for the city hosting the Super Bowl in early February. Bollards were not in place Wednesday because the project was nearing completion, Cantrell said. Kirkpatrick said that police officials have been aware of issues with the bollard system for some time. She said that because the bollards were not operable, police vehicles were parked at Bourbon Street to prevent traffic from getting through on New Year's Eve. Human remains found near Electric Forest music festival site However, she said Jabbar drove around the vehicles and onto the sidewalk to carry out the attack. 'We had a car there, we had barriers there, we had officers there,' Kirkpatrick said. 'And (Jabbar) got around it. She added: 'We did indeed have a plan, but the terrorist defeated it.' Kirkpatrick said that if bollards had been in place, they would have prevented ambulances and first responders from reaching victims killed or injured during the attack. However, New Orleans City Council President Helena Moreno said that the absence of the bollards was not the reason the attack took place. 'This person was determined to inflict pain and death and harm on Bourbon Street, and I think he would have done that anyway he could,' Moreno said, according to MetroWest Daily News.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/bollards-new-orleans-attack/	2025-01-01T14:34:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25001469314526.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Members of the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua are reportedly attacking border agents with knives and tire irons. The New York Post reported that border officials are preparing for a potential gang attack on Wednesday. Alfonso Aguilar, the former chief of the U.S. Office of Citizenship, believes the gang is taking advantage of the time remaining before President-elect Trump assumes office on Jan. 20. 'We’re seeing criminal organizations, members of Tre de Aragua, trying to get to the southern border and doing everything they can to enter the country because they know as soon as the Trump administration starts, it's going to be almost impossible to enter the country and be released into the community as it has happened during these past four years,' he said.

New Orleans attack suspect may not have acted alone: Ex-FBI agent	(NewsNation) — As police continue to piece together clues into what the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism in New Orleans, the suspect who was shot and killed by police may not have acted alone, a former FBI special agent told NewsNation. Stuart Kaplan said investigators won’t need long to identify the suspect who drove into a crowd on Bourbon Street early Wednesday morning, killing 10 and injuring 35. Given investigative tools available to police, suspects can't go unidentified for very long and Kaplan believes the suspect may have already been identified by law enforcement. Investigative technology may provide leads into where the man may have come from before carrying out Wednesday's attack. FBI: Homemade explosives seizure at Virginia farm largest in its history 'I would suggest this may be a byproduct of our unfortunate open border policies,' Kaplan told NewsNation, adding, 'Unfortunately this is the catastrophic result of an individual who was able to now create panic and fear.' Kaplan's sources suggest that the man may have entered the country illegally in the last week, and FBI investigators are working quickly to identify other 'potential bad actors' that may have been involved in the attack. Kaplan, citing sources, said government surveillance would have been able to place the suspect in Wednesday’s attack with other individuals who may have been involved. The sources indicate that the attack may be part of a bigger, more coordinated plot toward other venues and that 'other attacks may be coming our way.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/new-orleans-suspect-may-not-acted-alone/	2025-01-01T08:24:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25001471685675.jpg?w=900

FBI: Homemade explosives seizure at Virginia farm largest in its ...	SMITHFIELD, Va. (WAVY) — Virginia residents in Isle of Wight County worried about the large FBI presence and numerous explosions heard off of Foursquare Road in mid-December finally have answers. According to federal court documents, agents had just uncovered a massive trove of pipe bombs, and deemed them too unstable to transport — so they blew them up. The FBI said it believes it's the largest amount of homemade explosives it has encountered in its history. Brad Spafford, 36, was taken into custody at his Isle of Wight County home on Dec. 17 and charged with a weapons violation. The FBI executed a search warrant and uncovered the 'improvised explosive devices,' along with bomb-making instructions and materials and a jar full of a homemade high-explosive stored in the family freezer. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'FBI bomb technicians, who X-rayed the devices on scene, assessed them as pipe bombs,' the newly filed document reads. 'The majority were found in a detached garage, organized by color. ... Some were hand-labeled 'lethal.' 'Some were preloaded into an apparent wearable vest,' it continued. 'In the garage were also found numerous tools and materials for manufacturing explosives, a home-made mortar, and riot gear.' The filing also describes how the the pipe bombs were made — with two layers of plastic tubes. '[I]n between the tubes were metal spheres which 'would enhance the fragmentation effect of the device upon its explosion.' it quotes an FBI analysis of one bomb. 'The lab concluded that the device was 'capable of causing property damage, personal injury and/or death.'' Spafford was released on $25,000 bond earlier this week. The new details in this case come from new filings from the defense, arguing to block his release. Spafford's attorney argued that he never posed a threat to anyone. A motion by the defense describes him as 'a hard-working family man with no criminal record.' '[T'he government has been investigating and carefully watching Mr. Spafford for approximately two years through the use of a confidential human source who was a friend and confidant,' it reads. 'During all of that time, there is no evidence or allegation that Mr. Spafford committed or attempted to commit any act of violence.' Spafford's original, and so far only charge, is for violating the National Firearms Act — for possessing a rifle with a barrel shorter than 16 inches. His Dec. 30 preliminary hearing found enough evidence to allow the case to move forward. The prosecution's filing worried about Spafford's ability to access weapons and the danger he might pose even to the officers who have to check up on him before trial. They acknowledged that new charges for the bombs — each one carrying 10 years — were almost certainly impending. Lawsuits, FBI probe engulf South Dakota doomsday bunker complex 'The defendant has the undisputed know-how, resources, and extreme inclination to manufacture and stockpile improvised explosive devices,' it reads. 'Even after losing his own fingers as a result of his homemade explosive materials, he made the apparent remarkable decision to keep an extraordinarily danger explosive material in the home's freezer next to food items that could be accessed by the entire family.' Most of the evidence prosecutors relied on for the firearms charge came from a person Spafford apparently believed he was friends with. He showed the man his illegal rifle and the two went shooting together. '[The source] also noted that the defendant was using pictures of the president for target practice at shooting at a local range, stated that he believed political assassinations should be brought back, and that missing children in the news had been taken by the federal government to be trained as school shooter,' the prosecution's filing reads.

Israeli strikes kill 12 in Gaza as war grinds into the new year	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, mostly women and children, officials said Wednesday, as the nearly 15-month war ground on into the new year with no end in sight. One strike hit a home in the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza, the most isolated and heavily destroyed part of the territory, where Israel has been waging a major operation since early October. Gaza’s Health Ministry said seven people were killed, including a woman and four children, and at least a dozen other people were wounded. Another strike overnight in the built-up Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza killed a woman and a child, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. The military ordered people to evacuate an area near Bureij overnight, saying it would strike there in response to recent rocket fire by Palestinian militants. Former President Jimmy Carter’s state funeral: What we know A third strike early Wednesday in the southern city of Khan Younis killed three people, according to the nearby Nasser Hospital and the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and abducting around 250. About 100 hostages are still held in Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It says women and children make up more than half the fatalities but does not say how many of those killed were militants. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army says it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are living in tents on the coast as winter brings frequent rainstorms and temperatures drop below 10 degrees Celsius (50 F) at night. At least six infants and another person have died of hypothermia, according to the Health Ministry. American and Arab mediators have spent nearly a year trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release, but those efforts have repeatedly stalled. Hamas has demanded a lasting truce, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu has vowed to keep fighting until 'total victory' over the militants. Military blames ‘weakening of discipline’ in death of archaeologist who entered Lebanon with troops In a separate development, the Israeli military blamed 'operational burnout' and a 'weakening of discipline and safety' in the death of a 70-year-old archaeologist who was killed in southern Lebanon along with another soldier while visiting a combat zone in November. According to Israeli media reports, Zeev Erlich was not on active duty when he was shot, but was wearing a military uniform and had a weapon. The army said he was a reservist with the rank of major and identified him as a 'fallen soldier' when it announced his death. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Erlich was a well-known West Bank settler and researcher of Jewish history. Media reports at the time of his death said he entered Lebanon to explore an archaeological site. The family of the soldier who was killed with him has expressed anger over the circumstances of his death. The military launched an investigation after they were killed in a Hezbollah ambush. A separate probe is looking into who allowed Erlich to enter. The military said the entry of civilians who are not military contractors or journalists into combat zones is not widespread. Still, there have been multiple reports of Israeli civilians who support a permanent Israeli presence in Gaza or Lebanon entering those areas. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

The world welcomes 2025 with light shows, embraces and ice plunge...	NEW YORK (AP) — From Sydney to Mumbai to Paris to Rio de Janeiro, communities around the world welcomed 2025 with spectacular light shows, embraces and ice plunges. The New Year’s Eve ball dropped in soggy Times Square, where thousands of revelers stuck it out in heavy rain to celebrate the start of 2025 in New York City. Countries in the South Pacific Ocean were the first to ring in the New Year, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball dropped in Times Square. Auckland was the first major city to celebrate, with thousands thronging downtown or climbing the city’s ring of volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point. Close Thank you for signing up!

Earliest fireworks A few hours after Auckland, fireworks blasted off Australia's Sydney Harbor Bridge and across the bay. More than a million people gathered at iconic Sydney Harbor for the celebration. British pop star Robbie Williams led a singalong with the crowd. The celebration also featured Indigenous ceremonies and performances that acknowledged the land’s first people. American traditions, old and new In New York City, crowds cheered and couples kissed when the ball weighing almost 6 tons (5.4 metric tons) and featuring 2,688 crystal triangles descended down a pole in Times Square. The celebration included musical performances by TLC and Jonas Brothers. The revelry culminated with a dance party and a carpeting of soggy confetti as attendees left singing along to Frank Sinatra’s version of 'New York, New York.'

Biden doesn't believe he should have dropped out of race: Source	NewsNation) — President Joe Biden has told aides he believes he should not have ended his presidential campaign and that he could have defeated Donald Trump, a source has confirmed to NewsNation. Biden, who will leave the White House after Trump’s inauguration on January 20, said in the conversations that he believes he could have won the November election despite low approval rankings, sources confirmed. He also said he should have remained in the race despite the debate performance that many believe led to Biden dropping out of the race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris was defeated by Trump, who won both the Electoral College and popular vote en route to his capturing a second term in the White House. Former President Jimmy Carter’s state funeral: What we know After the election loss, Harris vowed for a peaceful transfer of power during her concession speech. The Washington Post was the first to report the conversation between Biden and his aides. A NewsNation source with knowledge of the conversations between Biden and the aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that other associates believe Biden should have never dropped out of the race. Biden has not criticized Harris in the conversations, the source said. Biden said that Americans needed to keep the faith after Trump's victory and commended Harris for a 'whole heart effort.' 'The struggle for the soul of America, since our very founding, has always been an ongoing debate, and still vital today,' Biden said. 'I know for some people, it’s a time for victory, to state the obvious. For others, it’s a time of loss. Campaigns are contests of competing visions. The country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-doesnt-believe-dropped-race/	2024-12-31T11:03:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2170948834.jpg?w=900
Drone discovers 'narco tunnel' between Arizona, Mexico	NewsNation) — Mexican law enforcement officials have discovered what they believe is a tunnel designed to smuggle drugs or people between the United States and Mexico after a drone detected the passageway. Photos of the tunnel were posted on a Facebook account operated by the State Public Secretary of Security in Sonora, Mexico. Investigators believe that the discovery will disrupt the construction of the tunnel. The agency said that the entrance of the tunnel was found in San Luis, Rio Colorado, in Mexico, which is located south of Yuma, Arizona. The tunnel stretched across the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a report by Arizona’s Family. The report indicated that a drone that was being used during a joint operation between Mexican authorities and U.S. Customs of Border Protection and discovered the tunnel's entrance just south of the border wall. ‘Common sense’ law requires congressional scrutiny, oversight of border security contracts Mexican police believe that the tunnel was in the early stages of construction. However, if completed, authorities believe the passageway would have been used as a 'narco tunnel' to smuggle drugs or people under the border wall and into the United States. 'Implementing the Border Security Protocol and using technology critical points were identified to strengthen surveillance in the area,' the Facebook post said. The police agency said that the tunnel was the third of its kind found near Yuma this year. The report said the Yuma Border Patrol did not have information about this specific tunnel. However, the agency reported it works with the Mexican police to combat border crimes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/drone-narco-tunnel-arizona-mexico/	2024-12-31T10:47:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/64e0c45ad05201.50438490.jpeg?w=900
Lawsuits, FBI probe engulf South Dakota doomsday bunker complex	(NewsNation) — An investigation into resident unrest at a South Dakota residential bunker complex, marketed to doomsday preppers, has uncovered multiple problems. South Dakota News Watch found the Vivox xPoint bunker complex, located eight miles south of Edgemont, is at the center of lawsuits, complaints to the state attorney general, a near-fatal shooting, and an FBI inquiry. Developed in 2016 on a former Black Hill Army Deport munitions storage facility, the complex features 500 above-ground concrete bunkers. While owner Robert K. Vicino claims more than 200 of the bunkers are leased and the community is thriving, many residents who sought to make it their permanent home disagree. At least 16 lawsuits underway Over the past four months, South Dakota News Watch uncovered 16 lawsuits involving Vivos xPoint, with actions filed both by and against residents, Vivos management, and its subcontractors. Five complaints have also been lodged with the South Dakota Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division, and two former residents confirmed FBI interviews. South Dakota doomsday city built at former Army base The lawsuits include eviction disputes, demands for refunds, and claims Vivos failed to deliver promised amenities, security, and services. Vivos owner Robert Vicino blamed 'bad apples' for the disputes, stating legal actions arise only if residents violate the 99-year lease or community rules. Residents pay up to $55,000 upfront, $3,000 for water, and ongoing fees, but they do not own their bunkers. Leases include non-disclosure clauses prohibiting media contact under penalty of fines or eviction. Attorney J. Scott James noted that evicted residents risk losing their investment, and any improvements made, with Vivos able to re-lease the bunkers. Residents interviewed by FBI The FBI's San Diego office has interviewed at least two former residents of the bunker complex, according to the South Dakota News Watch. One former resident, Elliott, told the outlet that FBI agents questioned him in November about Vicino 'dealing with problems in an illegal way.' Another ex-resident, David Streeter, told the outlet he was interviewed twice regarding leases, finances, and other allegations against Vicino. Streeter, who shot a Vivos subcontractor in August but wasn't charged, is involved in lawsuits against Vivos over evictions and defamation while also facing eviction himself. The FBI declined to respond to South Dakota News Watch's request for comment regarding the investigation or confirm if active investigations were underway. Vicino said he was unaware of any inquiry but welcomed it. Other issues residents are unhappy with At least three current and former Vivos residents told South Dakota News Watch they are concerned about two on-site subcontractors with criminal records Amenities promised by Vivos — prominently advertised on signs and its website — remain incomplete years after the complex opened. Residents report paying upfront for bunker leases or improvements that can take years to finish, if ever, while still being charged monthly fees for common area amenities. Doomsday prepping: Inside elite underground survival bunker One resident, Roehm, filed a complaint with the South Dakota Attorney General’s Office, citing issues such as an improperly installed septic system, unfinished roof repairs, and unfulfilled promises of security systems and personnel. In November, Michelle Collins, a Virginia resident, sued Vivos, alleging multiple contract breaches. According to her lawsuit, she paid $35,000 for a bunker lease, $3,000 for water, and $94,000 for improvements, while also covering annual land fees and monthly maintenance and security charges. Residents wanted a peaceful, stable life: Attorney Vicino said his son, Dante Vicino, who oversees operations at the complex, is in contact with the state attorney general's office. According to Robert Vicino, officials at the attorney general's office have praised their compliance, stating they're 'doing it by the book.' However, some residents have raised concerns about the response and protection provided by the Fall River County Sheriff's Office regarding complaints about the complex and its subcontractors. James said his clients are frustrated and disappointed, as they only sought a peaceful, stable life but have instead ended up in court. He said he hopes the state attorney general or another law enforcement agency will investigate the situation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/lawsuits-fbi-probe-engulf-south-dakota-doomsday-bunker-complex/	2024-12-31T10:28:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/12/south-dakota-doomsday-city.jpg?w=900

Nearly all of Puerto Rico is without power on New Year's Eve	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A blackout hit nearly all of Puerto Rico early Tuesday as the U.S. territory prepared to celebrate New Year’s, leaving more than 1.3 million clients in the dark. Officials said it could take up to two days to restore power. The outage hit at dawn, plunging the island into an eerie silence as electrical appliances and air conditioners shut down before those who could afford generators turned them on. 'It had to be on the 31st of December!' exclaimed one man, who only gave his name as Manuel, as he stood outside a grocery store in the capital of San Juan, grumbling about the outage that coincided with his birthday. 'There is no happiness.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Nearly 90% of 1.47 million clients across Puerto Rico were left in the dark, according to Luma Energy, a private company that oversees electricity transmission and distribution. Luma said in a statement that it appears the outage was caused by a failure of an underground power line, saying it is restoring power 'in the quickest and safest way possible.' A Luma spokesman told The Associated Press that the incident was under investigation. The blackout fanned simmering anger against Luma and Genera PR, which oversees the generation of power in Puerto Rico, as a growing number of people call for their ouster. Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón, who is set to be sworn in on Jan. 2, has called for the creation of an 'energy czar' to review potential Luma contractual breaches while another operator is found. Meanwhile, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said he was in touch with Luma and Genera PR, adding on X that 'we are demanding answers and solutions.' Puerto Ricans began to plan ahead. 'I'll go to my balcony. That's where I'll sleep,' Raúl Pacheco said with a shrug, as the 63-year-old diabetic sat on a walker nursing an injured foot. Julio Córdova, a municipal worker, said he got dressed by the light of his cellphone and planned to buy candles. 'This affects me because I had plans. It couldn't have been yesterday or tomorrow?' he said, shaking his head as he raked leaves. While blackouts are rare in Puerto Rico, the island struggles with chronic power outages blamed on a crumbling power grid that was razed by Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm in September 2017. The system, however, was already in decline after years of lack of maintenance and investment. Only recently did crews start making permanent repairs to Puerto Rico’s power grid following Hurricane Maria. The island continues to depend on generators provided by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to help stabilize the grid. Former President Jimmy Carter’s state funeral: What we know In November, Puerto Rico’s government asked U.S. officials for permission to keep using more than a dozen portable generators for two additional years. Some Puerto Ricans took the latest outage in stride. 'They're part of my everyday life,' said Enid Núñez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority struggles to restructure more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of the island's government agencies. © Copyright 2024 Associated Press.

Center of the universe.' Mar-a-Lago preparing for NYE bash	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The cars begin lining up early in the morning to be screened by Secret Service agents under white tents near the fence that surrounds President-elect Donald Trump’s vast south Florida estate. Famous figures such as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Tesla and X owner Elon Musk pop up at breakfasts, luncheons and other social gatherings held daily at the opulent Mar-a-Lago club. Over the weekend, Mike Love, one of the original members of the Beach Boys, performed the band’s greatest hits under an outdoor tent there as Trump, trailed by Secret Service agents, wandered through the crowd, swinging his fists to the music, according to videos posted online. At other parts of the evening, he stood next to his wife, Melania, near the pool, bobbing his head to the music. Kevin Cramer’s son sentenced to 28 years over chase, fatal car crash The resort is the 'Center of the Universe,' Trump declared on social media Friday, adding, 'Bill Gates asked to come, tonight.' Representatives for Trump and Gates didn't clarify if the Microsoft co-founder did indeed join the parade of figures making the trip to Mar-a-Lago. But the president-elect's post reflects the way his resort, where he's largely been holed up since the election, has become a salon and celebration for his movement. For the people he's selected for his administration — and those who seek to get jobs or curry favor with the incoming president — it's the place to be. Sightings of those turning up there, usually in photos posted online or in the occasional public event, offer a glimpse into the workings of Trump’s incoming White House and how he is setting priorities for office. They are also renewing concerns about transparency as the meetings are largely shrouded in secrecy, and raising questions about how Trump benefits financially as club members seeking to influence the new administration stay and eat there. 'It’s kind of unreal,' said James Fishback, an investor who has in recent days launched an investment fund in the club’s tea room and dined at the courtyard. 'This is the power center.' He recalled standing by the pasta table exchanging words with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump has chosen to lead the Health Department. The winter holidays have been another occasion for Trump's celebrations and for big names to come visit. Jimmy Carter’s hometown pays tribute to late president A representative for Zuckerberg confirmed he joined Trump for a dinner the night before Thanksgiving. A Christmas Eve video showed Trump in one of the resort's ballrooms full of guests, dancing to one of his favorite songs, the Village People's 'Y.M.C.A.,' while his daughter Ivanka sat in a gilded chair nearby. It's not clear what Trump planned for New Year's Eve — he has traditionally held a bash at the resort — but in his social media post on Friday, he boasted, 'New Year’s Eve is going to be AMAZING!!!' During dinners with friends and family, Trump uses the Spotify account on his tablet to play many of the same tunes that were ubiquitous at his campaign rallies. One night, his guest of honor was Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Another night, the honor went to Akie Abe, the widow of slain Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. And, yes, that was Argentine President Javier Milei doing Trump's 'Y.M.C.A.' dance between the tables at a gala dinner. During the day, Trump often golfs at his nearby course with friends, relatives and allies, like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Overall, the vibe is a mix of south Florida's monied social scene overlaid with the power dynamics of an executive job fair. 'He’s surrounded by a lot of old friends,' Graham said. 'I just know that everybody I know wants some job.' Musk has been a constant presence at the club, so much so that Trump’s granddaughter, Kai, wrote on X that he was 'achieving uncle status.' Trump has tasked Musk and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy with leading the Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental task force formed to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations. Kevin Roberts, president of the think tank behind Project 2025, spoke at a December event with investors at the club. One of the guests at the small function was health care executive Dr. Peter Lamelas, later tapped by Trump to be U.S. ambassador to Argentina. Biden doesn’t believe he should have dropped out of race: Source Sometimes Trump relaxes for dinner alongside club members and guests under the yellow and white awnings in the courtyard. Other times, he will address large groups for black-tie events in the ballrooms. At a recent gala for a nonprofit led by Lt. Gen Michael Flynn, the song ″God Bless the U.S.A.,' a favorite of Trump's, cued the president-elect's entrance. 'We’re off to a really good start,' Trump told people gathered for the event. He then inquired about the whereabouts of Tom Homan, whom he has tapped to be border czar, and joked that Homan was from 'central casting.' 'Just relax, Tom. I want you to relax and get ready for the big push,' Trump said. Trump shared with the party guests that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, whom he threatened with a 25% tariff on all imported goods unless she does more to tackle illegal border crossings and drug flows, 'has made progress.' At another recent event at Mar-a-Lago, this one hosted by the America First Policy Institute, the ballroom was full of recognizable Trump-world figures such as Kellyanne Conway, who served as counselor to the president, and Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and founder of Turning Point Action. A copy of the president-elect’s latest book was sitting on the chairs for guests as they arrived in gowns and tuxedos. As he entered the ballroom, Musk was swarmed by guests, including Kash Patel, whom Trump would later select to lead the FBI, before the tech billionaire took his seat at the center table of the ballroom. Musk was later joined there by Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance.

Besides Zuckerberg, Trump has hosted other Silicon Valley executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. 'The top executives, the top bankers, they’re all calling,' Trump said. 'It’s like a complete opposite.' Actor Russell Brand traveled this month to the club to speak at an event, where he sat with actor Mel Gibson, former Fox News personality Tucker Carlson and others. Later in the evening, he stood by a palm tree on the lawn, listening to a bagpiper in a kilt. Brand later posted a video to X about his experience. 'Pretty amazing,' he said.

Jimmy Carter had a UFO encounter. What to know	(NewsNation) — Former President Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday at age 100, left behind a unique legacy of openness about UFO sightings, including his own encounter in 1969, and a message to potential alien civilizations that continue to travel through space. As a rising politician in Georgia, Carter reported seeing an unidentified flying object outside a Lions Club in Leary, Georgia. He described a bright orb that changed colors from blue to red to white, moving toward and away from the group of about 25 witnesses before disappearing beyond the pine trees, per History.com. 'I've never believed that it came from Mars,' Carter told GQ magazine in 2005. 'I know enough physics to know that you can't have vehicles that are tangible in nature flying from Mars, looking around, and then flying back.' Carter said, 'And all of a sudden, one of the men looked up and said, ‘Look, over in the west!’ And there was a bright light in the sky. We all saw it. And then the light, it got closer and closer to us. And then it stopped, I don’t know how far away, but it stopped beyond the pine trees. And all of a sudden it changed color to blue, and then it changed to red, then back to white.' Lawmakers push to expand agencies’ power to cope with drones In 1973, then-Governor Carter filed an official report with the International UFO Bureau, according to History.com. During his 1976 presidential campaign, he promised to release all government UFO information if elected. However, after winning the presidency, Carter backed away from this pledge, citing national security concerns, per History.com. During his presidency, Carter maintained a fascination with space exploration. In 1977, he contributed a message to NASA's Voyager spacecraft mission, and carried on golden records into deep space, per the Daily Mail. 'We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations,' Carter wrote in the message, which continues to travel beyond our solar system along with recordings of Earth's music, languages and images, according to USA Today.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/jimmy-carter-ufo-encounter/	2024-12-30T19:14:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/02/bc343e0d27a14458bec7bff674e83888.jpg?w=900
How Jimmy Carter paved way for craft beer	(NewsNation) — Former President Jimmy Carter, who died on Sunday at the age of 100, was known to be a teetotaler. However, his name and legacy continue to buzz throughout the beer industry. In fact, without the 39th president's help, America's bustling craft beer scene might not even exist. When prohibition ended in 1933, the federal government rolled back most jurisdictions on home alcohol production — but left beer in a legal gray area. Homebrewing remained off-limits for decades, allowing big names like Anheuser-Busch, Schlitz, Pabst and Coors to dominate the market with light, mild lagers. Social Security: When are benefits being sent out in 2025? By the late 1970's, just five large breweries controlled about three-quarters of America's beer volume. Meanwhile, a small community of homebrewers was quietly experimenting with more flavorful, European-inspired style such as IPAs, porters and pale ales. Everything changed in 1978 when Carter signed HR 1337, legalizing homebrewing for personal use. The move allowed Americans to brew up to 100 gallons per person and 200 per household tax-free. Basement hobbyists becoming legitimate gave rise to the craft beer boom. From humble homebrew setups to full-scale operations, these small breweries have transformed the industry. Today, craft beer makes up over 13% of the US market. Experts say more than 90% of craft brewers began as homebrewers, proving just how pivotal the legislation Carter approved became. Before 1978, there were about 100 breweries across the United States. Now there's upwards of 10,000 and it's an industry that's still growing. Ironically, the former president himself rarely drank alcohol and famously never served little liquor in the White House, and yet his signature on that 1978 legislation laid the foundation for today's vibrant craft beer landscape.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/how-jimmy-carter-paved-way-for-craft-beer/	2024-12-30T17:22:56-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/651495e9c46199.52547691-e1722778856683.jpeg?w=800
Allman Brothers’ Chuck Leavell details Jimmy Carter’s musical leg...	(NewsNation) — Former Allman Brothers Band member Chuck Leavell, who has been the Rolling Stones' principal touring keyboardist since the 1980s, shared fond memories of the longest-living president's musical passion and genuine kindness on 'NewsNation Now.' He described first meeting Jimmy Carter in 1973 when the future president was still Georgia's governor. While Leavell and his bandmates expected Carter's gubernatorial visit to be nothing more than a quick photo-op, Carter sat with them for two hours, asking 'really great questions about the state of the music business in Georgia.' 'He was such a likable human being. He really was, you know, when you were in his presence, he made you feel comfortable. He was a great listener,' Leavell added, describing Carter as someone who had more than 'just a casual love of music.'

China hacked Treasury Department earlier this month: Officials	(NewsNation) — A Chinese state-sponsored hacker accessed U.S. Treasury workstations and stole documents in a 'major incident' in early December, a letter sent to lawmakers and reviewed by NewsNation confirmed. The Treasury Department was notified on Dec. 8, 2024, that a bad actor had 'gained access to a key' used by a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust. 'Based on available indicators, the incident has been attributed to a China state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor,' the letter reads in part. Hackers have posted some RIBridges data on the dark web, McKee says With this key, the hacker was able to override security measures, remotely access workstations and access 'certain unclassified documents' from users. The Treasury Department said it is working with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 'fully characterize the incident and determine its overall impact.' A BeyondTrust spokesperson shared the following statement with NewsNation: 'BeyondTrust previously identified and took measures to address a security incident in early December 2024 that involved the Remote Support product. BeyondTrust notified the limited number of customers who were involved, and it has been working to support those customers since then. No other BeyondTrust products were involved. Law enforcement was notified and BeyondTrust has been supporting the investigative efforts. BeyondTrust posted information regarding the incident and the on-going investigation on its website on December 8, 2024, including a summary, timeline, and indicators. The security advisory has been updated since then as part of BeyondTrust’s commitment to updating customers through the completion of this matter.' As of Dec. 30, the BeyondTrust service is offline, according to the letter. The department also assured lawmakers that 'there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/china-treasury-department-hack-security/	2024-12-30T14:19:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/cdfb1daf1c2e440291361ecca0562d4b.jpg?w=900
Northern lights could be seen in continental US on New Year's Eve	(NewsNation) — The solar system is putting on its own New Year's Eve show, with the northern lights potentially visible as far south as Oregon and Illinois on Dec. 31. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Space Weather Prediction Center issued a geomagnetic storm warning for New Year's Eve that could bring the aurora borealis much farther south than usual. The warning comes after several other solar storms made the northern visible to much more of the U.S. than typical in 2024. NASA spacecraft ‘safe’ after closest-ever approach to Sun The sun is currently in a period of solar maximum, where coronal mass ejections send plumes of plasma and magnetic field into space, triggering geomagnetic storm conditions to the Earth's magnetosphere. When CMEs come into contact with the magnetosphere, electrically charged particles collide with atmospheric gases and release energy that manifests as lights, giving us the colorful light show known as the aurora borealis. Weather forecast for viewing the northern lights Cloud cover could make viewing difficult in several states, including Washington, Oregon, Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Those in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and parts of Idaho, on the other hand, have the best chance of catching a light show, though cloud cover could still be an issue. For the best chance of viewing the natural light show, head outside to a place with as little light pollution as possible. If you're struggling to see, your phone may help, as sensitive phone cameras can sometimes capture more of the lights than are visible to the naked eye.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/northern-lights-new-years-eve/	2024-12-30T14:11:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670a1332285440.89773874.jpeg?w=900
Trump border czar Tom Homan to migrants: 'Stay home'	(NewsNation) — Immigration officials and agents at the U.S.-Mexico border insist there is still time for a potential surge of immigrants to cross into the country illegally before President-elect Donald Trump takes office and cracks down on border entries. Trump and his border czar, Tom Homan, have pledged to begin mass deportation efforts on Day 1 of Trump’s second White House term. But with three weeks before Trump’s inauguration, federal immigration officials believe they could be facing an influx of migrants who attempt to find safety in the United States before the border is closed. Homan, however, is warning them not to come. Several caravans of immigrants have broken free from Mexico’s southernmost point in Tapachula near the Guatemalan border. However, those groups of migrants have not yet reached the U.S.-Mexico border. Migrant crisis added to record-level US homelessness: HUD Instead, smaller segments of those caravans have arrived in Eagle Pass, Texas, before Trump takes office. Since President Joe Biden took office in 2021, more than 8 million migrants have been encountered at the southern border. The majority were given a court date to appear at an immigration hearing, which can take years to materialize. Homan told NewsNation that immigrants who cross illegally and then enter the process seeking asylum should not get comfortable living in the United States. 'They need to hear, they need to understand, ‘Do not sell everything you own to give it to the criminal cartels to be smuggled into the United States because you’re not going to stay,’' Homan said. Homan said that the Trump administration will be ending the federal 'catch and release' program, which allows immigrants who entered the country illegally to remain in the country as long as they are in the process for asylum. 'Stay in your homeland,' Homan told NewsNation. 'Be safe. Crossing into this country illegally is very dangerous.' Trump ‘border czar’ says he will override sanctuary city roadblocks Homan said that a record number of migrants have died attempting to cross into the United States and that a record number of Americans are dying from fentanyl. Homan blamed both the migrant and American deaths on the Biden administration and its approach to the border. Texas Department of Public Safety officers encountered two unaccompanied girls who were abandoned by a smuggler in Eagle Pass before the smuggler fled back to Mexico. Texas DPS said that the girls were ages 5 and 9 and were from El Salvador. Both children had a note that included an address and phone number. While Homan wants migrants to remain safe, he told NewsNation that many are ignoring warnings in an attempt to get family members across the border before Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Homan’s warnings come at Mexico government officials announced they would open 25 detention centers for immigrants who were sent back across the border once they were detained by U.S. immigration officials. With a tougher stance coming once Trump takes office, Homan said there is one solution for migrants looking to remain safe. 'Stay home,' Homan said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/homan-migrants-stay-home/	2024-12-30T13:56:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/AP24159796496621.jpg?w=900

Dec. 27, 2024, should have been Smith's 22nd birthday. Instead, her family pleaded for the public's help in finding her nearly three years after she disappeared in a Los Angeles area notorious for gang violence and prostitution.

Former President Jimmy Carter's state funeral: What we know	(NewsNation) — The state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter, who died on Sunday at the age of 100, will be held on January 9 at Washington National Cathedral, the White House has announced. Jimmy Carter's funeral NewsNation confirmed on Monday that President Joe Biden, who addressed the nation on Sunday night after Carter's passing, is expected to deliver the eulogy at the funeral. More details are expected to be announced soon. The funeral will take place three days after Carter’s body is flown to Washington from Atlanta, where the former president will lie in repose on Saturday and Sunday at the Carter Center. The Carter Center announced on Sunday that public observances for the 39th president will be held in Atlanta and Washington before private interment will be held in Plains, Georgia. A state funeral is a national tribute that is traditionally reserved for a head of state, according to the Joint Task Force-National Capital Region and the U.S. Military District of Washington. The United States conducts the funerals on behalf of all people who hold, or who have held, the office of president, president-elect, and other people who have been designated by the president. A state funeral is typically made up of three stages and typically lasts 7-10 days. In former President Carter’s case, however, this week’s New Year’s holiday will delay the start of the process. Stage 1 of the state funeral takes place in the former president’s state of residence. The New York Times reported that Carter’s body will be taken by motorcade from Plains to Atlanta, which is the site of the Carter Center. Stage 2 includes ceremonies that are held in Washington before the state funeral culminates with interment. The Washington ceremonies may involve Armed Forces color guards, elite military bands and other representatives from service academies, the JTR-NCR/USAMDW said. Any services held outside of Washington include Washington-based honor guards and local service units as well as active duty, National Guard and Reserve for logistical, military band or salute guns support. Who will attend Jimmy Carter’s state funeral? State funerals are typically expected to be attended by other former presidents, including Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The New York Times reported it is not yet known whether President-elect Donald Trump will attend the funeral, which will take place 11 days before Trump’s inauguration.

Bush at the National Cathedral, Dec. 5, 2018, in Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) Biden has also declared January 9 as a National Day of Mourning. Biden ordered all flags across the nation to remain at half-staff for the next 30 days. ABC News reported Carter asked Biden in 2023 to deliver his eulogy upon his passing. Biden endorsed Carter as the Democratic nominee for president during his first term as a U.S. senator and was the first member of Congress to do so. 'I think that what Jimmy Carter is an example of is just simple decency,' Biden said about Carter. 'And I think that’s what the rest of the world looks to America for.' NewsNation has confirmed that in addition to Biden speaking at the state funeral, eulogies will also be delivered by Jason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson who is the chairman of the board of the Carter Center. Other eulogies will be delivered by the son of former President Gerald Ford and the son of former Vice President Walter Mondale. Mondale was Carter’s running mate when Carter defeated Ford in the 1976 presidential election. The national funeral will be the first to be held since former President George H.W. Bush died in 2018. What will happen before and after the national funeral? Once Carter’s body arrives in Washington on January 6, the former president will lie in state at the Capitol, where presidents dating back to Abraham Lincoln have been publicly remembered. Thousands of people are expected to pass through the Capitol Rotunda to pay their respects. The Carter Center issued a statement on Monday saying that the U.S. Congress graciously extended an invitation to allow the former president to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda. Washington National Cathedral is located just a few miles north of the White House and has been the venue used for several state funerals, ABC News reported. Other former presidents whose service was held at the church have included Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. Carter will be returned to Georgia by military flight for burial after the national funeral. The New York Times reported that Carter’s body was initially set to be returned to Georgia by train, but that the former president objected. 'If you take my cold, dead body across the U.S. by train, I’ll haunt you until the day you die,' he told a staffer, according to the report. Carter is expected to be buried next to his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn Carter, who died last year at the age of 96. The Carter Center family has asked that in lieu of flowers, donations are asked to be made to the nonprofit Carter Center, which is located at 453 John Lewis Freedom Parkway, N.E. in Atlanta.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/former-president-jimmy-carters-state-funeral-what-we-know/	2024-12-30T10:14:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66ebe9a74477d4.41431495.jpeg?w=900
Judge blocks Biden admin from selling border wall materials	DALLAS (NewsNation) — A federal judge in Texas has ruled that the Biden administration must stop selling border wall materials that the outgoing president has refused to install. The Biden administration agreed to stop selling further border wall materials over the next 30 days. In a Truth Social post, President-elect Trump celebrated the blocked sale, calling the ruling 'a major, crucial WIN for America.' 'The Judge has also ordered an investigation into the illegal selling of the materials, which will expose just how corrupt and anti-American Radical Democrats are,' Trump added. What are the pros and cons of incremental budgeting? Texas AG applauds judge blocking sale The effort, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, began amid reports that the Biden administration was selling border wall materials. 'We have successfully blocked the Biden administration from disposing of any further border wall materials before President Trump takes office,' said Paxton, who has said he wants to help the incoming Trump administration with mass deportation efforts. Materials auctioned cheaply: Texas officials This battle over the border wall materials has been going on for years. In 2023, Congress ordered the U.S. Department of Defense to sell off remaining border wall materials. Some were sent to border states and federal agencies, while others were sold to a private auction company GovPlanet.com for pennies on the dollar, according to Texas officials. This December, Paxton filed a motion to halt further sales. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick celebrated the decision on X, calling it 'a huge win for Donald Trump and Texas!' 'The border wall that Joe Biden was attempting to auction off for pennies on the dollar in secret has been stopped,' he added. Meanwhile, Trump is reportedly planning to issue an executive order releasing funds to restart building the border wall, potentially on day one of his presidency.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/judge-blocks-biden-admin-selling-border-wall-materials/	2024-12-30T07:12:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2155622941.jpg?w=900
Homelessness in US at record high levels: HUD	(NewsNation) — According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's annual assessment report, overall homelessness in America rose by 18% in 2024. The report found more than 770,000 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January. Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, a 33% increase from 2023. The number of homeless older Americans also rose, with more than 140,000 people over the age of 55 going unhoused in the U.S. this year. Nearly half of these older Americans reported living in places not meant for humans. Can you fly with pot? Here’s what the TSA says 'No American should face homelessness, and the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring every family has access to the affordable, safe and quality housing they deserve,' HUD Agency Head Adrianne Todman said in a statement. HUD officials noted that the report reflects information collected a year ago, and likely does not represent current circumstances. It also misses some people and does not include those staying with friends or family because they do not have a place of their own. 'While this data is nearly a year old, and no longer reflects the situation we are seeing, it is critical that we focus on evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness,' Todman said. Black Americans were overrepresented among the homeless population at about 32%, despite making up 12% of the overall population. While nearly every demographic in the U.S. reported record levels of homelessness this year, veterans saw a drop in their numbers. 'We know what works, and our success in reducing veteran homelessness by 55.2% since 2010 shows that,' Todman said. In addition, major cities such as Dallas, Texas and Los Angeles, as well as Chester County, Pennsylvania, saw declines in homelessness.

Jimmy Carter, the 39th US president, has died at 100	ATLANTA (AP) — Jimmy Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, endured humbling defeat after one tumultuous term and then redefined life after the White House as a global humanitarian, has died. He was 100 years old. The longest-lived American president died on Sunday, roughly 22 months after entering hospice care, at his home in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he and his wife, Rosalynn, who died at 96 in November 2023, spent most of their lives, The Carter Center said. 'Our founder, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, passed away this afternoon in Plains, Georgia,' the center said on the social media platform X. It added in a statement that he died peacefully, surrounded by his family. As reaction poured in from around the world, President Joe Biden mourned Carter’s death, saying the world lost an 'extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian' and he lost a dear friend. Biden cited Carter’s work to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil and human rights, promote free and fair elections and house the homeless as an example for others. 'To all of the young people in this nation and for anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning – the good life – study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith, and humility,' Biden said in a statement. Biden spoke later Sunday evening about Carter, calling it a 'sad day' but one that 'brings back an incredible amount of good memories.' 'I’ve been hanging out with Jimmy Carter for over 50 years,' Biden said in his remarks. He recalled the former president being a comfort to him and his wife Jill when their son Beau died in 2015 of cancer. The president remarked how cancer was a common bond between their families, with Carter himself having cancer later in his life. 'Jimmy knew the ravages of the disease too well,' said Biden, who scheduled a state funeral in Washington, D.C., for Carter on Jan. 9. Biden also declared Jan. 9 as a National Day of Mourning across the nation and ordered U.S. flags to fly at half-staff for 30 days from Sunday. Businessman, Navy officer, evangelist, politician, negotiator, author, woodworker, citizen of the world — Carter forged a path that still challenges political assumptions and stands out among the 45 men who reached the nation’s highest office. The 39th president leveraged his ambition with a keen intellect, deep religious faith and prodigious work ethic, conducting diplomatic missions into his 80s and building houses for the poor well into his 90s. 'My faith demands — this is not optional — my faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I am, whenever I can, for as long as I can, with whatever I have to try to make a difference,' Carter once said. A president from Plains A moderate Democrat, Carter entered the 1976 presidential race as a little-known Georgia governor with a broad smile, outspoken Baptist mores and technocratic plans reflecting his education as an engineer. His no-frills campaign depended on public financing, and his promise not to deceive the American people resonated after Richard Nixon’s disgrace and U.S. defeat in southeast Asia. 'If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me. I would not deserve to be your president,' Carter repeated before narrowly beating Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who had lost popularity pardoning Nixon. Carter governed amid Cold War pressures, turbulent oil markets and social upheaval over racism, women’s rights and America’s global role. His most acclaimed achievement in office was a Mideast peace deal that he brokered by keeping Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at the bargaining table for 13 days in 1978. That Camp David experience inspired the post-presidential center where Carter would establish so much of his legacy. Yet Carter’s electoral coalition splintered under double-digit inflation, gasoline lines and the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran. His bleakest hour came when eight Americans died in a failed hostage rescue in April 1980, helping to ensure his landslide defeat to Republican Ronald Reagan. Carter acknowledged in his 2020 'White House Diary' that he could be 'micromanaging' and 'excessively autocratic,' complicating dealings with Congress and the federal bureaucracy. He also turned a cold shoulder to Washington’s news media and lobbyists, not fully appreciating their influence on his political fortunes. 'It didn’t take us long to realize that the underestimation existed, but by that time we were not able to repair the mistake,' Carter told historians in 1982, suggesting that he had 'an inherent incompatibility' with Washington insiders. Carter insisted his overall approach was sound and that he achieved his primary objectives — to 'protect our nation’s security and interests peacefully' and 'enhance human rights here and abroad' — even if he fell spectacularly short of a second term. And then, the world Ignominious defeat, though, allowed for renewal. The Carters founded The Carter Center in 1982 as a first-of-its-kind base of operations, asserting themselves as international peacemakers and champions of democracy, public health and human rights. 'I was not interested in just building a museum or storing my White House records and memorabilia,' Carter wrote in a memoir published after his 90th birthday. 'I wanted a place where we could work.' That work included easing nuclear tensions in North and South Korea, helping to avert a U.S. invasion of Haiti and negotiating cease-fires in Bosnia and Sudan. By 2022, The Carter Center had declared at least 113 elections in Latin America, Asia and Africa to be free or fraudulent. Recently, the center began monitoring U.S. elections as well. Carter’s stubborn self-assuredness and even self-righteousness proved effective once he was unencumbered by the Washington order, sometimes to the point of frustrating his successors. He went 'where others are not treading,' he said, to places like Ethiopia, Liberia and North Korea, where he secured the release of an American who had wandered across the border in 2010. 'I can say what I like. I can meet whom I want. I can take on projects that please me and reject the ones that don’t,' Carter said. He announced an arms-reduction-for-aid deal with North Korea without clearing the details with Bill Clinton’s White House. He openly criticized President George W. Bush for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He also criticized America’s approach to Israel with his 2006 book 'Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.' And he repeatedly countered U.S. administrations by insisting North Korea should be included in international affairs, a position that most aligned Carter with Republican President Donald Trump. Among the center’s many public health initiatives, Carter vowed to eradicate the guinea worm parasite during his lifetime, and nearly achieved it: Cases dropped from millions in the 1980s to nearly a handful. With hardhats and hammers, the Carters also built homes with Habitat for Humanity. The Nobel committee’s 2002 Peace Prize cites his 'untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.' Carter should have won it alongside Sadat and Begin in 1978, the chairman added. Carter accepted the recognition saying there was more work to be done. 'The world is now, in many ways, a more dangerous place,' he said. 'The greater ease of travel and communication has not been matched by equal understanding and mutual respect.' ‘An epic American life’ Carter’s globetrotting took him to remote villages where he met little 'Jimmy Carters,' so named by admiring parents. But he spent most of his days in the same one-story Plains house — expanded and guarded by Secret Service agents — where they lived before he became governor. He regularly taught Sunday School lessons at Maranatha Baptist Church until his mobility declined and the coronavirus pandemic raged. Those sessions drew visitors from around the world to the small sanctuary where Carter will receive his final send-off after a state funeral at Washington’s National Cathedral. The common assessment that he was a better ex-president than president rankled Carter and his allies. His prolific post-presidency gave him a brand above politics, particularly for Americans too young to witness him in office. But Carter also lived long enough to see biographers and historians reassess his White House years more generously. His record includes the deregulation of key industries, reduction of U.S. dependence on foreign oil, cautious management of the national debt and notable legislation on the environment, education and mental health. He focused on human rights in foreign policy, pressuring dictators to release thousands of political prisoners. He acknowledged America’s historical imperialism, pardoned Vietnam War draft evaders and relinquished control of the Panama Canal. He normalized relations with China. 'I am not nominating Jimmy Carter for a place on Mount Rushmore,' Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s domestic policy director, wrote in a 2018 book. 'He was not a great president' but also not the 'hapless and weak' caricature voters rejected in 1980, Eizenstat said. Rather, Carter was 'good and productive' and 'delivered results, many of which were realized only after he left office.' Madeleine Albright, a national security staffer for Carter and Clinton’s secretary of state, wrote in Eizenstat’s forward that Carter was 'consequential and successful' and expressed hope that 'perceptions will continue to evolve' about his presidency. 'Our country was lucky to have him as our leader,' said Albright, who died in 2022. Jonathan Alter, who penned a comprehensive Carter biography published in 2020, said in an interview that Carter should be remembered for 'an epic American life' spanning from a humble start in a home with no electricity or indoor plumbing through decades on the world stage across two centuries. 'He will likely go down as one of the most misunderstood and underestimated figures in American history,' Alter told The Associated Press. A small-town start James Earl Carter Jr. was born Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains and spent his early years in nearby Archery. His family was a minority in the mostly Black community, decades before the civil rights movement played out at the dawn of Carter’s political career. Carter, who campaigned as a moderate on race relations but governed more progressively, talked often of the influence of his Black caregivers and playmates but also noted his advantages: His land-owning father sat atop Archery’s tenant-farming system and owned a main street grocery. His mother, Lillian, would become a staple of his political campaigns. Seeking to broaden his world beyond Plains and its population of fewer than 1,000 — then and now — Carter won an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1946. That same year he married Rosalynn Smith, another Plains native, a decision he considered more important than any he made as head of state. She shared his desire to see the world, sacrificing college to support his Navy career. Carter climbed in rank to lieutenant, but then his father was diagnosed with cancer, so the submarine officer set aside his ambitions of admiralty and moved the family back to Plains. His decision angered Rosalynn, even as she dived into the peanut business alongside her husband. Carter again failed to talk with his wife before his first run for office — he later called it 'inconceivable' not to have consulted her on such major life decisions — but this time, she was on board. 'My wife is much more political,' Carter told the AP in 2021. He won a state Senate seat in 1962 but wasn’t long for the General Assembly and its back-slapping, deal-cutting ways. He ran for governor in 1966 — losing to arch-segregationist Lester Maddox — and then immediately focused on the next campaign. Carter had spoken out against church segregation as a Baptist deacon and opposed racist 'Dixiecrats' as a state senator. Yet as a local school board leader in the 1950s he had not pushed to end school segregation even after the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision, despite his private support for integration. And in 1970, Carter ran for governor again as the more conservative Democrat against Carl Sanders, a wealthy businessman Carter mocked as 'Cufflinks Carl.' Sanders never forgave him for anonymous, race-baiting flyers, which Carter disavowed. Ultimately, Carter won his races by attracting both Black voters and culturally conservative whites. Once in office, he was more direct. 'I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over,' he declared in his 1971 inaugural address, setting a new standard for Southern governors that landed him on the cover of Time magazine. 'Jimmy Who?' His statehouse initiatives included environmental protection, boosting rural education and overhauling antiquated executive branch structures. He proclaimed Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the slain civil rights leader’s home state. And he decided, as he received presidential candidates in 1972, that they were no more talented than he was. In 1974, he ran Democrats’ national campaign arm. Then he declared his own candidacy for 1976. An Atlanta newspaper responded with the headline: 'Jimmy Who?' The Carters and a 'Peanut Brigade' of family members and Georgia supporters camped out in Iowa and New Hampshire, establishing both states as presidential proving grounds. His first Senate endorsement: a young first-termer from Delaware named Joe Biden. Yet it was Carter’s ability to navigate America’s complex racial and rural politics that cemented the nomination. He swept the Deep South that November, the last Democrat to do so, as many white Southerners shifted to Republicans in response to civil rights initiatives. A self-declared 'born-again Christian,' Carter drew snickers by referring to Scripture in a Playboy magazine interview, saying he 'had looked on many women with lust. I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times.' The remarks gave Ford a new foothold and television comedians pounced — including NBC’s new 'Saturday Night Live' show. But voters weary of cynicism in politics found it endearing. Carter chose Minnesota Sen. Walter 'Fritz' Mondale as his running mate on a 'Grits and Fritz' ticket. In office, he elevated the vice presidency and the first lady’s office. Mondale’s governing partnership was a model for influential successors Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Biden. Rosalynn Carter was one of the most involved presidential spouses in history, welcomed into Cabinet meetings and huddles with lawmakers and top aides. The Carters presided with uncommon informality: He used his nickname 'Jimmy' even when taking the oath of office, carried his own luggage and tried to silence the Marine Band’s 'Hail to the Chief.' They bought their clothes off the rack. Carter wore a cardigan for a White House address, urging Americans to conserve energy by turning down their thermostats. Amy, the youngest of four children, attended District of Columbia public school. Washington’s social and media elite scorned their style. But the larger concern was that 'he hated politics,' according to Eizenstat, leaving him nowhere to turn politically once economic turmoil and foreign policy challenges took their toll. Accomplishments, and ‘malaise’ Carter partially deregulated the airline, railroad and trucking industries and established the departments of Education and Energy, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He designated millions of acres of Alaska as national parks or wildlife refuges. He appointed a then-record number of women and nonwhite people to federal posts. He never had a Supreme Court nomination, but he elevated civil rights attorney Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the nation’s second highest court, positioning her for a promotion in 1993. He appointed Paul Volker, the Federal Reserve chairman whose policies would help the economy boom in the 1980s — after Carter left office. He built on Nixon’s opening with China, and though he tolerated autocrats in Asia, pushed Latin America from dictatorships to democracy. But he couldn’t immediately tame inflation or the related energy crisis. And then came Iran. After he admitted the exiled Shah of Iran to the U.S. for medical treatment, the American Embassy in Tehran was overrun in 1979 by followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Negotiations to free the hostages broke down repeatedly ahead of the failed rescue attempt. The same year, Carter signed SALT II, the new strategic arms treaty with Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, only to pull it back, impose trade sanctions and order a U.S. boycott of the Moscow Olympics after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Hoping to instill optimism, he delivered what the media dubbed his 'malaise' speech, although he didn’t use that word. He declared the nation was suffering 'a crisis of confidence.' By then, many Americans had lost confidence in the president, not themselves. Carter campaigned sparingly for reelection because of the hostage crisis, instead sending Rosalynn as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy challenged him for the Democratic nomination. Carter famously said he’d 'kick his ass,' but was hobbled by Kennedy as Reagan rallied a broad coalition with 'make America great again' appeals and asking voters whether they were 'better off than you were four years ago.' Reagan further capitalized on Carter’s lecturing tone, eviscerating him in their lone fall debate with the quip: 'There you go again.' Carter lost all but six states and Republicans rolled to a new Senate majority. Carter successfully negotiated the hostages’ freedom after the election, but in one final, bitter turn of events, Tehran waited until hours after Carter left office to let them walk free. 'A wonderful life' At 56, Carter returned to Georgia with 'no idea what I would do with the rest of my life.' Four decades after launching The Carter Center, he still talked of unfinished business. 'I thought when we got into politics we would have resolved everything,' Carter told the AP in 2021. 'But it’s turned out to be much more long-lasting and insidious than I had thought it was. I think in general, the world itself is much more divided than in previous years.' Still, he affirmed what he said when he underwent treatment for a cancer diagnosis in his 10th decade of life. 'I’m perfectly at ease with whatever comes,' he said in 2015. 'I’ve had a wonderful life. I’ve had thousands of friends, I’ve had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.' ___ Sanz is a former Associated Press reporter.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/ap-us-news/ap-jimmy-carter-the-39th-us-president-has-died-at-100/	2024-12-30T03:11:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/67728079b742c0.37109972.jpeg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Jimmy Carter was 'the most impactful one-term president' in modern American history, according to his former domestic policy adviser Stuart Eizenstat, who defended the 39th president's legacy following Carter's death Sunday at age 100. Eizenstat, speaking with NewsNation before Carter's passing, cited the former president's achievements in energy security and foreign policy, arguing that Carter's presidency laid crucial groundwork for America's future despite his 1980 electoral defeat to Ronald Reagan. 'The energy security which we enjoy as a country today, the lack of dependence on OPEC oil… rests on the foundation of three major energy bills that he passed,' Eizenstat said. How Jimmy Carter’s marriage to Rosalynn Carter helped shape his legacy He also credited Carter for initiating defense programs that would later be associated with the Reagan administration, including the cruise missile and stealth bomber. His post-presidential work through the Carter Center included monitoring over 100 democratic elections and helping combat diseases in Africa. 'This was a life well lived,' Eizenstat said, 'not just in longevity, but in its impact from the time he got into public life and served as a submariner to the time he passed away.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jimmy-carter-impactful-one-term-president-stuart-eizenstat/	2024-12-29T18:44:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/snapshot-6-1.jpg?w=900
Geraldo Rivera recalls Jimmy Carter's life, legacy	(NewsNation) — Former President Jimmy Carter was the 'most underrated president we've ever had,' NewsNation correspondent-at-large Geraldo Rivera said in the hours after the 100-year-old's passing. 'He was a wonderful president and even better in his post-presidential life, I think that history will come to regard him, really, truly, as one of the best we've had,' Rivera said on 'NewsNation Prime.' Carter, the 39th president known for his peanut farm and loving relationship with his wife, passed away on Dec. 29, 2024, in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, after more than a year of hospice care. Former President Jimmy Carter dies at 100 Rivera first met Carter at a campaign event in 1975, the first time the then-Georgia governor had traveled north of the Mason-Dixon line. Rivera ended up introducing Carter at the event through a connection with the southern rock band the Allman Brothers. 'I was very proud,' Rivera said. 'I played a tiny part in the history to help propel this really wonderful man, wonderful, compassionate man.' Carter himself said the Allman Brothers helped him get elected.

How long will flags fly at half-staff for Jimmy Carter?	(NEXSTAR) - Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, died 'peacefully' in his Georgia home Sunday, the Carter Center confirmed. He was 100 years old. Carter, the longest-living American president, underwent a series of short hospital stays before being placed in hospice care in February 2023. He had 'decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention.' To pay tribute to Carter, and in accordance with federal law, the flag was lowered to fly at half-staff Sunday. Flags on federal buildings and grounds in the U.S. and its territories, as well as all naval vessels, will also fly at half-staff. You will likely also see your governor issue a proclamation ordering flags to fly at half-staff at state government facilities. Politicians mourn Jimmy Carter’s death According to a proclamation signed by then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954, because Carter is a former president, flags are to remain at half-staff for 30 days from the day of Carter's death. This is the longest period possible for the flags to fly at half-staff, reserved for the death of the sitting president or former presidents, per the proclamation. Should the sitting vice president, chief justice (current or retired) of the Supreme Court, or the sitting speaker of the house die, flags would be ordered to half-staff for 10 days from the day of death. For other officials – associate justices of the Supreme Court; a Cabinet member; a former vice president; the president pro tempore of the Senate; and majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate – flags are to fly at half-staff from the day of death until interment. Flags are flown at half-staff 'when the whole nation is in mourning,' the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs explains.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/how-long-will-flags-fly-at-half-staff-for-jimmy-carter/	2024-12-29T15:00:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/gettyimages-93160807-e1564950075396-1-e1735511691928.jpg?w=800

Politicians mourn Jimmy Carter's death	(NewsNation) — Leaders across the political spectrum united in mourning Sunday following the death of former President Jimmy Carter, who passed away at age 100 in his hometown of Plains, Georgia. The nation's 39th president, who died peacefully at home surrounded by family, drew bipartisan tributes highlighting his humanitarian work and dedication to public service. 'Today, America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman, and humanitarian,' President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden said in a statement.

Notable quotes by Jimmy Carter	Some quotations from Jimmy Carter. We have a tendency to exalt ourselves and to dwell on the weaknesses and mistakes of others. I have come to realize that in every person there is something fine and pure and noble, along with a desire for self-fulfillment. Political and religious leaders must attempt to provide a society within which these human attributes can be nurtured and enhanced. — from 1975 book 'Why Not the Best?' ___ Our government can express the highest common ideals of human beings — if we demand of government true standards of excellence. At this Bicentennial time of introspection and concern, we must demand such standards. — 'Why Not the Best?' ___ I am a Southerner and an American, I am a farmer, an engineer, a father and husband, a Christian, a politician and former governor, a planner, a businessman, a nuclear physicist, a naval officer, a canoeist, and among other things a lover of Bob Dylan’s songs and Dylan Thomas’s poetry. — 'Why Not the Best?' ___ Christ said, 'I tell you that anyone who looks on a woman with lust has in his heart already committed adultery.' I’ve looked on a lot of women with lust. I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times. This is something that God recognizes I will do — and I have done it — and God forgives me for it. But that doesn’t mean that I condemn someone who not only looks on a woman with lust but who leaves his wife and shacks up with somebody out of wedlock. — Interview, November 1976 Playboy. ___ This inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning, a new dedication within our Government, and a new spirit among us all. A President may sense and proclaim that new spirit, but only a people can provide it. — Inaugural address, January 1977. ___ It’s clear that the true problems of our nation are much deeper — deeper than gasoline lines or energy shortages, deeper even than inflation and recession. ... All the legislation in the world can’t fix what’s wrong with America. ... It is a crisis of confidence. — So-called 'malaise' speech, July 1979. ___ But we know that democracy is always an unfinished creation. Each generation must renew its foundations. Each generation must rediscover the meaning of this hallowed vision in the light of its own modern challenges. For this generation, ours, life is nuclear survival; liberty is human rights; the pursuit of happiness is a planet whose resources are devoted to the physical and spiritual nourishment of its inhabitants. — Farewell Address, January 1981. ___ We appreciate the past. We are grateful for the present and we’re looking forward to the future with great anticipation and commitment. — October 1986, at the dedication of the Carter Presidential Library and Museum. ___ War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, never a good. We will not learn to live together in peace by killing each other’s children. — December 2002, Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech. ___ Fundamentalists have become increasingly influential in both religion and government, and have managed to change the nuances and subtleties of historic debate into black-and-white rigidities and the personal derogation of those who dare to disagree. ... The influence of these various trends poses a threat to many of our nation’s historic customs and moral commitments, both in government and in houses of worship. — From 2005 book 'Our Endangered Values.' ___ I think that this breakthrough by Barack Obama has been remarkable. When he made his speech (on race) a few months ago in Philadelphia, I wept. I sat in front of the television and cried, because I saw that as the most enlightening and transforming analysis of racism and a potential end of it that I ever saw in my life. — August 2008, commenting on then-Sen. Barack Obama’s candidacy. ___ I think it’s based on racism. There is an inherent feeling among many in this country that an African-American should not be president. ... No matter who he is or how much we disagree with his policies, the president should be treated with respect. — September 2009, reacting to Rep. Joe Wilson’s shout of 'You lie!' during a speech to Congress by President Barack Obama. ___ I’m still determined to outlive the last guinea worm. — 2010, on The Carter Center’s work to eradicate guinea worm disease. ___ You know how much I raised to run against Gerald Ford? Zero. You know how much I raised to run against Ronald Reagan? Zero. You know how much will be raised this year by all presidential, Senate and House campaigns? $6 billion. That’s 6,000 millions. — September 2012, reacting to the 2010 'Citizens United' U.S. Supreme Court decision permitting unlimited third-party political spending. ___ I have become convinced that the most serious and unaddressed worldwide challenge is the deprivation and abuse of women and girls, largely caused by a false interpretation of carefully selected religious texts and a growing tolerance of violence and warfare, unfortunately following the example set during my lifetime by the United States. — From 2014 book 'A Call to Action.' ___ I don’t think there’s any doubt now that the NSA or other agencies monitor or record almost every telephone call made in the United States, including cellphones, and I presume email as well. We’ve gone a long way down the road of violating Americans’ basic civil rights, as far as privacy is concerned. — March 2014, commenting on U.S. intelligence monitoring after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks ___ We accept self-congratulations about the wonderful 50th anniversary - which is wonderful - but we feel like Lyndon Johnson did it and we don’t have to do anything anymore. — April 2014, commenting on racial inequality during a celebration of the Civil Rights Act’s 40th anniversary. ___ I had a very challenging question at Emory (University) the other night: 'How would you describe the United States of America today in one word?' And I didn’t know what to say for a few moments, but I finally said, 'Searching.' I think the country in which we live is still searching for what it ought to be, and what it can be, and I’m not sure we’re making much progress right at this moment. — October 2014 during a celebration of his 90th birthday. ___ The life we have now is the best of all. We have an expanding and harmonious family, a rich life in our church and the Plains community, and a diversity of projects at The Carter Center that is adventurous and exciting. Rosalynn and I have visited more than 145 countries, and both of us are as active as we have ever been. We are blessed with good health and look to the future with eagerness and confidence, but are prepared for inevitable adversity when it comes. — From 2015 book, 'A Full Life.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/ap-us-news/ap-notable-quotes-by-jimmy-carter/	2024-12-29T13:50:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6771c4e16ed663.47836255.jpeg?w=900
Jimmy Carter's accomplishments, in and out of office	(NewsNation) — The domestic and charitable achievements of Jimmy Carter, the nation's 39th president, extend well beyond his four years in office. Carter envisioned a 'competent and compassionate' government. From his championing of human rights to his environmentally conscious track record to his negotiating, policy-setting and personal contributions, echoes of Carter's influence are still noticeable today. Here's a look at his legacy, both in the White House and in the years after. Camp David Peace Accords In 1978, Carter played a significant role in the Camp David Accords, a pair of agreements that helped stabilize an otherwise tumultuous relationship between Egypt and Israel. From the outset of his presidency, Carter hoped to reconvene the Geneva Conference to end Arab-Israeli tensions. Ultimately, two weeks of secret negotiations at the U.S. presidential retreat Camp David yielded results. Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin signed a series of agreements in September 1978. The Camp David Peace Accords are thought to be a framework for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt the following year. The Carter Center Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter went on to establish a non-profit organization centered on human rights in 1982. Today, the Carter Center is responsible for observing 114 elections in 39 countries 'to help establish and strengthen democracies' and was a leader in new public health approaches to prevent and control diseases in Africa and Latin America, according to the organization's website. By 2002, Carter would be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize 'for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.' Creation of the Department of Education President Andrew Johnson first attempted to create a U.S. Department of Education in 1867, but it was downgraded to the Office of Education out of fear it would have too much power over local schools. Under Carter, the Department of Education was officially created in 1980 with a different vision. While Johnson's department would have existed primarily to collect data about the nation's schools, Carter's was born out of growing efforts to help foster equal access to education, according to the department's website. Congress passed the Department of Education Organization Act in October 1979, and the department began carrying out its duties the following May. Established national energy policy Carter created the U.S. Department of Energy and is behind policy establishing national energy goals. The National Energy Act focused on reducing annual growth in energy demand and oil imports and gasoline consumption as well as improving the efficacy of heating and cooling systems, increasing coal production and introducing solar energy in American homes. He's also been lauded for decontrolling domestic petroleum prices to stimulate production. The Carter Work Project Carter was in New York to speak at a church in 1984 when he stopped by a Habitat for Humanity construction site, according to the organization's website. Wanting to secure more volunteers for the project, Carter and his wife returned to the site with dozens of people and helped renovate an apartment building. So began the first Carter Work Project, which is now a weeklong annual tradition. To date, the Carters have joined more than 103,000 volunteers across 14 different countries to repair and build thousands of homes, according to Habitat for Humanity.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jimmy-carters-accomplishments/	2024-12-29T13:46:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/GettyImages-2070989.jpg?w=900
Five defining moments of Jimmy Carter's presidency	Former President Carter's post-presidential life lasted decades, putting his career in the White House in a deep rearview mirror in many ways. Carter died Sunday, according to the Carter Center. It was a memorable four-year term, and one that has some parallels to today's battles over inflation, and how to deal with an unstable Iran and Middle East. The Carter years brought a Democrat to office after the short presidency of Gerald Ford, who took office after the Watergate controversy that ended the Nixon administration. But the Georgia Democrat's presidency was ended by the Reagan revolution, which impacted the political scene for the following decades. Here are five defining moments from Carter's presidency. Camp David Accords Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin chats informally with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and U.S. President Jimmy Carter during their peace talks on September 6, 1978, at the presidential retreat of Camp David in Maryland. (Photo by Moshe Milner/GPO via Getty Images) Carter's crowning achievement as president was the peace treaty signed between Israel and Egypt in 1978. Carter invited Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to Camp David in Maryland to negotiate a peace agreement. After nearly two weeks of intense negotiations, which very nearly failed multiple times, the three men signed the Camp David Accords. The agreements included a process for Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza, an outline for a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, and frameworks for peace among Israel and its other neighbors in the region. The Sinai Peninsula was demilitarized, and Israeli ships won free passage through the Suez Canal. Sadat and Begin would be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize later in 1981; Sadat was assassinated two years later. While the treaty did not lead to a lasting peace throughout the Middle East and was opposed by the Palestine Liberation Organization and other Arab states, it cast a long shadow on peace negotiations in the region, including a 2000 effort by former President Clinton. The intervention by Carter remains among the most significant diplomatic accomplishments by a president in modern history. ‘Malaise’ speech President Jimmy Carter at his desk in the Oval Office, talking to his new Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan, White House, Washington, D.C., July 19, 1979. In mid-1979, the U.S. was facing high inflation, rising interest rates and both unemployment and energy crises. The problems were crippling Carter’s presidency. In July 1979, with an approval rating of just 29 percent, Carter decided to address the American public. In a nationally televised speech from Camp David, Carter laid out energy proposals such as increased domestic production, restricting foreign imports and taxing energy profits to fund research for new energy technologies. But the speech wouldn’t be remembered for Carter’s vision to curb the economic and energy crisis facing the nation. Instead, Carter’s speech on July 15, 1979, would be remembered as his 'malaise' or 'crisis of confidence' speech. Carter said the U.S. was facing a 'fundamental threat to American democracy' — what he called a 'crisis of confidence.' He argued Americans had lost faith in the ability to govern themselves and the future of the nation. It was a sober assessment by Carter, but it was one that voters did not greet kindly. Instead, it dropped public confidence in the embattled president even further. Olympic boycott A protester against the Moscow summer Olympics boycott during the Opening Ceremony for the XIII Olympic Winter Games on February 14, 1980, at the Lake Placid Equestrian Stadium, Lake Placid, United States. (Photo by Steve Powell/Allsport/Getty Images) Against the backdrop of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, Carter ordered a boycott by U.S. athletes of the 1980 Summer Olympics that were set to be held in the Soviet Union. Carter convinced other countries, including Canada, West Germany and Japan, to boycott the event. Ultimately, 66 countries in total boycotted the games in an effort to isolate Moscow, which kept troops in Afghanistan. The 1980 boycott led the Soviet Union to boycott the 1984 Olympics hosted by the United States in Los Angeles, an effort joined by other Soviet states. In both Games, the boycotts had a huge impact on the competition, given the countries involved. Some athletes who had trained for years to compete at the Games were angry with Carter's decision. When the idea was floated for athletes from boycotting nations to compete in the Games under a neutral banner, Carter threatened to revoke the passports of U.S. athletes. Still, many Americans saw the decision as another way to fight against the Soviet regime. The U.S. has not launched a similar boycott of the Olympics since 1980.

(AFP/AFP via Getty Images) Carter oversaw the creation of the Department of Education, a sizable expansion of the federal government that was opposed strongly by many Republicans at the time. GOP candidates more than 40 years after the decision still talk about ending the federal department. The newly established department was an offshoot of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. It was created, in part, to meet Carter's commitment to make the federal government more efficient. Before signing off on the creation of the agency in 1979, Carter argued that the federal government had beleaguered education in the U.S. because of 'bureaucratic buck passing.' Even though he thought the federal government played a 'junior role' to states and localities on education, he argued that a new federal bureaucracy was needed to streamline federal responsibilities. But Carter's move to create the department also came after he picked up the influential 1976 endorsement of the National Education Association, the largest labor union in the U.S. He committed himself to creating the department to secure the endorsement. The department faces enduring Republican dissent, with many over the years calling for it to be abolished. By 2022, the department's annual budget was more than $80 billion. Iranian hostage crisis US President Jimmy Carter signs the order blocking Iranian funds in US banks, on November 14, 1979, in Washington, D.C., as White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler (L), Secretary of the Treasury G. William Miller (2nd R) and Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti look on. (Photo by CONSOLIDATED NEWS PICTURES/AFP via Getty Images) The Carter presidency was badly shaken by the Iranian hostage crisis, in which 52 Americans were held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran for 444 days. The 1980 presidential campaign took place against the backdrop of the hostage crisis, which began in November 1979 after the U.S. admitted the Iranian shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, into the country to receive medical treatment following the Islamic Revolution that toppled him. Daily newscasts on the hostage crisis added to Carter's already deep political problems, contributing to a sense of a nation defeated and in decline. Carter at one point ordered a rescue mission to try to release the U.S. hostages. It ended in failure, with eight U.S. service members dying when a helicopter crashed into a transport craft. Carter worked tirelessly to secure the release of the hostages, but they were not freed until minutes after former President Reagan was sworn in on Jan. 20, 1981. While polls weeks ahead of the 1980 presidential election showed a close race, Reagan won in a landslide. Carter won just six states plus the District of Columbia, taking 49 electoral votes to 489 won for the Reagan ticket. Reagan won the popular vote by more than 8 million votes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/five-defining-moments-of-jimmy-carters-presidency/	2024-12-29T13:43:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-138433866-e1701378494470.jpg?w=900
How Jimmy Carter's marriage to Rosalynn Carter helped shape his l...	Former President Jimmy Carter’s marriage to first lady Rosalynn Carter played a defining role in his life, spanning 77 years and making it the longest presidential marriage in U.S. history. Jimmy Carter died on Sunday, according to the Carter Center. Throughout his four-year presidency, the pair presented themselves as a team, with Rosalynn serving as one of his closest advisers and even being a presence in Cabinet meetings. And while the couple’s time in the White House was brief, they became a fixture in U.S. politics by championing various causes at home and abroad. 'Usually they say that first ladies are sometimes behind where society is in terms of what women can do, but I would say for Rosalynn Carter, she was out in front,' said Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. 'She and her husband had worked as a team from the beginning and certainly as they went through life,' she added. Jimmy Carter dies at 100 Rosalynn Carter died Nov. 19, 2023, just days after she entered into hospice care. The former president made a rare public appearance at a tribute service for her on Nov. 28, 2023. Jimmy Carter started dating then-Rosalynn Smith while he was home from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., according to the White House Historical Association. Smith had just wrapped up her freshman year at Georgia Southwestern College. The couple married in 1946 before following Carter’s naval career, which took them to Virginia, Hawaii and Connecticut. However, this period of their life ended when Carter’s father died and the couple returned home to run his family’s peanut farm outside of Plains, Ga. The future first lady helped her husband with the business by working as a bookkeeper for the farm. 'We developed a partnership when we were working in the farm supply business, and it continued when Jimmy got involved in politics,' the former first lady said during a joint interview with her husband with The Associated Press ahead of the couple’s 75th wedding anniversary in 2021. 'I knew more on paper about the business than he did. He would take my advice about things,' she added, drawing a laugh and affirmation from her husband. Rosalynn Carter continued to support her husband by playing an integral role in his campaigns for state Senate, governor and later president. During the Carter administration, Rosalynn Carter notably represented her husband during trips abroad including Brazil, Poland, Costa Rica, Rome and Thailand. 'There are pictures of her meeting with the secretary of State and the head of the National Security Council, so Cyrus Vance and Zbigniew Brzezinski,' Perry said. 'Major, big figures in the president’s Cabinet that she was meeting with separately from the larger Cabinet meetings.' Politicians mourn Jimmy Carter’s death She played a major role domestically, too, becoming the first spouse of the president since Eleanor Roosevelt to testify on Capitol Hill. Carter, who served as an active honorary chairwoman on the President’s Commission on Mental Health, was testifying about mental health, one of her chief issue areas as first lady. 'She, despite her activism, was not attempting to show herself to be a full partner with her husband even if she had wanted to be,' Perry said, referring to Roosevelt. 'But Rosalynn Carter, I think, was the first to do that in the modern era.' President Carter, whose administration was grappling with soaring inflation and energy costs, lost reelection in 1980 to then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan (R). But historians argue that the couple’s four years in the White House set them up for success down the road. 'What I say to the Gilbert and Sullivan’s lyric ‘he is the very model of a modern major general,’ in the case of Jimmy Carter, he’s the very model of a modern post president, and she’s the very model of a post or former first lady,' Perry said. After the presidency, the pair went on to establish the Carter Center, a nonprofit humanitarian organization seeking to 'prevent and resolve conflicts, enhance freedom and democracy, and improve health.' The opening line to the center’s mission statement reads: 'The Carter Center is guided by the principles of our Founders, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter.' 'I always admire Jimmy Carter because he never downplayed the role of Rosalynn,' Perry said. 'He always up-played the fact that they were a partnership and he believed in her and trusted in her.' Jimmy Carter underscored the mutual respect he and his wife shared for each other during the couple’s interview with the AP in 2021, calling his marriage 'a full partnership.' 'My biggest secret is to marry the right person if you want to have a long-lasting marriage,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/how-jimmy-carters-marriage-to-rosalynn-carter-helped-shape-his-legacy/	2024-12-29T13:43:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/illustration_carterjimmy_carterrosalynn_022023mm-ap_marriage_v4.jpg?w=900

(Adam Schultz, The White House via AP) Carter, previously governor of Georgia, beat then-President Gerald R. Ford for the presidency in 1976. He served a single term before being defeated by Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980. But Carter didn't ride off into the sunset after his landslide loss. Instead, he went on to spend decades on global advocacy for democracy, public health, and human rights via The Carter Center. The center was opened in 1982 by Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, now 95. Carter received a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work through the center. Carter, who has lived most of his life in Plains, Georgia, traveled extensively into his 80s and early 90s, including annual trips to build homes with Habitat for Humanity and frequent trips abroad as part of The Carter Center's election monitoring and its effort to eradicate the Guinea worm parasite in developing countries. But the former president's health declined over his 10th decade of life, especially as the coronavirus pandemic limited his public appearances, including at his beloved Maranatha Baptist Church where he taught Sunday School lessons for decades before standing-room-only crowds of visitors. Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter: A picture of the American dream In August 2015, Carter had a small cancerous mass removed from his liver. The following year, Carter announced that he needed no further treatment, as an experimental drug had eliminated any sign of cancer. Carter was born Oct. 1, 1924, to a prominent family in rural south Georgia. He went on to the U.S. Naval Academy during World War II and pursued a career as a Cold War Naval officer before returning to Georgia with Rosalynn and their young family to take over the family peanut business after Earl Carter's death in the 1950s. A moderate Democrat, the younger Carter rapidly climbed from the local school board to the state Senate and then the Georgia governor's office. He began his White House bid as an underdog with a broad smile, outspoken Baptist mores and policy plans reflecting his education as an engineer. He connected with many Americans because of his promise not to deceive the American people after Nixon’s disgrace and U.S. defeat in southeast Asia. 'If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me. I would not deserve to be your president,' Carter said often as he campaigned. Former first lady Rosalynn Carter dies at 96 Carter said after leaving office that he had underestimated the importance of dealing with Washington power brokers, including the media and lobbying forces anchored in the nation's capital. But he insisted his overall approach was sound and that he achieved his primary objectives — to 'protect our nation’s security and interests peacefully' and 'enhance human rights here and abroad' — even if he fell spectacularly short of a second term. And years later, upon his cancer diagnosis as a nonagenarian, he expressed satisfaction with his long life. 'I’m perfectly at ease with whatever comes,' he said in 2015. 'I’ve had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.'

Jimmy Carter dies at 100	(NewsNation) — The longest-lived U.S. president in history, Jimmy Carter, has died at the age of 100. Carter, who served as the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981, died Sunday in Plains, Georgia. At 100, Carter was the third-oldest living person to have served as a state leader. He had been receiving hospice care since February 2023. The Carter Center confirmed his death via X. Presidential historian and friend of Carter's, Dr. Larry Cook remembered Carter as a gracious and caring man guided by his faith and values. 'He's let it be known that his faith has guided him since he was a child and up through his adult life and through the presidency and beyond,' Cook said. 'It's who he is, his faith is who he is.' Carter was preceded in death by his wife, Rosalynn Carter, who died Nov. 19, 2023. The former president and first lady had the longest marriage of any first couple in U.S. history and celebrated their 77th wedding anniversary in July. 'They’ve experienced everything that you can together. I think the beautiful thing is that they are still together,' the Carters’ grandson, Josh Carter, recently told People magazine. 'They are still holding hands … it’s just amazing.' Born Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, James Earl Carter Jr. was the first person on his father’s side of his family to graduate from high school. He was the only United States Naval Academy graduate to be elected to the White House. Presidential historian Robert Dallek said Carter will be remembered for his post-presidential work than his time in office. 'He'll never be seen as a great president. But he will be seen as a great humanitarian,' Dallek said. A month after Carter graduated, he married Eleanor Rosalynn Carter in 1946. 'She’s the girl I want to marry,' Jimmy Carter told his mother after his first date with Smith, who had grown up as a friend and neighbor of the Carter family in Plains, Georgia. In July 1953, Carter gave up his military career to save his family’s peanut farm and later became involved in local politics when he served on an education board. Carter served as the 76th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and as a Georgia state senator from 1963 to 1967. After Carter’s presidency, in 1982, he founded the Carter Center, which has played an active role in human rights and disease prevention issues globally. The Carters helped publicize Habitat for Humanity as well.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jimmy-carter-dies-100/	2024-12-29T13:13:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-29-151242.png?w=900
4 killed as storm system that spawned tornadoes moved across sout...	Officials were beginning to assess the damage on Sunday after a strong storm system moved across the southern U.S. over the weekend, spawning tornadoes across the region and killing at least four people. The line of severe weather led to about 40 tornado reports from southeastern Texas to Alabama, National Weather Service meteorologist Frank Pereira said, but those reports remain unconfirmed until damage surveys are completed. 'It’s not unheard of, but it is fairly uncommon to have a severe weather outbreak of this magnitude this late in the year,' he said. In the Houston area, National Weather Service crews planned to conduct surveys Sunday for at least five tornados that hit north and south of the city on Saturday. At least one person died. The 48-year-old woman killed was found about 100 feet (30 meters) from her home in the Liverpool area south of Houston, said Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff’s Office. She said the exact cause of death wasn't immediately known. Four other people in Brazoria County suffered injuries that weren't considered critical, said Polston, who added that at least 40 homes and buildings were significantly damaged in the county. In North Carolina, a 70-year-old man was killed Sunday in Statesville, just north of Charlotte, when a tree landed on top of the pickup truck he was driving. Highway Patrol Trooper DJ Maffucci said 'it was just a freak accident' and that he believes Matthew Teeple, of Cleveland, North Carolina, was killed instantly. 'It’s very sad, just terrible timing is pretty much all it was,' Maffucci said. The storms also were responsible for a number of downed trees in the area and 'quite a few wrecks,' Maffucci added. Two people were killed in storms in Mississippi, including a teen, officials said. The 18-year-old died after a tree fell on her home Saturday night in Natchez in Adams County as the storm brought high winds to the area, said Adams County Emergency Management spokesperson Neifa Hardy. Two other people in the home were injured. Another person died in Lowndes County and at least eight more were injured across the state, officials said. The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. Storm damage also was reported in the northern Alabama town of Athens, just northwest of Huntsville. A National Weather Service survey team was expected to begin assessing damage Sunday morning, said meteorologist Chelly Amin. Holly Hollman, spokeswoman for the city of Athens, said she lives about two blocks from downtown, where most of the damage from the early Sunday morning storms occurred. Hollman said the storm hurled large HVAC units from the tops of building, ripped the roof off a bookstore and damaged a brick building adjacent to a veteran’s museum. A full-sized, stripped down military helicopter was toppled from a pole where it was on display, she added. 'I stepped out on my porch and I could hear it roar,' she said. 'I think we are extremely lucky that we got hit late at night. If it had hit during the busy hours, I think we might have had some injuries and possibly some fatalities.' At 9 a.m. Sunday, nearly 65,000 customers were without power in Mississippi, down from 93,000 around 1 a.m., according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. Also without power were some 54,000 customers in Georgia; 36,000 in Alabama; 20,000 in Louisiana; and 13,000 in Texas. Two roads were closed in western North Carolina — a region broadly devastated by Hurricane Helene this fall — as of late Sunday morning because of severe weather, North Carolina Department of Transportation spokesperson Jamie Kritzer said. Part of U.S. 441, also known as the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, was closed in both directions in Swain County north of Bryson City, due to high winds. It was expected to reopen on Monday. Another road in Macon County near Franklin — State Road 1672, also known as River Road — was closed Sunday morning due to high water and was slated to reopen Sunday afternoon. The storms moved quickly through Georgia, where there were reports of trees toppled in the Atlanta area. During a week of bustling holiday travel, a few of the busiest U.S. airports were directly in the path of the severe weather. On Sunday morning, there were over 200 flight delays to or from the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and almost 20 flights were cancelled. At Charlotte Douglas International Airport there were nearly 500 delays and 28 cancellations. ___ Associated Press reporters Corey Williams and Julie Walker also contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/ap-tornadoes-in-texas-and-mississippi-kill-2-as-storm-system-moves-across-southern-u-s/	2024-12-29T12:49:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6771b6dd8ac368.19551325.jpeg?w=900
US children are struggling with reading — and so are adults	(The Hill) — Learning to read can become exponentially more difficult for older students and adults who have fallen behind, creating grave concerns as the number of individuals struggling with literacy into high school and adulthood is increasing. Data released in recent months shows K-12 schools are seeing more older students who cannot read at their grade level, coupled with an international study showing an increase in U.S. adults who cannot read past simple sentences. 'We are really taking a family literacy approach to understand this issue and to recognize that this is a multi-generational challenge. If the parents and caregivers struggle with literacy, the children are more likely to also struggle with literacy,' said Sarah Cacicio, the director of Adult Literacy and Learning Impact Network, which was convened by the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. 'Socioeconomic status and parents' literacy levels are bigger [...] indicators for how well a child is going to do, even more so than quality instruction. Although quality instruction is super important,' Cacicio added. 'That's why it's so important to address this issue of literacy at multiple generations.' The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), part of the Department of Education, released data earlier this month showing 28 percent of adults in the U.S. ranked at the lowest levels of literacy, compared to 19 percent in 2017. Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library seeks New York state expansion NCES Commissioner Peggy Carr said in a news conference the increase was 'substantial.' Studies have shown that low literacy rates exacerbate everything from poverty and health care to low civic engagement. And while there are programs to help adult learners, concerns about time and money can prove problematic. 'We connected with individuals who could enroll in adult education services but have not, and what we found is that 80 percent of the adults surveyed didn't know about available programs in their area, but 84 percent said they would like to continue learning and enroll in a program. So, what that tells us is it's less about time and more about awareness. We really think that lack of awareness about free programs and access to resources and services is the No. 1 barrier, as well as perceived costs,' Cacicio said. Federally funded adult education programs 'are only serving, really, fewer than 10 percent of all of those who need literacy services,' she added. Adult literacy problems are tricky to resolve and lack a one-size-fits-all solution. When adults join reading programs, they can be at literacy levels ranging from third graders to high school seniors. 'I think one of the interesting things about adult learning is that you can't really design a standard curriculum,' Cacicio said. 'Some people are more looking for work-based learning, or if they're an English learner, they're trying to learn specific language and vocabulary that connects to their workplace,' she added. And the problem isn't limited to adults. Earlier this year, a study was released by the Educational Testing Service and the Advanced Education Research and Development Fund showing more than 20 percent of students in fifth through seventh grades stumble over words they can’t recognize or sound out. Experts aim to have children reading proficiently at their own level by third grade. Biden canceling student loan debt for 55K public service workers Over the summer, education firm NWEA published data showing eighth graders are a full year behind in reading and math. 'So, fourth grade is when you start to see significant gaps in in reading, and many times, these comprehension gaps are actually due to more foundational skills, so something that students didn't get either in phonics instruction or they're lacking vocabulary or background knowledge to be able to comprehend the text, or they're just haven't been taught comprehension strategies,' said Erin Bailey, vice president of literacy and content at Reading Is Fundamental. Students struggling with reading has become a top concern, with multiple states switching to the science of reading for young students in an attempt to help them meet standards before leaving third grade. Part of the difficulty once a student falls behind is teachers in higher grades haven't been trained to help students with the building blocks of reading. 'For most students, in most places around grade six, definitely by grade eight, students no longer have a reading teacher unless they're in an intervention or there’s some data that indicates they need some additional services, but your majority of kids, they're not in a reading class anymore,' said Miah Daughtery, NWEA vice president for content advocacy. 'Your average English teacher is no more prepared to teach reading than your average physics teacher. Your English teacher does not go to school to learn how to teach reading; they go to school to learn how to teach the humanities in English,' Daughtery said. This leads to a common reading problem between older students and adults, which is lacking context or background knowledge to understand the text in front of them. 'We have adolescents, young adults and adults who are still growing in their reading journey, either from being nonreaders to rudimentary readers to readers, even readers like me, who are good readers but really still need help with technical text and science text. The brain is such a phenomenal organ you can really learn how to read, for most people, throughout the course of your life,' Daughtery said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/us-literacy-adults-children-reading-writing/	2024-12-29T12:44:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/school-choice_lonas_AssociatedPress-1-e1734983418988.jpg?w=800
Tornadoes in Texas and Mississippi kill 2 and injure 6 as severe ...	HOUSTON (AP) — At least two people were killed and six more injured as several tornadoes touched down in Texas and Mississippi on Saturday, damaging homes and flipping vehicles as the storm system moved east across Alabama early Sunday. The National Weather Service's severe storm tracker indicated the system was moving east through Alabama into Georgia shortly before 4 a.m. The agency issued severe thunderstorm warnings with the possibility of tornadoes in western Georgia and the northwestern tip of Florida directly above the Gulf of Mexico. One person died in the Liverpool area, located south of Houston, and four people suffered injuries that were not considered critical, according to Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff’s Office. There were 'multiple touchdown points' in the county between Liverpool, Hillcrest Village and Alvin. Officials knew of around 10 damaged homes but were working to determine the extent of the damage, Polston said. In Mississippi, one person died in Adams County and two people were injured in Franklin County, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. 'These storms are probably going to get a lot worse this evening and overnight the further east you go,' said Josh Lichter, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. It appeared at least six tornadoes touched down in the Houston area, though they may discover there were more when crews go out to survey the damage, and there was damage in the area from both tornadoes and straight-line winds, Litcher said. North of Houston, mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in Katy and Porter Heights, where the doors of a fire station were blown in, the weather service said. The storms also caused departure delays of over an hour Saturday afternoon at Houston's two main airports, Bush Intercontinental and Hobby, according to the website FlightAware. About 71,000 utility customers were without power in Mississippi Saturday and the number was expected to rise, said Malary White, chief communications officer for the state's Emergency Management Agency. Around 3:30 a.m. Sunday, nearly 81,000 customers were without power in the state, down from 93,000 around 1 a.m., according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. The emergency management agency did not have official damage reports Saturday. First responders were focused on ensuring safety and making sure everyone was accounted for, White said. 'We do anticipate more thorough damage assessments starting in the early morning hours,' she said. The National Weather Service office in Birmingham, Alabama, issued overnight severe thunderstorm warnings for several areas in the southern part of the state, advising residents to seek shelter to avoid possible damaging winds up to 60 mph (96.5 kph).	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/mid-south/ap-tornadoes-touch-down-around-houston-killing-1/	2024-12-29T06:12:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6771591a41a6d3.84666764.jpeg?w=900
Azerbaijan's president says crashed jetliner was shot down by Rus...	Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev said Sunday that the Azerbaijani airliner that crashed last week was shot down by Russia, albeit unintentionally, and criticized Moscow for trying to 'hush up' the issue for days. 'We can say with complete clarity that the plane was shot down by Russia. (...) We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done,' he told Azerbaijani state television. Aliyev said that the airliner, which crashed Wednesday in Kazakhstan, was hit by fire from the ground over Russia and 'rendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare.' Aliyev accused Russia of trying to 'hush up' the issue for several days, saying he was 'upset and surprised' by versions of events put forward by Russian officials. 'Unfortunately, for the first three days we heard nothing from Russia except delirious versions,' he said. The crash killed 38 of 67 people on board. The Kremlin said that air defense systems were firing near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, where the plane attempted to land, to deflect a Ukrainian drone strike. Aliyev said Azerbaijan made three demands to Russia in connection with the crash. 'First, the Russian side must apologize to Azerbaijan. Second, it must admit its guilt. Third, punish the guilty, bring them to criminal responsibility and pay compensation to the Azerbaijani state, the injured passengers and crew members,' he said. Aliyev noted that the first demand was 'already fulfilled' when Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized to him on Saturday. Putin called the crash a 'tragic incident' though stopped short of acknowledging Moscow’s responsibility. He said that an investigation into the crash was ongoing, and that 'the final version (of events) will be known after the black boxes are opened.' He noted that Azerbaijan was always 'in favor of a group of international experts' investigating the crash, and had 'categorically refused' Russia’s suggestion that the Interstate Aviation Committee, which oversees civil aviation in the Commonwealth of Independent States, investigate it. 'It is no secret that this organization consists mostly of Russian officials and is headed by Russian citizens. The factors of objectivity could not be fully ensured here,' Aliyev said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media on Sunday that Putin had spoken to Aliyev over the phone again, but did not provide details of the conversation. The Kremlin also said a joint investigation by Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan was underway at the crash site near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. The plane was flying from Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, to Grozny when it turned toward Kazakhstan, hundreds of kilometers (miles) across the Caspian Sea from its intended destination, and crashed while making an attempt to land. Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic. The crash is the second deadly civil aviation accident linked to fighting in Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed with a Russian surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people aboard, as it flew over the area in eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014. Russia has denied responsibility, but a Dutch court in 2022 convicted two Russians and a pro-Russia Ukrainian man for their role in downing the plane with an air defense system brought into Ukraine from a Russian military base. ___ Associated Press writer Aida Sultanova in London contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-azerbaijans-president-says-crashed-jetliner-was-shot-down-by-russia-albeit-not-intentionally/	2024-12-29T06:01:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/677156d2db4507.14999544.jpeg?w=900
Plane burst into flames after skidding off runway at an airport i...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A plane burst into flames after veering off a runway at an airport in South Korea on Sunday, killing at least 28 people on board, emergency officials said. The fire engulfed the aircraft carrying 181 people when it skidded off the runway just after landing and struck a barrier. The country's emergency office said its landing gear appeared to have malfunctioned. Footage of the crash aired by YTN television showed the Jeju Air plane skidding across the airstrip, apparently with its landing gear still closed, and colliding head-on with a concrete wall on the outskirts of the facility. The transport ministry said the incident happened at 9:03 a.m. local time. The National Fire Agency said the fire was almost put out but officials were still trying to pull people from the Jeju Air passenger plane at the airport in the southern town of Muan. At least 28 people had died in the fire, the agency said. Emergency workers pulled out two people — one passenger and one crew member. It said it deployed 32 fire trucks and several helicopters to contain the fire. Emergency officials said they were examining the cause of the fire. Local TV stations aired footage showing thick pillows of black smoke billowing from the plane engulfed with flame. The incident came as South Korea is embroiled into a huge political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment. Last Friday, South Korean lawmakers impeached acting President Han Duck-soo and suspended his duties, making Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok to take over. Choi ordered officials to employ all available resources to rescue the passengers and crew, according to Yonhap news agency. Yoon’s office said his chief secretary, Chung Jin-suk, will preside over an emergency meeting between senior presidential staff later on Sunday to discuss the crash.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-south-korean-media-report-28-people-dead-after-a-plane-catches-fire-at-an-airport/	2024-12-28T18:26:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6770b3eaae0256.64581136.jpeg?w=900
UnitedHealthcare taught us ways to deny claims: Former employee	(NewsNation) — A former UnitedHealthcare claims representative says employees were systematically trained to deny medical claims and rush distressed customers off phone lines, revealing internal practices at the nation's largest health insurer amid growing scrutiny of the industry. Natalie Collins, who worked for UnitedHealthcare for nine months, said Saturday on 'NewsNation Prime' that staff received 'so many different ways to deny' claims during their two to three months of training, with supervisors often standing behind representatives instructing them on denial methods. 'We weren't given proper instruction to actually pay the claim, and there wasn't enough monies in certain files in certain companies to pay medical claims,' Collins said. 'We would have to just get the client off the phone as fast as we could.' Health insurance ‘delay tactic’ is too common: Former Cigna executive Collins described crying at her desk while handling calls from desperate patients, as supervisors laughed. Collins, now the owner of 'Mother's Keeper Doula,' quit her position after attempting to approve payment for a widowed mother of five whose husband died of pancreatic cancer, saying supervisors had instructed her to deny the hospice claim and get the caller 'off our phone line.' 'They just wouldn't allow me to submit the claim. There would be alerts on each claim telling us that either we had to put it back in our queue and it would just go to someone else, 30 days later, 60 days later,' Collins said. Luigi Mangione pleads not guilty to state murder Collins' experience comes after accused UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to murder and terror charges in New York State Court. Public support for Mangione has grown, with his legal defense fund reaching $250,000 in donations. Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting 'It's all about your employer and who they are negotiating with to get their employees the best health coverage,' Collins said when asked what she wanted the public to know. A recent poll found that about seven in 10 adults believe insurance company denials and profits bear at least moderate responsibility for CEO Brian Thompson's death. Collins said that while she understands public anger, she condemns violence. 'We the people are sick and tired,' Collins said. 'I don't believe anyone should die ... but people are angry. People have reasons to be very angry, and I feel that to my bones. I've seen it, I lived it, I processed them and I denied them.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/unitedhealthcare-ways-deny-claims-former-employee/	2024-12-28T18:07:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/B6E2BB6B39BF576D8A806AAA0CC58447.jpg?w=900
Trump weighs in on H-1B debate, backs immigration visas	President-elect Trump backed immigration visas for highly-skilled workers as the program has been in the spotlight after Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy faced backlash within the Republican leader's base for signaling their support for the H-1B work visa, which has been criticized as too complicated and susceptible to abuse. 'I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,' Trump said in a phone interview with The New York Post published Saturday. 'I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,' he added, as reported by the NY Post. Trump's support for the program comes as two of his key allies set to run the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk and Ramaswamy, have faced heightened scrutiny on Musk's social platform X from some in the GOP, including far-right activist Laura Loomer and other hard-line anti-immigration Republicans. More battles over transgender rights await Supreme Court The dispute further escalated late Friday night after Musk pledged to 'go to war' over the issue in a post on X. 'The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,' he wrote in the post. 'I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,' he added. The debate appeared to originate from a suggestion last month from Sriram Krishnan, Trump’s pick for White House policy adviser on artificial intelligence, that Musk examine removing caps on green cards for skilled immigrants. Krishnan’s comments resurfaced in recent days after he was appointed by Trump to serve in his incoming administration. The dispute also comes as the Biden administration announced a rule earlier this month clarifying who can apply for the visas, which followed years of lobbying for a more streamlined H-1B process. Some democratic lawmakers previously called on the Biden administration to address gaps in the immigration system to prepare for the incoming Trump administration’s expected crackdown on immigration.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-weighs-in-on-h-1b-debate-backs-immigration-visas/	2024-12-28T14:35:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24308063014128-e1734698903451.jpg?w=900
Trump applauds blocked sale of Texas border wall materials	President-elect Trump celebrated the blocked sale of border wall materials following a Friday ruling from a federal judge in Texas. The incoming president, in a Saturday Truth Social post, called the ruling a 'major, crucial WIN for America,' calling out President Biden and 'his cronies' for seeking to stall the construction of the border wall, which was a central piece of Trump's first administration. 'The Judge has also ordered an investigation into the illegal selling of the materials, which will expose just how corrupt and anti-American Radical Democrats are,' he added. The effort, led in part by the state’s Attorney General Ken Paxton, began amid reports the Biden administration was selling the parts. Last week, Trump asked a Texas court to intervene. Trump weighs in on H-1B debate, backs immigration visas But Congress required the Biden administration to dispose of the materials. The measure, included in the National Defense Authorization Act, allows the sale of items if they are used to repair existing barriers and not install new ones. Friday's ruling prohibits the sale of any materials intended for border wall, which Trump says he is 'going to rebuild in order to protect our Country from violent migrant crime, fentanyl smuggling, sex trafficking, terror attacks, and other heinous, Nation ending disasters,' over the next 30 days. Trump first suggested a structure be erected along the United States to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the country during his first campaign for the presidency. Although Trump campaigned on the notion that Mexico would fund the wall, the neighboring country never cut a formal check for the partition. At the end of Trump's first term, 694 miles of primary barriers were put in place, according to U.S. Customs and Border patrol. More battles over transgender rights await Supreme Court Texas, per the ruling, is also entitled to documentation that proves that the Biden administration has not disposed of border wall materials, which would violate an injunction from Paxton earlier this year that required the Biden Administration to spend statutorily obligated funds on building the wall. 'This follows our major victory forcing Biden to build the wall, and we will hold his Administration accountable for illegally subverting our Nation’s border security until their very last day in power, especially where their actions are clearly motivated by a desire to thwart President-elect Trump’s immigration agenda,' Paxton wrote in the release. Republicans made border security a prominent theme in the 2024 election cycle which helped propel the party to victory, gaining a trifecta in Washington. Trump has promised to carry out the largest deportation in the country’s history and hammer down ambitious immigration policies when he returns to office, with the help of 'border czar' Tom Homan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-applauds-blocked-sale-of-texas-border-wall-materials/	2024-12-28T14:32:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/TrumpDonald_MaraLago2_121624_APPhotoEvan-Vucci_e09620.jpg?w=900

Trump asks Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban so he can 'negotiate...	President-elect Trump asked the Supreme Court to delay the deadline for a potential TikTok ban, which is slated for the day before his inauguration. The court has agreed to hear TikTok’s challenge to the potential ban on an expedited schedule, but Trump told the justices that delaying the law until he returns to the White House could obviate the need for the court to weigh in. 'President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns,' wrote D. John Sauer, one of Trump’s personal appellate attorneys. Sauer is Trump’s nominee for U.S. solicitor general, which would have him take over managing the government’s defense of the ban from the Biden administration. 'In light of these interests—including, most importantly, his overarching responsibility for the United States’ national security and foreign policy—President Trump opposes banning TikTok in the United States at this juncture, and seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office,' Sauer wrote. During the campaign, Trump voiced opposition to the law, which requires TikTok’s China-based parent company to divest from the app or face a ban by Jan. 19, and vowed to 'save TikTok.' However, the president-elect has offered few details about his plans to protect the app since winning the election. TikTok has noted the president-elect's sympathies in its legal arguments, suggesting the trajectory could change once he takes office. The new brief repeatedly touts Trump’s unique interest, calling him 'one of the most powerful, prolific, and influential users of social media in history' and noting his social media platform, Truth Social. 'Indeed, President Trump’s first Term was highlighted by a series of policy triumphs achieved through historic deals, and he has a great prospect of success in this latest national security and foreign policy endeavor,' Sauer wrote. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on Jan. 10 on TikTok’s First Amendment challenge to the new law, giving the justices an opportunity to weigh in before the ban potentially goes into effect. Trump said he takes no position on the merits of the First Amendment issue but called it a 'historically challenging' question.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-asks-supreme-court-to-delay-tiktok-ban-so-he-can-negotiate-a-resolution-to-save-the-platform/	2024-12-27T15:58:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Top-Trump_122224_AP_Rick-Scuteri.jpg?w=900
Border czar vows to 'target' Tren de Aragua gang	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump’s new border czar, Tom Homan, tells NewsNation’s Ali Bradley criminal gangs like Tren de Aragua will be his 'priority target,' and he will root them out once he takes office. 'We've been saying from Day 1 that the priority right out of the gate is public safety threats and national security threats. Tren de Aragua is a public safety threat,' Homan said. 'They have proven that they're in at least 16 states across this country, and they'll be a priority.' Tren de Aragua is a gang that started in a prison in the Venezuelan state of Aragua nearly a decade ago. It’s since expanded into what the Justice Department calls a 'transnational criminal organization.' The gang has spread to 16 U.S. states, according to a New York Post report citing an internal Department of Homeland Security memo. The Venezuelan gang is the fastest-growing transnational criminal organization, in part because the U.S. government cannot track criminal records in Venezuela. As such, members of the gang are more easily able to blend in with law-abiding migrants. What is the Tren de Aragua gang, linked to several crimes in US? In Colorado, Aurora police have acknowledged that 'components of Tren de Aragua' are operating in the area and have identified at least 10 known members. Homan vowed to 'remove them' and says he’s been working with state and law enforcement to monitor the gang’s activity. 'We'll be attacking Tren de Aragua right where they operate, where they live, and we're going to put them in detention,' he said. For the gang members who are applying for asylum, Homan said he will be putting on strict conditions of release. 'Participating in gang activity is a violation of conditions of release, so at a minimum, we want to take them back into custody,' he said. Tren de Aragua gang member arrested in El Paso Homan blamed President Joe Biden’s border policies as the reason why the U.S. hasn't been able to force Venezuela to take the gang members back, but that will all change under Trump, he said. 'Starting January 20, we'll have a very strong America-first president who's going to negotiate, if he needs to negotiate, or simply make these countries do what they should do,' Homan said. 'In the small chance they won't take them back, then we'll send them to other countries,' he said, adding that he is already in talks with several countries willing to take the gang members.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/border-czar-vows-to-target-tren-de-aragua-gang/	2024-12-27T15:45:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Gateway-hotel.png?w=900
Requiring federal workers to return to office will be hard: Comer	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump has warned federal employees who have been working on a remote basis that if they want to keep their jobs, they will need to return to their given office spaces. However, forcing government employees back into the office may not be as easy as threatening them with termination, a Republican lawmaker tells NewsNation. U.S. Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., said he anticipates that as the newly formed Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE) prepares to tackle government waste, a downsizing of the federal workforce may be required. Trump’s campaign promise to force federal workers back to the office comes at a time when 17 of the 24 federal office buildings in Washington are at 25% capacity or less, according to a report released by the Government Accountability Office in the fall of 2023. Trump ‘border czar’ says he will override sanctuary city roadblocks The study found that the government spends an estimated $2 billion per year maintaining the office space and an additional $5 billion per year to lease it. However, as Trump pushes to force workers back into the office, Comer, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, told NewsNation that many government employee contracts include clauses that allow for remote work on a hybrid or full-time basis. Trump said earlier this month that he plans to do away with a waiver that he said President Joe Biden provided federal employees to work from home. He said that if needed, his administration would fight the waiver in court to force workers back to the office. 'If people don't want to come back to work, come back into the office, they're going to be dismissed,' Trump said. Comer told NewsNation that enforcing such a threat won't come without a legal challenge from the unions representing federal employees. More Americans say they need a break from political news: Survey 'This will probably head to court. But in the court of public opinion, I think the people that work hard every day and have to go to work and pay taxes, I don't think they're very happy with the fact that such a high percentage of the federal workforce is working from home,' Comer told NewsNation. 'And they're not held accountable like the employees who work for the federal government, who have to go to the office every day.' Although the government is spending billions each year on physical office space, experts maintain that the solution DOGE is seeking doesn't come by filling government-leased buildings with federal employees. Comey told NewsNation that in addition to closing down excessive federal offices, more attention needs to be paid to the workforce itself. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have been tasked with heading up DOGE, have suggested that they would like to eliminate 25% of the federal workforce. However, Comer, who believes employees are more responsive and efficient in the office than they are from home, says that rather than eliminating jobs, the priority should be determining what government employees actually do. The New York Times reported that of the 2.3 million civilian workers working for the government in May, 1.1 million were eligible for telework, and about 228,000 were eligible for entirely remote work. 'Some of them haven't been seen since prior to COVID,' Comer said. 'We've got to bring them back, and I would like for every employee to have to explain to some competent person exactly what their job entails and what their day looks like working from home.' As DOGE prepares to get to work, Comer said that federal officials need to find a balance when it comes to what the work environment for many of these government employees looks like. 'The bottom line is, we have too many federal employees, the taxpayers cannot continue to pay them good federal benefits: the long-term pensions, the long-term health insurance, in addition to the just the everyday payroll,' Comer told NewsNation. 'The taxpayers cannot put this burden anymore, and we're going to have to get more efficient.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/federal-rto-fight-comer/	2024-12-27T12:20:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Congress-Comer_061124_AP_J.-Scott-Applewhite.jpg?w=900
First severe human bird flu case shows mutations: CDC	LOS ANGELES (NewsNation) — New research shows that the highly contagious bird flu, found in the nation's first severe human case, shows signs of a rare mutation, amid growing concern over pets contracting the disease. A genetic analysis suggests the bird flu virus mutated inside a Louisiana patient who contracted the first severe case of the illness in the United States. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the finding this week. Meanwhile, at least three house cat deaths linked to bird flu have been reported this month — two in Los Angeles County, California, and one in Oregon. Health experts are urging pet owners to be cautious about raw foods and limit their pets' exposure to wildlife. Cats can get sick with bird flu. Here’s how to protect them Bird flu linked to cats' deaths In Oregon, health officials reported a house cat contracted H5N1 after eating Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food. The Portland-based company has issued a voluntary recall for the affected product. Earlier this month, two house cats in L.A. County died after consuming raw milk linked to a statewide recall due to infected dairy herds. Bird flu has been detected on farms in at least 16 states, with hundreds of herds now under quarantine. In Washington state, 20 big cats, including a tiger, died from bird flu in just the past month, according to the facility's director. Experts advise watching for symptoms of bird flu in pets, including nasal or oral discharge, labored breathing, and neurological issues. US processed food, dyes are ‘unethical’: ‘The Food Babe’ How concerned should Americans be? While dozens of human cases have been reported in several states, including California, Oregon, and Washington, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency over bird flu to allocate resources and focus on containment on farms. The majority of bird flu cases in humans have occurred among farm workers exposed to poultry or cattle, with mild symptoms and full recovery. However, an elderly man in Louisiana remains hospitalized with the only severe case reported in the U.S. Scientists believe the mutations may allow the virus to better bind to receptors in the upper airways of humans. Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher, likened this to a lock and key. The virus needs a key that turns a lock to enter a cell. Though the virus may be changing to have a key that might work, Osterholm says it doesn't mean the world is closer to seeing a readily transmitted virus between people.

Man charged in fatal burning of woman on NYC subway to be in cour...	(NewsNation) — The man charged in the killing of a woman who was burned alive as she slept on a New York City subway train is due in court Friday. As Sebastian Zapeta-Calil is set to appear before a grand jury, there are still more questions than answers about the victim in this case. The New York Police Department is still trying to figure out the woman's identity. Authorities say Zapeta-Calil approached the woman on the subway and lit her clothing on fire. Zapeta-Calil then fanned the flames using a shirt, prosecutors said. Tiny homes at risk of being stolen: Report The 33-year-old from Guatemala was arraigned on murder and arson charges Tuesday. In court, he stood before the judge in a white jumpsuit and black hoodie. Zapeta-Calil did not speak and was surrounded by a dozen NYPD officers the entire time. The crime was caught on camera. Body-worn cameras on responding officers caught the suspect's face and his image was blasted on social media. Three teenagers in a different part of the city recognized him and called the police. Video footage shows an NYPD patrolman passing the scene casually. At one point, someone appears with a blanket to fan the flames, while another person is filming. At the time of the incident, Zapeta-Calil was living at a homeless shelter that provides outpatient services for substance abuse and mental health. A source close to the investigation tells NewsNation that Zapeta-Calil's attorney wanted his client to have a psychiatric evaluation, possibly setting the stage for an insanity defense. Federal immigration officials said Zapeta-Calil entered the U.S. illegally. He has been jailed at New York City's Rikers Island complex.

Trump 'border czar' says he will override sanctuary city roadbloc...	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's incoming 'border czar' told NewsNation the administration will aggressively enforce immigration laws in sanctuary cities and may seek prosecution of officials who 'knowingly harbor' undocumented immigrants. 'Sanctuary jurisdictions aren't going to stop what we're going to do,' Tom Homan said in a NewsNation interview Thursday. 'If they don't want to protect their communities, then the Trump administration will.' Homan said immigration officers would focus on 'public safety threats' and emphasized that sanctuary jurisdictions could face legal consequences if they actively interfere with federal enforcement efforts. No ‘price tag’ for mass deportations, says incoming border czar 'They can stand by and watch us do it, but they cannot impede us,' Homan said. 'They cannot knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal from ICE. Those are crimes.' He warned that forcing immigration agents to make arrests in communities rather than jails would likely result in more 'collateral arrests' of undocumented immigrants who are not primary targets. Regarding sensitive locations such as churches and hospitals traditionally considered off-limits to immigration enforcement, Homan indicated the policy is under review. He said there are already exceptions for 'significant public safety threats' or national security issues. Homan dismissed sanctuary city officials' claims that their policies help protect crime victims and witnesses, calling it 'a stone-cold lie.' 'The victims and witnesses of crime certainly don't want the bad guy released back into their neighborhood,' he said. Republican strategist Katie Frost said that given the crisis along the U.S. southern border, 'all options need to be on the table' when it comes to enforcement. 'We have to do whatever is necessary to find people who broke our laws, came into this country illegally and have overstayed their visas, ' Frost told NewsNation. Russia suspected in Azerbaijan Airlines crash; black boxes recovered Frost pointed to the case of the woman who was set on fire on a New York City subway by a man that police said entered the U.S. illegally. She said that the question that has to be answered is, 'When is enough be enough?' Frost said that one of the reasons Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in November was because Americans are sick of how the Biden administration has handled securing the southern border. However, Democratic strategist David Carlucci, says that the details of how the incoming Trump administration handles mass deportations become a critical part of the issue. Carlucci told NewsNation that based on what he has heard from Homan, the 'border czar' does not have a concrete plan for carrying out mass deportations. Instead, Carlucci believes Homan just going to try to catch illegal immigrants. He said Homan needs to specify how he plans to carry out zeroing in on convicted criminals who entered the country illegally as he proposed when he first announced mass deportations. Homan said that if illegal immigrants who do not have criminal convictions are found with those who do, they run the risk of being arrested. Carlucci said that could have dangerous ramifications. 'Is this going to be some sort of government state where we'll all be questioned and audited for harboring illegal immigrants?' Carlucci said. 'At what ends do we go to? The incoming Trump administration should be working with local officials instead of trying to make some sort of scapegoat.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/tom-homan-override-sanctuary-city-roadblocks/	2024-12-27T05:10:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/videoframe_2526.png?w=800
Average mortgage rates close 2024 at the highest since July	(NewsNation) — Average mortgage rates will end the year on a high note — financially. This week, the housing market saw its highest 30-year mortgage rate since July at 6.85%, according to data from Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. That's up from last week and up from 6.61% during the same time last year. 'While a slight improvement in new and existing home sales is encouraging, the market remains plagued by an overwhelming undersupply of homes,' said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, in a news release. 'A strong economy can help build momentum heading into the new year and potentially boost purchase activity.' Tiny homes at risk of being stolen: Report The 15-year mortgage rates also climbed from 5.92% last week to 6% this week. These mortgage rates come after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week. Now, market players are looking to see how next year plays out with President-elect Donald Trump's policy initiatives and how they will impact inflation, and in turn, mortgage rates.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/average-mortgage-rates-increased-december-2024/	2024-12-27T04:20:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673f4ed67b4342.65100526.jpeg?w=900
Jackpot for Mega Millions over $1 billion after no numbers match ...	Hang onto those stocking-stuffer lottery tickets. The Mega Millions jackpot has surpassed $1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers drawn on Christmas Eve. That means the estimated jackpot for Friday's drawing is $1.15 billion, potentially the fifth-largest jackpot in the game's history. 'We know that many people will likely receive tickets to Friday’s drawing as holiday gifts, and what a gift that would turn out to be if you ended up with a ticket worth a $1.15 billion jackpot,' Joshua Johnston, lead director for the Mega Millions Consortium said in a Wednesday statement. The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are 1 in 302,575,350, while the odds of winning any Mega Millions prize are 1 in 24, according to lottery officials. Tickets for the game are sold in 45 states, along with Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Mega Millions tickets are $2 a piece. Half of the proceeds from the sale of each ticket remains in the state where the ticket was sold. Drawings are held at 11 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesdays and Fridays. 'I can’t think of a better way to celebrate the holidays – whether Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, the Winter Solstice, or any other way people choose to celebrate the season – than by helping fulfill the dreams that come with a prize like this and prizes that will be won at all levels of the game,' Johnston said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/mega-millions-jackpot-1-billion-no-christmas-eve-wins/	2024-12-27T03:03:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-1297834427-1-3.jpg?w=900
NewsNation kept a wide lens on the border crisis in 2024	(NewsNation) — One of the most important issues to Americans on both sides of the aisle has been the ongoing immigration crisis, and NewsNation has been there every step of the way in 2024, highlighting not only the plight of migrants coming to the U.S. but the challenges this posed to Border Patrol and state officials. Over the last four years, the U.S. has seen the largest immigration surge in history, averaging more than 2 million migrants a year from all around the world in search of the American dream. 2024 began with more controversial moves by GOP Texas Governor Greg Abbott to relieve some of the burden placed on cities in his state by transporting migrants to sanctuary cities like Washington, DC, New York, Chicago and Denver. The standoff between state and federal reach on immigration continued in the courts, where NewsNation covered several lawsuits between the two. The Justice Department sued Texas, claiming the state's new immigration law violated the Constitution. Who is Trump’s new border czar Tom Homan? A federal judge blocked that law, but the state would ultimately be the victor and start arresting on the state level for criminal trespass. This also came as the Biden administration was told by the Supreme Court that it could take down razor wire installed by Texas that was meant to keep migrants out. The situation reached a fever pitch in March when more than 400 migrants tore down razor fencing during a riot on the border town of El Paso. Several Texas National Guard members were injured, and roughly 200 migrants were arrested. Drones, wire walls, buoys and pepper balls were all utilized by border control to fight illegal entry. But it wasn’t always effective. NewsNation was there to capture exclusive video of smugglers destroying barbed wire fencing to get migrants across the border. The fight to control the border was made harder by the cartel. Crime exploded as groups of masked gunmen kidnapped migrants, participated in human trafficking and transported guns and drugs across the border, including deadly fentanyl. NewsNation exclusively uncovered the amazing story of a teen who barely escaped capture by the cartel. The violence played out in U.S. border towns before moving north. NewsNation closely followed a brutal attack on New York police officers by a group of migrants with a notorious Venezuelan gang. ‘High volume’ scanning system going up at Texas border crossing NewsNation got an exclusive look into the dangers border agents face hunting down migrant smugglers. A ride-along showed how Border Patrol agents are tackling the trafficking of illicit drugs in El Centro, California, which has become a drug smuggling hotspot. The network closely reported on the murder of a 22-year-old nursing student, Laken Riley, who was killed while jogging on the university’s campus by Jose Ibarra, who entered the U.S. illegally in September 2022. The team followed the highly emotional trial and eventual conviction of Ibarra, which brought even more attention to the debate over border laws. NewsNation was there as the 'take our border back convoys, also known as 'God's Army,' made their way to the southern border stopping in Virginia, Florida and Louisiana, before arriving at Texas to raise awareness about the crisis on the border.' President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to take a zero-tolerance approach to the border when he comes into office next year, and NewsNation will continue its pledge to cover this ongoing crisis.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/newsnation-border-recap-2024/	2024-12-26T14:26:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/GettyImages-2149335672.jpg?w=900
JonBenét Ramsey’s father to meet with police, urge new DNA tech	(NewsNation) — The Boulder Police Department says it plans to use new DNA technology in hopes of solving the killing of 6-year-old JonBenét Ramsey in 1996. Ramsey’s body was found 28 years ago in her family’s Boulder home. Now, her father is planning to meet once again with local police to discuss new DNA testing technology that may hopefully fill in the forensic gaps and bring closure to the Ramsey family. 'They have the ability to separate DNA — mixed DNA samples, which is one of the issues with the sample they got in 1997. They had an unidentified male DNA sample in early 1997, and it was mixed, apparently with JonBenét’s blood,' JonBenét’s father, John Bennett Ramsey, told NewsNation in November. 'That DNA can now, technology-wise, be separated. They have the ability to do familial genealogy research, which has been wildly successful in solving old cold cases. That's what we're asking the police to do.' Teen actor from ‘Baby Driver’ dies after falling from moving vehicle He says he is expected to meet with the Boulder police chief in January alongside representatives from a leading DNA lab to push for the new approach. Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn says the department remains committed to finding JonBenét Ramsey’s killer and that the department has already taken significant steps to modernize its investigation. In a video statement released in November, Boulder police said they were working with forensic experts to find the latest advancements in DNA technology and recently digitized all of their case evidence. They hope to use those thousands of files to create a searchable database that could reveal new leads. The department has also taken inventory of more than 2,500 pieces of evidence and reviewed 40,000 reports in the last year alone.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jonbenet-ramseys-father-dna-tech/	2024-12-26T13:42:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/09/snapshot-2023-09-28T220700.744.jpg?w=814
No ‘price tag’ for mass deportations, says incoming border czar	(NewsNation) — Incoming Trump administration border czar Tom Homan tells NewsNation's Ali Bradley there is no 'price tag' for the mass deportations planned by the incoming administration, citing 'national security' concerns. 'What price do you put on national security? I don't think it has a price tag,' Homan said. 'What price do you put on the thousands of American moms and dads who buried their children? You want to talk about family separation; they buried their children because their children were murdered by illegal aliens that weren't supposed to be here. I don't put a price on that. I don't put a price on national security. I don't put a price on American lives.' Homan further defended the mass deportations’ $86 billion price tag, saying it would save American taxpayers money in the future. Trump criticizes Trudeau, Panama, Biden commutations on Truth Social 'This operation would be expensive,' he acknowledged. 'However, it’s going to save taxpayers a lot of money in the long run. Right now, we’re spending billions of dollars on free airline tickets, free hotel rooms, free medical care, free meals, the education system.' Homan, however, said they will also need help from Congress. 'We need more resources; we need funding. We obviously need to buy more detention beds because everybody we arrest, we have to detain to work on those removal efforts and get travel documents, get flight arrangements. So we need more detention beds,' said Homan. Homan said the Trump administration doesn’t plan on separating families but rather deporting them together. He said the administration is looking into using halfway houses to hold U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants. Which members of Congress have the worst attendance record? 'As far as U.S. children, that's going to be a difficult situation because we're not going to change your U.S. citizenship,' he said. 'Which means they’re going to be put in a halfway house or they can stay at home and wait for the officers to get the travel arrangements and come back and get the family. You know the best thing to do for a family is to self-deport themselves.' Homan also targeted birthright citizenship, saying having a child who is a U.S. citizen does not make undocumented immigrants 'immune from our laws.' 'We can't send that message,' he said. 'Because if we do, you're never going to solve the border crisis.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/deportation-price-tag-tom-homan/	2024-12-26T12:15:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/snapshot-13.jpg?w=900
US officials: Russia behind Azerbaijan plane crash, early indicat...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — U.S. officials tell NewsNation evidence indicates Russian air defenses downed the Azerbaijan Airlines plane that crashed in Kazakhstan on Wednesday, killing 38 of the 67 people on board. The passenger jet flying from Azerbaijan to Russia crashed while trying to make an emergency near Aktau. The flight had been en route from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia, but was diverted due to fog. The U.S. officials added that if the preliminary information proves to be true, it would further underscore Russian recklessness in its invasion of Ukraine. Which members of Congress have the worst attendance record? The Russian government on Thursday warned against spreading 'hypotheses' about the cause of the crash. 'The investigation is underway,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 'And until investigators make their conclusions, it would be incorrect to make any kind of hypothesis. So, we cannot do it and nobody should do it. We must await the end of this investigation.' Azerbaijan observed a nationwide day of mourning on Thursday. National flags were lowered across the country, traffic across the country stopped at noon, and signals were sounded from ships and trains. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that the weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/us-officials-russia-behind-azerbaijan-plane-crash-us-officials-say/	2024-12-26T11:02:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24360347887622.jpg?w=900
Biden grants clemency to BMF co-founder Terry 'Southwest T' Fleno...	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden has granted clemency to Terry 'Southwest T' Flenory, co-founder of the organization Black Mafia Family (BMF). Flenory was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2008 after prosecutors linked him and his brother, Demetrius 'Big Meech' Flenory, to an international drug trafficking operation, according to WXIA-TV. In 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, Terry Flenory was released from federal prison and ordered to serve the rest of his sentence on house arrest, WXYZ-TV reported. Which members of Congress have missed the most votes — and why? Terry Flenory celebrated the decision on Instagram, sharing a photo of his clemency affidavit and videos of him removing his house arrest device, writing, 'It’s been a journey, but prayer and unwavering faith beyond mere human comprehension got us to this point.' Demetrius Flenory has not yet been pardoned. However, in October, he was transferred to a residential reentry program in Miami to serve the remainder of his sentence. Known for their leadership in BMF, both Terry and Demetrius Felonry's stories have been widely covered in the media and are dramatized in the Starz series 'BMF.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/biden-grants-clemency-bmf-co-founder-terry-southwest-t-flenory/	2024-12-26T08:16:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2186740159.jpg?w=900
Which members of Congress have the worst attendance record?	(NewsNation) — After U.S. Rep. Kay Granger’s five-month absence from Congress came to light, some Americans are left wondering if their elected officials are doing their jobs or if they are missing critical votes. As the 81-year-old is in a retirement facility dealing with dementia-related issues, other members of Congress have been chronically absent from Capitol Hill, too. NewsNation's Tom Dempsey reviewed data from govtrack.us, a congressional watchdog site, and found Granger isn't even the most absent member of Congress this year. Matt Gaetz ethics report: Rep. Ivey says ‘public deserves to know’ Arizona Democrat Rep. Raúl Grijalva missed 455 votes, roughly 88% of the House votes taken this year, as he battled cancer. The 76-year-old was reelected in November and has said his upcoming term will be his last. Pennsylvania Democrat Rep. Dwight Evans is the second most absent member of Congress, having missed nearly 63% of votes after suffering a stroke in May. He also won reelection in November after running unopposed. By comparison, Granger ranks third on this list, missing 54% of the votes. Coming in fourth is Minnesota Democrat Rep. Dean Phillips, who missed 149 votes this year, most of which were during his failed effort to run against President Biden in the primaries. Trump announces ambassador to Panama amid fight over canal On the other side of Congress, Vice President-elect JD Vance missed the most votes in the Senate, most of which were after being tapped as President-elect Donald Trump's running mate. Retiring West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin ranked second, having skipped 90 votes in the Senate this year. He's followed by a fellow outgoing senator, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who missed 73 votes this year, and Indiana Republican Sen.

Trump criticizes Trudeau, Panama, Biden commutations on Truth Soc...	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump made more than 30 posts on his social media platform Truth Social in the span of 1 hour on Christmas. Among the posts Trump made on Tuesday was one announcing his pick for U.S. Ambassador to Panama, though he criticized the country itself. 'Kevin Marino Cabrera will serve as the United States Ambassador to the Republic of Panama, a country that is ripping us off on the Panama Canal, far beyond their wildest dreams,' Trump wrote. This echoes comments the Republican made Sunday at the conservative conference 'AmericaFest,' where he said that the United States 'foolishly' ceded control of the canal to Panama, and suggested his administration would try to get it back. The president of San Jose, José Raúl Mulino rejected that notion as an affront to his country’s sovereignty. A million taxpayers will soon receive up to $1,400 from the IRS Along with revealing his new choice for his incoming administration, Trump used Truth Social to urge others to confirm his nominee for Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth and FBI director, Kash Patel. Both are facing criticism — Hegseth for sexual misconduct allegations and Patel for comments he's made about the 'Deep State' and other conspiracy theories. To Republican strategist Whitley Yates, the flurry of social media posts by the president-elect are 'very Trump.' 'He is someone who's consistently thinking about America, consistently on Truth Social talking about America,' Yates said on 'Morning in America' Wednesday. Democratic Strategist Brad Howard said although the 'meat' of the story is who Trump is nominating to be in his administration, he likes to throw other topics out there 'because he's really good at grabbing headlines and narratives and media attention.' 'It's working,' Howard said. 'But there are some troubling things here that he's proposing.' President-elect Donald Trump strongly defended cabinet nominees Pete Hegseth and Kash Patel in a flurry of Christmas Day Truth Social posts.

'If Canada was to become our 51st State, their taxes would be cut by more than 60%, their businesses would immediately double in size, and they would be militarily protected like no other Country anywhere in the World,' Trump wrote. He previously called making Canada the 51st state a 'great idea' in another Truth Social post as well. Instead of Trudeau, Trump suggested former professional hockey player Wayne Gretzky run for prime minister of Canada. Greenland, Trump added, is 'needed by the United States for National Security purposes.' Last week, Trump said the U.S. owning Greenland 'is an absolute necessity.' Múte Egede, Greenland’s prime minister, said in a statement that Greenland 'is not for sale and will never be for sale.' What is ‘walking pneumonia’? Trump slams Biden commutations Among his multiple posts on Tuesday were ones criticizing current President Joe Biden for commuting the death row sentences of 37 federal inmates to life in prison. 'I refuse to wish a merry Christmas to those lucky souls, but instead will say, go to hell,' Trump said. The White House announced Biden's commutations Monday. 'Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,' Biden said in a statement released for publication on Monday. 'But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President and now President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.' Throughout his time on the campaign trail for the 2024 election, Trump said his administration would not shy away from the death penalty. During the last six months of Trump’s first term, a record 13 federal inmates were put to death.

Year-end travel: What you need to know about post-holiday trips	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — Millions of Americans are traveling on Thursday as a record-breaking post-holiday rush continues. The Transportation Security Administration anticipates Friday to be one of the season's busiest days, with 40 million passengers projected to be screened on New Year's Day. AAA projects 119.3 million people will travel during the year-end holiday period, which runs through next Thursday. Here's what you can expect for holiday travel as the year comes to a close: 14K flights delayed since Monday: FlightAware Americans flying in the next few days are hoping to get to their destinations smoother than they did before Christmas. The flight-tracking website FlightAware reported some 14,000 flights into and out of the United States were delayed since Monday, with over 400 cancellations. As of Thursday morning, more than 570 flights into and out of the U.S. have been delayed and 21 have been canceled. Return your 2024 holiday gifts by these deadlines Winter weather from Boston to Baltimore may have given folks in the northeast a White Christmas, but it also contributed to Christmas Eve delays. American Airlines reports it's all hands on deck after Tuesday's technical glitch that grounded flights for over an hour. Over 40% of American flights were delayed Tuesday, according to FlightAware. What will be the busiest travel days? Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Dec. 20 and 21, followed by Dec. 26, Dec. 27, and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on New Year’s Day. The slowest U.S. air travel day this year — by a wide margin — was Thanksgiving Day. AAA: 107M driving through New Year's Day About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA. The 107 million people hitting the road is 2.5 million more than last year. Additionally, AAA expects nearly 4.5 million people to take buses and trains this year, up nearly 10 percent from last year. Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.05 a gallon, down from $3.08 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per kilowatt hour, but varies by state. Transportation data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation’s highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays. New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, the company said. Body found in wheel well of United Airlines flight from Chicago to Maui AAA recommends traveling early to avoid heavy traffic, as the peak driving times are in the afternoon and early evening. It also urges drivers to slow down and stay alert and refreshed behind the wheel. Planning ahead for 2025 Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But travel analysts suggest early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year’s trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.

Ex-NASA astronaut encounters mysterious flying orbs 9,000 ft. in ...	(NewsNation) — Two months before the recent wave of unexplained drones in New Jersey and other parts of the Northeast, a former NASA astronaut encountered mysterious metallic orbs while flying a private plane, he revealed in an interview with NewsNation's The Hill. Leroy Chiao, who was a commander on the International Space Station, had a near-collision with unidentified flying objects in the panhandle of Texas in August as he was flying from Colorado in a small airplane. 'I was about 9,000 feet (in the air), and suddenly, out of nowhere, these two big metallic spherical orbs, one on top of the other about three feet in diameter, each went zipping by the left side of my airplane right underneath about 20 feet away,' Chiao said. The unmanned aircraft was not on the Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control radar, Chiao said. Over a month later, the northeast drone mystery remains unsolved 'I got a good look at them only for a second, and it happened so quick, there wasn't even a chance to get scared, but it could have been a bad result if they had actually hit me,' he said. The former astronaut has flown several state space missions before, three of which lasted six months on the ISS. He said it's 'hard to believe' the government doesn't know what's going on with the drones that have been flying in New Jersey near U.S. military facilities. 'I think they could tell us what they know,' Chiao said. 'How could we have the best, most advanced military and technological capabilities in the world, and if they don't know? That's even more disconcerting.' Reports of drones began in mid-November, and residents and local officials have voiced their frustration over the lack of government transparency. 'To me, it seems like it's some kind of a military program,' Chiao said. 'It seems like it's way too widespread and organized to be some kind of prank unless somebody's got a lot of money to spend on that.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/nasa-astronaut-mysterious-flying-orbs/	2024-12-26T04:08:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-486714640.jpg?w=724
What is 'walking pneumonia'?	(NewsNation) — Cases of 'walking pneumonia' are rising for the first time since the start of the pandemic, with health providers reporting an increase in young children. Cases began climbing in the spring and peaked in late August, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Diagnoses appear to be rising the most among children, according to diagnosis data from March 31 through October 5, 2024. The percentage grew from 1% to 7.2% among children ages 2 to 4 years and from 3.6% to 7.4% among children ages 5 to 17 years, according to the CDC. The agency said the increase in babies and toddlers is notable because the infection is historically known to affect school-age more than younger children. Cases of ‘walking pneumonia’ are rising across the US 'We've seen a dramatic increase in illness and hospitalization due to Mycoplasma pneumonia,' said Dr. Mary Fairchok, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor at Mary Bridge Children's Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, told MedicalExpress. 'Adults can get Mycoplasma too, but it's really hitting the pediatric population.' What is 'walking pneumonia Walking pneumonia is a respiratory tract infection caused by the bacterium mycoplasma pneumoniae, according to the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. It is the common term for atypical or a mild form of pneumonia. Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes airways to swell, the air sacs in your lungs to fill with mucus and other fluids and a high fever and a cough with mucus, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The main differences between walking pneumonia and the more common pneumonia is that the former is milder and usually doesn’t require bed rest or hospitalization, the clinic stated. The highest rates of walking pneumonia generally occur in school-age children and teens, and people who have weakened immune systems or are recovering from another respiratory infection are at higher risk of severe infection. What are the symptoms of walking pneumonia? Symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, chest pain, cough and low-grade fever in adults. The infection doesn't tend to cause much nasal or sinus congestion in adults, the medical center stated. Walking pneumonia can feel like a bad cold or the flu. Children under 5 may experience symptoms other than a chest cold, including nasal congestion, sneezing, and watery eyes or gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting, according to the CDC. What is ‘walking pneumonia,’ and why are cases rising? The infection is highly contagious and spreads through droplets in the air through coughing and sneezing. It can take up to three to four weeks from the time someone was exposed to the germ to the time that they're feeling sick. Walking pneumonia may last from four to six weeks. A cough is usually the longest-lasting walking pneumonia symptom, according to the Cleveland Clinic. How to test for walking pneumonia? Medical professionals can test for walking pneumonia with a nose swab similar to the COVID-19 test, the Cleveland Clinic stated. They could also order chest X-rays to see if there’s an infection in the lungs. Providers can also do a blood test and send the sample to a laboratory to confirm the infection. How to treat walking pneumonia The infection, like most, can be treated with antibiotics. Hospitalization is generally rare with this infection. Most people can recover on their own, but over-the-counter medicine can help ease symptoms. Why are cases rising? The infection has risen to levels unseen since the pandemic. The reason why it dropped since 2020 is because of infection prevention measures that went into place, like social distancing and masking, reported Johns Hopkins. 'In North America, we began to detect M. pneumoniae more frequently on tests in 2024. Since the summer, the proportion of tests that are positive for M. pneumoniae has gone up and is still going up right now,' the organization stated.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/what-is-walking-pneumonia/	2024-12-25T17:41:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67198c0c4990a0.81738904.jpeg?w=900

Alleged shoplifters learn retail crime now a felony in California	(NewsNation) — Two alleged shoplifters figured out the hard way retail crime is now a felony in California under Proposition 36. California's Seal Beach Police shared video on social media of an exchange between two suspects sitting in the back of a squad car where one realizes repeat offenders of retail theft can now face felony charges. 'That’s a felony?' the female suspect asked, referring to retail theft. 'B----, new laws. Stealing is a felony,' the other replied, adding, 'And this is Orange County, b----. They don't play.' Californian voters crack down on crime, pass Proposition 36 Police captioned the post 'Remember folks, Don’t Steal in Seal,' and they said the 'new proposition only strengthens our commitment to combating Organized Retail Theft.' Police also released video surveillance from several locations, including a Kohl’s and an Ulta store, that the suspects visited. In the video, three women are seen carefully selecting and stealing nearly $2,000 worth of merchandise from the stores. They are also seen calmly walking out holding the allegedly stolen items. The social media post also includes bodycam video from when officers chase the suspects. California voters approved Proposition 36 in November, which made shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders and increased penalties for some drug charges. A felony conviction could mean jail time of up to three years. ‘Peek-a-boo’: California police catch alleged shoplifter hiding in car trunk The measure partly rolls back a progressive law passed by voters in 2014 that downgraded several nonviolent crimes to misdemeanors, including theft under $950 in value and some drug offenses. The reversal reflects widespread anger among voters who are increasingly pinning the blame for homelessness and retail theft on criminal justice reform and progressive district attorneys. California Governor Gavin Newsom had opposed Prop 36, claiming that it would disproportionately impact minority communities and worsen jail overcrowding, but the legislation was approved by nearly 70% of California voters. Business owners have expressed their support for the new law but say they are waiting to see how it plays out in the legal system. The Associated Press contributed to this story.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/alleged-shoplifters-california-felony/	2024-12-25T14:09:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66ff69f3adfc44.51935877.jpeg?w=900
NewsNation became the voice for all Americans in 2024	(NewsNation) — NewsNation became the voice for all Americans in 2024 by focusing on the people behind the stories, taking on the issues that matter and bringing together all perspectives. Through town halls and in-depth reporting, NewsNation met communities where they are across the country. In 2024, NewsNation focused on the value of learning trades, as opposed to attending a four-year college or university, alongside 'Dirty Jobs' host Mike Rowe. One American shared his journey during a NewsNation town hall in April, saying he left college after realizing the pride of learning a trade like his forefathers. CUOMO Special Edition: Trading Up with Mike Rowe 'My whole heritage has been based on working a skill, having trades,' Micheal Gamez told Rowe and NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. 'That means a lot to me. Those are my heroes; my grandfather does that, and my dad does that, so I just said, ‘You know what? Now I'm out.' ... It is the land of the brave, and I got to be able to go out there and be brave enough to show that pride.' NewsNation continued to put into focus brewing issues at the border, highlighting not only the plight of migrants coming to the U.S. but the challenges this posed to border patrol and state officials. NewsNation took a ride with law enforcement officials at the U.S.-Mexico border, capturing four encounters on camera during one hour of live coverage. During the 'Dan Abrams Live' special episode, NewsNation reporters fanned out nationwide, reporting live on the border crisis and its impact on communities, education and crime rates. Teams used night-vision technology and a specially outfitted NewsNation border truck. 'It's not going to be about the finger-pointing,' NewsNation’s Dan Abrams told viewers as he covered the southern border. The stories we bring will 'hopefully make us all a little bit more informed about what is actually happening at our southern border, and maybe maybe even spur some change.' Hurricane Helene victims vow to rebuild and return NewsNation remained committed to covering two devastating hurricanes: Helene and Milton. The team spoke to those who lost almost everything and the struggles they still face to rebuild. During a crucial election year, NewsNation brought important voices together to have conversations on the issues that mattered to Americans and to agree and disagree with civility. Commentators Bill O'Reilly and Stephen A Smith joined Cuomo in a town hall along with Mark Cuban, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Sarah Palin, Rep. Ro Khanna, UFC President Dana White and Geraldo Rivera to discuss a slew of topics. Vice-president elect JD Vance also joined Cuomo in another town hall where voters could ask questions through social media and engage with the then-candidate. No matter what side of the aisle Americans fell on, their voice mattered at NewsNation in 2024.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/newsnation-voice-americans-2024/	2024-12-25T11:45:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/town-hall-wide-shot.jpg?w=800
