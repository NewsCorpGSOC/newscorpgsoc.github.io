New York judge delays Trump hush money sentencing	President-elect Trump’s sentencing in his New York criminal case will not go forward as planned next week as his attorneys push to dismiss the prosecution following his election victory. Judge Juan Merchan, who oversees the trial proceedings, announced the adjournment in a letter Friday. The judge halted the case to accept additional written briefing on Trump’s argument that his return to the White House compels the court to toss his 34-count felony conviction entirely. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) is opposing that request. Instead, Bragg floated that Merchan could freeze the proceedings while Trump is in office, meaning the conviction would remain on the books but sentencing wouldn’t occur until 2029, at the earliest. Merchan ordered Trump to file his formal motion asking for dismissal by Dec. 2 and Bragg to respond by Dec. 9. The judge will then decide how to proceed. Though both sides agreed to delay the sentencing, the new schedule aligns with Bragg’s request. Trump had asked for a slower timeline that would push the dismissal battle closer to his inauguration. The Hill has reached out to the district attorney's office for comment. Steven Cheung, Trump's campaign spokesperson and incoming White House communications director, called the ruling a 'decisive win' for the former and future president. 'President Trump won a landslide victory as the American People have issued a mandate to return him to office and dispose of all remnants of the Witch Hunt cases,' he said. 'All of the sham lawfare attacks against President Trump are now destroyed and we are focused on Making America Great Again.' The former president’s criminal defense strategy long rested on delaying until after the election. Trump successfully staved off trial in his other three criminal prosecutions, and in the only case that did reach a verdict, the New York hush money case, he successfully pushed the sentencing until after voters headed to the ballot box. The jury’s verdict made Trump the first former U.S. president convicted of a felony. When he returns to the White House, he would become the first person to assume the nation’s highest office with such a criminal record — if the conviction stands. With his White House victory secured, Trump’s team now believes his criminal cases must be tossed. They have moved most aggressively to pull the plug on the hush money case, given that Trump’s sentencing date of Nov. 26 was rapidly approaching on. '[D]ismissal of this case is necessary under the Constitution and federal law to facilitate the orderly transition of Executive power — and in the interests of justice — following President Trump's victory in the Electoral College and the popular vote in the 2024 Presidential election,' Trump attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, whom the president-elect recently nominated to senior Justice Department roles, wrote in a letter last week. The jury of 12 New Yorkers in May found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money deal his ex-fixer made with a porn actor ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Though Trump could face jail time, such a sentence is rare for first-time offenders on charges like his, and he is expected to seek a delay of any punishment pending a lengthy appeal. Before sentencing, Merchan was also set to rule on whether the verdict can stand following the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision. Merchan delayed his ruling — and the sentencing — until shortly after the election and then put it on hold upon Trump’s electoral win. Both will remain on hold at least until the judge decides how to proceed in the wake of Trump’s election. His imminent return to the White House has already pumped the brakes on his other criminal prosecutions. Courts agreed to special counsel Jack Smith’s requests to halt his federal election subversion case and his appeal seeking to revive his documents case as prosecutors assess how to wind down the cases. In Georgia, where Trump is accused of attempting to subvert the state’s 2020 presidential election results, an appeals court without explanation took a scheduled oral argument in a defense challenge off the calendar.

What will Mike Huckabee focus on if confirmed as Israel ambassado...	(NewsNation) — If confirmed by the Senate to be ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee said it would 'be an honor' to represent the continuation of the Abraham Accords. The Abraham Accords, which President-elect Donald Trump helped broker, aimed to normalize relations between Israel and Arab nations. On 'Morning in America,' Huckabee said the job is all about carrying out responsibilities assigned by the president. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'An ambassador doesn't get to make policy. He's there to represent the policy,' Huckabee said. 'An ambassador serves at the pleasure of the President.' Huckabee's nomination comes during the Israel-Hamas war. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed 44,056 people, according to local health authorities, who say more than half of those killed were women and children. Parts of Gaza have been decimated and more than 2.3 million people driven from their homes. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage. The world’s top war crimes court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity.

Covenant House 'sleep out' raises money, awareness for homeless	(NewsNation) — Covenant House, a charity focused on helping the homeless, hosted 'sleep out' events across the country Thursday night to raise money and awareness for their cause. The purpose of the sleep out is to give participants a glimpse at how difficult it is to be unhoused. The temperature maxed out at 41 degrees overnight, and there was light rain and wind. The event also raises money for Covenant House's operations. NewsNation's Caitlyn Becker attended a sleep out in New York Thursday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/morninginamerica/covenant-house-sleep-out-2024/	2024-11-22T02:17:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/1bccc838-70bc-4ac3-a596-d043631475bc_59300e.jpg?w=800
Putin says Russia attacked Ukraine with a new missile that he cla...	The Kremlin fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile at Ukraine on Thursday in response to Kyiv's use this week of American and British missiles capable of striking deeper into Russia, President Vladimir Putin said. In a televised address to the country, the Russian president warned that U.S. air defense systems would be powerless to stop the new missile, which he said flies at ten times the speed of sound and which he called the Oreshnik — Russian for hazelnut tree. He also said it could be used to attack any Ukrainian ally whose missiles are used to attack Russia. 'We believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,' Putin said in his first comments since President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the green light this month to use U.S. ATACMS missiles to strike at limited targets inside Russia. Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed that Russia’s missile was a new, experimental type of intermediate range missile based on it’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile. 'This was new type of lethal capability that was deployed on the battlefield, so that was certainly of concern,' Singh said, noting that the missile could carry either conventional or nuclear warheads. The U.S. was notified ahead of the launch through nuclear risk reduction channels, she said. The attack on the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro came in response to Kyiv's use of longer-range U.S. and British missiles in strikes Tuesday and Wednesday on southern Russia, Putin said. Those strikes caused a fire at an ammunition depot in Russia's Bryansk region and killed and wounded some security services personnel in the Kursk region, he said. 'In the event of an escalation of aggressive actions, we will respond decisively and in kind,' the Russian president said, adding that Western leaders who are hatching plans to use their forces against Moscow should 'seriously think about this.' Putin said the Oreshnik fired Thursday struck a well-known missile factory in Dnipro. He also said Russia would issue advance warnings if it launches more strikes with the Oreshnik against Ukraine to allow civilians to evacuate to safety — something Moscow hasn’t done before previous aerial attacks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov initially said Russia hadn’t warned the U.S. about the coming launch of the new missile, noting that it wasn't obligated to do so. But he later changed tack and said Moscow did issue a warning 30 minutes before the launch. Putin's announcement came hours after Ukraine claimed that Russia had used an intercontinental ballistic missile in the Dnipro attack, which wounded two people and damaged an industrial facility and rehabilitation center for people with disabilities, according to local officials. But American officials said an initial U.S. assessment indicated the strike was carried out with an intermediate-range ballistic missile. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that the use of the missile was an 'obvious and serious escalation in the scale and brutality of this war, a cynical violation of the UN Charter.' He also said there had been 'no strong global reaction' to the use of the missile, which he said could threaten other countries. 'Putin is very sensitive to this. He is testing you, dear partners,' Zelenskyy wrote. 'If there is no tough response to Russia’s actions, it means they see that such actions are possible.' The attack comes during a week of escalating tensions, as the U.S. eased restrictions on Ukraine's use of American-made longer-range missiles inside Russia and Putin lowered the threshold for launching nuclear weapons. The Ukrainian air force said in a statement that the Dnipro attack was launched from Russia’s Astrakhan region, on the Caspian Sea. 'Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is,' Zelenskyy said hours before Putin's address. 'And how afraid he is.' Russia was sending a message by attacking Ukraine with an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of releasing multiple warheads at extremely high speeds, even if they are less accurate than cruise missiles or short-range ballistic missiles, said Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. 'Why might you use it therefore?' Savill said. 'Signaling — signaling to the Ukrainians. We’ve got stuff that outrages you. But really signaling to the West ‘We’re happy to enter into a competition around intermediate range ballistic missiles. P.S.: These could be nuclear tipped. Do you really want to take that risk?’' Military experts say that modern ICBMs and IRBMs are extremely difficult to intercept, although Ukraine has previously claimed to have stopped some other weapons that Russia described as 'unstoppable,' including the air-launched Kinzhal hypersonic missile. David Albright, of the Washington-based think tank the Institute for Science and International Security, said he was 'skeptical' of Putin’s claim, adding that Russian technology sometimes 'falls short.' He suggested Putin was 'taunting the West to try to shoot it down ... like a braggart boasting, taunting his enemy.' Earlier this week, the Biden administration authorized Ukraine to use the U.S.-supplied, longer-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia — a move that drew an angry response from Moscow. Days later, Ukraine fired several of the missiles into Russia, according to the Kremlin. The same day, Putin signed a new doctrine that allows for a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. The doctrine is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons. In response, Western countries, including the U.S., said Russia has used irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behavior throughout the war to intimidate Ukraine and other nations. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday that Russia’s formal lowering of the threshold for nuclear weapons use did not prompt any changes in U.S. doctrine. She pushed back on concerns that the decision to allow Ukraine to use Western missiles to strike deeper inside Russia might escalate the war. ″They’re the ones who are escalating this,' she said of the Kremlin — in part because of a flood of North Korean troops sent to the region. More than 1,000 days into war, Russia has the upper hand, with its larger army advancing in Donetsk and Ukrainian civilians suffering from relentless drone and missile strikes. Analysts and observers say the loosening of restrictions on Ukraine's use of Western missiles is unlikely to change the the course of the war, but it puts the Russian army in a more vulnerable position and could complicate the logistics that are crucial in warfare. Putin has also warned that the move would mean that Russia and NATO are at war. 'It is an important move and it pulls against, undermines the narrative that Putin had been trying to establish that it was fine for Russia to rain down Iranian drones and North Korean missiles on Ukraine but a reckless escalation for Ukraine to use Western-supplied weapons at legitimate targets in Russia,' said Peter Ricketts, a former U.K. national security adviser who now sits in the House of Lords. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless and Emma Burrows in London, and Zeke Miller and Lolita C.

Trump picks Pam Bondi for next attorney general	President-elect Trump has named former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as his next nominee to the lead the Department of Justice (DOJ). Bondi was a swift pick just hours after former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) withdrew himself from consideration for the role. 'For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore. Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again. I have known Pam for many years — She is smart and tough, and is an AMERICA FIRST Fighter, who will do a terrific job as Attorney General!' Trump wrote on Truth Social. Bondi served as attorney general of Florida from 2011 to 2019 under then-Gov. Rick Scott. She is the chair of the Center for Litigation at the America First Policy Institute, a right-wing think tank working with the Trump transition team on the administration’s agenda. She is also a partner at Ballard Partners, the lobbying firm at which Trump’s incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles worked. Bondi was a senior adviser on Trump’s first impeachment defense team, a role for which she took a leave from Ballard Partners. She then rejoined the firm, which was founded by Florida lobbyist Brian Ballard, the former 2016 chair of Trump Victory. She steps in for Gaetz, who was named Trump’s pick for attorney general just a week ago and immediately became the president-elect’s most controversial Cabinet choice. Gaetz was previously investigated by the Justice Department as part of a broader sex trafficking probe, including allegations involving an underage woman. The department ultimately decided not to pursue charges, and Gaetz has strongly denied any wrongdoing. While he cited that his nomination was becoming a distraction to the Trump transition team, his withdrawal suggests he had realized he was unlikely to win the votes necessary to be confirmed in the Senate after meeting with members of the upper chamber this week. Updated 6:48 p.m. EST	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-picks-pam-bondi-for-next-attorney-general/	2024-11-21T15:47:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/pambondi_msg_.jpg?w=900
What's next for Matt Gaetz: 5 possibilities	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s (R-Fla.) political future is up in the air following his announcement that he is taking his name out of the running to be attorney general in the Trump administration. Gaetz was under intense scrutiny over past investigations by the Justice Department (DOJ) and the House Ethics Committee. The DOJ was investigating Gaetz as a part of a broad sex trafficking probe, including allegations involving underage women, though it declined to file charges. Gaetz has vigorously denied those accusations. The former congressman was also the subject of a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and drug use. 'While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,' Gaetz wrote on social platform X. Here are five possibilities for what could come next for Gaetz. Another role in Trump administration While Gaetz took himself out of the running to be attorney general, President-elect Trump still could appoint him to an administration post, in the White House or elsewhere, that would not require a Senate confirmation hearing. By choosing Gaetz, Trump would have a high-profile defender in his administration without having to go through a messy confirmation process. Senate Republicans were warning that confirmation hearings on Gaetz would be like 'Kavanaugh on steroids,' referring to the hearings in 2018 for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. If Gaetz were to take on another role in the Trump administration, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) would have to set a date for a special election for Gaetz’s seat in the state’s 1st Congressional District. DeSantis has already instructed the Florida secretary of state to set a schedule for the special election, but a date has not yet been determined. The 1st District is a red seat and would likely see a competitive Republican primary. A number of Republicans have already lined up to run in the special election for Gaetz’s seat. Gubernatorial run Gaetz has been among the Republicans floated to run for governor once DeSantis’s term ends in 2026. But a gubernatorial run for Gaetz would come with baggage. 'Gaetz is damaged goods and donors should line up behind someone else,' said Dan Eberhart, a Florida-based Republican donor. 'It’s time for Gaetz to practice law,' he added. A gubernatorial run, however, could still prompt problems for Gaetz up on Capitol Hill. One House Republican, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, said there would likely still be a push for more information regarding the allegations against Gaetz, including the Ethics Committee's report. 'If he puts himself out there to run for governor, which is kind of the one everyone seems to think he’s gonna run for, I do think that if not this report, at least some information needs to come out because people need to know who they’re electing,' the lawmaker said. Reps. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) and Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) were also floated for the position, but with Waltz being appointed to serve as Trump’s national security adviser, Gaetz would likely face off against Donalds in a primary. 'Right now, the best-positioned person to be the next governor of Florida is Byron Donalds,' said Ford O’Connell, a Florida-based GOP strategist. Return to House of Representatives Gaetz resigned his seat for the current 118th Congress, but his resignation letter left some wiggle room for Gaetz to return for the 119th Congress that starts on Jan. 3, 2025, since he was reelected to the seat. 'I do not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress to pursue the position of Attorney General in the Trump Administration,' Gaetz wrote in his letter. Now that he is no longer pursuing the attorney general position, his intentions may change. It is unclear whether Gaetz could return unilaterally, but some congressional sources believe he can. If not, Gaetz has easily won reelection, and he could likely win a special election. Of course, Gaetz may not even want to return to the House. His wife, Ginger Gaetz, reposted his statement on X about withdrawing from attorney general consideration with a photo of the two on the Capitol steps that was captioned: 'The end of an era.' Being in the House would also mean that the House Ethics Committee would again have jurisdiction over him — and nullifying thorny questions about whether it is appropriate to release a report on a former member. The panel investigated Gaetz on and off for years over allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and other matters. Gaetz has vigorously denied the allegations, and the Department of Justice declined to charge him after investigating related matters. Several House Republicans do not want to see Gaetz, who threw the House into chaos when he voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), back in the halls. 'No one wants him back,' one House Republican told The Hill with a chuckle. 'I think that he can get sworn in, I mean he was elected by his district, he has every right. So, I don’t think we could stop him. But he’s not loved, that’s for sure.' 'A collective good riddance from many right-of-center members!' another House Republican told The Hill in reaction to Gaetz’s withdrawal. Media career While there are several paths Gaetz could pursue in government and politics, the Florida Republican could also take a stab at a career in media — an industry in which he already has experience. Gaetz has been a regular presence on TV and other media for years, vigorously defending Trump. In 2021, Gaetz started his own show, the 'Firebrand with Matt Gaetz' podcast, where he gives a 'behind-the-scenes look into the Swamp of Washington without the spin of Fake News and Deep State influence,' according to the show’s description. According to YouTube, he just published his 173rd episode. Gaetz has also occasionally found himself sitting at the anchor desk at other conservative outlets. He has guest-hosted former Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s 'War Room' podcast, and been a fill-in host on Newsmax. When discussing his appointment to be attorney general, Newsmax host Greg Kelly referenced the Florida Republican’s time holding the fort for shows on the network. 'Matt Gaetz is a special guy. He's incredibly smart, eloquent, bold, unafraid. He's also the occasional fill-in host on this program. No kidding,' Kelly said, adding: 'I am so honored that we gave him his start, didn't we? No. Matt Gaetz flattered us with his services here at Newsmax, and he is unafraid. And he knows his stuff when he takes on the swamp.' One media watcher is predicting that Gaetz will land at a Newsmax anchor desk when all is said and done. 'I'm guessing Matt Gaetz ends up as a Newsmax host,' Aaron Rupar wrote on X. Appointment to Senate Shortly after Gaetz took his name out of the ring to be attorney general, some floated the possibility that Gaetz could fill Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) seat in the Senate after Rubio is confirmed as secretary of State. The two are former colleagues in the House, and Gaetz helped prepare DeSantis in debate preparation when he first ran for governor in 2018. But the two were on different sides in the 2024 primary. Gaetz backed Trump in the Republican presidential primary last year shortly before DeSantis challenged Trump. The decision on who will fill Rubio’s seat lies with DeSantis, and Gaetz has not been among the names floated for the position. DeSantis is said to be considering his chief of staff James Uthmeier, state Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez and state Attorney General Ashley Moody. Lara Trump, the president-elect’s daughter-in-law, has been floated by a number of prominent lawmakers and has expressed interest in the position. A scenario in which DeSantis appoints her to the Senate could be viewed as an olive branch to the president-elect. There would be another chance at the Senate in 2026 when the special election for Rubio’s seat is held, but that scenario seems like it would present the same challenges that a statewide run for governor would. 'He’s toxic for the same reasons,' Eberhart said when asked about the possibility of Gaetz going for the Senate seat. 'If he wants back in, he’s gonna need to run on his own.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/whats-next-for-matt-gaetz-5-possibilities/	2024-11-21T15:42:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_022924ar02_w_8ed45c.jpg?w=900
73% worry Social Security won't pay promised benefits: Survey	(NewsNation) — A majority of Americans expect to rely on Social Security benefits when they retire, but according to a new survey, most are worried they won't get them. A Bankrate survey found that more than half (53%) of nonretired U.S. adults expect to count on their Social Security checks to cover necessary expenses in retirement. At the same time, 73% are concerned they won't receive their promised benefits when they retire. Those fears are not unfounded: Social Security is facing a financial shortfall. In roughly a decade, Social Security recipients could see their benefits cut by hundreds of dollars a month if Congress doesn't take action. While it's highly unlikely federal lawmakers will let that happen, so far, they have opted to kick the can down the road, avoiding major changes that could be politically unpopular. Experts say the longer Congress waits, the more drastic the changes will have to be later on. 'There’s a vast divide between Americans’ concern about the looming Social Security funding shortfall and the lack of serious and thorough conversation among elected officials about what to do about it,' Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick said in a statement. 'The result is that the American public’s financial well-being is not being tended to.' Keep in mind: Even if Congress does nothing — and the trust funds that pay out Social Security benefits run out — retirees will still receive a monthly check, but it could be lower than what was promised. The Brookings Institution says today’s financing challenge is 'at least double' what it was in 1983, the last time Social Security was in dire straits. Back then, insolvency was just months away before Congress stepped in. How much do retirees rely on Social Security? Bankrate found that more than three-quarters (77%) of current retirees are reliant on Social Security to pay necessary expenses, including 62% who said they are 'very reliant.' The rising cost of living has hit seniors on fixed incomes especially hard in recent years. Among beneficiaries 65 and older, about 12% of men and 15% of women rely on Social Security to meet 90% of their needs, according to government data. Social Security is meant to replace about 40% of past earnings, but roughly 4 in 10 retirees receive more than 50% of their income from the program. A recent AARP survey suggests retirees could be even more reliant on Social Security in the years ahead, with 20% of adults 50-plus saying they have no retirement savings. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to ease the burden by ending taxes on retirees benefits, but experts say that would require bipartisan buy-in and is unlikely to happen. What is the average retirement check? In October, the average monthly benefit for a retired worker was $1,924, according to the Social Security Administration. Retirees will see a 2.5% bump in January thanks to the annual cost-of-living adjustment. The size of your monthly retirement check is based on several factors, including how long you worked, how much you made over your career and when you started collecting. You can calculate your estimated benefit here. There's no perfect age to start collecting benefits because everyone's circumstances are different, but research suggests it's typically better to wait until age 70. At that point, you can receive up to 124% of your full Social Security benefit.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/workers-worry-social-security/	2024-11-21T15:00:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6707efe6621806.04044092.jpeg?w=900
Police report reveals assault allegations against Hegseth, Trump'...	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) — A woman told police that she was sexually assaulted in 2017 by Pete Hegseth after he took her phone, blocked the door to a California hotel room and refused to let her leave, according to a detailed investigative report made public late Wednesday. Hegseth, a former Fox News personality and President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be defense secretary, told police at the time that the encounter had been consensual and denied any wrongdoing, the report said. News of the allegations surfaced last week when local officials released a brief statement confirming that a woman had accused Hegseth of sexual assault in October 2017 after he had spoken at a Republican women’s event in Monterey. 'The matter was fully investigated and I was completely cleared,' Hegseth told reporters Thursday at the Capitol, where he was meeting with senators to build support for his nomination. The report does not say that police found the allegations were false. Police recommended the case report be forwarded to the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office for review. Monterey County District Attorney Jeannine M. Pacioni said Thursday that her office declined to file charges in January of 2018 because they didn't have 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt.' Tim Palatore, Hegseth’s attorney, has said the woman who made the allegations was paid an undisclosed sum in 2023 as part of a confidential settlement to head off the threat of what he described as a baseless lawsuit. The 22-page police report was released in response to a public records request and offers the first detailed account of what the woman alleged to have transpired — one that is at odds with Hegseth’s version of events. The report cited police interviews with the alleged victim, a nurse who treated her, a hotel staffer, another woman at the event and Hegseth. The woman’s name was not released, and The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually assaulted. A spokeswoman for the Trump transition said Thursday that the 'report corroborates' what Hegseth’s legal team has been saying 'all along.' Investigators were first alerted to the alleged assault, the report said, by a nurse who called them after a patient requested a sexual assault exam. The patient told medical personnel she believed she was assaulted five days earlier but couldn’t remember much about what had happened. She reported something may have been slipped into her drink before ending up in the hotel room where she said the assault occurred. Police collected the unwashed dress and underwear she had worn that night, the report said. The woman’s partner, who was staying at the hotel with her, told police that he was worried about her that night after she didn’t come back to their room. At 2 a.m., he went to the hotel bar, but she wasn’t there. She made it back a few hours later, apologizing that she 'must have fallen asleep.' A few days later, she told him she had been sexually assaulted. The woman, who helped organize the California Federation of Republican Women gathering at which Hegseth spoke, told police that she had witnessed the TV anchor acting inappropriately throughout the night and saw him stroking multiple women’s thighs. She texted a friend that Hegseth was giving off a 'creeper' vibe, according to the report. After the event, the woman and others attended an after-party in a hotel suite where she said she confronted Hegseth, telling him that she 'did not appreciate how he treated women,' the report states. A group of people, including Hegseth and the woman, decamped for the hotel’s bar. That’s when 'things got fuzzy,' the woman told police. She remembered having a drink at the bar with Hegseth and others, the police report states. She also told police that she argued with Hegseth near the hotel pool, an account that is supported by a hotel staffer who was sent to handle the disturbance and spoke to police, according to the report. Soon, she told police, she was inside a hotel room with Hegseth, who took her phone and blocked the door with his body so that she could not leave, according to the report. She also told police she remembered 'saying ‘no’ a lot,' the report said. Her next memory was of lying on a couch or bed with a bare-chested Hegseth hovering over her, his dog tags dangling, the report states. Hegseth served in the National Guard, rising to the rank of major. After Hegseth finished, she recalled he threw a towel at her and asked if she was 'OK,' the report states. She told police she did not recall how she got back to her own hotel room and had since suffered from nightmares and memory loss. At the time of the alleged assault, Hegseth, now 44, was going through a divorce with his second wife, with whom he has three children. She filed for divorce after he had a child with a Fox News producer who is now his third wife, according to court records and social media posts by Hegseth. His first marriage ended in 2009, also after infidelity by Hegseth, according to court records. Hegseth, who joined Fox News as a contributor in 2014 before becoming co-host of 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend,' left the network after Trump announced his intention to nominate him. Hegseth said he attended an after party and drank beer but did not consume liquor, and acknowledged being 'buzzed' but not drunk. He said he met the woman at the hotel bar, and she led him by the arm back to his hotel room, which surprised him because he initially had no intention of having sex with her, the report said. Hegseth told investigators that the sexual encounter that followed was consensual, adding that he explicitly asked more than once if she was comfortable. Hegseth said in the morning the woman 'showed early signs of regret,' and he assured her that he wouldn’t tell anyone about the encounter. Hegseth’s attorney said a payment was made to the woman as part of a confidential settlement a few years after the police investigation because Hegseth was concerned that she was prepared to file a lawsuit that he feared could have resulted in him being fired from Fox News, where he was a popular host. The attorney would not reveal the amount of the payment. ___ Slodysko reported from Washington and Linderman from Baltimore.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-police-report-reveals-assault-allegations-against-hegseth/	2024-11-21T14:46:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673fb9786c66b5.78382331.jpeg?w=900
Family fears missing woman Hannah Kobayashi was trafficked	(NewsNation) — The family of a woman who has been missing for over a week says they fear she may have been trafficked. Hannah Kobayashi was on her way to New York from Hawaii but missed her connecting flight in Los Angeles on Nov. 8, 2024. Her family says they received suspicious texts from the missing 31-year-old and says she was spotted on surveillance video in downtown LA near a Metro stop about a block from where the Los Angeles Lakers play. She was accompanied by an unidentified person. 4-year-old Florida boy found dead after vanishing from park A rally is planned for Thursday afternoon outside the Crypto.com Arena as her family searches for Kobayashi. Her aunt, Larie Pidgeon, said the unreleased surveillance footage showed Kobayashi was not alone and that she did not look well in the video. Kobayashi was wearing the same clothing she had worn when she arrived from Maui. Earlier sightings included one at the Grove Shopping Center, where Kobayashi posted to Instagram from a Nike event on Nov. 10. In a video obtained by the family, Kobayashi is seen strolling through the event that day wearing headphones. Her relatives are especially concerned about text messages from Kobayashi's phone on Nov. 11. One stated, 'I got hacked, stripped of my identity, I can't fly.' Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator Another said, 'I got tricked pretty much into giving away my funds for someone I thought I loved. I've been on the streets.' According to Pidgeon, the wording in the text is suspicious, and the phone has been turned off since Nov. 11. 'Time is of the essence, and it's dwindling, so we are terrified,' Pidgeon said. 'We're thinking of things like, was she abducted? I hate to say it, but the word 'trafficked.'' Posters and flyers are plastered throughout the area. Another question focuses on the Metros top, which does not connect to LAX. You have to make a connection from another line, which has left the family wondering if someone brought her to the area by the stadium. Family pleads for help finding pregnant Indiana woman who vanished in October The family filed a formal missing persons report on Nov. 12, and police confirmed there is an investigation underway. Since there is no hard evidence of a crime or foul play, the family fears her case is not a priority to officers. Her family is focusing their search in the area around the arena and are hoping the rally, right before a Lakers game, will lead to new leads.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/family-fear-hannah-kobayashi-trafficked/	2024-11-21T14:04:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/HannahKobayashi.jpg?w=229
Veronica Butler autopsy released after judge’s ruling	(NewsNation) — The autopsy of a Kansas woman has been released after a judge denied a motion that would have kept it sealed. The report says Veronica Butler, 27, suffered about 30 cuts and stab wounds throughout her body. There was also one blunt force injury to the top of her head and possible stun gun marks to the lower neck. Investigators said her body was found in a freezer under a concrete slab buried up to 8 feet below ground and sealed with yellow ratchet straps. Investigators said they also found clothing, a stun gun, a roll of tape and a sheathed knife. Kansas moms killings: What we know Butler and Jilian Kelley, 39, were killed earlier this year after they traveled from Hugoton, Kansas, to pick up Butler’s children in Oklahoma. The women never made it to the children. They disappeared March 30, and their bodies were found about two weeks later. Five people have been arrested and charged in the case, including the children’s grandmother. Tifany Adams, 54; her boyfriend Tad Cullum, 43; Cora Twombly, 44; and her husband Cole Twombly, 50; and Paul Grice, 31, have each been charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder. Wrangler Rickman, the father of the two children, had legal custody but was in a rehabilitation facility, so the children were living with Adams at the time of the disappearance. Exclusive: Kansas moms murder suspects kept apart in jail Police have described the two women as more acquaintances than friends. NewsNation reported that Kelley was the supervisor of the childhood visits for Butler. Family members, who have been asked to postpone media interviews until the police tell them otherwise, say the two women were involved in their community and their churches.

Pentagon admits some UAP sightings still unexplained	(NewsNation) — The Pentagon recently said it solved one of the most high-profile videos of a UFO, revealing that the famed 'GOFAST' video was a trick of the eye. The unexplained anomalous phenomena (UAP) was spotted by a jet from the USS Theodore Roosevelt in 2016 off the East Coast, appearing to fly at high speeds. But in a Senate hearing, the director of the Pentagon testified the object was an ordinary one, appearing to be moving very fast and very close to water due to an optical illusion known as parallax. What UAP witnesses recommend for congressional action Nick Pope, who investigated UFOs for the British Ministry of Defense, said he believes it is a good thing for the Pentagon to resolve cases like that one. 'This is good news because then they can move on to the ones that, even by their own admission, they can't explain,' he told NewsNation. The Pentagon maintains that there is no evidence UAPs are connected to extraterrestrial life, though believers think otherwise. Pope said it's a good sign that AARO is ramping up efforts to work with the academic and scientific communities to study sightings, noting that 99% of cases can be eliminated as conventional objects. What do UFOs look like? The best plan, he said, is to eliminate those and focus on the cases that are left. 'It only takes one of these cases to be the real thing, something genuinely extraterrestrial, and it will change our world forever,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/pentagon-some-uap-sightings-unexplained/	2024-11-21T12:42:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/NAVAIR_GOFAST_video_poster_5fe476.jpg?w=900
Daniel Penny trial: Pathologist disputes chokehold death finding	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — A forensic pathologist testified Thursday in defense of the military-trained commuter charged with killing Jordan Neely. A New York City medical examiner determined that Daniel Penny’s chokehold killed Neely, an agitated, mentally ill man whom Penny and some other riders found threatening. But the defense's pathologist, Dr. Satish Chundru, told jurors that Neely's medical records and bystander video didn't show telltale signs of known types of fatal chokehold. Matt Gaetz withdraws from nomination as attorney general Among the discrepancies, he said: The location and extent of bruising on Neely's neck and the small amount of petechiae — small red spots caused by subsurface bleeding — on his eyelids. He said Neely died from 'the combined effects' of synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint, and a blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during exertion. Penny, 26, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. His defense says the Marine veteran and architecture student was defending himself and a car full of subway riders. Neely, 30, sometimes entertained subway riders as a Michael Jackson impersonator. But he also had a history of psychiatric and drug problems and a criminal record that included assaulting a woman at a subway station. Illinois Supreme Court reverses actor Jussie Smollett’s conviction When they crossed paths in a subway car on May 1, 2023, Neely was begging for money, shouting about being willing to die or go to jail, and making sudden movements, according to witnesses. Penny has said Neely lurched toward a woman with a small child and said, 'I will kill.' Penny put his arm around Neely's neck, took him to the floor and held Neely there, with Penny’s legs around him, for close to six minutes, bystander videos show. Neely had stopped moving at roughly the last minute.

Donald Trump could create first 'crypto czar'	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump is considering adding a new position to his administration: the nation’s first-ever 'crypto czar.' The role would oversee cryptocurrency policy and regulation and act as a liaison between Congress and the White House. Trump's top team is meeting with bitcoin and crypto experts to discuss the role. Matt Gaetz withdraws from nomination as attorney general Trump has several crypto businesses himself and, during his campaign, had promised to make the United States the crypto capital of the world by creating a bitcoin strategic reserve.

The idea is in its early stages. Bloomberg reports that many of the conversations are in their initial processes, and there are still discussions about whether the role would be a specific White House administrative role or more of a 'czar' position, which is more colloquial for someone being a point person to spearhead a certain topic. What’s clear is that Trump has spoken very positively about the issue of cryptocurrency on the campaign trail and even gave remarks at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, this summer. 'If crypto is going to define the future, I want to be mined, minted and made in the USA,' Trump said. 'It's not going to be made anywhere else. Bitcoin is going to the moon, as we say. It’s going to the moon. I want America to be the nation that leads the way, and that's what's going to happen. You’re going to be very happy with me.' The price of bitcoin in just the past month has skyrocketed since the election. That’s largely because there are a lot of cryptocurrency investors who remain optimistic that this administration will be favorable to bitcoin and to cryptocurrency in the future. Sanctuary cities plan to resist Trump’s mass deportation plans Sen. Debbie Stabenow from Michigan has been trying to push cryptocurrency legislation since this summer and has encountered some roadblocks — both from within her own party as well as from across the aisle. She’s looking for ways to offer regulations and consumer protections, trying to make a push, according to Politico, before the new session comes into effect and Republicans take the majority in the Senate.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-first-crypto-czar/	2024-11-21T11:30:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2182554552.jpg?w=900
Are athletes being targeted by transnational crime ring?	(NewsNation) — The FBI is investigating whether a recent spate of burglaries at the homes of high-profile professional athletes is connected to a transnational crime ring. Last month, the homes of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce were broken into within days of each other, according to law enforcement reports. Mahomes said he couldn’t provide many details because the investigation is ongoing. Kelce’s losses included $20,000 in cash, according to a police report. In November, the home of Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis was burglarized by at least two people. That incident was captured on Portis’ home surveillance system. Illinois Supreme Court reverses actor Jussie Smollett’s conviction In September, burglars broke into the home of Minnesota Timberwolves player Mike Conley, stealing jewelry. NBC News reports the FBI is working to figure out if a transnational crime ring — possibly one from South America — is responsible. 'Referring to them as gangs kind of brings up this vision of street gangs,' retired FBI agent Bobby Chacon told NewsNation. 'These are not gangs in that sense. They are more organized rings or cells of thieves that are very highly trained.' The gang’s modus operandi, however, may end up giving them away, according to Chacon. 'The more sophisticated some of these groups actually become easier to find ... because they leave a signature, some type of thing that either enables them to defeat a sophisticated security system or get into a house in a certain way,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/athletes-targeted-transnational-crime-ring/	2024-11-21T11:06:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24318678707600.jpg?w=900
Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua now in 16 states: Report	(NewsNation) — The Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua has spread to 16 U.S. states, according to a New York Post report citing an internal Department of Homeland Security memo. The gang has reportedly established a presence in Virginia, Montana, Wyoming, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.

The New York Post cited internal communication from the Department of Homeland Security and shared a partial image of a memo in its reporting. NewsNation has not reviewed the memo or independently verified the report. GOP senator: Using military for deportations would be ‘huge mistake’ The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to NewsNation’s request for comment. Earlier this week, House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., issued a statement warning that the gang was operating in Tennessee. Green blamed President Joe Biden’s administration, saying it 'intentionally threw our borders wide open' and 'gutted interior enforcement.' 'Tennesseans — and our entire country — shouldn’t be forced to live in fear of heinous gangs because of this administration’s inability to secure our borders,' Green said. The gang started in a prison in the Venezuelan state of Aragua nearly a decade ago. It’s since expanded into what the Justice Department calls a 'transnational criminal organization.' The U.S. Treasury sanctioned the group in July, freezing assets and blocking transactions in the U.S. Several high-profile cases, including the death of 12-year-old Texas girl Jocelyn Nungaray, have fueled speculation about alleged migrant gang crimes. As for confirmed instances of TdA crimes in the U.S., some local leaders say the issue has been blown out of proportion. Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman refuted Trump’s comments about the city being a 'war zone.' 'The reality is that the concerns about Venezuelan gang activity have been grossly exaggerated,' Coffman wrote in an Oct. 8 Facebook post. 'The incidents were limited to several apartment complexes in this city of more than 400,000 residents.'

Matt Gaetz withdraws from nomination as attorney general	(NewsNation) — Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has withdrawn his name from the running for attorney general following controversy over his nomination. Gaetz announced on X he had made the decision to withdraw after meeting with Senators for feedback. 'While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1,' he said. Trump’s border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes Gaetz resigned from his seat in the current Congress once he was nominated and said at the time he would not be sworn into his seat in the upcoming Congress on Jan. 3, 2025. However, now that he has backed out of the nomination, it is technically possible he could choose to take up the seat again. If Gaetz does not return to the House, Florida will hold a special election to fill the vacant seat. Many had expressed doubts over Gaetz's nomination due to an ongoing investigation by the House Ethics Committee and the fact that he's faced allegations of sex trafficking and soliciting a minor. The Justice Department declined to charge Gaetz after investigating him for sexual conduct and illicit drug use. The Ethics Committee had been getting close to releasing the report on Gaetz when he resigned, halting the process because the committee doesn't typically release reports on former lawmakers. There has been mounting public pressure for the committee to break with that precedent, however, in the face of Gaetz's nomination. Speaker Johnson: Capitol bathrooms restricted by ‘biological sex’ On Wednesday, the committee met to discuss the issue but failed to reach a consensus. A hacker released documents purportedly from the investigation to The New York Times, which included testimony from a woman who said she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17 and he was an adult. Another document allegedly from the investigation appeared to show Gaetz paying money for sex. If Gaetz were to take his seat up again, the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction over him would resume along with the investigation and possible consequences based on the findings. This is a developing story.

Illinois Supreme Court reverses actor Jussie Smollett's convictio...	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — The Illinois Supreme Court has reversed the conviction of actor Jussie Smollett. The former 'Empire' actor took his case to the Illinois Supreme Court in September in a last-ditch effort to have his 2021 conviction overturned. The court cited Smollett's second prosecution after his charges were initially dropped as the main reason why his conviction was overturned. 'Today we resolve a question about the State’s responsibility to honor the agreements it makes with defendants. Specifically, we address whether a dismissal of a case by nolle prosequi allows the State to bring a second prosecution when the dismissal was entered as part of an agreement with the defendant and the defendant has performed his part of the bargain. We hold that a second prosecution under these circumstances is a due process violation, and we therefore reverse defendant’s conviction,' the Illinois Supreme Court wrote in its ruling. Smollett was convicted of falsely reporting a 2019 hate crime against him in 2021. Smollett, who is Black and gay, alleged his attackers shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him before putting a noose around his neck on a freezing night in Streeterville. He was found guilty of five counts of disorderly conduct for setting up the attack. Testimony at his trial indicated he paid two brothers, whom he knew from the set of the TV show, $3,500 to carry out the 'attack.' But prior to his conviction, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx initially dropped his 16 charges in Apr. 2019 — which is the basis of Thursday's Supreme Court ruling. Foxx, who recused herself from the case after she communicated with a Smollett relative during the probe, reiterated that she welcomed of an independent investigation into the way she and her office handled the case. That came in Aug. of 2019, when Cook County Judge Michael Toomin’s appointed former U.S. attorney Dan Webb as special prosecutor. Previous: Jussie Smollett found guilty on 5 of 6 counts of disorderly conduct Webb led the prosecution efforts the second time around and Smollett was found guilty of five of six disorderly conduct charges on Dec. 9, 2021. Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in jail, 30 months of probation, and ordered to pay more than $130,000 in restitution. So far, he has served six days of that sentence. According to the ruling's conclusion, the Illinois Supreme Court cited Bill Cosby's case as one that also generated 'significant public interest.' The court went on to allude to Smollett's original charges being dropped and said while 'many people' were dissatisfied with that — it 'would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the State was not bound to honor agreements upon which people detrimentally relied.' In addition to the aforementioned public interest, Cosby's case was cited from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania regarding enforcing a prosecutorial promise not to prosecute. 'It cannot be gainsaid that society holds a strong interest in the prosecution of crimes. It is also true that no such interest, however important, ever can eclipse society’s interest in ensuring that the constitutional rights of the people are vindicated. Society’s interest in prosecution does not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons,' the court wrote regarding Cosby. The Appellate Court of Illinois denied Smollett’s request to toss his conviction in December of last year. The Illinois Supreme Court noted that Chief Justice Theis and Justice Cunningham did not take part in the consideration or decision of Smollett's case. Special prosecutor Dan Webb sent the following lengthy statement, saying he disagreed with the decision. 'We are disappointed in the Illinois Supreme Court’s decision today to overturn Jussie Smollett’s convictions and sentence, including the award of over $120,000 in restitution to the City of Chicago for its overtime expenses in investigating Mr. Smollett’s fake hate crime. We respectfully disagree with the Court’s factual and legal reasoning which upends long-standing Illinois precedent. Indeed, the Special Prosecutor’s brief to the Illinois Supreme Court was replete with Illinois case law that would not preclude a second, new prosecution following a dismissal without prejudice via nolle prosequi. Even the Illinois Supreme Court agreed in its opinion that its holding today was not explicit in earlier Illinois decisions. Make no mistake—today’s ruling has nothing to do with Mr. Smollett’s innocence. The Illinois Supreme Court did not find any error with the overwhelming evidence presented at trial that Mr. Smollett orchestrated a fake hate crime and reported it to the Chicago Police Department as a real hate crime, or the jury’s unanimous verdict that Mr. Smollett was guilty of five counts of felony disorderly conduct. In fact, Mr. Smollett did not even challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against him in his appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. My office spent nearly two years developing evidence and working closely with the Chicago Police Department to prepare that case for trial. It is very important I point out that today’s decision is also not the result of any error or conduct by the Office of the Special Prosecutor, the trial court, or the Chicago Police Department. In fact, the events that led to the Illinois Supreme Court to reverse Mr. Smollett’s conviction occurred 5 months before I was appointed as Special Prosecutor. Rather, today’s decision is only possible because of the unprecedented resolution of Mr. Smollett’s initial case by the Cook County State’s Attorneys’ Office (CCSAO) in March 2019, which the Illinois Supreme Court determined barred Mr. Smollett from any further prosecution. The Illinois Supreme Court reached this decision notwithstanding the fact that the CCSAO dismissed the initial Smollett case via a nolle prosequi, which does not bar re-prosecution under Illinois law, and Mr. Smollett’s own lawyers told the public immediately following the dismissal of his initial case in March 2019 that there was 'no deal' with the CCSAO. As previously set forth in my 63-page, very detailed Special Prosecutor’s Public Summary Report, my office developed evidence of substantial abuses of discretion and operational failures by the CCSAO in prosecuting and resolving the initial 2019 Smollett case, and also found that State’s Attorney Kimberly Foxx and other CCSAO prosecutors made multiple false and/or misleading statements to the public. Those significant failures and false and/or misleading statements by State’s Attorney Foxx’s office led Cook County Judge Michael B. Toomin to appoint me as Special Prosecutor in order to restore the public’s faith in Illinois’ criminal justice system. In fact, there was a public clamor to have a well-respected trial lawyer and law firm agree to become a special prosecutor in order to help restore the public’s confidence in the Cook County judicial system. My law firm, Winston &amp; Strawn LLP, accepted the appointment pro bono with no compensation to the firm in order to give back to the City of Chicago. Our Winston &amp; Strawn lawyers fulfilled this mandate by devoting over 5 years and more than 15,000 hours in examining the original Smollett investigation and bringing new charges, which yielded a unanimous jury conviction of Mr. Smollett in 2021 on five felony counts of wrongful misconduct. Nothing about today’s decision upsets the work undertaken by the Special Prosecutor’s office, or the overwhelming evidence underlying the jury’s verdict that Mr. Smollett faked a hate crime and reported it as a real hate crime to the Chicago Police Department. Despite today’s ruling, the City of Chicago remains able to pursue its pending civil lawsuit against Mr. Smollett in order to recoup the over $120,000 in overtime expenses the Chicago Police Department incurred for investigating Mr. Smollett’s fake hate crime. I want to provide a special thanks to Deputy Special Prosecutors Sean G. Wieber, Samuel Mendenhall, and the entire team at Winston &amp; Strawn who assisted in this matter, for all of their dedication and efforts over the years. Today’s ruling does not change how deeply proud I am of the work my Special Prosecutor’s office accomplished; nor does it undermine the jury’s verdict, and most importantly, it does not clear Jussie Smollett’s name—he is not innocent.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/illinois-supreme-court-reverses-actor-jussie-smolletts-conviction/	2024-11-21T08:43:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Bookingphoto2-e1732203524508.jpg?w=900
Side hustles becoming a necessity for some Americans	(NewsNation) — Having a second job used to be associated with greater financial freedom but, for many Americans, side hustles have become a necessity. No longer just a means for spare cash, side gigs are an important contribution to many household incomes. Matthew Kallish is among those with a second full-time job. After working a graveyard shift at a New Jersey hotel, he then heads back for another eight hours of work as a mailman. Man wins $650K on lottery ticket using numbers tied to late wife 'It’s definitely a struggle,' Kallish said. 'Staying up all night, which is a struggle in itself, and then knowing that you’re coming to work another whole shift at another job.' More than one-third of people with a so-called side hustle need the work to afford living essentials like rent and groceries, according to a BankRate survey. 'It’s hard,' Kallish said. 'With the cost of gas and groceries. Sometimes, at the end of the week, all the big bills are paid but we’re waiting until Friday to go grocery shopping because there’s only so much money to go around — even with both jobs.' Financial expert Rachel Cruz says Americans struggling to make ends meet should pause investing while paying off debt and sell things they don’t use or need. Skipping a vacation or going one month on 'no spending' can help ease the burden. Burning the candle at both ends shouldn’t be a long-term solution, she said. 'It’s easy to wander into debt and really hard to get out,' she said. 'So those two to three extra jobs to keep you afloat to be able to get you out of debt are key. But once you're out of debt and you have an emergency fund in place, then my hope would be that your full-time job can take care of your living expenses and you can still live below your means.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/side-hustles-necessity-some-americans/	2024-11-21T05:51:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/fdf78e6255a04e2da5ca885c746999d3.jpg?w=900
Egregious patterns of abuse' in Florida migrant facility: ACLU	(NewsNation) — A migrant woman with a history of mental illness spent a month in solitary confinement at a Florida detention center and experienced abuse and neglect, a civil rights complaint filed last week alleges. The woman, named only as Ana, suffers from PTSD, anxiety and depression, yet her intake forms at the Baker County Detention Center in Macclenny, Florida, categorized her as having no 'major mental illness such as . . . major depressive (disorder),' the ACLU of Florida said in the complaint, co-filed with the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization. Still, she was placed in isolation in a 'filthy' and 'dark' cell without a mattress, according to the complaint, which was submitted to the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. Trump’s border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes Ana, a 33-year-old domestic violence and human trafficking survivor from an unspecified Spanish-speaking country, arrived at Baker in May 2023 under U.S. Immigrations and Enforcement custody. Her intake forms incorrectly identify English as her spoken language, the complaint says. The language barrier and lack of translation services exacerbated her abusive experience in the detention center. The jail operates in part as an immigration detention facility and has faced multiple civil rights suits since 2022. This year, a Baker officer was convicted of sexual battery on an inmate and sentenced to 25 years. 'Ana’s experiences at Baker illustrate many of the most egregious patterns of abuse at the facility, including sexual abuse in the form of voyeurism, abuse of solitary confinement,' the complaint says, 'the improper use of force and restraints, denial of mental health care, denial of access to counsel, failure to provide language access services and incomplete and falsified records.' Illegal crossings down 70% along US-Mexico border A Florida lawmaker wants the facility shut down. 'What I saw was horrible. I saw conditions that no human should have to live in,' said Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., in an Instagram video call with the ACLU of Florida on Monday. Frost said he visited the ICE facility before. 'We are talking about the medical unit. The problem here too is a lot of that medical unit is being used to house people, or being used as a solitary confinement,' Frost said. 'Do what’s right — shut down this facility.' Baker County Sheriff Scotty Rhoden praised the facility's staff in a Facebook post Monday from the Baker County Sheriff's Office page, saying, 'I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated Detention staff. They do an outstanding job, and I am incredibly proud of their unwavering commitment to the citizens of Baker County.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/florida-migrant-facility-aclu-complaint/	2024-11-21T05:29:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66fae40d3095e1.75671394.jpeg?w=900
City of Asheville lifts boil water notice seven weeks after Helen...	(NewsNation) — Asheville, North Carolina, residents can safely drink from the tap now that the citywide boil water notice has been lifted, the city's water department announced Tuesday. The announcement came more than seven weeks after Helene, the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. since Katrina, swept through the Southeast. Officials had been flushing the water system for a week until Saturday when no raw or untreated water remained, according to city spokesperson Clay Chandler. They tested 120 samples over the weekend. 'Customers may resume normal usage of the water system. It is no longer advisable to use bottled water for consumption,' Chandler said at a news conference. National Weather Service releases Helene wind damage assessment The storm damaged water lines at the North Forth Reservoir, Asheville's water source, forcing residents to rely on bottled water for drinking, cooking and bathing for close to 55 days. The city expects a surge in water demand, so residents should avoid large-volume usage, including filling bathtubs, watering yards and taking long showers. Western North Carolina was hit hard when Helene struck Sept. 27, wiping out infrastructure and knocking out power for weeks. At least 42 people died in Buncombe County where Asheville is located. Schools remained closed for about a month due to undrinkable water and road repairs. 'We understand that an initial disruption in water service, followed by not having potable water out of the tap, was disruptive and frustrating, and we thank you for hanging in there with us,' Chandler said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/asheville-north-carolina-boil-water-notice-helene/	2024-11-21T05:06:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/helene_aid_093024ap01_w.jpg?w=900

People seeking help or experiencing a crisis can dial 988 to reach the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline or 800-799-7233 to contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline. (NewsNation) — David Smith, the ex-husband of Susan Smith and father of the two boys she murdered, expressed 'much relief' Wednesday upon learning that Susan had been denied parole. Susan Smith was convicted of two counts of murder in 1994 after allowing her car to roll into a South Carolina lake with her sons, Michael and Alex, inside. In the days leading up to the parole hearing, David shared that he had 'spoken' to his sons in his own way. 'We had a lot of discussions,' he revealed exclusively on Banfield. 'Time heals some wounds. But for me, personally, time does not heal the loss of a child,' Smith said. During 'Banfield's' one-hour exclusive episode, Smith shared never-before-seen images of Michael and Alex Smith.

Smith’s voice shook as she spoke to board members over a video call and expressed remorse for the boys’ deaths. She told the parole board that she’s a Christian and asked them to show her 'that same kind of mercy, as well.' 'I know that what I did was horrible,' she said, wiping her eyes. 'And I would give anything if I could go back and change it. I love Michael and Alex with all my heart.' Trump’s border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes Smith was sentenced to life in prison in 1994 for the deaths of her 3-year-old son Michael and 14-month-old Alex. She initially told police a carjacker took off with her children still inside the vehicle. The case drew international attention as Smith pleaded with the media and public to help locate her children for nine days. Eventually, Smith admitted she strapped her two sons into car seats and drove onto a boat ramp at a South Carolina lake, where she let the vehicle roll into the water with her sons still in the back seats. 'I didn’t lie to get away with it,' Smith said through tears. 'I really didn’t. I was just scared. I didn’t know how to tell the people who loved them that they’d never see them again. How could I tell David he couldn’t see his sons again?' 'I’m sorry,' she continued. 'I know that’s not enough. I know it’s not. I know they just sound like words, but they come from my heart. They really do.'

Idaho college killings: Kohberger can face death penalty if convi...	(NewsNation) — Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students in 2022, can face the death penalty if convicted, a judge has ruled. Kohberger's defense team sought to remove the death penalty as a possible punishment, but Ada County Judge Steven Hippler denied its request. The trial for Kohberger is set to begin in August. Susan Smith up for parole 30 years after killing her sons Kohberger, 29, is charged in the deaths of four University of Idaho students who were found stabbed to death in an off-campus house in November of 2022. The deaths of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, shocked the small town of Moscow, Idaho. Initially, investigators had few leads and spent considerable time tracing the activities of the four students in the hours prior to their deaths. This journey for justice for Kaylee, Maddie, Xana, and Ethan has been filled with highs and lows. Some days, we are hopeful that justice will be served; other days, we are overwhelmed with hopelessness and sadness. Today is a day for hope! The past two years in front of Judge Judge have been marked by frustration and disappointment—whether it was failing to pronounce the victims' names correctly, laughing in the courtroom, or entertaining every absurd motion or argument the defense could muster. That has been our reality. But now, we feel hopeful once again. We finally have a judge who appears prepared, thoughtful, and well-versed in the legal process. There is a newfound level of seriousness that has been absent for far too long. So, when we learned today that the motions to challenge the death penalty were denied, we were overjoyed—not just for our family, but for our friends, supporters, and everyone who has shed a tear, made a donation, or listened to the story of these beautiful children who were so senselessly taken from us. Justice is moving forward, and we pray that one day, in the not-so-distant future, it will be served. Thank you once again to everyone for your unwavering support and prayers, and a special thank you to the people of Boise, who have welcomed us with open arms.

Trump's border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes	NewsNation) — Patrolling more than 1,900 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border falls under federal jurisdiction, but if President-elect Donald Trump bulks up manpower to go after immigrants who entered the country illegally as he has pledged, local law enforcement agencies could also be called into action. Trump has doubled down on plans for the largest domestic deportation in American history, focusing initially on immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes. As Trump’s inauguration draws closer, agencies on the front lines of border crimes and the entry of millions of immigrants expect a noticeable shift. Illegal crossings down 70% along US-Mexico border Republican Sheriff Mark Dannels in Arizona’s Cochise County says intensified federal attention to the border crisis will provide relief to his 100 deputized officers who patrol 6,200 square miles of rural desert that runs 83 miles along the U.S.-Mexico border. Cochise deputies have made 4,000 arrests in the past 35 months involving border crimes including human and drug smuggling. Dannels says officers are stressed and have risked serious injury and death in apprehending offenders. The incoming administration has created optimism, the sheriff said. 'You’ve got a president who has already made it very clear …and comes with a report card of border security being a priority – that he’s going to come in and do the federal government’s job. And that is, do what you’re supposed to do,' Dannels told NewsNation. Border sheriffs expect help from Trump administration Cochise County already partners with 100 federal and state agents and officers at a unique operations station to patrol 83 miles of the border. Border crossings aren’t the main issue for Cochise County deputies, as many of the migrants that come through the county head to urban areas. Instead, deputies are tasked with tackling crime at the border, such as drug smuggling. In almost three years, the department has arrested 4,000 people for border-related crimes, Dannels said most of them are Americans working with the cartels. Receiving more White House support will allow deputies to get back to 'doing what they do best,' Dannels said. 'We’ve covered the bill,' Dannels said. 'It’s time for them to reimburse us and cover their own debt and do their job.' Trump’s immigration grand strategy casts wide net Some agencies speculate that removing an estimated 11 million immigrants could cost the federal government nearly $970 billion over 10 years. Texas is prepared to offer up 1,400 acres of land to build a detention facility to aid Trump with his mass deportation efforts, according to a letter obtained by NewsNation. Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham sent the letter to Trump offering the land, which is located in the Rio Grande Valley sector near the U.S. Mexican border. Buckingham told Trump that her office is prepared to cooperate with ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Border Patrol for the facility. Immigrants captured in Terrell County, Texas, are illuminated after being found by local sheriff's deputies. (Photo courtesy of the Terrell County Sheriff's Department) (Photo courtesy of theTerrell County Sheriff's Department) (Photo courtesy of the Terrell County Sheriff's Department) Photo courtesy of the Terrell County Sheriff's Department) Photo courtesy of Thaddeus Cleveland Photo courtesy of the Terrell County Sheriff's Department) Thaddeus Cleveland, a retired Border Patrol agent and the Terrell County Texas sheriff since 2022, oversees a department that covers 2,300 square miles, including a 54-mile stretch along the border. He told NewsNation he’s ready for backup considering the fact his small department covers 2,300 square miles of territory and 54 miles along the border. Terrell County experienced a 417% jump in border apprehensions in fiscal year 2022, Cleveland said. The department already has existing relationships with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Texas Department of Public Safety. Cleveland knows that under Trump’s leadership, his department will benefit from increased support — even if it is asked to assist federal agents with locating and apprehension of illegal immigrants as is authorized under ICE’s 287 (g) Immigration and Nationality Act. 'We’re not afraid to be in the fight,' Cleveland said. Laredo police dismiss reports Guy Fieri, Sammy Hagar lost 4,000 cases of tequila in heist Joe Frank Martinez was recently elected for his fifth term as sheriff in Val Verde, Texas, which shares 150 border miles with Mexico along the Rio Grande River. His department includes four deputies to police the 3,200 square miles that make up the county. In 2021, roughly 3,000 mostly Haitian immigrants congregated under an international bridge for two weeks, creating an emergency in Del Rio and for Martinez’s small department. Although Val Verde County has seen immigrant encounters diminish since 2023, Martinez acknowledges more needs to be done. That’s especially true in a rural area of Texas where protective structures – like Trump’s unfinished border wall – have fallen into disrepair and include gaps. Martinez, a Democrat, says even though significant border encounters aren’t particularly problematic for his department these days, it doesn’t mean that’s the case everywhere. 'This shouldn’t be a red or blue issue,' Martinez said. 'I think that both sides need to come together and come up with a solution. If (a border wall) is the solution that is going to keep our community safe, I’m for it.' Where state laws prohibit local enforcement of immigration In California, which has been among the states affected most by illegal border crossings, local law enforcement officials are limited in their ability to make arrests of those entering the state. The CBP San Diego sector reported more than 9,500 migrant arrests in a single week in April of this year. It marked the first time since 1999 that the sector tallied the most arrests of any region, the Los Angeles Times reported. That number grew to 14,436 in August, according to CBP data cited by the Washington Office on Latin America. Despite the number of arrests made along the border by federal agents, California state law defines the role of agencies including the San Diego Sheriff’s Department. A department spokesman told NewsNation that local deputies are regularly used to assist immigrants who have already crossed the border and need humanitarian aid. However, the department’s involvement stops there, leaving any immigration enforecement work to the feds. The spokesman said any change in department policy would require a change to state law. Should that happen, the spokesman said the department would review the amendments and its current policies before considering any changes. The spokesman declined to speculate what could happen under Trump. 'We support the efforts of the United States Border Patrol, who have an extremely challenging and dangerous job,' the spokesman said.

Sanctuary cities plan to resist Trump's mass deportation plans	(NewsNation) — Ahead of a Donald Trump presidency, leaders in sanctuary cities insist they will not aid any mass deportation plans after Inauguration Day. In states like Colorado, Illinois and New York, where hundreds of thousands of migrants have been bused from the southern border by GOP Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, officials have doubled down on their promise to protect newcomers. Los Angeles became the latest city to approve sanctuary status after the City Council unanimously approved a measure this week. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The ordinance prohibits the use of city resources for federal immigration enforcement. It could also mean potential legal battles as the Trump administration prepares to use ICE and the military to carry out the campaign promise of mass deportations. An estimated 1.8 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally live in California, more than any other state, with nearly a million in Los Angeles County. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass expedited the sanctuary city ordinance as resistance to Trump's mass deportation plan. In Chicago, where more than 50,000 new arrivals have been sent since 2022, Mayor Brandon Johnson has characterized Trump as a tyrant and says the city’s police force has enough work to do without assisting in apprehending immigrants convicted of serious crimes. 'We’re not going to bend or break or cower to someone’s threat,' Johnson told reporters after the election. 'We’re going to stand up and unite around our shared values, and (residents) have my assurance that I’m going to protect the families of this city.'

(Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Johnson previously targeted his anger at Abbott, who threatened to keep sending busloads of immigrants to cities like Chicago until the White House committed to securing the southern border. But Trump and Tom Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Trump’s 'border czar,' are promising to withhold federal funding if Democrat-run cities don’t cooperate, leading some leaders in those places to push back even harder. Survey: Nearly half migrants experienced gun violence in home countries 'Our city’s police department is not going to (double) as ICE agents — we’re just not going to do that,' Chicago’s mayor said. 'It’s a dangerous precedent where members of communities begin to feel unsafe with their local police department.' Chicago police declined to make anyone available for an interview with NewsNation. In response to Democratic pushback in cities like Chicago, Homan has issued a warning. 'If you’re not going to help us, get the hell out of the way because we’re going to do it,' Homan told Fox News. The standoff has created some backlash in Chicago, where Johnson’s stand to remain a welcoming city for immigrants isn’t shared by some other city leaders. 'We need those funds like you wouldn’t believe,' Alderman Anthony Napolitano told NewsNation. 'The city is in so much disarray … it’s been catastrophic for the city of Chicago, and if you take away those federal funds, it’s only going to get worse for us here.' The pushback against Operation Aurora In Colorado, which Trump targeted during his presidential campaign over the presence of migrants and alleged migrant gang activity at an Aurora apartment complex, officials are also bracing for what could be coming. Trump told supporters that he would deport violent criminals by sending 'elite squads' of federal agents to 'hunt down, arrest and deport' every single illegal alien. He called the plan 'Operation Aurora,' referencing the Denver suburb. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis told Colorado Public Radio that while he welcomes federal assistance in tracking down and apprehending immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes or belong to gangs, the state’s support for Trump’s plans ended there.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) 'Obviously, it would devastate our economy and our society if someone were to come in and forcibly take our neighbors away from us,' Polis told the station. As far as local police involvement in Trump’s proposed crackdown on immigrant criminals, Aurora’s police department says it will remain focused on dealing with local law enforcement. 'As we always have, we will work with our federal partners and follow federal law and directives as they apply to our community,' an Aurora city spokesman said in a statement provided to NewsNation. Trump’s immigration grand strategy casts wide net Police in Denver, where around 45,000 migrants have been sent by Abbott since 2022, told NewsNation that it does not assist with the enforcement of federal immigration policy as part of city statutes. In addition, a department spokesperson said Denver police do not ask witnesses or victims of crime about immigration status, removing a potential barrier to reporting crimes and holding offenders accountable. Tom Homan targets New York City’s approach New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams has denounced Trump’s mass deportation plans for a city that has spent more than $5 billion in housing costs for the more than 200,000 migrants that have been sent there since 2022. The New York Times reported that Manuel Castro, New York’s commissioner of migrant affairs, has vowed not to follow 'the instructions of the federal government in cases of mass deportations.' Like other sanctuary cities, New York has provisions in place to limit its participation with federal immigration enforcement. That doesn’t prohibit ICE from apprehending immigrants who reside in New York City but who are not U.S. citizens, the report said. While ICE’s 287(g) Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes local police departments to deputize officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement efforts, the New York Police Department does not participate in those efforts, The New York Times reported. Since 2014, the city has declined to honor ICE detention orders that would involve the city’s police department holding immigrants in the U.S. illegally who have been charged with crimes in custody until they can be picked up. However, under New York law, criminals who have been convicted of 170 serious offenses — including murder and rape — are not protected. But Homan has pledged to send more federal agents to apprehend convicted immigrants in New York should city officials refuse to cooperate. 'We’re going to do the job,' Homan said in an interview with Fox News. 'We’re going to do the job with you or without you.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/sanctuary-cities-trump-deportation-plans/	2024-11-20T16:33:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/AP23212663498953.jpg?w=900
Musk, Ramaswamy lay out plans for 'mass' federal layoffs, rule ro...	(The Hill) — Tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy said Wednesday that their brand-new government efficiency panel will identify 'thousands' of regulations for President-elect Donald Trump to eliminate, which they argue will justify 'mass head-count reductions' across government. The pair, who were named co-chairs of the panel last week, laid out their plans for the 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. What is Elon Musk’s plan for DOGE? 'The two of us will advise DOGE at every step to pursue three major kinds of reform: regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions and cost savings,' they wrote. 'We will focus particularly on driving change through executive action based on existing legislation rather than by passing new laws.' Musk and Ramaswamy pointed to several recent Supreme Court decisions that have taken aim at the power of the administrative state, arguing that a 'plethora of current federal regulations' exceed agency authority and could be on the chopping block. Slashing regulations should allow for 'at least' proportional cuts to the government workforce, they argue. 'A drastic reduction in federal regulations provides sound industrial logic for mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy,' the pair wrote in the op-ed. 'Not only are fewer employees required to enforce fewer regulations, but the agency would produce fewer regulations once its scope of authority is properly limited,' they added. Musk and Ramaswamy preemptively addressed arguments about civil service protections that could potentially block Trump from firing federal workers. 'The purpose of these protections is to protect employees from political retaliation,' they wrote. 'But the statute allows for ‘reductions in force’ that don’t target specific employees. The statute further empowers the president to ‘prescribe rules governing the competitive service.’ That power is broad.' Elon Musk is hiring for DOGE. Here’s the type of people he wants to recruit 'With this authority, Mr. Trump can implement any number of ‘rules governing the competitive service’ that would curtail administrative overgrowth, from large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area,' they added. Government workers are already mobilizing in the face of potential mass cuts, reportedly hiring lawyers and preparing public campaigns while also hoping Congress will step in, according to Reuters. DOGE also hopes to take aim at 'unauthorized' federal funding, which could impact everything from veterans’ health care and opioid addiction treatment to NASA, The Washington Post reported. The op-ed seemingly seeks to address widespread skepticism about the ability of Musk and Ramaswamy’s panel to enact change. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

However, Musk’s close relationship with the president-elect could be influential. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO played a key role in Trump’s campaign, contributing millions of dollars to his own pro-Trump super PAC and getting out on the campaign trail. Trump said he can’t run in 2028 unless the GOP figures ‘something’ out: Could that happen? Since Trump’s decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this month, Musk has remained close at hand; the billionaire tech mogul joined the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago on election night to watch the results roll in and later received a shoutout in Trump’s victory speech. Musk has spent much of his time at the Palm Beach, Fla., resort over the past two weeks, reportedly weighing in on Trump’s Cabinet picks and attending meetings, including those with world leaders. He also hosted Trump in Texas to observe the launch of a SpaceX rocket Tuesday afternoon.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-musk-ramaswamy-mass-layoffs/	2024-11-20T15:50:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24291821306487_17af5f-e1732133362308.jpg?w=800
Thanksgiving will cost less this year, here's which items are che...	(NewsNation) — Thanksgiving dinner will cost less this year thanks to lower turkey prices, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s annual survey released Wednesday. The survey found that a classic feast for 10 will cost $58.08 this year, a 5% decrease from 2023 and down from a record high of $64.05 in 2022. It's the second year in a row that American families can expect to spend less on Thanksgiving dinner, but the cost is still almost 20% higher than before the pandemic in 2019. 'We are seeing modest improvements in the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for a second year, but America’s families, including farm families, are still being hurt by high inflation,' AFBF President Zippy Duvall said in a statement. This year's decline is partially due to lower turkey prices, which have dropped 6% from a year ago despite a bird flu outbreak. 'The American turkey flock is the smallest it’s been since 1985 because of avian influenza, but overall, demand has also fallen, resulting in lower prices at the grocery store for families planning a holiday meal,' AFBF economist Bernt Nelson said in a statement. How will Trump's tariffs impact everyday Americans? How much does Thanksgiving food cost in 2024? Thanksgiving staples, like pumpkin pie mix, vegetables and sweet potatoes, are less expensive than a year ago. The cost of whole milk has dropped more than other items, falling 14% from a year earlier because of favorable weather conditions for dairy farmers, AFBF said. Meanwhile, a pound of frozen peas is down to $1.73, an 8% decline from 2023. But it's not all good news. The survey found some prices, particularly processed food, have gone up. Corporate greed not the main driver of inflation: Fed study Items like dinner rolls and cubed stuffing saw an 8% increase due to higher labor costs. Cranberry prices have also shot up, almost 12% year over year, though that's still in line with historical averages, the AFBF said. There were also regional differences in the cost of a meal. Those celebrating in the West can expect to spend at least 15% more than the rest of the country: $67.81 for a party of 10. Southern dinners will cost the least at $56.81, followed closely by the Northeast at $57.36 and $58.90 in the Midwest, according to the survey. Grocery inflation has slowed down The AFBF's report is a promising sign that Americans are finally seeing some relief at the grocery store. Since Jan. 2021, grocery bills are up more than 22%, according to government inflation data. However, the rise in grocery prices has slowed significantly since the start of 2024, hovering around a 1% annual rate. The American Farm Bureau Federation’s 39th annual Thanksgiving dinner survey comes from Farm Bureau shoppers who checked store prices between Nov. 1 and 7 across all 50 states and Puerto Rico. The AFBF said the shoppers didn't take advantage of special promotions and collected the data before most grocery chains started discounting turkey prices.

Speaker Johnson: Capitol bathrooms restricted by 'biological sex'	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — House Speaker Mike Johnson signaled support Tuesday for a Republican effort to ban Democrat Sarah McBride — the first transgender person to be elected to Congress — from using women’s restrooms in the Capitol once she's sworn into office next year. 'All single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings — such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms — are reserved for individuals of that biological sex,' a statement from Johnson said in part. A resolution proposed Monday by GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina would prohibit any lawmakers and House employees from 'using single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex.' Mace said the bill is aimed specifically at McBride, who was elected to the House this month from Delaware. Nancy Mace: Capitol transgender bathroom rules protect women 'It’s the height of hypocrisy and gaslighting to tell women, you lose your rights, and then a man walks in the room. I don’t think so,' Mace said Tuesday on NewsNation’s 'On Balance.' 'I’m very socially sensible, but this is about women’s safety. It’s about women’s security, it’s about women’s privacy, and we have rights.' The debate over whether transgender people should be allowed to use the bathrooms that align with their gender identity has been prevalent across the U.S. and was a focal point of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign. At least 11 states have adopted laws barring transgender girls and women from girls and women’s bathrooms at public schools and in some cases other government facilities. McBride was elected to the House this month after building a national profile as an LGBTQ+ activist and raising more than $3 million in campaign contributions from around the country. She became the first openly transgender person to address a major party convention in the United States in 2016 when she spoke at the Democratic National Convention. 'We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care and child care, not manufacturing culture wars,' McBride said. 'Delawareans sent me here to make the American dream more affordable and accessible, and that’s what I’m focused on.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/mike-johnson-capitol-bathrooms-restricted-biological-sex/	2024-11-20T11:54:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2184995458.jpg?w=900
Gaetz meets with GOP senators as Dems ask FBI for more info	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's choice for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, has launched an effort to secure his embattled nomination, meeting behind closed doors Wednesday with GOP senators who have questions about sexual misconduct and other allegations against him. Gaetz’s move came as Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray asking for 'the complete evidentiary file' from the agency’s investigation into allegations of sex trafficking of minors against Gaetz. The Democratic senators, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, say the allegations against Gaetz are 'significant' in light of his associate, Joe Greenberg, having pleaded guilty to the sex trafficking charge for which the Florida Republican was also investigated. Republicans on Ethics Committee weigh ‘unenviable’ Gaetz report decision 'In order for the Senate to perform its constitutional duty in this instance, we must be able to thoroughly review all relevant materials that speak to the credibility of these serious allegations against Mr. Gaetz,' the senators wrote in their Wednesday letter to Wray. The senators wrote that 'the grave public allegations against Mr. Gaetz speak directly to his fitness to serve as the chief law enforcement officer for the federal government.' The letter was signed by Durbin and Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal, Conn.; Sheldon Whitehouse, R.I.; Amy Klobuchar, Minn.; Mazie Hirono, Hawaii; Laphonza Butler, Calif.; Chris Coons, Del.; Peter Welch, Vt.; Cory Booker, N.J.; and Alex Padilla, Calif. As Gaetz and senators holed up near the Senate, members of the House Ethics Committee were expected to be meeting to discuss the findings of a long-running investigation of their former colleague. Attorneys involved in a civil case brought by a Gaetz associate were notified this week that an unauthorized person accessed a file shared between lawyers that included unredacted depositions from a woman who said Gaetz had sex with her when she was 17 and a second woman who says she saw the encounter, according to attorney Joel Leppard. Trump interviewing candidates for FBI chief, Vance says in later-deleted social media post While House Speaker Mike Johnson has said the Ethics Committee should not release the report — since Gaetz swiftly resigned his congressional seat — several GOP senators have indicated they want all information before having to make a decision on how they would vote. Sen. Tommy Tuberville told NewsNation he’s waiting for more facts to come out. 'I'm fully supportive of (Gaetz). I just say, make sure you're transparent,' Tuberville said. 'We don't need things popping up. I'm not into rumors, because I know how this place is, they will ruin you in a heartbeat with rumors. But I'm all in with facts. And if it's all factual in terms of something that could be construed as criminal, then of course, I won't vote for it, but and (Gaetz) knows that.' As soon as the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3, when Republicans take majority control, senators are expected to begin holding hearings on Trump's nominees, with voting possible on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20.

Susan Smith denied parole after serving 30 years for sons' murder...	Editor's note: This article mentions suicide and domestic violence. People seeking help or experiencing a crisis can dial 988 to reach the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline or 1-800-799-7233 to contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline. (NewsNation) — A South Carolina parole board denied Susan Smith’s release Wednesday, nearly 30 years after she received a life sentence for murdering her 3-year-old and infant sons. Smith’s voice shook as she spoke to board members over a video call and expressed remorse for the boys’ deaths. She told the parole board that she’s a Christian and asked them to show her 'that same kind of mercy, as well.' 'I know that what I did was horrible,' she said, wiping her eyes. 'And I would give anything if I could go back and change it. I love Michael and Alex with all my heart.' Toys &amp; pics of Michael &amp; Alex Smith at John D.

Campbell/Getty Images) Smith was sentenced to life in prison in 1994 for the deaths of her 3-year-old son Michael and 14-month-old Alex. She initially told police a carjacker took off with her children still inside the vehicle. The case drew international attention as Smith pleaded with the media and public to help locate her children for nine days. Eventually, Smith admitted she strapped her two sons into car seats and drove onto a boat ramp at a South Carolina lake, where she let the vehicle roll into the water with her sons still in the back seats. 'I didn’t lie to get away with it,' Smith said through tears. 'I really didn’t. I was just scared. I didn’t know how to tell the people who loved them that they’d never see them again. How could I tell David he couldn’t see his sons again?' 'I’m sorry,' she continued. 'I know that’s not enough. I know it’s not. I know they just sound like words, but they come from my heart. They really do.' This story is developing.

Hannah Kobayashi: Family searches for woman who went missing in L...	(NewsNation) — Family members of Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi are in Los Angeles to search for her after the 31-year-old went missing on a trip to California earlier this month. According to the Los Angeles Police Department's Missing Persons Unit, Kobayashi is 5 feet, 10 inches tall, and weighs about 140 pounds. She has brown hair and eyes, and fair skin with freckles, as well as a tattoo that says 'knife' on her forearm. Kobayashi's family last heard from her on Nov. 11, when she started sending them 'alarming' text messages, NewsNation local affiliate KTLA reported. Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator What is known about Hannah Kobayashi's disappearance KTLA wrote that Kobayashi, on Nov. 8, missed a connecting flight from Los Angeles to New York City, where she was planning to visit family. The day after, Kobayashi decided to go to The Grove shopping center for a two-day Lebron James event, which she posted about on Instagram. While she was at The Grove on Nov. 9, Kobayashi was seen by employees at the Taschen bookstore, Larie Pidgeon, Kobayashi's aunt, told USA Today. New video, texts shows Laken Riley’s last moments On Nov. 11, according to the Los Angeles Times, Kobayashi went back to Los Angeles International Airport, though without getting onboard a flight. Family members confirmed to KTLA that they also saw footage of Kobayashi near the Pico Metro Station in downtown Los Angeles. 'I miss her,' Kobayashi's father Ryan said in an interview with KTLA. 'Just want her to know that, and just want her to reach out — anything.' Kobayashi sent 'strange' text messages, family says Pidgeon said it was when Kobayashi went back to the airport that she started sending the family 'alarming' text messages. 'She mentioned feeling scared, and that someone might be trying to steal her money and identity,' her aunt said to KTLA. 'Strange, cryptic messages — things about the matrix, it was so unlike her. And then all of a sudden, no more communication.' Kobayashi's sister started a GoFundMe to assist with search efforts.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/hannah-kobayashi-maui-woman-missing-los-angeles/	2024-11-20T07:00:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/HannahKobayashi.jpg?w=229
Republicans on Ethics Committee weigh 'unenviable' Gaetz report d...	Republicans on the House Ethics Committee are barreling into a no-win situation ahead of their expected meeting Wednesday to discuss their report into former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), weighing a high-stakes decision that will reverberate throughout Washington. The gathering for the panel — which is known for conducting its business in secrecy — comes as the debate over releasing their report into Gaetz, President-elect Trump’s pick for attorney general, has reached a fever pitch. One one side, Democrats on the committee — and several Republicans in Congress — say the report contains information that the public and senators should know as they consider whether to make Gaetz the head of an agency that once investigated him. On the other end is Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who is arguing that releasing the report — which is the culmination of a roughly three-year investigation — could damage the House since the panel would be in the rare, but not unprecedented, situation of publishing information on a former member. Caught in the center of that conversation are the Republicans on the panel, led by committee Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.), who have not yet disclosed where they stand despite incessant questions from reporters. Guest has only confirmed that the report exists and that all members of the committee have access to it. 'There’s not enough money in the world to pay me to serve on the Ethics Committee right now,' one House Republican said. 'Those members are definitely in an unenviable position.' With all Democrats expected to support releasing the report, just one Republican would be needed to achieve a majority vote and unleash the body of work. The committee is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, a structure intended to ensure that the panel — which polices its own members — does not act as a partisan weapon. Members of the panel have not confirmed that they will vote on the report's release Wednesday, but Democrats on the committee say they want to hold that referendum when they gather as a full group for the first time since Gaetz’s nomination and resignation. Members of each party have huddled separately since last week’s developments. Such a vote, however, would force the GOP lawmakers into a tough position: vote to release the report and risk being the target of Trump’s wrath, or side with Gaetz — whom many Republicans loathe — and keep the allegedly damaging information private as the former congressman moves forward in the confirmation process to become attorney general. Other Republicans are aware of those circumstances — and relieved they are not in the same position. A second House Republican said they do not envy the situation Republicans on the panel are in. 'I also wouldn’t want to be in a train wreck even if I survived,' they added. A third House Republican, however, said the predicament is not very complicated. They predicted that there is a good chance enough GOP members on the committee vote to release the report because several of the members clearly dislike Gaetz and will not be deterred by potential backlash. 'I don't think it's going to cause them a lot of heartache,' the member said, adding that the more moderate GOP members of the panel are used to taking tough votes, and can 'take that vote all day and still get reelected and walk around here.' Wednesday’s meeting comes as pressure is mounting on both sides of the disclosure debate. Rep. Susan Wild (Pa.), the top Democrat on the Ethics Committee, told reporters Monday that she had read the report and that she thinks it should be released. On Tuesday, 97 Democrats penned a letter to the panel asking that it 'immediately release' the report out of concern that concealing the information could 'jeopardize' the Senate’s confirmation process. And House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) responded with a succinct 'yes' when asked if the panel should release its report publicly. A number of Republicans have echoed the desire to release the report, at least to the senators considering his confirmation. 'I think we need to see it for confirmation purposes,' Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), who has harshly criticized Gaetz in the past, told reporters Tuesday. Mullin is close with former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who was ousted in a coup led by Gaetz. Mullin said he has talked to McCarthy multiple times over the last week but declined to share the former Speaker’s thoughts on Gaetz. Johnson, meanwhile, has consistently — and strongly — reiterated the Gaetz Ethics report should not see the light of day because the Florida Republican does not currently serve in the House. 'Matt Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress, and so we don’t issue Ethics reports on nonmembers,' Johnson reiterated on Tuesday. 'I think it’s an important guardrail for us to maintain for the interest of the institution.' Johnson said that he has spoken to Gaetz since his resignation but they have not discussed the reporting, contending that it would not be 'appropriate' to talk about the matter with him. 'This is my own opinion and I expressed the opinion before I talked with Matt,' Johnson said. The conversation surrounding Gaetz’s Ethics report broke out last week, after Trump shocked Washington and selected the Florida Republican to be attorney general. Gaetz resigned from Congress shortly after the pick. Johnson, who broke the news of Gaetz’s departure, told reporters that he was leaving early to quicken the process for filling his seat in the lower chamber. The development, however, came days before the House Ethics Committee was scheduled to vote on releasing the Gaetz report, raising questions about the true motive behind his resignation. The Ethics Committee investigated Gaetz for years over allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other claims. Gaetz, whom the Justice Department declined to charge after investigating similar matters, has vigorously denied wrongdoing. 'It’s very suspicious that he all of a sudden resigned because other members who are being nominated for posts have not resigned,' Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.) said last week, adding that 'most people' in the House GOP conference believe he departed to try to stop the report from coming out. Gaetz’s departure has muddied the path forward for the Ethics Committee, throwing the panel into a crisis as it debates the precedent that releasing the report may set. The Speaker has argued that such a move would break a long-standing 'rule' of the panel not publishing information on former members of Congress, even though there are previous examples of the current situation. In 1987, the panel released its report into former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House. And in 2011, the Senate Ethics Committee released its preliminary report into former Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) after he departed the chamber. Johnson, however, rejected past circumstances, arguing that they were aberrations of the norm. 'It’s a very important rule that should be maintained,' Johnson said last week. 'If it's been broken once or twice it should not have been because that would be a Pandora’s box. I think it’s a very important position to maintain regardless of what the circumstances [are].'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/republicans-on-ethics-committee-weigh-unenviable-gaetz-report-decision/	2024-11-20T04:48:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_043024gn03_w.jpg?w=900
Jose Ibarra trial Day 4: Defense expected to call final witnesses	(NewsNation) — Defense attorneys will call their last witnesses on the fourth day of the trial for Jose Ibarra, the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley earlier this year. Jose Ibarra, 26, will not be one of these witnesses. After being read his rights in both English and Spanish, Jose Ibarra chose not to testify on his own behalf. Diego Ibarra, Jose's brother, was called to the witness stand on Tuesday, but was rushed off after the court learned his lawyer did not want him to speak because of the fake green card case against him. It is possible Diego Ibarra will be called back to the stand Wednesday. Diddy hit with 5 new lawsuits, including alleged teen sexual assault On Feb. 22, Riley was reported missing when she didn’t return home from a run. Investigators later discovered her body in a forested area on the University of Georgia campus in Athens. UGA police arrested Jose Ibarra the next day. Before prosecutors wrapped up their case, attorneys revealed brand new video from the last time 22-year-old Riley was seen alive, showing her running on a trail on the University of Georgia's campus just minutes before she dialed 911. Another video, which the prosecution said showed Jose Ibarra on the morning Riley died, allegedly showed Ibarra lurking around the trail and trying to break into a young woman's apartment. Approximately one hour after this video was taken, prosecutors said, Jose Ibarra and Riley's cell phones pinged at identical locations near the scene of the crime. A minute-by-minute timeline of Riley's final moments was revealed through calls and texts from her phone. At 8:55 a.m. that morning, Riley texted her mother, 'Good morning, about to go for a run if you're free to talk.' Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security Then, at 9:03 a.m., Riley called her mom, who did not pick up. Riley's moms soon followed up with a number of calls and texts that her daughter did not answer. 'Please call me, I’m worried sick about you,' one of those texts by Riley's mother said. To close their case, the state asked a DNA specialist what she discovered when examining Laken Riley's fingernails. The DNA specialist said fingernail samples matched a profile of Jose Ibarra's blood found on a jacket found in a dumpster. The defense is questioning the prosecution's timeline by calling other witnesses — like a runner who says he saw someone like Jose Ibarra on the trail — although his timeline does not match up identically to the one that's been presented by prosecutors. Jose Ibarra, a Venezuelan national who Customs and Border Patrol sources tell NewsNation has ties to the Tren De Aragua gang, would spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty to murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, battery and tampering with evidence charges.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jose-ibarra-trial-day-4/	2024-11-20T04:25:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24323563549427.jpg?w=900
Nancy Mace: Capitol transgender bathroom rules protect women	(NewsNation) — Republican Rep. Nancy Mace said she's going to 'fight like hell' for a resolution that would keep Sarah McBride from using the women's bathroom. 'It's the height of hypocrisy and gaslighting to tell women, you lose your rights, and then a man walks in the room. I don't think so,' Mace said on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' 'I'm very socially sensible, but this is about women's safety. It's about women's security, it's about women's privacy, and we have rights.' On Monday, Mace introduced a resolution requiring all individuals in the Capitol complex to use bathrooms matching their sex assigned at birth, a move that has sparked controversy as McBride, the first openly transgender House member, prepares to take office. The measure charges the House sergeant-at-arms, William McFarland, with enforcing the ban, according to text previewed by The Hill, but it is unclear how the House’s chief law enforcement officer will determine who can and cannot use the Capitol’s facilities. House Republicans signal support for proposal to ban bathroom access for 1st transgender member State laws that bar transgender people from using public restrooms that match their gender identity often rely on anonymous complaints, a notoriously unreliable enforcement mechanism. LGBTQ+ rights activists in May flooded a tip line designed to alert officials in Utah to possible violations of the state’s bathroom ban with thousands of false complaints. Trump picks Sean Duffy to be transportation secretary Mace is pushing for the measure to be included in the rules package for the 119th Congress or for it to be brought to the floor and voted on as a standalone rule outside the package. If the bill, however, is not included in the 119th Congress rules package or brought to the floor as a standalone rule, Mace would force a vote on the legislation, the source said. The House is set to vote on a rules package for the next Congress in early January, which will require a majority vote for passage. Republicans are poised to have a razor-thin majority when the next session gavels in. McBride, who is set to assume her new position early next year, said on X that Mace’s resolution is 'a blatant attempt' to 'distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing.' This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing.

Diddy hit with 5 new lawsuits, including alleged teen sexual assa...	(NewsNation) — Five new lawsuits accusing Sean 'Diddy' Combs of sexual abuse were filed Tuesday by Texas lawyer Tony Buzbee, according to court documents obtained by NewsNation. One woman alleges that at 18 years old, she was drugged and coerced into performing oral sex on Combs and his bodyguard outside a Halloween party at a New York City nightclub in 2001. Another woman says that at 17 years old, she attended a Fourth of July party in 2004 where Combs sexually assaulted her while she was unconscious, according to the lawsuit. Combs and two of his bodyguards approached the victim after the assault and threatened her, telling her that she 'would be in danger if she spoke about what had occurred,' stating that he 'ran New York and would ruin her,' the lawsuit alleges. 'The Buzbee Law Firm, along with co-counsel AVA Law Group and New York local counsel Curis Law, is filing five more cases today alleging aggravated sexual assault, sexual abuse, and sexual exploitation against Sean 'Diddy' Combs and those entities with whom he has been affiliated,' Buzbee shared on Instagram. Diddy court witness says he saw 8 sex tapes with at least 2 celeb minors Buzbee added that 'several other individuals are referenced in the case filings but are not at this time formerly named as defendants. The cases are being brought for conduct that occurred as far back as the year 2001.' Buzbee said the conduct allegedly took place in New York and Miami, adding that three of the victims are male and two are female. 'We will let the allegations in the filed complaints speak for themselves, and will work to see that justice is done,' Buzbee said. 'We expect to be filing cases weekly naming Mr. Combs and others as defendants as we continue to gather evidence and prepare the filings.' In October, Buzbee, a lawyer from Houston, announced he was representing 120 people who plan on filing lawsuits saying they have experienced sexual misconduct from Combs, including 25 minors. Buzbee said the alleged victims are 60 men and 60 women, of whom 25 were minors at the time of the alleged misconduct. The youngest, Buzbee said, was 9. 'I imagine there’s a myriad of people who are nervous,' Buzbee said. 'You can’t hide skeletons in the closet forever.' Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he 'led a racketeering conspiracy that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice, among other crimes. ' Combs is currently seeking to be placed on house arrest through a $50 million bail package. Last week, prosecutors said Combs has been trying to dodge scrutiny of his jailhouse communications while orchestrating social media campaigns aimed at tainting the jury pool and trying to publicly leak materials he views are helpful to his case. They said he also has contacted witnesses through third parties.

Texas offers Trump 1,400 borderland acres for deportation plans	(NewsNation) — Texas officials have offered to lease more than 1,400 acres of state-owned borderland to President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration to construct deportation facilities, according to a letter from the Texas General Land Office (GLO) obtained Tuesday. Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham in a letter to Trump said, ' I am writing to formally offer 1,402 acres of land in Starr County, Texas, to be used to construct deportation facilities.' The property, located approximately 35 miles west of McAllen in Starr County, was recently acquired by the GLO. The letter reveals that within 24 hours of the Oct. 23 purchase, Buckingham approved a 7,681-foot border wall easement across the property. National Guard training for mass illegal crossings at border The letter details GLO's recent border security initiatives, including 'Operation Flat Top,' which secured a 170-acre island in the Rio Grande previously described by state authorities as 'the most dangerous part of the Texas border.' Buckingham stated the land could be used for 'processing, detention, and coordination of the largest deportation of violent criminals in the nation's history' in cooperation with federal agencies including the Department of Homeland Security and Border Patrol. The Texas GLO, which oversees 13 million acres of state lands, confirmed the offer through a spokesperson. This comes as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott plans to expand buoy barriers across the Rio Grande to stop migrants from crossing the southern border despite border crossings dropping in the state. Senate report claims Biden failures in protecting migrant children Abbott has maintained that Texas will have a proactive versus reactive stance at the border and will be prepared should a surge happen ahead of Trump’s inauguration. Border officials are now training for an expected surge in migrant crossings before President-elect Donald Trump takes the White House. The Texas National Guard is holding exercises in conjunction with the Texas Department of Public Safety along the Southern border in Eagle Pass on Tuesday. These proactive measures began last week with groups split to cover more ground across the vast Southern border.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/texas-trump-land-deportation/	2024-11-19T17:26:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66ecf60a2ec438.97773877.jpeg?w=900
Trump expected to name Linda McMahon as education secretary: Repo...	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Linda McMahon as education secretary, CNN reported on Tuesday, citing four sources familiar with the matter, putting the former pro-wrestling mogul at the helm of a department Trump has proposed abolishing. McMahon, who had been in the running for commerce secretary, headed up the Small Business Administration in Trump's first administration and was a major donor and early supporter of the Republican president-elect when he first ran for the White House almost a decade ago. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The co-founder and former CEO of the WWE professional wrestling franchise, she resigned from the SBA in 2019 to lead the pro-Trump spending group America First Action. She also chairs the America First Policy Institute, a Trump-friendly think tank. Trump tapped her to co-lead a transition team formed to help vet personnel and draft policy ahead of the Nov. 5 election. McMahon had been in the mix to head the Commerce Department, but Trump on Tuesday instead chose her transition team co-leader - Cantor Fitzgerald Chief Executive Howard Lutnick - for that post. Now she will lead an agency Trump said on the campaign trail that he would abolish, although he likely lacks authority to do it without congressional approval.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/linda-mcmahon-education-secretary/	2024-11-19T16:19:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2161971102.jpg?w=900
Floridians face slow recovery after back-to-back hurricanes	(NewsNation) — In Treasure Island, Florida, just west of Tampa, residents are still struggling to recover after being hit by back-to-back hurricanes. Areas off the Gulf of Mexico were hit first by Hurricane Helene, then, a few weeks later, by Hurricane Milton. Now, communities are struggling, with locals packed into hotel rooms that are usually filled with snowbirds this time of year. Floridians are frustrated with how slow the process has been. The two storms came 13 days apart, and almost two months after Hurricane Helene, damage is still visible. How to help Helene and Milton survivors In one apartment complex, sand is still pushed up in banks against the wall, and a couch that came through one of the windows thanks to a powerful storm surge is still visible. About 2,000 homes and businesses on Treasure Island alone were impacted by the storms. One resident told NewsNation she was frustrated by the struggle to get permits for repairs. She and her mother own a number of apartment complexes and have had annual renters back out and vacation bookings canceled all the way through January. The city of Treasure Island has had more than 700 requests for permits since the storms when it usually manages around 1,600 a year. For officials at all levels, local, state and federal, it's been difficult to keep up with demand, and they are asking people to be patient. 'We've never had to really do it on this large of a scale, and so the city is figuring out, the states' figuring it out,' said city spokesperson Jason Biesel. 'People are realizing what it means to live on a barrier island to have to go through all this rebuilding process, and so it's just been a learning experience for everybody.' Biesel said that it was terrible to see the damage to homes and businesses but asked for people to be patient. At another hotel, the general manager told NewsNation that 100% of the occupancy in the 96-room hotel is due to people who have been displaced in the community. Live: Congress questions FEMA about hurricane relief The Federal Emergency Management Agency is actually picking up the tab for those people through January if needed. The city has given a rough timeline of summer of 2025 for full recovery in a community that relies heavily on tourism, with an $11 billion dollar impact in Pinellas County alone. Anywhere from 11 to 15 million people come through, and this is usually the time of year when many people winter in the area. However, with bars, restaurants and hotels too damaged to operate or occupied by those who have been displaced, there are fewer options for snowbirds who would usually come to the area.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/florida-slow-recovery-hurricanes/	2024-11-19T14:14:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176610127.jpg?w=900
Susan Smith up for parole 30 years after killing her sons	(NewsNation) — Thirty years after she killed her two children, Susan Smith is now eligible for parole, raising the question of whether she will get out of prison. Susan Smith initially told law enforcement that a man carjacked her and took off with her two children still inside the car in 1994. Smith, who is white, identified the carjacker as Black when she described the alleged late-night carjacking near Union, South Carolina. RFK Jr.’s support of raw milk sheds light on debate Smith pleaded with the media and public for help locating three-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex, attracting international attention to the case. For nine days, she appeared on TV begging for help. But elements of her story didn't add up, including her description of the carjacking and why the carjacker would release her but keep her young children. Eventually, Smith admitted to strapping her two sons into car seats in the back of her car and driving it onto a boat ramp at a South Carolina lake, letting the vehicle roll into the water with her children inside, Smith said she was having an affair and the man that she was cheating with didn't want kids. Now, 30 years later, Smith is eligible for parole. That angers investigators like Union County Sheriff Jeff Bailey, who says Smith deserves to spend every day of her life behind bars, even if she's already been locked up for 30 years. 'Those kids didn't have a chance and I don't think she deserves one,' Bailey said. 'She still killed her kids, that is the bottom line That is [her] blood, [she] chose to let them go into the water and drown. That is a horrible death.' Smith's parole hearing is set for Wednesday morning, where she will make her case for release. Las Vegas home invasion suspect wanted police to kill her: Docs During the trial, Smith's lawyers said she was experiencing a mental breakdown and had intended to stay in the car with her sons but had exited at the last minute. Smith has also made claims that her then-husband abused her, something he has denied. During her time in prison, Smith has faced trouble multiple times, for everything from using drugs to having sex with prison guards.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/susan-smith-up-parole-30-years/	2024-11-19T13:04:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/05/gettyimages-525637762-594x594-2.jpg?w=594
40 inmates are on federal death row. Advocates want Biden to spar...	(NewsNation) — Hundreds of anti-capital punishment groups are calling on President Joe Biden to commute federal death row sentences during his remaining months in office fearing a renewed 'execution spree' under President-elect Donald Trump. 'Suddenly the whole world has changed and if Joe Biden doesn't commute these sentences, then Donald Trump is going to kill them,' Abraham Bonowitz, the executive director of anti-capital punishment group Death Penalty Action, said. The group has spearheaded a coalition of more than 350 groups that sent Biden a letter 24 hours after the election saying they have 'renewed concern and urgency' with Trump coming into office in less than two months. Which of Biden’s executive orders does Trump plan to undo? They ask Biden to commute death sentences to life in prison without the possibility of parole. 'We can't trust the government with the power to do this and to get it right, and not just in making sure that it's the right person who committed the crime, but also to be fair in the application of the death penalty,' Bonowitz said. There are currently 40 inmates on federal death row and the group includes Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Tree of Life mass shooter Robert Bowers and Dylan Roof, who murdered nine members of a Black South Carolina congregation in a racially motivated attack. Prior to the election, Trump signaled that his new administration would not shy away from the death penalty. 'We’ve never had (such) massive amounts of drugs pouring into our country,' he said during a campaign event in Arizona. 'And by the way, you’ll never solve the problem without the death penalty.' The Biden administration did not return requests for comment from NewsNation. Trump’s record on executions During the last six months of Trump’s first term, a record 13 federal inmates were put to death, with the last execution taking place days before Biden took office. The number far surpasses executions under any president for more than a century. Prior to July 2020, the federal government hadn’t executed anyone in 17 years. In the case of Brandon Bernard — who was convicted of killing an Iowa couple and executed in December 2020 — Trump himself agreed that there might be valid reasons not to proceed, reported the AP. Former President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2024, in Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) Trump’s administration also approved the use of pentobarbital in lethal injections despite evidence it might cause pulmonary edema, a painful condition akin to drowning. Fourteen states have also used pentobarbital in executions and five more are considering using it, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Trump will use ‘military assets’ to remove illegal migrants An autopsy report obtained by the AP for Corey Johnson, convicted of seven drug-related killings in 2021, concluded that during his execution he suffered pulmonary edema. The report showed that so much fluid rushed up his trachea that some exited his mouth. In his second term, Trump indicated he would expand the death penalty for migrants accused of killing U.S. citizens and law enforcement officers, as well as people convicted of drug and human trafficking. 'These are terrible, terrible, horrible people who are responsible for death, carnage and crime all over the country,' Trump said, referring to drug traffickers during an event kicking off his campaign. The Trump campaign did not return requests for comment by NewsNation. Is the death penalty right or wrong? Rev. Sharon Risher’s mother, two cousins and a childhood friend were killed in the Charleston Mother Emanuel Church shooting in 2015 by Roof, who sits on death row. She was the first to sign the letter asking Biden for the commutations. 'Killing Roof is not going to bring my family back. It's not going to erase all the grief and heartache that I have had, and all it's going to do is compound that feeling of wanting somebody to die,' Risher said. Risher has requested a meeting with Biden on behalf of the groups pushing for commutation. She believes the only way of forgetting Roof is to lock him up without any possibility of parole.

On Tuesday, May 25, 2021, Roof, on federal death row for the racist slayings of nine members of a Black South Carolina congregation, is making his appellate argument that his conviction and death sentence should be overturned. (Grace Beahm/The Post And Courier via AP, Pool, File) 'There will be no appeals, no more hearing from him again, he will be lost in obscurity when it comes to me and that's the best I can hope for, without wanting him to be killed or anybody to be killed,' she said. Trump has promised ‘concealed carry reciprocity.’ What would it do? While Risher is working with the groups pushing to commute death penalty sentences, other victims' family members argue the penalty serves justice. Michele Rosenthal, who lost her brothers in the 2018 Tree of Life massacre that left 11 dead, said she supported the Justice Department's decision to pursue the death penalty in a 2023 interview with Union Progress. 'This massacre was not just a mass murder of innocent citizens during a service in a house of worship,' she said. 'The death penalty must apply to vindicate justice and to offer some measure of deterrence from horrific hate crimes happening again and again.' Seven of the nine families who lost loved ones in the massacre sent a letter in July 2021 to Attorney General Merrick Garland reflecting their support of the death penalty. Can Biden commute all federal death sentences? Biden has the power to commute all the sentences under blanket clemency until his last day in office, said Corinna Barrett Lain, a law professor at the University of Richmond who’s written a forthcoming book on lethal injection. If he doesn’t, Trump 'can move very, very quickly' on executions if that is his priority, she said. There is still a legal process that needs to be followed prior to an execution which includes obtaining a death warrant and that will face expected legal challenges, but it’s not likely those challenges 'would get their due regard' as evidenced during the last Trump administration, she said. President Joe Biden speaks about Hurricane Milton from the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2024. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) The Supreme Court cleared all legal obstacles during Trump’s first term to greenlight executions, even in a case where the appellate court still hadn’t issued a ruling, deemed 'highly unusual' by SCOTUSblog. Across 13 executions the Supreme Court vacated 22 states of executions and injunctions, Lain said. 'The stays of execution were reversed without opinion, without resolution of the constitutional claims on the merits, without explanation, and the prisoners were promptly executed,' she said. While campaigning in 2020, Biden promised to abolish the federal death penalty but has done little to fulfill that pledge after stepping into office. His Justice Department announced a moratorium on federal executions in 2021, which halted executions but the department has since pushed for the death penalty against the suspects charged with mass shootings in Pittsburgh and Buffalo.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/death-row-inmates-trump-biden/	2024-11-19T11:16:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/01/AP22011097759203.jpg?w=900
Trump's hush money case should be paused, prosecutors say	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The case in which Donald Trump was convicted on criminal charges stemming from hush money paid to a porn star should be paused in light of his election victory to allow Trump to seek dismissal, New York prosecutors said on Tuesday. Trump, 78, is hoping to enter office for a second term unencumbered by any of the four criminal cases he has faced and which some said would derail his 2024 candidacy to return to the White House. Manhattan DA opposes Trump’s bid to dismiss hush money conviction Trump was convicted in May of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment his former lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump, who denies it. The case marked the first time a U.S. president - former or sitting - had been convicted of or charged with a criminal offense. Trump had been scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26, but Merchan last week put all proceedings in the case on pause at the request of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office. The prosecutors had asked for more time to consider next steps in the case, citing the need to balance the 'competing interests' between having the criminal case go forward and protecting the office of the president. Trump pleaded not guilty in the case, which he has long portrayed as a politically motivated attempt by Bragg, a Democrat, to interfere with his campaign. His defense lawyers urged Merchan to dismiss the case, arguing that having it loom over him while he was president would cause 'unconstitutional impediments' to his ability to govern. Trump's lawyers also argued his conviction should be vacated and the charges dismissed because of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in July that presidents cannot be prosecuted over their official acts, and that evidence of their official acts cannot be used in trials over personal behavior. Georgia appeals court cancels arguments in Trump’s bid to disqualify Fani Willis Bragg's office said that its case dealt with purely personal conduct. Falsification of business records is punishable by up to four years in prison. Before he was elected, experts said it was unlikely - but not impossible - that Trump would face time behind bars, with punishments such as a fine or probation seen as more likely. Trump's victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election made the prospect of imposing a sentence of jail or probation even more politically fraught and impractical, given that a sentence could have impeded his ability to conduct the duties of the presidency. Trump was indicted on three separate slates of state and federal charges in 2023, one involving classified documents he kept after leaving office and two others involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. A Florida-based federal judge in July dismissed the documents case. The Justice Department is now evaluating how to wind down the federal election-related case. Trump also faces state criminal charges in Georgia over his bid to reverse his 2020 loss in that state, but the case remains in limbo.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/trump-investigation/trump-hush-money-michael-cohen-stormy-daniels/	2024-11-19T10:03:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/Trump-Stormy_AP_Mary-Altaffer-Steven-Hirsch.png?w=900
Hacker gains access to testimony in Gaetz investigations: reports	A hacker gained access to witness testimony related to investigations into former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who resigned from Congress last week after President-elect Trump tapped him for attorney general, multiple news outlets reported Tuesday. The unidentified person, using the name 'Altam Beezley,' downloaded the information on Monday afternoon, according to The New York Times, which was the first to report on the breach. The file contained 24 exhibits and is said to include testimony from a woman who said she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17, and testimony from another woman who said she witnessed the encounter, according to The Times. The Times and CBS News reported that the file is part of a civil defamation case. The Times also reported it includes sealed files from the Justice Department and House Ethics Committee. The materials do not appear to have been made public. Interest in the files may be at an all-time high, given Gaetz's looming confirmation process. The Ethics Committee has been investigating Gaetz for years over allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other claims. Gaetz, whom the Justice Department declined to charge after investigating the same matters, has vigorously denied wrongdoing. The Florida Republican resigned from Congress as the release of the Ethics Committee’s report was imminent, a source familiar with the matter told The Hill last week. While the panel doesn't generally release information about former lawmakers, the committee is facing mounting pressure to make its findings public. Senators on both sides of the aisle have said they would like to see the report as they mull whether to confirm Gaetz as the nation's top prosecutor, and on Monday Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), the top Democrat on the Ethics Committee, said she thinks the report should be released.

RFK Jr.'s support of raw milk sheds light on debate	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, has long been a proponent of natural food choices. One includes raw milk, which has become mainstream in the health and wellness communities recently. Kennedy has admitted when he drinks milk it is solely the unpasteurized variety. Last month, he proclaimed on X the 'FDA's war on public health' would come to an end, including 'aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamins, clean foods, sunshine, exercise, nutraceuticals and anything else that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.' ‘I’m being framed’: Fired FEMA worker Marn’i Washington speaks out The FDA wrote about 'the dangers of raw milk' in May, suggesting it 'can harbor dangerous germs that can pose serious health risks to you and your family.' An April article from the CDC says pasteurization is 'crucial for milk safety, killing harmful germs that can cause illness.' The CDC adds raw milk 'can carry dangerous germs such as Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria, Campylobacter, and others that cause foodborne illness, often called 'food poisoning.' It adds that 2,645 illnesses and 228 hospitalizations occurred between 1998 and 2018 from drinking raw milk. Some champion positive health returns from drinking unpasteurized milk, including raw milk farmer Cliff McConville. 'I can tell you that I used to get sick like three times a year, like, you know, with colds or flu, and I almost never get sick anymore,' McConville said. Farmers and raw milk advocates argue that the dairy industry is against raw milk because it's bad for their bottom line. Conversely, health advocates argue that we have the tools to make milk safer now, and ignoring that is a step backward.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/rfk-support-raw-milk-debate/	2024-11-19T09:51:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2174504226.jpg?w=900
Should women serve in combat roles?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Fox News commentator Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense, sparking controversy over Hegseth's experience and his comments about women in combat. The Defense Secretary nominee has said he doesn't believe women should serve on the front lines in combat roles, raising the possibility he could try to roll back policies that allow women in those jobs. Former U.S. Army Sgt. Kayla Williams served on the front lines in Iraq as a linguist. She told NewsNation that at the time, women were limited in terms of combat roles, which made her work more challenging. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'We know that what really didn't work was to not have women directly assigned to these units, to have women like me just be attached so we hadn't trained as we fought,' she said. 'I didn't know their standard operating procedures. Those programs that had to be stood up like the cultural support teams to fill that gap were just inadequate.' Williams said it is essential that women be able to join the military in all aspects, especially when the service is facing a recruiting shortage. Former U.S. Army Maj. Chase Spears disagrees, saying that while women have proven they can meet the physical standards required for combat roles, they are built differently and still shouldn't be eligible to fill those positions. 'The question is, can women endure the standard day after day, week after week, month after month,' Spears said. Fear of mass deportations spreads in immigrant communities Spears claimed women do poorly in combat roles and said inclusion hasn't made the military more lethal. Williams noted that while women may not always be as strong as men, they bring different skills to the table that can also be critical, like agility. 'We know from examples like the woman recently completing the Appalachian Trail many, many hours faster than anyone else ever has, that women have real advantages when it comes to endurance,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/women-combat-roles/	2024-11-19T08:51:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/64e3ab600fe155.65196006.jpeg?w=900
Okla. Superintendent: I have 'freedom to express' religious belie...	(NewsNation) — Oklahoma Superintendent Ryan Walters defended a controversial video he required public school superintendents to play for students where he prays over Republican President-elect Donald Trump, saying Tuesday that he has 'religious beliefs as well that I get the freedom to express.' In a video to announce the creation of the Education Department's Office of Religious Freedom and Patriotism, Walters said he prays 'for President Donald Trump and his team as they continue to bring about change to the country.' According to a press release, the new office is meant to 'oversee the investigation of abuses to individual religious freedom or displays of patriotism.' ‘I’m being framed’: Fired FEMA worker Marn’i Washington speaks out Speaking on 'Morning in America,' Walters said he made it 'crystal clear' in the video that students don't have to pray if they don't want to. 'We all have the free exercise of our religious beliefs that was essential in the foundation of this country,' Walters said. 'We're going to protect that.' The office of state Attorney General Gentner Drummond issued a statement Friday saying Walters isn't able to issue a mandate that schools watch the video. 'Not only is this edict unenforceable, it is contrary to parents’ rights, local control and individual free-exercise rights,' the statement said. Some school districts, including two of the state's largest, said they do not plan to show the video to students. Walters already faces two lawsuits over his June mandate that schools incorporate the Bible into lesson plans for students in grades 5 through 12. 'Look, every county here voted for President Trump. We want to have prayer back in school,' Walters said. 'President Trump won an overwhelming election speaking unapologetically about getting our schools back on track. Protecting religious liberty is absolutely crucial in that.'

Live: Day 3 in trial of Jose Ibarra	(NewsNation) — The trial for Jose Ibarra, the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, could be ending soon. Prosecutors say they only need half a day more, and the defense says it only plans to call a few witnesses themselves — including Jose Ibarra's brothers, Diego and Argenis. Diego and Argenis Ibarra, who, like Jose are Venezuelan citizens, have been in federal custody since February on charges they had fake green cards. The defense was instructed to bring the brothers to Athens, Georgia one full day ahead of schedule. Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator Tuesday marks the third day of the trial. Over the previous two days, the prosecution has called 19 witnesses. Riley's roommates, police officers and FBI agents all testified. On Monday, police showed body camera footage of the moment they first made contact with Jose Ibarra. Police said they noticed scratches and cuts all over his arms. In video footage from the police, Jose Ibarra was not able to explain where those injuries came from. Prosecutors say these are clear defensive wounds from when Riley was fighting for her life. A technological analysis of Riley's watch revealed the exact moment the 22-year-old stopped dead in her tracks before launching an emergency call to police that was abruptly hung up. An FBI agent said in court Monday that GPS location data from Jose Ibarra's phone puts him in an identical spot as Riley at the exact moment she died. Rep. Nancy Mace introduces Capitol bathroom bill restrictions Defense attorneys for Jose Ibarra continue to say it's still possible someone else might be responsible for the crime. The defense team pointed to the fact that Jose Ibarra and his brothers, who lived together in a one-bedroom apartment near the crime scene, shared clothes like hats and jackets that have been seen on surveillance videos. Jose Ibarra is charged with murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, battery and tampering with evidence. If convicted, faces the possibility of life in prison without the possibility of parole. The 26-year-old has pleaded not guilty on all counts. Riley was reported missing on Feb. 22 when she didn't return home from a run. Investigators later discovered her body in a forested area on the University of Georgia campus. UGA police arrested Jose Ibarra the next day.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jose-ibarra-trial-day-three/	2024-11-19T04:52:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24323563549427.jpg?w=900
Congress to question FEMA about hurricane relief	(NewsNation) — Congress will hear from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Tuesday, following reports that the agency withheld hurricane recovery aid from supporters of President-elect Donald Trump. The Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management will hold a hearing at 10 a.m. ET with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. Questions will focus on the agency’s preparedness and response to recent disasters, including Hurricanes Helene and Milton. NewsNation will stream the event live here. Trump to attend SpaceX ‘Starship’ launch in Texas: Sources A FEMA worker was fired earlier this month after she directed others helping hurricane survivors not to go to homes with yard signs supporting President-elect Donald Trump, according to the agency’s leader. 'This is a clear violation of FEMA’s core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation,' Criswell said in a statement at the time. 'This was reprehensible.' The fired employee, Marn’i Washington, is accused of telling her survivor assistance team not to go to Florida homes with pro-Trump yard signs. Washington told NewsNation she believes she’s being used as a scapegoat for a common agency practice. The instruction to avoid certain houses with certain campaign signs came from her direct superior based on previous team encounters, Washington said, adding that 'safety precautions are not politically driven.' Several recent hostile encounters happened at homes with Trump campaign signs, she said. 'I’m being framed. There’s no violation of the Hatch Act,' Washington said. 'I was simply following orders.'

Top Democrat on House Ethics panel says Gaetz report should be re...	Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), the top Democrat on the House Ethics Committee, said she thinks the panel’s report on former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) should be released. Wild answered 'yes' when asked whether the panel should release its report on Gaetz, who President-elect Trump nominated to be attorney general last week. 'We have a scheduled meeting on Wednesday, and it remains to be seen what the chairman's agenda is for that, but I believe we should vote on whether we're to disclose it or not,' Wild said. Wild, who is leaving Congress at the end of the year after being defeated by Republican challenger Ryan Mackenzie, said that she expected all Democrats to vote in favor of releasing the report. On the evenly split panel with five Republicans and five Democrats, it would take at least one Republican to side with Democrats to vote to release the report. 'Everybody on the committee now has the report, so they've got the opportunity to be reviewing it,' Wild said. Asked about the possibility of releasing the report only to the Senate, Wild said: 'Either you are going to disclose it or you're not going to disclose it.' Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.), the chair of the Ethics Committee, declined to confirm details about the meeting scheduled for Wednesday. Guest did say that he has read the report on Gaetz, and that other members on the panel 'have the ability to read the report.' He declined to offer his thoughts on what the Gaetz report said. The Ethics Committee investigated Gaetz for years over allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other claims. Gaetz, whom the Justice Department declined to charge after investigating the same matters, has vigorously denied wrongdoing. Gaetz abruptly resigned from his seat the same day he was announced as Trump's attorney general pick. A source told The Hill that his resignation came just two days before the committee was scheduled to meet to vote to release the report, but that meeting was later canceled. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has publicly advocated against releasing the report, since Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress and the committee traditionally does not investigate former members. 'I think that would be a Pandora's box. I don't think we want the House Ethics Committee using all of its vast resources and powers to go after private citizens,' Johnson said Sunday on CNN’s 'State of the Union.' While such a move is very rare, there is precedent for the committee releasing a report after a member resigned. In 1987, the committee released its report on former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House. Senators on both sides of the aisle have said they want to see the report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/top-democrat-on-house-ethics-panel-says-gaetz-report-should-be-released/	2024-11-18T16:34:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/wildsusan_110424gn02_w.jpg?w=900
2 women tell Ethics panel Matt Gaetz paid them for sex, attorney ...	(The Hill) -- Two women testified before the House Ethics Committee that former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) paid them to have sex, according to the attorney representing them. Joel Leppard, a Florida-based attorney, made the disclosure in an interview with ABC News that was published Monday. The article does not include the identities of his clients, both of whom are older than 18. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Leppard said the House Ethics Committee and his clients went one by one through a series of Venmo transactions. 'That’s correct,' Leppard told ABC News's Juju Chang when asked if both his clients testified that they were paid by Gaetz to have sex. 'The House was very clear about that and went through each. They essentially put the Venmo payments on the screen and asked about them. And my clients repeatedly testified, ‘What was this payment for?’ ‘Well that was for sex.’' The revelation marks the latest piece of information Leppard has disclosed since President-elect Trump nominated Gaetz to serve as attorney general and the Florida Republican subsequently resigned from the House. Last week, Leppard told ABC News that one of his clients testified that she saw Gaetz having sex with a minor. 'She testified in July of 2017, at this house party, she was walking out to the pool area, and she looked to her right, and she saw Rep. Gaetz having sex with her friend, who was 17,' Leppard said. Leppard told ABC News that the client told the panel she believed Gaetz ended that sexual relationship when he learned the girl was a minor. The House Ethics Committee — which is known for conducting its business in secrecy — had been investigating Gaetz on and off for roughly three years, probing whether he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. The Hill reached out to Gaetz for comment on Leppard’s remarks. Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition, called the allegations 'baseless' in a statement. 'Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He’s the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration,' Pfeiffer said. 'The Biden Justice Department investigated Gaetz for years and cleared him of wrongdoing. The only people who went to prison over these allegations were those lying about Matt Gaetz.' Gaetz’s resignation from Congress has raised questions about whether the Ethics Committee’s highly anticipated report on the Florida Republican will become public. A number of lawmakers in both parties have called on the panel to release it — which would require a majority vote — but others, including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), have pushed for it to remain private. Leppard is one of the voices calling on the Ethics Committee to release its report on Gaetz. Last week he said, 'As the Senate considers former Rep. Gaetz's nomination for attorney general, several questions demand answers.' 'What if multiple credible witnesses provided evidence of behavior that would constitute serious criminal violations?' he added. Former primary challenger to Gaetz considering bid for now-open seat Johnson, meanwhile, has argued that because Gaetz is no longer in Congress, the Ethics Committee’s report is moot. He also warned that releasing the body of work would open a 'Pandora’s box' of the panel releasing reports on individuals who no longer serve in the lower chamber. 'What I have said with regard to the report is that it should not come out. And why? Because Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress. He is no longer a member,' Johnson told CNN’s 'State of the Union' in an interview Sunday. 'There's a very important protocol and tradition and rule that we maintain that the House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to nonmembers of Congress. I think that would be a Pandora's box.' The 9 GOP senators who could derail Trump’s Cabinet picks While releasing an Ethics report after a lawmaker has departed the House is rare, it is not unprecedented. In 1987, the panel published its report on former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he had left the chamber. The House Ethics Committee is slated to meet Wednesday, a source told The Hill, during which the Gaetz report is likely to be discussed. The focus around Gaetz’s Ethics investigation comes after the Department of Justice declined to charge the then-congressman with any crimes in 2017, after its probe had concluded. Investigators had questioned if witnesses at the center of the case would be seen as credible before a jury, according to multiple outlets.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/matt-gaetz-ethics-panel/	2024-11-18T16:06:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_043024gn01_w-e1731971603796.jpg?w=800
Trump picks Sean Duffy to be transportation secretary	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump said Monday he is naming former Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy as his nominee to be transportation secretary, as he continues to roll out picks for his Cabinet. Duffy is a former reality TV star who was one of Trump’s most visible defenders on cable news — a prime concern for the media-focused president-elect. Duffy served in the House for nearly nine years, was a member of the Financial Services Committee and was chairman of the subcommittee on insurance and housing. He left Congress in 2019, and is now co-host of a show on Fox Business, the 'Bottom Line.' Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? In his announcement Monday, Trump noted that Duffy is married to a Fox News host, calling him 'the husband of a wonderful woman, Rachel Campos-Duffy, a STAR on Fox News.' Trump said Duffy would use his experience and relationships built over the years in Congress 'to maintain and rebuild our Nation’s Infrastructure, and fulfill our Mission of ushering in The Golden Age of Travel, focusing on Safety, Efficiency, and Innovation. Importantly, he will greatly elevate the Travel Experience for all Americans!' Duffy in 2022 ruled out a run for Wisconsin governor, despite pleas from Trump to make a bid, saying he needed time to care for the needs of his family of nine children, posting on social media that his youngest child had a heart condition. The 9 GOP senators who could derail Trump’s Cabinet picks He is a former lumberjack athlete and frequent contributor to Fox News. He was featured on MTV’s 'The Real World: Boston' in 1997. He met his future wife on the set of MTV’s 'Road Rules: All Stars' in 1998.

Trump to attend SpaceX 'Starship' launch in Texas: Sources	Sources have confirmed President-elect Donald J. Trump will be visiting Brownsville Tuesday to watch the sixth SpaceX launch. The team of U.S. Representative for District 34 Vicente Gonzalez confirmed to NewsNation local affiliate KVEO that Trump will be in attendance Tuesday as space enthusiasts, locals and out of towners watch SpaceX attempt to launch the Starship rocket. Two sources also confirmed his attendance to NewsNation's Libbey Dean. Musk’s bold plans for ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ face roadblocks Local flight restrictions read: 'The Federal Aviation Administration has issued temporary flight restrictions over Brownsville and Boca Chica, Texas area for a VIP visit that coincides with the SpaceX launch window for a test of its massive Starship rocket from its launch facility on the Gulf of Mexico. The flight restrictions put in place over Trump’s home in Palm Beach, Florida when he is there will be lifted briefly while the Texas security measures are in place.' Trump won the Rio Grande Valley, where the launch will take place. Leading up to the Nov. 5 election, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk showed support for Trump while on the campaign trail. He's since been tapped to to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) along Vivek Ramaswamy. This is SpaceX's sixth attempt at launching Starship, and this time around, it aims to expand the envelope on Starship and booster capabilities. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'Objectives include the booster once again returning to the launch site for catch, reigniting a ship Raptor engine while in space, and testing a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,' SpaceX stated. According to SpaceX.com, Starship is expected to launch on Nov. 19 with a 30-minute launch window beginning at 4 p.m.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-spacex-starship-launch-texas/	2024-11-18T13:54:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Collage-Maker-18-Nov-2022-09.58-PM.jpg?w=900
Diddy's lawyers say his jail cell was unlawfully raided	(NewsNation) — Sean 'Diddy' Combs’ attorneys have accused prosecutors of engaging in 'outrageous government conduct' alleging that they seized notes and other 'privileged attorney-client' material from the music mogul’s jail cell and are using it to keep him locked up. In a letter requesting an immediate hearing, his lawyers alleged Monday that prosecutors gathered 'privileged material, including the defendant’s own written notes' during a raid on Combs’ cell at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. They said those materials were cited in papers the government filed in Manhattan federal court on Friday in a bid to keep the music mogul locked up before his May 5 trial. What’s happened since Diddy was indicted? 'This search and seizure are in violation of Mr. Combs’ Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights,' the lawyers told Judge Arun Subramanian. 'The targeted seizure of a pre-trial detainee’s work product and privileged materials – created in preparation for trial – is outrageous government conduct amounting to a substantive due process violation,' they added. They demanded prosecutors answer who authorized the search of Combs’ cell, where personal effects and paperwork were seized. Subramanian gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. ET Monday to respond to Comb’s lawyers and set a hearing on the matter for Tuesday afternoon. Combs has been held in pre-trial detention while awaiting his trial since September. Diddy receiving privileges including more showers: Former inmate He has pleaded not guilty to charges that he 'led a racketeering conspiracy that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice, among other crimes. ' Combs is currently seeking to be placed on house arrest through a $50 million bail package. On Friday, prosecutors said Combs has been trying to dodge scrutiny of his jailhouse communications while orchestrating social media campaigns aimed at tainting the jury pool and trying to publicly leak materials he views are helpful to his case. They said he also has contacted witnesses through third parties.

White House rejects claim it's 'adding fuel' to Russia’s war on U...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The White House rejected the Kremlin’s claim Monday that it is adding 'fuel to the fire' by authorizing Ukrainian forces to use U.S.-supplied missiles inside Russia. 'The fire was lit by Russia's invasion of Ukraine,' deputy national security advisor Jon Finer, said. 'So, I think this notion of fuel on the fire is, frankly, a side issue to the main issue, which is Russia waging a war of aggression across a sovereign border, into Ukraine, and continuing to do so.' 'I would put the question back to Russia about who's actually putting fuel on the fire here, and I don’t think it’s the Ukrainians,' Finer said. President Joe Biden has given Kyiv the green light to use long-range weapons – known as Army Tactical Missile Systems or ATACMS – which would enable strikes deep inside Russian territory, easing previous restrictions on Western-made weapons. What does Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range US weapons mean? The announcement came Sunday after the U.S. had frequently said it would not lift its ban on Ukraine’s use of American weapons against Russia, citing fear of escalation. The United States has provided Ukraine with more than $56 billion in military aid since Russia’s invasion in Feb. 2022, according to the Department of Defense. With two months left in office, Biden’s shift in U.S. policy came in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin deploying more than 10,000 North Korean troops into Moscow’s fight. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov criticized the Biden administration for 'adding fuel to the conflict,' before recalling Putin’s statement in September in which he said that Ukraine’s use of U.S. weapons to attack Russia would put NATO at war with Moscow. 'If this decision is taken, it will mean nothing less than the direct involvement of NATO countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine,' Putin said at the time. 'This will be their direct participation, and this, of course, will significantly change the very essence, the very nature of the conflict.' President-elect Donald Trump has not commented on Biden’s decision, but his son, Donald Trump Jr., lambasted it. 'The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,' he wrote on X. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he could resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine within 24 hours without specifying how. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky seemingly agreed with this Friday, saying he is certain his country’s war with Russia would end 'faster' once Trump becomes U.S. president.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/white-house-russias-war-ukraine-missiles/	2024-11-18T12:30:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1680847188.jpg?w=900
Diddy tried to reach out to witnesses from jail, prosecutors alle...	(NewsNation) — Prosecutors said in a court document last week that Sean 'Diddy' Combs tried to contact potential witnesses for his upcoming sex trafficking trial from jail. 'The defendant has continued to engage in a relentless course of obstructive conduct designed to subvert the integrity of these proceedings,' prosecutors said in a court filing asking the judge to reject Combs' $50 million bail request. 'The defendant has shown repeatedly — even while in custody — that he will flagrantly and repeatedly flout rules in order to improperly impact the outcome of his case.' Jail calls showed that Combs asked family members to reach out to potential victims and witnesses, prosecutors said in the filing. They also accused Combs of orchestrating social media campaigns 'aimed at tainting the jury pool' and trying to publicly leak materials that could help his case. Part of this campaign included having his children post a video to their social media accounts showing them gathered to celebrate Combs' birthday, the court filing said. Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator During a nationwide sweep of Bureau of Prison facilities, investigators found notes from Combs' cell phone that included communications with a woman identified in the court filing as Witness 2. 'It is clear that when the defendant reinitiated contact with Witness 2 in September 2024, his purpose was to ensure that Witness 2 was on his side,' prosecutors wrote. The strong inference to be drawn from Combs' communication with Witness 2 is that he paid her after she posted a statement denying allegations of violence by him. NewsNation reached out to Witness 2 for comment. In their own filing, Combs' lawyers argued that the prosecutors' search and seizure of their clients' notes violated his rights, according to Billboard. New ‘X’ terms and conditions leads to exodus of users 'The targeted seizure of a pre-trial detainee’s work product and privileged materials — created in preparation for trial — is outrageous government conduct amounting to a substantive due process violation,' Combs' lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, said in the filing.

House Ethics Committee to meet Wednesday amid debate over Gaetz r...	Members of the House Ethics Committee will meet Wednesday, a source confirmed to The Hill, as the panel weighs whether it should release its report into former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), whom President-elect Trump plans to nominate to serve as attorney general. The source, however, cautioned that the huddle may be delayed, since details about the meeting leaked early Monday morning. The panel scrapped plans to gather this past Friday for an unclear reason. House Ethics Committee Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.) told Politico the meeting had been postponed, not canceled. A spokesperson for the Ethics Committee declined to comment. The debate over whether the panel should publish its report on Gaetz is heating up in the Capitol. Lawmakers from both parties are calling for its release for the sake of transparency and ahead of confirmation hearings, while others — including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) — argue the final product should remain private because Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress. Johnson reaffirmed that position Sunday. 'What I have said with regard to the report is that it should not come out. And why? Because Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress. He is no longer a member,' Johnson told CNN’s 'State of the Union' in an interview. 'There's a very important protocol and tradition and rule that we maintain that the House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to nonmembers of Congress. I think that would be a Pandora's box.' The committee — which is known for conducting its business in secrecy — had been investigating for roughly three years whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. The probe came to an abrupt end when Gaetz left the House on Wednesday, since the panel does not have jurisdiction over former members of Congress. But the committee can still release its report into Gaetz if it wishes, a move that is rare but not unprecedented; in 1987, the panel released its report into former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he has resigned from Congress. Such a move would require a majority vote on the panel. Lawmakers who sit on the Ethics Committee have been mum about how they plan to handle the question of releasing the report. The panel was initially scheduled to meet Friday of last week and vote on releasing it, a plan that was set before Trump announced Gaetz as his attorney general pick and the Florida Republican immediately resigned from Congress on Wednesday. Some members have questioned whether Gaetz left the House early to stop the investigation from advancing. 'It’s very suspicious that he all of a sudden resigned, because other members who are being nominated for posts have not resigned,' Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.) said last week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/house-ethics-committee-to-meet-wednesday-amid-debate-over-gaetz-report/	2024-11-18T09:17:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_060524jg03_w.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr. faces resistance as Trump's pick to lead HHS	(NewsNation) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could face some resistance as he seeks Senate confirmation to be Republican President-elect Donald Trump's Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. When he announced Kennedy as his pick to lead the department, Trump said the former independent presidential candidate will 'play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives.' As part of his 'Make America Healthy Again' agenda, Kennedy is looking to do a complete system overhaul of the agencies that regulate health and food. He's called for stricter pesticide regulations and made a vow to get processed foods removed from school lunches. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? On vaccines, Kennedy has said he wants a re-examination of their safety data. Health and medical experts raised concerns to NewsNation partner The Hill about Kennedy's influence on the Trump administration, as he has spread misinformation about vaccines before. In an interview with NBC News, Kennedy denied being anti-vaccine and said that he wouldn't 'take them away' from those who want one. 'I’m going to make sure scientific safety studies and efficacy are out there, and people can make individual assessments about whether that product is going to be good for them,' Kennedy told the news outlet earlier this month. Kennedy will likely face political pushback from senators during his confirmation as HHS Secretary. Democratic senators such as Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Ed Markey of Massachusetts criticized Kennedy as Trump's choice to head the department. 'Dangerous. Unqualified. Unserious,' Markey wrote. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., posted on X that Kennedy potentially being in charge of Health and Human Services 'could not be more dangerous.' 'There's no telling how far an anti-vaxxer (and) fringe conspiracy theorist like RFK Jr. could set America back in terms of public health, reproductive rights, research, &amp; more,' she said. New ‘X’ terms and conditions leads to exodus of users On the other hand, some Republican lawmakers celebrated Kennedy's nomination. 'RFK Jr. has championed issues like healthy foods and the need for greater transparency in our public health infrastructure,' Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in a statement Thursday, The Hill reported. 'I look forward to learning more about his other policy positions and how they will support a conservative, pro-American agenda.' Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson said on X that he could not be happier with Kennedy. 'He’s a brilliant, courageous truth-teller whose unwavering commitment to transparency will make America a healthier nation,' Johnson wrote. Some lobbyists in the food and health industry are planning ways to stop the Senate from confirming Kennedy, Politico reported. Others are currying favor in case they aren't successful, the news outlet writes. According to Reuters, shortly after news of Kennedy's nomination came down, shares of vaccine makers including Pfizer and Moderna fell by as much as 2%. Processed food stocks decreased as well, CNBC wrote.

Live: Oxford shooting victims' families demand investigation	(NewsNation) — Almost three years after the Oxford High School shooting in Michigan, the parents of the victims say the fight for justice is far from over. The parents are pressuring the state to conduct and fund a new investigation, hoping to force some people to talk who didn't want to before. It's been nearly three years since Ethan Crumbley gunned down four students and injured several others using a gun gifted by his father. It's the first case in which the parents of a suspect have been held legally accountable. The families don't feel like a thorough investigation was ever done in this case. It was clear after the shooting who was responsible for it so from an investigative standpoint, the case was closed, they knew who did it. But these families want Michigan lawmakers to fund an investigation into the how and the why behind the tragedy. Read more: Crumbleys’ sentence ‘about accountability’: Father of victim The hope is that the answer will provide a sort of roadmap for legislation that will prevent this tragedy from repeating itself. This court case is not entirely over, despite the convictions. Ethan was 15 when he gunned down his fellow classmates with a semi-automatic weapon. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole and an additional 24 years. The now-18-year-old is asking the court to consider a lesser sentence. His appeal requests an expert witness to be able to testify to Ethan Crumbley's rough childhood, and suggests he may suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome. The deadline for prosecutors to respond to his request is Tuesday. Ethan Crumbley's parents are also serving time for involuntary manslaughter in the shooting.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/gun-violence/oxford-shooting-michigan-parents-demand-state-investigation/	2024-11-18T06:56:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/666387f314df88.15051825.jpeg?w=900
The 9 GOP senators who could derail Trump’s Cabinet picks	(The Hill) - Multiple Republican senators are looming as potential obstacles to President-elect Trump's controversial Cabinet picks, especially his two most polarizing choices: former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Trump has had a rocky relationship in the past with a handful of Republicans senators who won’t likely give him the same deference as loyal allies such as Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who last week called on his GOP colleagues to 'get out of the way' and approve Trump's nominees. Senators who could derail Trump's Cabinet nominations Trump can afford three defections within the Senate GOP conference and still get his picks confirmed. Federal workers brace for Trump overhaul of civil service But four Republican senators would be enough to sink any of his nominees, and two moderates — Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, — have already voiced deep reservations about Gaetz, who was embroiled in a federal sex trafficking investigation, of leading the Justice Department. Here are the senators that could stymie Trump’s nominees. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 11: Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) speaks during the Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on the Special Diabetes Program on July 11, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for JDRF) Murkowski signaled her likely opposition to Gaetz soon after he was announced as Trump’s pick to serve as attorney general. 'I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for attorney general. We need to have a serious attorney general,' she told reporters. Murkowski, who didn’t vote for either Trump or Vice President Harris, would likely be skeptical of Trump’s choice of Kennedy to head the Department of Health and Human Services. The Alaska senator, who serves on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, used social media to promote vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, but she also voted in December 2021 to overturn the vaccine mandate for private businesses. Trump will use ‘military assets’ to remove illegal migrants She expressed surprised over Trump’s choice of Pete Hegseth, a military veteran and Fox News host, to head the Department of Defense. 'Wow. … I’m just surprised. I'm not going to comment on whether it's good, bad or indifferent. I’m just surprised because the names that I’ve heard for secretary of Defense have not included him,' she said. Murkowski was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump of inciting insurrection during his 2021 Senate impeachment trial. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 04: Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) speaks during the 2024 Government Day Reception hosted by Breakthrough T1D at the Kennedy Caucus Room in the Russell Senate Office Building on June 04, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Breakthrough T1D) Collins is the only Republican senator up for reelection in 2026 in a state that Harris won, and she immediately expressed her skepticism about Gaetz serving as the nation’s next attorney general. 'I was shocked by the announcement,' she said of Gaetz’s nomination. 'I’m sure that there will be a lot of questions raised at his hearing. Obviously, the president has the right to nominate whomever he wishes, but I’m certain that there will be a lot of questions.' Collins will closely review Trump’s nomination of Kennedy, as she also sits on the HELP Committee. Collins told The New York times that she found some of Kennedy’s past statements 'alarming.' Cheryl Hines’ friends ‘concerned’ 'I’ve never even met with him or sat down with him or heard him speak at length,' she said before Trump formally announced his nomination of Kennedy. But she said that Kennedy 'would be a surprising choice' to head the nation’s health services, given his long track record of claiming that vaccines pose serious health concerns and his push to remove fluoride from public water, something that many lawmakers view as a fringe issue. Sen.-elect John Curtis, R-Utah WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 13: U.S. Senator-elect John Curtis (R-UT) arrives for the Senate Republican leadership elections at the U.S. Capitol on November 13, 2024 in Washington, DC. The Senate Republicans elected Sen. John Thune (R-SD) as Majority Leader, Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) as Assistant Majority Leader, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) as Republican Conference Chair, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) as Republican Policy Committee Chair, Sen. James Lankford as Republican Conference Vice Chair and Sen. Tim Scott (R-FL) as National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair for the 119th Congress. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Curtis will be filling the seat of retiring Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and he has the reputation of a practical centrist who is expected to approach his job in the same thoughtful and measured way that Romney did during his six years in the Senate. Curtis heads the Conservative Climate Caucus and has pushed back against climate skeptics, arguing that conservatives have a role to serve as 'good stewards' of the environment. He favored censuring Trump for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election, but he voted 'no' on impeachment during his tenure in the House, urging colleagues to 'tone down the rhetoric and calm the tensions.' Curtis doesn’t have a great relationship with Gaetz, who traveled to Utah in March to campaign against him in the Senate Republican primary. Pentagon fails 7th audit in a row but says progress made Gaetz accused Curtis on the campaign trail of 'weakness' and a 'willingness to prioritize foreign interests abroad' and 'special interests in the halls of Washington.' Curtis has already signaled he would not support putting the Senate into an extended recess to allow Trump to circumvent the confirmation process by making recess appointments. 'Senator-elect Curtis believes that every president is afforded a degree of deference to select his team and make nominations,' Curtis’s chief of staff, Corey Norman, told KSL TV in Salt Lake City. 'He also firmly believes in and is committed to the Senate’s critical role to confirm or reject nominations based on information and insight from confirmation hearings.' Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 08: U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), ranking Member on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, participates in a hearing on prescription drugs costs at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 08, 2024 in Washington, DC. The Committee heard testimony on drug pricing from the heads of several drug manufactures including Joaquin Duato, CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, Robert Davis, CEO of Merck, and Chris Boerner, CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Cassidy will be one of only three Republican senators still serving next year who voted to convict Trump on the impeachment charge of inciting insurrection. Cassidy is known as a principled politician who’s not afraid to buck Trump or tackle politically dangerous issues, such as reforming Social Security to extend its solvency. But the Louisiana lawmaker is up for reelection in 2026 and faces a potential primary challenge given his vote to convict Trump. He will likely serve as chair of the HELP Committee next year, giving him jurisdiction over Kennedy’s nomination to head Health and Human Services. Cassidy, a doctor, has disputed claims attempting to link vaccines and autism as 'fake news.' Trump taps FCC commissioner Brendan Carr to chair the agency 'As a doctor who has spent my life trying to bring health to the people of Louisiana, I strongly endorse immunizations,' he said in 2019. 'There is no linkage to autism that has ever been made by a credible scientist.' Cassidy's Health panel will hold a hearing on Kennedy but the Senate Finance Committee will handle Kennedy's paperwork and vote to advance him to the floor, according to a Republican source familiar with the process. Cassidy dodged questions about Gaetz’s nomination to head the Justice Department but did not appear to be impressed by Trump’s choice of Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense, given his career in television and lack of experience managing large organizations such as the Pentagon. 'Who?' Cassidy said when asked Tuesday about Hegseth becoming the next secretary of Defense, expressing the same bewilderment that several GOP senators voiced about Trump’ s unorthodox choice when news of it broke Tuesday. Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind. WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 04: U.S. Sen. Todd Young (R-IN) speaks on the economy during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on May 04, 2022 in Washington, DC. The group of Senators spoke out about Biden's economic agenda and blamed his administration for rising inflation. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Young is a serious legislator who doesn’t like to be asked about Trump’s latest provocative statements on Truth Social. But while Young doesn’t often talk about the controversies that constantly swirl around Trump, he’s made clear in the past that he’s not a fan.

Gaetz said at the time that any Republican senator who supported the measure would be 'a traitor to the Constitution,' a statement that won’t endear him to the senators whose support he needs to win confirmation.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Ernst told The Hill that Gaetz has an 'uphill climb' to securing enough votes to win confirmation, and she’s taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump’s choices of Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, to serve as director of national intelligence and Hegseth to lead the Defense Department. Ernst said she wants to meet with Gabbard before forming any judgments about her nomination. 'I’ve had a relationship with her. It might be a little unconventional, but at the same time she might bring value to us too. So we’ll have to sort through all that,' she said. Asked about Gabbard’s past statements defending Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Putin, Ernst said, 'We’ll have to talk about that.'

Thom Tillis (R-NC) speaks at a news conference on the Supreme Court at the U.S. Capitol Building on July 19, 2023 in Washington, DC. Senators with the Senate Judiciary Committee held the press conference to discuss Senate Judiciary Chairman Richard Durbin's (D-IL) upcoming ethics bill. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Tillis is not afraid to play the role of Republican maverick if he feels strongly about a nominee or an issue, and he’s already suggesting that Gaetz might not have much support in the Senate. 'It'll just be interesting to see what his organic base is,' Tillis said of the nominee. 'At the end of the day, Congressman Gaetz, he'll have a hearing, but I'm all about counting votes and I would think that he's probably got some work cut out for him to get a good strong vote.' 'We're not going to get a single Democrat vote,' he said.

'I think he’s just got to go through the vetting process and withstand what I’m sure is going to be an interesting murder board in the Senate Armed Services Committee,' he told reporters. Tillis acknowledged Hegseth’s lack of experience leading large organizations will be something he needs to address at his confirmation hearing. 'Those are all things you got to have good, sound answers for. It’s a large, complex, very, very important agency,' he said. 'We’ve got to see all the vetting.

John Cornyn (R-TX) walks to the Senate Chambers for a nomination vote at the U.S. Capitol Building on December 05, 2022 in Washington, DC. Congress faces multiple legislative hurdles before their holiday recess including passage of the annual National Defense Authorization Act and government funding for 2023. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Cornyn pledged to get Trump’s nominees through the Senate quickly when he was running against Senate Republican Whip John Thune, S.D., and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to become the next Senate majority leader. Cornyn, however, lost that race, which could give him more freedom to criticize Trump’s picks, especially if he doesn’t think they’re qualified for the highest-profile Cabinet roles. He joked to reporters that he and Sen. Mitch McConnell, Ky., who will retire as Senate GOP leader, are now 'liberated' as they won’t have elected leadership positions in 2025, giving them more latitude to push back against flawed nominees. Cornyn, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has called for members of his panel to have full access to the findings of the House Ethics Committee’s investigation of Gaetz for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Elon Musk is hiring for DOGE. Here’s the type of people he wants to recruit He warned that if there’s evidence of wrongdoing, Gaetz could become 'an embarrassment to the president.' 'We need to get access to everything,' he said, breaking with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who said Friday that he will 'strongly request' that the House Ethics panel stick to its practice of not releasing a report about a member who has resigned from the House, as Gaetz did this past week. Cornyn also appeared surprised that Trump picked Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence, given her past statements disputing the U.S. government’s claim that Assad used chemical weapons against his own people and defending Putin’s stated rationale for invading Ukraine. Cornyn, however, is up for reelection in 2026 and is likely to face a conservative primary challenger. This might give him reason to be cautious in criticizing Trump’s nominees, but even so, he’s not likely to shy away from standing his ground on Trump’s most controversial picks, such as Gaetz. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 23: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) speaks during a press conference following the Republicans weekly policy luncheon on January 23, 2024 in Washington, DC. Negotiations over border security, military aid to Ukraine and Israel, and the government budget continue this week on Capitol Hill. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images) McConnell will be one of the most interesting Senate wild cards next year given his deep skepticism of Trump’s character and many of his policy positions. McConnell has served as Senate majority or minority leader for the past 18 years, which saddled him with the responsibility of preserving unity within the GOP conference. As majority leader during Trump’s first four years in office, he played a leading role in confirming Trump’s nominees to the executive and judicial branches. He counts his role in confirming three conservative justices to the Supreme Court under Trump among his greatest career accomplishments. Yet McConnell, an institutionalist and defense hawk, is not likely to rubber-stamp Trump’s nomination of Gaetz to head the Justice Department if he thinks it would undermine public confidence in the nation’s top law enforcement institution. Cruise line offers 4-year journey to ‘skip forward’ in wake of US presidential election 'Looking at his track record, he’s never cowed to Trump on things, especially as they relate to the Senate and the Senate’s role,' said a Senate Republican aide. McConnell rejected Trump’s call in 2018 for Senate Republicans to abolish the filibuster to improve the chances of passing his legislative agenda at the time. Given his role as a defender of Senate prerogatives, he will likely counsel against putting the Senate in an extended recess to allow Trump to make recess appointments. McConnell will carefully examine Gabbard’s statements about Russia, given the leading role he has played directing U.S. military aid to Ukraine. He said his priority over the final two years of his seventh Senate term will be to build up defense spending and the nation’s defense industrial base. If he views Hegseth as a Trump loyalist who might be at odds with that mission, he will likely speak out against him.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-cabinet-senator-obstacles/	2024-11-18T06:28:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/collinssusan_mcconnellmitch_murkoswkilisa_111524gn01_w-e1731929158765.jpg?w=900

Laken Riley trial: Forensic, technology experts to testify	(NewsNation) — Jose Ibarra, the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, is scheduled to be in court Monday for the second day of his trial. Nine witnesses were called to testify on Friday in Athens-Clarke County Superior Court. The prosecution is expected to pick right back up where it left off Monday morning, with experts called to explain how fingerprints found on Riley's phone match Jose Ibarra's. They are also expected to talk about how Riley's watch data matches up to video evidence the prosecution has collected over the last nine months which points to Jose Ibarra. Prosecutors say Jose Ibarra's DNA was found under 22-year-old Riley's fingernails. Jose Ibarra's defense attorneys, meanwhile, argue all of the evidence the prosecution has is circumstantial. An investigation began after a friend reported Riley missing on Feb. 22 when she didn’t return home from a run. Investigators later discovered her body in a forested area on the University of Georgia campus. UGA Police arrested Jose Ibarra in connection to Riley’s death the following day. Jose Ibarra 26, who waived his right to a jury trial, is charged with murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, battery and tampering with evidence. He has pleaded not guilty on all counts. Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator Ibarra's brothers to testify NewsNation obtained copies of court documents showing Ibarra's attorneys plans to call two of his brothers, Diego and Argenis, to testify in court this week. Neighbors told NewsNation that the three brothers were living in a one-bedroom apartment not far from the crime scene. On Friday, the defense showed photographs that reveal Diego Ibarra was wearing the exact same baseball hat Jose Ibarra was said to have been wearing on the day Riley was killed, as well as similar clothes. Diego and Argenis Ibarra are charged with possessing fraudulent green cards and in federal custody. They are set to be taken to the courthouse on Wednesday. Authorities say all three brothers are Venezuelan citizens who are in the United States illegally. New ‘X’ terms and conditions leads to exodus of users First Day of Jose Ibarra's Trial Prosecutor Sheila Ross said on the first day of the trial that Jose Ibarra 'went hunting for females on the University of Georgia’s campus.' 'When Laken Riley refused to be his rape victim, he bashed her skull in with a rock repeatedly,' Ross said Friday. Defense attorney Dustin Kirby called the evidence in the case graphic and disturbing, but said none of it proves his client is a killer. 'People have used this case for their own personal gain — financial gain, political gain,' Kirby said.

Trump will use 'military assets' to remove illegal migrants	(NewsNation) President-elect Donald Trump confirmed Monday morning he plans to use 'military assets' to remove migrants accused of entering the U.S. illegally. In a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump shared a post by Judicial Watch president John Fitton which read, 'Reports are the incoming @RealDonaldTrump administration prepared to declare a national emergency and will use military assets to reverse the Biden invasion through a mass deportation program.' Trump commented 'True!' It's unclear what military assets Trump intends to use, but he's mentioned invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite migrant removal in the past. Critics argue the law is out of date and wince at its most recent use during World War II to hold Japanese-Americans in internment camps without due process. Immigration was a top issue in the 2024 presidential campaign, and Trump has promised to stabilize the southern border after more migrants crossed during the Biden administration than any other in history.

Baltimore mayor discusses winning strategy against violent crime	(NewsNation) — Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, who recently made history as the city's first mayor to win re-election in two decades, is highlighting significant progress in reducing violent crime through a comprehensive approach to public safety. One Baltimore neighborhood, Brooklyn, has marked more than 400 days without a homicide — a dramatic turnaround for an area that experienced a block party shooting in July 2023 that left two dead and nearly 30 injured, mostly teenagers and young adults. In the aftermath of the tragedy, the city’s flagship anti-violence program Safe Streets ramped up its work in the area. Scott's strategy includes a distinctive approach to violence prevention: sending personalized letters to individuals identified as at risk of becoming either victims or perpetrators of gun violence. The letters offer support for life changes while warning of consequences for continued criminal activity. Kohberger attorneys motion to suppress evidence including DNA 'We want them to be alive. We will help them change their life, but if they don't, we will extract them with law enforcement,' Scott said Sunday on 'NewsNation Prime.' The neighborhood has seen an 86% reduction in homicides and a 76% decrease in non-fatal shootings. These improvements are part of a broader trend, with Baltimore recording a 20% reduction in homicides last year and an additional 24% drop this year, alongside a 34% decrease in non-fatal shootings. The mayor emphasizes a collaborative approach involving multiple city agencies, from violence interrupters to recreation and parks staff. The program includes job training and education support, citing recent success stories including a participant who obtained their GED and found employment. Safe Streets focuses on de-escalating conflicts by employing mediators with credibility and knowledge of the streets. The program has 10 offices based in some of the city’s most dangerous neighborhoods. It was launched in 2007 and expanded in recent years under Scott’s administration, which has often pledged to treat violence as a public health crisis and address its root causes. Laken Riley trial: Jose Ibarra’s brothers subpoenaed A community survey conducted in the weeks after the Brooklyn mass shooting showed that many neighborhood residents placed more trust in Safe Streets than Baltimore police, local schools, nonprofits and other institutions, according to city officials. Only neighborhood churches ranked higher. Even still, having Safe Streets workers present during the block party wasn’t enough to prevent it from ultimately devolving into chaos and bloodshed. Scott also addressed the city's ongoing struggle with the opioid crisis, noting a recent settlement with pharmaceutical companies that will bring approximately $500 million to Baltimore for addiction response efforts. The city currently averages more than two overdose deaths per day, according to health department statistics. The mayor's efforts are featured in 'The Body Politic,' a documentary chronicling his first year in office, scheduled to air on PBS on Nov. 25 at 10 p.m. Eastern.

Laken Riley trial: Jose Ibarra's brothers subpoenaed	(NewsNation) — The criminal brothers of accused killer Jose Ibarra will testify on behalf of the defense this week in the murder trial of 22-year-old Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. New court documents obtained by NewsNation revealed that Diego and Argenis, who are both undocumented immigrants currently in custody for fake green cards, were subpoenaed by the defense team to appear. Agents rescue 4-year-old girl, baby from smugglers near border The Ibarra brothers were allegedly living together in an apartment not far from the University of Georgia campus at the time of Riley's murder. All three crossed over the border illegally from Venezuela. Diego was employed for a short time by the university, but was fired shortly before Riley's death for failing to produce proper documentation. In a rare move, Ibarra has waived his right to a jury trial, leaving his fate solely in the hands of a judge — a risky decision in a case that has garnered national attention. That move could prove strategically advantageous for the accused killer following a devastating start to court proceedings. Riley’s family sobbed as graphic details and images were revealed about the woman's terrifying final moments. Laken Riley's murder The investigation into Riley’s death began when a friend reported her missing on Feb. 22 after she didn’t return home from a run. Investigators soon after discovered her body in a forested area on the University of Georgia campus. Emergency responders tried to revive Riley but determined she died before officers discovered her body. The UGA Police Department arrested Ibarra in connection to Riley’s death the following day. Texas authorities on high alert for pre-Trump immigration ‘surge’ Prosecutors allege Ibarra beat Riley with an object and dragged her body to a secluded area off the jogging path to conceal her body. The prosecution is relying on hard forensic evidence — DNA, blood, fingerprints and video of Ibarra allegedly dumping bloody clothes 15 minutes after the murder — to make its case.

Manchin postelection: 'There is a need for a third party'	Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.) said the 2024 election shows there is a 'need for a third party.' Manchin joined NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt on Sunday for 'The Hill Sunday,' where he argued that the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have a duopoly, and both of their business models right now are 'spewing hatred and division.' Cole says Republicans should ‘be working with’ Trump ‘to try and achieve his objectives’ 'They attack the other and make you more concerned or more frightened of the other. You better join my side and vice versa. That does not fix our problems, it does not keep our country the United States of America,' Manchin continued. 'I know there’s a need for a third party.' Manchin, a lifelong conservative Democrat, announced in May he had become an independent. He’d long toyed with the idea of a possible third-party bid for the White House but ruled it out. He is leaving Congress at the end of his term and did not say what he plans to do next. On Sunday, he said he’s interested in participating in or helping a third party. Manchin said he believes a ticket with a former Democrat and former Republican would be strong. 'I thought that would be very attractive in [these] most divisive times that we have,' he said. As Democrats point fingers about their brutal loss in the election and try to understand where they went so wrong, many are left thinking reform is needed within both parties, Manchin included. Ron Johnson says his ‘bias would be to vote’ for Trump’s picks 'I don’t know what has to be one here but … the only way you’re going to change the Democrat and Republican Party is to challenge them,' he said.

Pension, perks await retiring US presidents	(NewsNation) — It’s nowhere near what the average corporate CEO earns, but the annual salary of the president of the United States may be the envy of most Americans: $400,000. That does not include lodging at the White House, travel on Air Force One, living allowances, entertainment, staff and much more. When a president leaves office, the checks and other benefits continue. Here’s a look at some of those benefits, and how they came about. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits What benefits do all former presidents get? The Former Presidents Acts of 1958 provides for a pension and several other benefits. All presidents receive money for office space, equipment, staff, travel, entertainment and supplies. If they were enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program for at least five years, former presidents get the same health benefits as other former government workers. Tom Cole: Republicans should ‘be working with’ Trump ‘to try and achieve his objectives’ Ironically, Jimmy Carter, America’s longest-living former president, was not eligible for that program since he was president for only four years and held no other federal government post. One-term president George H.W. Bush, who was vice president for eight years, as well as serving in Congress and as an ambassador, was eligible for health benefits but declined them. Former presidents are guaranteed a funeral with full honors and burial at Arlington National Cemetery. But only two presidents, John F. Kennedy and William Howard Taft, are buried there. Pollster Ann Selzer steps aside in wake of huge Iowa poll miss Biden’s big pension payday When Joe Biden leaves the White House he will be eligible for the standard annual pension that any cabinet secretary receives: $246,424. But Biden also served eight years as vice president and spent 36 years as a U.S. senator from Delaware. All three pensions will total $413,000 a year, more than he made as president. The federal government places very few limits on multiple pensions, and only a few states ban or limit 'double dipping,' in which a government employee retires, collects a pension, and then returns to work in another government job. For example, Burlington County, New Jersey, passed a law banning county departments from hiring anyone who is collecting a 'taxpayer-funded retirement pension.' Cruise line offers 4-year journey to ‘skip forward’ in wake of US presidential election A president's other post-White House benefits Donald Trump has received more than $3 million in pension, office, printing, travel, and other allowances since his first term ended. From 2016 to 2024, Bill Clinton has received nearly $13 million in pension and other benefits from 2016 to 2024. George W. Bush has been paid just over $12 million in those same eight years. Barack Obama has received about $10.5 million. And Jimmy Carter, famous for his frugality, has received just over $5 million in that same time. Clinton, Bush and Obama may also receive pensions from other government positions they held. Ron Johnson says his ‘bias would be to vote’ for Trump’s picks Has a president been denied or refused benefits? To date, no president has ever been denied a pension. The Former Presidents Act of 1958, which established the current pension and benefits system, denies benefits to a president who has been impeached and convicted by Congress. Richard Nixon avoided that fate by resigning. Bill Clinton and Donald Trump were impeached, but not convicted. Former presidents and their spouses may receive protection by the U.S. Secret Service for life. Eleven years after his resignation, Richard Nixon relinquished his protection – the only former president to do so. Progressive fault lines emerge after Harris’s loss Why do presidents receive pensions? A few years after leaving the White House in 1953, Harry S. Truman lobbied for financial support. Claiming dire financial straights, Truman wrote to House Speaker Sam Rayburn in 1957 saying he might have to turn to the private sector or some other source beneath the dignity of a former president. The upshot was the Former Presidents Act of 1958, which established the system of pension, allowances and office expenses in effect today. But in 2021, University of Colorado Law School professor Paul Campos debunked the Truman 'poverty' claim. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Campos claims that Truman misappropriated nearly all of the presidential expense account that Congress set up at the beginning of his second term. Truman also, according to Campos, did the thing he claimed that he wouldn’t do: exploit his status as a former president. 'By the time Congress passed the FPA in response to Truman’s various claims that he was at least teetering on the brink of potential financial distress, Truman’s net worth was, in relative economic terms, approximately $72 million in 2021 dollars,' Campos wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/president-pension-benefits/	2024-11-17T16:39:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-514952648.jpg?w=900
Biden authorizes Ukraine to use US-supplied long-range missiles f...	MANAUS, Brazil (AP) — President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter. The decision allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, for attacks farther inside Russia comes as President Vladimir Putin positions North Korean troops along Ukraine's northern border to try to reclaim hundreds of miles of territory seized by Ukrainian forces. Biden's move also follows the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war and raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the United States' vital military support for Ukraine. The official and the others knowledgeable about the matter were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's reaction Sunday was notably restrained. 'Strikes are not made with words,' he said during his nightly video address. 'Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves.' Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters have been pressing Biden for months to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles, saying the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids. Zelenskyy's statement came shortly after he posted a message of condolence on Telegram following a Russian attack on a nine-story building that killed at least eight people in the northern city of Sumy, 40 kilometres (24 miles) from the border with Russia. Russia also launched a massive drone and missile attack, described by officials as the largest in recent months, targeting energy infrastructure and killing civilians. The attack came as fears are mounting about Moscow’s intentions to devastate Ukraine’s power generation capacity before the winter. 'And this is the answer to everyone who tried to achieve something with Putin through talks, phone calls, hugs, and appeasement,' Zelenskyy said. Some supporters have argued that the limitation and other U.S. constraints could cost Ukraine the war. The debate has become a source of disagreement among Ukraine’s NATO allies. Biden had remained opposed, determined to hold the line against any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. News of Biden's decision followed meetings over the last two days with the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China. The addition of North Korean troops was central to the talks, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru. Biden did not mention the decision during a speech at a stop in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil on his way to the Group of 20 summit. Asked about the decision, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a press conference that the body’s position is 'to avoid a permanent deterioration of the war in Ukraine.' 'We want peace, we want fair peace,' Guterres said on Sunday before the summit in Rio de Janeiro. He didn't elaborate. The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to support Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to one of the people familiar with the development. The overall supply of ATACMS missiles is short, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference. Some supporters of Ukraine say that even a few long-range strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources. North Korea has provided thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year. The introduction of North Korean troops to the conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict. As many as 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian assessments. U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Trump, who takes office in January, spoke for months as a candidate about wanting Russia’s war in Ukraine to be over, but he mostly ducked questions about whether he wanted U.S. ally Ukraine to win. He also repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid. His victory has Ukraine’s international backers worrying that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Putin. America is Ukraine’s most valuable ally in the war, providing more than $56.2 billion in security assistance since Russian forces invaded in February 2022. Worried about Russia’s response, however, the Biden administration repeatedly has delayed providing some specific advanced weapons sought by Ukraine, agreeing only under pressure from Kyiv, its supporters and in consultation with allies. That includes initially refusing Zelenskyy’s pleas for advanced tanks, Patriot air defense systems and F-16 fighter jets, among other systems. The White House agreed in May to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weaponry for limited strikes just across the border with Russia. ___ Long, Miller, Knickmeyer and Lee reported from Washington.

Cole says Republicans should 'be working with' Trump 'to try and ...	Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said in an interview Sunday that Republicans should 'be working with' President-elect Trump 'to try and achieve his objectives.' 'As we record this, the Republican majority in the 119th Congress looks like it'll be about the same size as it is in the current Congress — 222, maybe 221 — but … in the same space,' NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt said on 'The Hill Sunday.' Ron Johnson says ‘bias would be to vote’ for Trump’s picks 'Narrow majorities make for hard work,' Stirewalt continued. 'What do you tell your fellow Republicans about navigating these spaces?' 'Well, first of all, I tell them, you have your majority because of President Trump,' Cole said. 'Look, he’s won the popular vote … for the first time in 20 years any Republican’s been able to do that. And so, we ought to be working with him to try and achieve his objectives.' Republicans will have control of both the House and Senate next year, as well as the presidency. The election results mirror those of around four years ago in which the party that won the presidency, the Democrats, also won the House and Senate. 'I think it will be a little bit different this Congress, simply because we've got a little bit of discipline,' Cole said in his NewsNation interview. 'You know, President Trump is not shy about expressing his opinions. I think all of my members have a very healthy respect for him.' Trump allies remain in legal peril despite his election victory The Republicans’ win in the House this year is a victory for House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who has led the House GOP through tumultuous times for a little more than a year. Johnson has overseen rough patches for the GOP conference in the lower chamber, including the period following former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s (R-Calif.) ouster and fierce debates over foreign aid. Trump’s return to the White House, as well as having a friendlier neighbor in a GOP-controlled Senate, may make things easier for House Republicans, who have recently been dealing with Democrats leading the Senate and President Biden.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/the-hill-sunday/tom-cole-republicans-trump-objectives/	2024-11-17T13:46:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP23292638592566-e1697741916519.jpg?w=900
Ron Johnson says 'bias would be to vote' for Trump's picks	Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said Sunday that his 'bias would be to vote for the people that President Trump wants' for the upcoming administration. 'My bias would be to vote for the people that President Trump wants to serve [by in his] administration,' Johnson told NewsNation's Chris Stirewalt on 'The Hill Sunday.' 'Again, as a U.S. senator, I'm probably the minority view here; I don't particularly like being the human resource department of administration.' 'Again, the top picks, lifetime appointments, I have no problem with that, but you start getting down to … the lesser agencies here, or positions, it's really ridiculous what we do,' Johnson continued, adding that he’d 'much rather spend time on oversight and investigations.' Trump allies remain in legal peril despite his election victory President-elect Trump has selected a few controversial people for roles in his incoming administration, including right-wing firebrand and former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) for attorney general. While Gaetz had been a strong supporter of the president-elect during his time in Congress, he also had some rough relationships within his party, notably having an ongoing public feud with ex-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).

The Florida Republican, who resigned from the House immediately after the announcement, has recently been the subject of a probe by the House Ethics Committee looking into whether he took part in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, alongside other allegations. He has denied allegations of wrongdoing, but Gaetz’s resignation essentially kills the probe by taking himself out of the panel’s jurisdiction.

Biden becomes the first sitting US president to visit the Amazon ...	MANAUS, Brazil (AP) — Joe Biden on Sunday became the first sitting American president to set foot in the Amazon rainforest, as the incoming Trump administration seems poised to scale back the U.S. commitment to combating climate change. The massive Amazon, which is about the size of Australia, stores huge amounts of the world’s carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that drives climate change when it's released into the atmosphere. But development is rapidly depleting the world's largest tropical rainforest. Joined by Carlos Nobre, a Nobel-Prize winning scientist and expert on how climate change is impacting the Amazon, and Biden climate adviser John Podesta, Biden lifted in his helicopter over a stretch of the rainforest, for a good view of the shallowing of waterways, fire damage and a wildlife refuge. He was also getting a peek at where the Rio Negro and Amazon rivers meet. Biden will then meet local and indigenous leaders and visit an Amazonian museum as he looks to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. His administration announced plans last year for a $500 million contribution to the Amazon Fund, the most significant international cooperation effort to preserve the rainforest, primarily financed by Norway. So far, the U.S. government said it has provided $50 million, and the White House announced Sunday an additional $50 million contribution to the fund. 'It’s significant for a sitting president to visit the Amazon. ... This shows a personal commitment from the president,' said Suely Araújo, former head of the Brazilian environmental protection agency and public policy coordinator with the nonprofit Climate Observatory. 'That said, we can’t expect concrete results from this visit.' She doubts that a 'single penny' will go to the Amazon Fund once Donald Trump is back in the White House. The incoming Trump administration is highly unlikely to prioritize the Amazon or anything related to climate change. The Republican president-elect already said he would again pull out of the Paris agreement, a global pact forged to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change, after Biden recommitted to the agreement. Trump has cast climate change as a 'hoax' and said he will eliminate energy efficiency regulations by the Biden administration. Still, the Biden White House on Sunday announced a series of new efforts aimed at bolstering the Amazon and stemming the impact of climate change. Among the actions is the launch of a finance coalition that looks to spur at least $10 billion in public and private investment for land restoration and eco-friendly economic projects by 2030, and a $37.5 million loan to the organization Mombak Gestora de Recursos Ltda. to support the large-scale planting of native tree species on degraded grasslands in Brazil. Biden is also set to sign a U.S. proclamation designating Nov. 17 as International Conservation Day, and will highlight in remarks during the visit that the U.S. is on track to reach $11 billion in spending on international climate financing in 2024, a six-fold increase from when he started his term. The Amazon is home to Indigenous communities and 10% of Earth’s biodiversity. It also regulates moisture across South America. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil, and scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet. The forest has been suffering two years of historic drought that have dried up waterways, isolated thousands of riverine communities and hindered riverine dwellers’ ability to fish. It's also made way for wildfires that have burned an area larger than Switzerland and choked cities near and far with smoke. When Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office last year, he signaled a shift in environmental policy from his predecessor, far-right Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro prioritized agribusiness expansion over forest protection and weakened environmental agencies, prompting deforestation to surge to a 15-year-high. Lula has pledged 'zero deforestation' by 2030, though his term runs through the end of 2026. Forest loss in Brazil’s Amazon dropped by 30.6% in the 12 months through July from a year earlier, bringing deforestation to its lowest level in nine years, according to official data released last week. In that 12-month span, the Amazon lost 6,288 square kilometers (2,428 square miles), roughly the size of the U.S. state of Delaware. But that data fails to capture the surge of destruction this year, which will only be included in next year’s reading. Despite the success in curbing Amazon deforestation, Lula’s government has been criticized by environmentalists for backing projects that could harm the region, such as paving a highway that cuts from an old-growth area and could encourage logging, oil drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River and building a railway to transport soy to Amazonian ports. Biden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. He traveled from Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. After his stop in Manaus, he was heading to Rio de Janeiro for this year's Group of 20 leaders summit. ___ Sa Pessoa reported from Sao Paulo, and Long from Washington.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-biden-will-become-the-first-sitting-us-president-to-visit-the-amazon-rainforest/	2024-11-17T09:11:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673a204ac3f8f4.34729729.jpeg?w=900
Democratic AGs rush to form line of defense against Trump	Democratic attorneys general across the country are readying their legal defenses against the incoming Trump administration, preparing to pounce on potential violations and even take the president-elect to court if he implements controversial policies. During his first term, state attorneys general brought a wave of lawsuits against the Trump administration as they worked to block moves like his travel ban and family separations at the border. Four years after he left office, as President-elect Trump touts plans for mass deportations and a rollback of environmental regulations, the top prosecutors are on high alert. They join Democratic governors, some of whom are already in the spotlight as possible 2028 contenders, as a critical line of defense for the party, with the GOP set to take a trifecta of control over the White House and Congress. 'This time, not just with the trifecta, but also a more conservative judiciary, the number of venues for Democrats to advance their policies has shrunk on the federal level,' said Paul Nolette, a Marquette University political scientist and the director of a database on state litigation and attorney general activity. 'Whenever that happens, what we’ve seen is that parties then really use the states as a way to advance their own policy. And when Democrats are still in control of states like California, New York, Illinois … the actions of governors, the actions of state AGs, they really can make a difference not only in their own states, but across the country, on national policy,' he said. The days since Trump’s win have seen a surge of Democratic attorneys general stepping up to signal they’re ready to counterbalance the GOP when it takes power in Washington next year. 'I don't wake up every morning dying to sue the president of the United States or his administration,' New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin (D) told The Hill. 'If he’s operating lawfully, we’re not going to challenge it. But when he violates the law, we're not going to hesitate to protect our residents,' Platkin said. Trump has said his Day 1 agenda would launch 'the largest deportation program in American history,' roll back Biden orders on equity and 'drill, baby, drill.' 'It’s not like the Democrats made it up or something,' said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, of the prospective threats posed by a second Trump term. 'It comes from the mouth, and social media, of Trump himself.' The president-elect has also stoked concerns with his picks for Cabinet positions, including Trump ally former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) for U.S. attorney general. Gaetz, who is being investigated by the House Ethics Committee, resigned from Congress after getting the nod. Platkin blasted the nomination on the social platform X as a sign that Trump 'would use the DOJ to punish political opponents and undermine the rule of law.' Attorneys general from coast to coast have been preparing for months amid the competitive White House race, California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta (D) told The Hill. They’ve monitored comments from Trump and his inner circle and scrutinized Project 2025, the conservative Heritage Foundation’s blueprint for a second Trump term. The prep is as specific as prewriting briefs so officials 'just need to cross the Ts, dot the Is and press print and file it,' Bonta said. California alone reportedly brought more than a hundred lawsuits against Trump in his first term. 'What we learned from the first Trump administration is that he can’t help but break the law. It’s part of his brand. It’s part of what he does,' Bonta said. During Trump’s first term, Democratic attorneys general led more than 130 multistate lawsuits against the administration, according to Nolette’s database, and boasted an 83 percent win rate. That was more than twice as many as Republican attorneys general led against the Obama administration, with a 63.5 percent win rate. Against President Biden’s administration so far, Republican AGs have seen a win rate of around 76 percent. The first Trump administration ushered in a 'world of heightened AG activism,' Nolette said, making the latest crop of state legal officers 'much more proactive in getting ready for challenges that currently don’t even exist.' The attorneys general are connecting with each other through the Democratic Attorneys General Association (DAGA), as well as coordinating with their governors, who are also gearing up to resist Republican policies. 'Nothing unites Democrats more than Donald Trump,' said James Tierney, a Harvard Law School lecturer, the director of StateAG.org and a former Democratic attorney general of Maine. After Trump’s win, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) called a special session of the state legislature to protect progressive policies, vowing the Golden State is 'ready to fight.' New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), who brought a major lawsuit against Trump in 2022, joined with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) to announce their offices would be convening regularly to 'coordinate legal actions' and develop responses to the incoming administration, according to a release. In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey (D) — herself a former state AG — has promised her state’s law enforcement would 'absolutely not' assist if the Trump administration asked for help with mass deportation plans. Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell (D) said she’s on alert for threats to reproductive health care, gun safety, consumer protections and other issues, and told The Hill that she has 'real concerns about the president-elect’s position when it comes to the rule of law.' 'The role of the Democratic AG is the most critical, I think, in this moment in time,' Campbell said, arguing they’re 'on the front line.' Several Democratic governors were in the running for the veepstakes to join Vice President Harris’s 2024 presidential bid, and they’re also making early lists of possible 2028 contenders. Some state AGs, too, may have higher political aspirations, adding a political subtext to their public defense of their party ideals. 'The old joke, of course, is that AGs are ‘aspiring governors.’ And I think at this point we've seen, certainly, plenty of evidence that AGs have leveraged their roles to become good candidates for higher office,' Nolette said. Harris herself is a prime example: She served as California AG before jumping to the Senate and then to the vice presidency. Along the 2024 campaign trail, she touted her work in the role. Washington state’s Attorney General Bob Ferguson (D) won his gubernatorial bid on Election Day. He told reporters after the results that his office feels 'prepared to defend' progressive policies in his state as both the White House and his seat changes hands. And that defense doesn’t always look like lawsuits, experts noted. State attorneys general often write letters to congressional leaders, participate in the notice-and-comment rule-making stage and speak out about certain policies. 'The wise attorney general understands that they're more than just a lawsuit machine,' Tierney said. DAGA president Sean Rankin told The Hill that state AGs will continue their work in the courtroom during a second Trump term, but also work to 'do a better job' of explaining the work of attorneys general to the public. Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach (R), the chair of the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), argued in a statement to The Hill that the Democratic AGs are 'making an empty gesture' with their responses to Trump's win, 'given that regulatory overreach has been a hallmark of the Biden Administration.' 'Unlike President Biden who lost dozens of times to Republican AGs for promulgating illegal and unconstitutional rules and regulations, President Trump will be focused on reducing excessive overreach,' Kobach said. A Trump White House 2.0. will also likely have a 'more sophisticated approach' both to reverse Biden-era regulations and advance their own policies, Nolette said. And Democrats are set to face new hurdles in the increasingly conservative court system — including at the U.S. Supreme Court level, thanks to Trump’s appointments. 'It's like the filibuster in the Senate. Both sides use it when it's to their advantage. Republicans had a huge amount of litigation against the Biden administration in these past four years, and there's more to come. And so this isn't specific about Trump,' Nolette said of using litigation to combat the administration. 'It's something that I think AGs of both parties have realized is a very good strategy to delay and to stop policies that they disagree with,' he said. 'This is part of the process that's now entrenched.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/democratic-ags-rush-to-form-line-of-defense-against-trump/	2024-11-17T09:01:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/State-AG_111724_AP_Minh-Connors.jpg?w=900
Trump allies remain in legal peril despite his election victory	President-elect Trump’s White House victory set his legal cases on a downward spiral, but his allies who have faced prosecution or other legal trouble are not yet in the clear. Dozens of Trump aides, associates and backers — including top officials in his first administration — have faced criminal charges tied to efforts to keep the former president in power after he lost the 2020 election. Many also faced disbarments, bankruptcy and civil litigation. While Trump’s criminal cases are winding down upon his imminent return to the nation’s highest office, those same protections he has as president don’t extend to his allies. In Georgia, more than a dozen people were charged alongside Trump with attempting to subvert the state’s election results. Biden won the state by 11,779 votes in 2020. Trump’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and Rudy Giuliani, the ex-New York City mayor who helped lead the 2020 push, are co-defendants in that case, in addition to several lawyers and aides. Trump supporters who signed false paperwork saying they were the state’s true electors are also charged. A Justice Department opinion on separation of powers makes it clear that state criminal prosecutions against Trump must, at the very least, be put on ice while he’s in office, said Gregory Germain, a law professor at Syracuse University, in a blog post after November’s election. 'In all likelihood, the state criminal cases will be put on hold during Trump’s presidency,' he wrote. 'If they try to continue with the prosecutions, or even to impose a stayed sentence, I suspect the decisions will be reversed on appeal.' But that’s not the case for the 14 other defendants with remaining charges. In fact, with Trump effectively out of the picture, any limitations the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision would have put on the prosecution — barring certain evidence and causing further delays — are gone now, said Anthony Michael Kreis, a Georgia State University law professor. It could make his allies' prosecutions more potent. 'They're kind of living on a hope and a prayer that something has changed in the world to their benefit,' Kreis said of Trump’s co-defendants, citing the former president’s election win. 'But when it comes down to the actual trial practice, they might be more sorry than glad.' Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis won her own reelection this fall, allowing her to maintain her place at the helm of the historic case. In an interview with Atlanta News First, she declined to nail down a plan forward but indicated that she doesn’t intend to let the case crumble – for any defendant. 'If someone has an indictment in this office, no matter who they are, we continue to pursue those charges,' Willis said. 'I’m here for eight more years, is my plan. So, if that’s what it takes for us to get justice in some cases, we come to work every day, we’ll come to work and look for justice.' Still, the immediate fate of the Georgia case is in the hands of a state appeals court, which is weighing whether to boot Willis from the prosecution over her previous romantic relationship with a top prosecutor on the case, who has since resigned. Arizona’s 2020 election case, in which Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator of 16 defendants still facing charges, is also expected to push forward, according to the state’s Democratic attorney general. 'I have no intention of dropping that case,' Mayes said last week. 'A grand jury in the state of Arizona decided that these individuals who engaged in an attempt to overthrow our democracy in 2020 should be held accountable.' The prosecution hit a roadblock earlier this week when the judge overseeing that case recused himself after urging colleagues to call out attacks against Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign in an email to other judges. A spokesperson for Giuliani said the judge’s remarks underlined 'the partisan and baseless nature of this whole case,' but Mayes’s office pushed back that the email represented a 'cry for decency and respect' and was 'not reflective of bias.' Mayes spokesperson Richie Taylor said the case has 'never been motivated by politics.' The Arizona case is set to go to trial in January 2026, though the judge’s recusal could cause delays. Trump's troubles in Arizona might not be over, either. The state’s statute of limitations on most felony offenses is seven years, meaning that it’s possible the former president could face charges there in the final year of his term and leave office with few mechanisms to stop them, Kreis said. Three Trump allies also face charges in Wisconsin, and 16 so-called 'fake electors' are charged in Michigan. In Nevada, charges were brought against six alternate electors, but a trial court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction; the state appealed. And in New Mexico and Pennsylvania, prosecutors have said legal standards were not met to bring charges. If there are convictions for Trump’s allies in the state cases, he won’t be able to issue pardons or other relief, as that power is exclusively reserved to federal offenses. Criminal prosecutions aside, Trump’s allies have faced a slew of other legal issues for their efforts to keep Trump in the White House. Giuliani has been disbarred and was forced to turn over most of his assets to two election workers he defamed. Two others involved, Jeff Clark and John Eastman, have also faced disciplinary proceedings. And attorneys Sidney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro and Jenna Ellis have pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from their post-2020 election work. Even as president, there’s little Trump can do to help. 'I think they're out on their own,' Kreis said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/trump-allies-remain-in-legal-peril-despite-his-election-victory/	2024-11-17T07:52:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24318581178921-e1731686648497.jpg?w=900
What has Project 2025 said since Trump's win?	(NewsNation) — The key figure behind Project 2025, a controversial conservative presidential blueprint, congratulated Donald Trump on his election victory. 'We look forward to this historic term, during which President Trump has an opportunity to make America great, healthy, safe, and prosperous once again,' said Kevin Roberts, president of The Heritage Foundation, in an online statement on Election Day. Project 2025 is a nearly 1,000-page handbook from conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, and the authors refer to it as a guide on what the next president needs to do to undo the 'damage' to America they claim has been caused by liberal politicians. How Project 2025’s rightward vision became a flashpoint in this year’s election It acts as a manual for the next Republican president, detailing ways to reshape and give the executive branch more power. 'The entire conservative movement stands united behind him,' Roberts said. Many of Trump's former aides have authored parts of the document, although Trump said during his campaign that he did not know about it. The Heritage Foundation has issued six statements on Trump's nominations for his second administration. Project 2025 mischaracterized by left: The Heritage Foundation president 'The creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is a welcome and long-overdue step toward addressing government waste and restoring fiscal discipline to the federal budget,' said David Ditch, senior policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, in a news release Wednesday. Trump appointed tech entrepreneurs and billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to head the inaugural Department of Energy. The organization also praised Trump's appointments of Tom Homan as 'Border Czar,' news anchor Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of state, and former national intelligence director John Ratcliffe as CIA chief. 'Pete Hegseth is a tremendous choice for Secretary of Defense,' Roberts said in a post on X, which was paired with a picture of a Jerusalem Cross. The Heritage Foundation also praised the selection of former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the secretary of Human and Health Services. 'This nomination sends a clear message to our failed public health establishment: Americans are sick and tired of being sick and tired,' Roberts said in a news release Thursday. 'Under President Trump and Secretary Kennedy, those Americans will be in control of their health, not the commissars of three-letter health agencies.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/what-has-project-2025-said-since-trumps-win/	2024-11-17T07:42:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670c9c6324b334.96284448.jpeg?w=900
Trump said he can't run in 2028 unless the GOP figures 'something...	(NEXSTAR) – President-elect Donald Trump, during a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday, made an apparent joke in which he remarked that the GOP might want to 'do something' that would somehow allow him to serve a third term in 2028. 'I suspect I won’t be running again, unless you do something,' Trump said, according to audio shared with NewsNation affiliate The Hill. 'Unless you say, ‘He’s so good, we have to just figure it out.’' Trump’s remarks garnered some laughs from the GOP lawmakers, a couple of whom dismissed them as a joke. But Trump has made similar comments in the past, having previously floated the ideas of 'extending' his term or somehow disregarding term limits. Trump taps fracking CEO Chris Wright for Energy secretary As it stands, however, the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution bars any president from serving more than two terms — regardless of whether those terms are consecutive or not. 'No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once,' reads the amendment, in part. The idea behind this amendment was introduced for consideration in 1947, in response to President Franklin D. Roosevelt winning four consecutive terms in office. Franklin, who died just months into his fourth term, was the only president to get elected more than twice (though other presidents before him had indeed attempted to secure third terms). There have also been dozens of attempts to repeal the amendment in the years since its introduction, though none made any significant progress. But could the 22nd Amendment be repealed under the coming Trump administration with GOP majorities in the Senate and the House? It’s not likely. Repealing an amendment would require a new amendment itself, the National Constitution Center, a non-profit dedicated to studying and educating about the U.S. Constitution, explains. But any new amendment must have the backing of two-thirds of the House and Senate — and the incoming GOP does not have enough seats to secure its passing. Two-thirds of state legislators could also call for a constitutional convention to propose the new amendment, but three-quarters of the states would have to approve it — another unlikely scenario. A Democratic lawmaker in New York isn’t taking any chances, though. Rep. Dan Goldman said last week he was filing to clarify the wording of the 22nd Amendment, to make it clearer that the terms described therein apply 'to two terms in the aggregate,' The New York Times reported. The resolution likely will never reach a vote under House Speaker Mike Johnson, the outlet noted. Trump has promised ‘concealed carry reciprocity.’ What would it do? Congress has previously acknowledged, however, that it may still be possible for a two-term president to once again become president, largely due to language in the 22nd and 12th Amendments that could be interpreted to suggest the possibility that a former president ascends to the presidency, in very specific situations. ' … [N]either Amendment addresses the eligibility of a former two-term President to serve as Speaker of the House or as one of the other officers who could serve as President through operation of the Succession Act,' according to an overview from the Congressional online database.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-said-he-cant-run-in-2028-unless-the-gop-figures-something-out-could-that-happen/	2024-11-17T07:35:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/TrumpGettyImages-2183887423.jpg?w=900
Big voter turnout this year benefited Republicans, contradicting ...	The 2024 presidential election featured sky-high turnout, approaching the historic levels of the 2020 contest and contradicting long-held conventional political wisdom that Republicans struggle to win races in which many people vote. According to Associated Press elections data, more than 152 million ballots were cast in this year's race between Republican Donald Trump, now the president-elect, and Democrat Kamala Harris, the vice president, with hundreds of thousands of more still being tallied in slower-counting states such as California. When those ballots are fully tabulated, the number of votes will come even closer to the 158 million in the 2020 presidential contest, which was the highest turnout election since women were given the right to vote more than a century ago. 'Trump is great for voter turnout in both parties,' said Eitan Hersh, a political scientist at Tufts University. The former president's victory in both the Electoral College and popular vote — Trump currently leads Harris by nearly 3 million votes nationwide — also contradicts the belief in politics that Democrats, not Republicans, benefit from high-turnout elections. Trump himself voiced it in 2020 when he warned that a Democratic bill to expand mail balloting would lead to 'levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.' That warning came as Trump began to sow conspiracy theories about using mail voting during the coronavirus pandemic, which he then used to falsely claim his 2020 loss was due to fraud. That claim led to a wave of new laws adding regulations and rolling back forms of voting in GOP-controlled states and an expansion of mail voting in Democratic-led ones, as the battle over turnout became a central part of political debate. Such laws usually have a miniscule impact on voting but inspired allegations of voter suppression from Democrats and cheating from Republicans. 'It's such an embarrassing story for proponents on both sides, because it's so obviously wrong,' Hersh said. Though both sides are likely to continue to battle over how elections are run, Trump's high-turnout victory may take some of the urgency out of that confrontation. 'Now I think, you just won the popular vote, I think it'll quiet down,' said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican data analyst and pollster who has long argued his party can succeed in a high-turnout election with a diverse electorate. Experts note that turnout in the seven swing states at the heart of the election was even higher than in the rest of the country. 'This was a campaign in seven states much more so than previous elections have felt like,' Ruffini said. While the rest the country shifted significantly from 2020, when Democrat Joe Biden won the popular vote by 7 million, or 4.5 percentage points, the outcome in the swing states was closer. The turnout story also was different. Turnout dropped from 2020 in noncompetitive states such as Illinois, which recorded more than 500,000 fewer votes than in the last presidential election, and Ohio, which reported more than 300,000 less. Meanwhile, the number of votes cast topped those in 2020 in the battleground states of Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which Trump won. Arizona's turnout was nearly even with four years ago, as the state continued to count ballots. Harris even met or topped Biden's vote totals in Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin, and turnout has far eclipsed that of the 2016 presidential election, when 135.6 million voters cast ballots in a race won by Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton. The problem for Democrats is that Trump did better in the battlegrounds than four years ago. 'The Harris campaign did a pretty good job getting voters out who wouldn't have come out,' said Tom Bonier, a Democratic data analyst. 'She did get her voters out. Trump got more.' Those Trump turnout victories included first-time voter Jasmine Perez, 26, who voted for Trump at the Las Vegas Raiders stadium. 'I’m a Christian and he really aligns with a lot of my values as a Christian in America, and I like that he openly promotes Christianity in America,' Perez said. Voting alongside her was Diego Zubek, 27, who voted for Trump in 2016 but didn’t vote in 2020 because he figured Trump would win easily. He voted for Trump this year. 'I wasn’t going to let that happen again,' Zubek said. A key part of the GOP strategy was reaching out to voters such as Perez and Zubek, encouraging early and mail voting after Republicans had largely abandoned them in the past two elections due to Trump's lies about vote fraud. Conservatives mounted extensive voter registration and get-out-the-vote operations targeting infrequent voters, a demographic that many operatives have long believed would not vote for the GOP. More than half the votes were cast before Election Day this year, according to AP tracking of the advanced vote. During the campaign, Andrew Kolvet, a spokesman for Turning Point Action, a conservative group that ran a get-out-the-vote campaign with more than 1,000 workers in multiple battleground states, cited Stacey Abrams, a onetime Democratic candidate for Georgia governor, as an inspiration in his group's effort. Abrams' success mobilizing Black voters and other groups in her home state that were less likely to vote helped pave the way for Biden's 2020 win there. 'We saw that Trump has this amazing reservoir of low-propensity conservatives who needed a little coaxing,' Kolvet said in an interview Friday. 'They didn't think their vote mattered, and their No. 1 pushback was they didn't understand, really, how to vote.' Kolvet acknowledged that conservatives long believed large turnout didn't help them but contended that's changed in the Trump era: 'Our ideas are more popular,' he said. Whether it continues is up to what happens next in Washington. 'It's going to be up to conservatives to make good on those campaign promises,' Kolvet said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-big-voter-turnout-this-year-benefited-republicans-contradicting-conventional-political-wisdom/	2024-11-17T07:04:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673a069e2d5c43.51697419.jpeg?w=900
Texas' officials signal border spending cut amid Trump return	(NewsNation) — With President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House, Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick have signaled openness to cutting the state’s spending on border security, the Texas Tribune reported. The former president has continuously hinted at several actions he plans to take when he returns to office, key among them being mass deportation. Abbott told reporters last week that Texas 'will have the opportunity to consider' repurposing the state money it has plowed into Operation Lone Star. Texas has allocated $11 billion to Operation Lone Star since it launched in 2021. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Abbott’s office had asked lawmakers to approve another $2.9 billion in the upcoming legislative session and now says OLS money could be used for things like property tax cuts or education, the Texas Tribune reports. 'President Trump will provide a more secure border than any president in the history of the United States of America,' Abbott said a day after the election. 'I’ve had private talks with the president, and he’s going to be stronger and better at securing the border than he was in his first term, which was very strong and effective.' Trump taps fracking CEO Chris Wright for Energy secretary Patrick, another top elected official in Texas, said that Trump’s victory could mean shifting spending priorities for the state. 'We had to do everything we could to protect our citizens,' Patrick said in an interview with WFAA-TV in Dallas. 'We’re going to be able to take a lot of that money now and put it back to our taxpayers, for roads, for water, for education, for health care, for all the things that we need that Joe Biden forced us to spend because he was letting millions of people cross the border.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/texas-border-spending-cut-trump-return/	2024-11-16T20:34:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670f11ae897139.98474181.jpeg?w=900
Ohio governor condemns reports of neo-Nazis marching in Columbus	COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and multiple Columbus city officials made their thoughts known Saturday after receiving earlier reports that a group of neo-Nazis marched in the Short North Arts District. NewsNation affiliate WCMH received multiple eyewitness accounts and video around 1:45 p.m. of the march, which showed at least eleven people wearing masks walking down the sidewalk. The group carried flags bearing swastikas near the intersection of 1st Avenue and North High Street, and also shouted obscenities into a megaphone. DeWine, who denounced the group’s actions, also confirmed more details of the incident. 'We will not tolerate hate in Ohio,' DeWine wrote. 'Neo-Nazis — their faces hidden behind red masks — roamed streets in Columbus today, carrying Nazi flags and spewing vile and racist speech against people of color and Jews. There were reports that they were also espousing white power sentiments.' Model charged in stabbing death in the Bronx City Council President Shannon Hardin rejected the group's 'pathetic efforts to promote fear and hate.' 'I’ve been in touch with law enforcement about Nazis marching through the city,' Hardin said. City Attorney Zach Klein also confirmed he was in contact with Columbus police regarding the march, and would 'continue to monitor this hate group's actions.' 'Displays of neo-Nazi hate have no home in Columbus,' Klein wrote. 'Take your flags and the masks you hide behind and go home and never come back.' Customers pour in after Whoopi Goldberg criticizes bakery NBC4 reached out to Columbus police and asked if any arrests were made as a result of the march. They have not said if anyone was detained as of 5:30 p.m. Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther also shared a statement regarding the march. 'We will not allow any of our neighbors to be intimidated, threated or harmed because of who they are, how they worship or whom they love,' Ginther said. 'We reject the cowardly display reported in the Short North earlier today.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/ohio-governor-condemns-reports-of-neo-nazis-marching-in-columbus/	2024-11-16T20:01:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Zach-Klein-and-Andrew-Ginther.jpg?w=900
Texas Republican to propose House committee targeting cartels	(NewsNation) — Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, plans to introduce legislation establishing a House select committee aimed at combating Mexican drug cartels when the Trump administration takes office in January. The proposed bill would authorize the use of military force specifically against the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels, though not against Mexico itself. The legislation would expand presidential powers to target cartel operations through intelligence, surveillance and cyber capabilities. 'The cartels are the greatest near-term threat. Full stop. President Trump agrees,' Crenshaw stated on social media. The Texas congressman, who leads the House Cartel Task Force, emphasized that a select committee would improve chances of moving anti-cartel legislation to the House floor. Homan outlines enforcement priorities as Trump’s ‘border czar’ The push for expanded powers comes after recent high-profile arrests of cartel leaders. U.S. authorities have apprehended Sinaloa Cartel co-founder Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, son of notorious kingpin El Chapo. Both men allegedly oversaw drug trafficking operations, including fentanyl distribution to the United States. 'I lead the House Cartel Task Force. We have solutions. But we don’t have any authority. A select committee will have a better chance of moving these bills to the House floor and to a president who will sign them,' Crenshaw wrote in a post on X. However, the initiative faces significant diplomatic hurdles. Mexican officials maintain their long-standing position against allowing U.S. military or special forces to operate on Mexican soil in anti-cartel operations. The lack of Mexican cooperation could complicate enforcement efforts if the legislation passes. Texas authorities on high alert for pre-Trump immigration ‘surge’ Crenshaw argues the measure would align House Republicans with Trump's aggressive anti-cartel agenda. The congressman cited concerns about cartel influence in Mexican politics and their expanding operational reach. The proposal comes amid a heightened focus on border security and drug trafficking as primary issues for the incoming administration.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/dan-crenshaw-committee-cartels/	2024-11-16T17:34:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/cartel.jpg?w=370
Gobsmacked' woman receives anti-gay text amid federal investigat...	The FBI is looking into a series of racist and offensive text messages and emails and encouraging any recipient to report details to the agency. The agency released a statement about the series of emails and texts Friday. 'The FBI is aware of the offensive and racist text messages sent to African American and Black communities around the country and is in contact with the Justice Department and other federal authorities on the matter. The reports are not identical and vary in their specific language, but many say the recipient has been selected to pick cotton on a plantation,' according to the statement. 'The text message recipients have now expanded to high school students, as well as both the Hispanic and LGBTQIA+ communities. Some recipients reported being told they were selected for deportation or to report to a re-education camp. The messages have also been reported as being received via e-mail communication.' Which of Biden’s executive orders does Trump plan to undo? The FBI had not received reports of violent acts stemming from the offensive messages and was evaluating all reported incidents, according to the statement. The department said it is working with the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and sharing information with law enforcement partners, and community, academia, and faith leaders. Diana Brier said she received an anti-gay text on Sunday. 'I'm not surprised that my information is publicly available and that it's known that I'm a member of the gay community,' she said. The text message referred to an executive order, and stated the recipient was required to check in at Nellis Airforce Air Force Base in Las Vegas on Jan. 20, which is Inauguration Day. 'Following check-in, you will be transported to an undisclosed location for LGB re-education camp for a period of no less than 8 weeks,' the text stated. 'Your new president, Donald J. Trump, looks forward to assisting you in becoming a mentally and emotionally stable member of society by eliminating lifestyles that have been detrimental to our American way of life through re-education.' 'At first, I was sort of gobsmacked,' Brier told the 8 News Now Investigators. The text also referred to Jesus Christ, an 'obligation to reproduce, birthing healthy white Christian children,' and language against 'transgenders.' There is also a threat included in the text that those unwilling to participate will be put away in a work camp for two years to life. Pentagon UFO office open to meeting with whistleblowers: Director 'Someone put a lot of thought and effort into this message. It was very detailed. It was very specific and very targeted towards the LGBT community,' Brier said. 'It was just something that, that I think I was just absolutely shocked and frankly repulsed and disgusted that this sort of rhetoric, this hateful speech is being propagated so quickly, so rapidly, and so, so for no reason.' The 8 News Now Investigators looked up the phone number and did not find results for a user or owner. It has a 301 area code, which covers Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. Brier said she was sharing her story to encourage others to come forward. 'This is something we need to really get eyes on and really raise awareness and let my community know it's safe to let somebody know that you're receiving this,' Brier told the 8 News Now Investigators. 'If you've been on the receiving end of a hateful targeted message, tell someone. We need to be in a see something, say something kind of era.' In addition to encouraging recipients of the messages to report them, the FBI encouraged the public to remain vigilant and report threats of violence or anything considered suspicious. The 8 News Now Investigators also reached out to the Nevada Attorney General's office. Spokesperson John Sadler said the office has not received any complaints regarding offensive messages targeting the LGBTQ community but did receive several complaints regarding similar messages with racist language. Sadler said anyone who has received one of the messages is encouraged to file a complaint. 'This type of hate has no place in Nevada,' the Attorney General's office said in a statement. 'True Nevadans defend their neighbor, regardless of race, sexual orientation, political beliefs, or gender expression. They do not spread messages of hate.'

Pete Hegseth to face 'a lot of questions': Retired Army Gen.	(NewsNation) — Retired four-star Army Gen. Wesley Clark believes much is to play out before, and during, President-elect Donald Trump's appointment of Pete Hegseth as the next secretary of defense. Clark joined 'Morning in America' to discuss Hegseth's elevation, which has been criticized by the media. In an interview on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' last week, Hegseth unequivocally said 'We should not have women in combat roles. 'It hasn’t made us more effective, it hasn’t made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated,' he added. Clark believes women are more than capable of serving in combat. He noted that Hegseth will have to answer questions regarding the topic and more. Pete Hegseth: What to know about Trump’s pick for Defense Secretary 'He's got to have a degree of open-mindedness,' Clark told NewsNation. 'Things look different when you're a captain looking up at a big organization, especially when you're in counterinsurgency operations, and when you're looking through the organization, you may find that your opinions are different, and if you hang on to them and try to enforce those prejudices, yeah, it could be some difficulties.' Hegseth was part of an investigation into a sexual assault in 2017, according to the Monterey Police Department. Few details about the case have been released. 'You know, if he's got these incidents behind him, does he represent the kind of ethics that we demand of our leaders in the military? And if he doesn't, that's a problem,' Clark added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/pete-hegseth-to-face-questions/	2024-11-16T14:17:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1167012751.jpg?w=900
Which of Biden's executive orders does Trump plan to undo?	(NewsNation) — After President Joe Biden leaves the White House in January, Trump could leverage the newly Republican-controlled Congress to take aim at several Biden executive orders he no longer wants in place. Which ones could be in the most jeopardy? Immigration In June, Biden announced a series of executive actions that would limit the flow of illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border. The changes allowed his administration to close the border between legal ports of entry, meaning border agents could turn away asylum-seekers if crossings surpassed a certain number per day. Trump tests GOP with controversial Cabinet picks Biden also implemented a policy that aimed to ease the path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants who are married to U.S. citizens, but a federal judge struck it down earlier this month. The program allowed undocumented spouses and stepchildren of U.S. citizens to apply for a green card without first having to leave the country. One of Trump's campaign issues is to 'carry out the largest deportation operation in American history,' according to his campaign website. He will likely push for a complete overhaul to implement immigration policies of his own. Police: Trump cabinet pick Hegseth involved in 2017 sexual assault investigation LGBTQ+ rights In 2022, Biden signed an executive order on 'Advancing Equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Individuals.' The policy made unlawful any discrimination against people in the LGBTQ community. It was consistent with another of his executive orders that year on addressing discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. Trump's platform has promoted banning transgender women from participating in women's sports and mandating teachers to report students who tell them they are transgender. What does the Department of Education do? Reproductive health care Roe v. Wade, which protected the federal right to abortion, was overturned in 2022. However, a majority of voters in seven states this election cycle passed ballot measures to protect the right to abortion in their respective state constitutions. During Trump's presidential campaign, he said he would not sign a federal abortion ban and instead supported states deciding their own policies. Yet Vice President-elect JD Vance said on the campaign trail that he would support a nation law limiting rights. Biden issued an order that ensured women's access to reproductive health care across state lines. Last month, he proposed a rule that would cover the cost of over-the-counter birth control. What are recess appointments, and can Donald Trump use them? Tax policies Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act removed the requirement for taxpayers to buy a health insurance plan, raised the standard deduction on tax returns, raised the child tax credit, suspended the personal exemption and more. Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act was passed to 'meet its climate goals and strengthen energy security, investing in America to create good-paying jobs, reducing energy and health care costs for families, and making the tax code fairer.' For taxpayers, the IRA provides a $7,500 credit to those who buy certain electric vehicles and home energy efficiency credits. Some Republicans have already said they plan to review the IRA.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/trump-executive-order-biden-plans/	2024-11-16T14:02:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2183892286_e9dad3.jpg?w=900
Trump taps fracking CEO Chris Wright for Energy secretary	(The Hill) — President-elect Trump on Saturday announced he would nominate Chris Wright, a donor and fracking company leader, to serve as his Energy secretary. 'Chris has been a leading technologist and entrepreneur in Energy. He has worked in Nuclear, Solar, Geothermal, and Oil and Gas,' Trump said in a statement announcing the pick. 'Most significantly, Chris was one of the pioneers who helped launch the American Shale Revolution that fueled American Energy Independence, and transformed the Global Energy Markets and Geopolitics.' Wright, a Trump donor, is the CEO of Liberty Energy, a fracking and oilfield services company. Wright will require Senate confirmation to lead the Department of Energy. In addition to that role, Trump said Wright would serve on a newly formed Council of National Energy being led by his nominee for Interior secretary, Doug Burgum. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? That council will focus on cutting regulations and increasing investments to ramp up oil and gas production. Trump has pledged to increase drilling upon taking office, even as the U.S. set records for oil production under the Biden administration, and he has signaled support for the fracking industry. The Energy Department oversees oil and gas production and exports, as well as the nation’s nuclear weapons program. Fracking, which is short for hydraulic fracturing, is an oil and gas extraction technique that kicked off the 'shale revolution' greatly boosting companies’ energy production potential and helping to make the U.S. the world’s top producer of oil and gas. The technology is controversial however, because of oil and gas’s contribution to climate change, as well as fracking’s links to earthquakes and childhood cancers. Trump ally and donor Harold Hamm, an energy executive, recently told publication Hart Energy that Wright was his top choice for energy secretary.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-taps-fracking-ceo-chris-wright-for-energy-secretary/	2024-11-16T14:01:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/trump_townhall_foxnews_101624-e1731794005406.jpg?w=800
Trump names attorney Will Scharf to key White House job	President-elect Trump on Saturday announced he was appointing Will Scharf, one of his personal attorneys, as White House staff secretary in his incoming administration. Scharf represented Trump as one of his lawyers during a hearing on presidential immunity before the Supreme Court and was a regular on television defending Trump amid his hush money trial in Manhattan. Staff secretary is a lower-profile position that carries significant importance within the White House. The staff secretary manages paper flow to the president and typically is in close proximity to the commander-in-chief. Rob Porter and Derek Lyons held the role during Trump’s first term. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'Will is a highly skilled attorney who will be a crucial part of my White House team,' Trump said in a statement. 'He has played a key role in defeating the Election Interference and Lawfare waged against me, including by winning the Historic Immunity Decision in the Supreme Court.' Scharf made an unsuccessful run for Missouri attorney general earlier this year, losing in a primary to incumbent Andrew Bailey. Trump endorsed both men in the primary. Scharf is the latest Trump attorney to get rewarded with an administration job. Trump earlier this week announced Todd Blanche, Emil Bove and John Sauer, all of whom represented him in the past year, were being tapped for senior roles in the Justice Department.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-will-scharf-lawyer/	2024-11-16T13:23:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/white-house_12152023_AP_AP23348831720567-1.jpg?w=900
California slated to rename places to remove Native American slur	The California Natural Resources Agency on Friday said that a racist term for a Native American woman will be removed from more than 30 locations in 15 counties, according to a press release issued Friday. The press release noted that Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) in 2022 signed a bill that bans the term 'squaw.' The agency was ordered to rename streets, bridges, public buildings, cemeteries and other places that use the slur. 'The 'sq_' is a word that denigrates Native American women and dehumanizes them,' California Assemblymember James Ramos (D), who spearheaded the bill, said in the release. The release stated the California Advisory Committee on Geographic Names is set to implement the new names, which were selected in consultation with the state's Native American tribes, by Jan. 1. First known case of mpox reported in Bay Area county The announcement comes on the heels of a ski resort in California changing its name after facing criticism over its original name, which used the slur. The new name, Palisades Tahoe, was announced in September after the resort acknowledged its former name was a racist and sexist slur following an internal investigation from August 2020 into the term and its etymology. The Interior Department had also announced in September that it removed the slur from federal place names after announcing a review in November. The department said the federal Board on Geographic Names has voted on replacement names for more than 600 places that included the term. The department also issued a full map of places where names were replaced.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/california-slated-to-rename-places-to-remove-native-american-slur/	2024-11-16T11:50:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/ca._squaw_valley_gettyimages-1212449999.jpg?w=900
Lara Trump emerges as an early favorite to fill Rubio's Senate se...	Calls from Republicans are intensifying for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) to pick President-elect Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump to replace his secretary of State pick, Marco Rubio, in the Senate. On Thursday, Florida Sen. Rick Scott (R) said he hopes Trump picks his daughter-in-law, echoing his colleagues Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Katie Britt (R-Ala.). Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R) has also publicly backed her. Appointing Lara Trump would ensure that the incoming president has a loyalist in the Senate, but it would most definitely come with criticism from Democrats. But DeSantis, who has been on a trade mission in Italy this week, will ultimately make the final call. The governor himself and a number of figures from his orbit have been floated as well, including his own chief of staff, as well as the state’s lieutenant governor and attorney general. 'There are a lot of good names in the mix for the Senate seat, Lara Trump being one of them,' Republican Party of Florida Chair Evan Power said. 'I think she would be a capable voice if that’s the direction the governor decided to go in.' Lara Trump herself expressed interest in the position during an interview with Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo on Thursday. 'If this is something I am asked to do, I would seriously consider it, but I have yet to hear from Gov. DeSantis. So we’ll see what happens,' Lara Trump said. Lara Trump has received praise from Republicans across the board for her role as Republican National Committee (RNC) co-chair, given the party’s massive wins last week. 'She worked incredibly hard at the RNC and helped deliver a huge win for Trump and Republicans across the country,' said one Florida House Republican. 'She is articulate and would be a reliable MAGA vote for Trump.' The speculation over the seat’s future comes as the state has become the epicenter of Republican Party politics. In addition to nominating Rubio, Trump also tapped Florida's Rep. Mike Waltz (R) for national security adviser and former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R) for attorney general. Additionally, Trump is carrying out his transition operation from his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Fla., with his incoming chief of staff and veteran Florida political operative Susie Wiles. The dynamic could put Trump and DeSantis, who put their Republican primary rivalry aside ahead of the general election, on a potential collision course. The two famously engaged in a highly personal presidential primary battle. Another added element is Wiles’s central role in Trump’s political world. Wiles worked on DeSantis’s successful 2018 gubernatorial campaign, but the two developed a rift. She responded to news of DeSantis dropping out of the GOP primary in a post on social platform X, writing 'Bye, bye.' To be clear, the president-elect has not publicly pushed for Lara Trump to fill the position. Meanwhile, DeSantis endorsed the then-Republican candidate after exiting the primary, part of an effort at burying the hatchet. In April, Trump and DeSantis met for three hours in South Florida in a meeting that was arranged by businessman Steve Witkoff. Witkoff was appointed to be Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East earlier this week. Trump touted the meeting as 'great' and confirmed he had the 'full and enthusiastic support' of DeSantis. The governor was given a speaking role at the Republican National Convention months later and has played a central role in pushing for an investigation into the second assassination attempt against Trump in Palm Beach. 'DeSantis endorsed Trump, so by all accounts the relationship between the two of them is fine,' said Justin Sayfie, a Florida-based strategist. 'He endorsed him a lot earlier than Nikki Haley did.' 'There’s much more significant dynamics at play when you’re appointing a U.S. senator,' he added. But others say the relationship between the two men is not what it was before DeSantis challenged Trump for the nomination last year. 'Sure,' said the Florida House Republican when asked if the idea of appointing Lara Trump offers a good opportunity to repair the relationship between the president-elect and the governor. 'But does anyone actually believe that those two will ever trust each other again? Cordial, but unlikely to ever be fully repaired.' If DeSantis decides to move in a different direction than Lara Trump, he still has a significant pool of applicants. Other names floated to replace Rubio include DeSantis’s chief of staff James Uthmeier, Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez and state Attorney General Ashley Moody. 'All great people,' the Florida House Republican said. 'Also heard there are some congressional names being batted about. This is the [governor’s] call and only he and Casey are going to be in the know,' they said, referring to Florida first lady Casey DeSantis. The timing of any appointment is unclear given questions surrounding the president-elect’s push to use recess appointments. And any convention confirmation process would take place after Trump is inaugurated next year. However, Rubio, unlike a number of Trump’s other appointments, will likely face an easier confirmation process. 'This is not imminent,' Sayfie said.

Nicholas Begich projected to win Alaska US House-at-large race	(NewsNation) — NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ has called the race for Alaska’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in favor of Nicholas Begich. See the results of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate races across the country here. Democratic incumbent Rep. Mary Peltola and Republican challenger Nick Begich were the two leading vote-getters coming out of the primary election, from which the top four candidates advanced to the November general election regardless of political party. Peltola was first elected to the House in 2022 via special election to replace longtime GOP Rep. Don Young, who died in March 2022. She was later elected to a full term that same year. Begich, a businessman who lost twice to Peltola in 2022, received an endorsement from former President Donald Trump. Two other candidates, John Wayne Howe of the Alaskan Independence Party and Democrat Eric Hafner, also appeared on Tuesday’s general election ballot due to Alaska’s ranked-choice general election system. See NewsNation’s election live blog with real-time analysis from our political experts and the latest race calls nationwide powered by Decision Desk HQ. Watch live results from the presidential election, important swing states and the balance of power in Congress. NewsNation will also be tracking your local state elections and impactful ballot initiatives around the country. Despite finishing outside of the top four in the August primary, Howe and Hafner appeared on the ballot after Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom and Republican Matthew Salisbury both withdrew from consideration for the seat. Hafner will appear on the ballot despite being incarcerated in the Otisville Federal Correctional Institution in New York. He’s serving a 20-year prison sentence for threatening public officials in New Jersey. An Anchorage Superior Court judge ruled that Hafner — who received less than 1% of the primary vote along with Howe — was eligible to remain on the ballot for Tuesday’s election. Heading into Tuesday’s election, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives were up for election. Republicans control the chamber with a narrow majority of 220 seats, while the Democrats occupy 212 with three vacancies.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/nicholas-begich-projected-to-win-alaska-us-house-at-large-race/	2024-11-16T11:07:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Thumb-Alaska-Nick-Begich.jpg?w=900
Kamala Harris raised $1 billion-plus in defeat. She's still sendi...	ATLANTA (AP) — Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party's prodigious fundraising operation raised more than $1 billion in her loss to Donald Trump, but the vice president is still pushing donors for more money after the election. Democrats are sending persistent appeals to Harris supporters without expressly asking them to cover any potential debts, enticing would-be donors instead with other matters: the Republican president-elect's picks for his upcoming administration and a handful of pending congressional contests where ballots are still being tallied. 'The Harris campaign certainly spent more than they raised and is now busy trying to fundraise,' said Adrian Hemond, a Democratic strategist from Michigan. He said he was been asked by the campaign after its loss to Trump to help with fundraising. The party is flooding Harris’ lucrative email donor list with near-daily appeals aimed at small-dollar donors — those whose contributions are measured in the hundreds of dollars or less. But Hemond said the postelection effort also includes individual calls to larger donors. One person familiar with the effort and the Democratic National Committee's finances said the Harris campaign's expected shortfall is a relatively small sum compared to the breadth of the campaign, which reported having $119 million cash on hand in mid-October before the Nov. 5 election. That person was not authorized to publicly discuss the campaign's finances and spoke on condition of anonymity. But the scramble now underscores the expense involved in a losing effort and the immediate challenges facing Democrats as they try to maintain a baseline political operation to counter the Trump administration and prepare for the 2026 midterm elections. It also calls into question how Democrats used their resources, including hosting events with musicians and other celebrities as well as running ads in a variety of nontraditional spaces such as Las Vegas' domed Sphere. Patrick Stauffer, chief financial officer for the Harris campaign, said in a statement that 'there were no outstanding debts or bills overdue' on Election Day and there 'will be no debt' listed for either the campaign or the DNC on their next financial disclosures, which are due to the Federal Election Commission in December. The person familiar with the campaign and DNC's finances said it was impossible to know just where Harris’ balance sheet stands currently. The campaign still is getting invoices from vendors for events and other services from near the end of the race. The campaign also has outstanding receipts; for example, from media organizations that must pay for their employees’ spots on Air Force Two as it traveled for the vice president’s campaign activities. Within hours of Trump picking Florida Republican Matt Gaetz for attorney general on Wednesday, Harris' supporters got an appeal for more money for 'the Harris Fight Fund,' citing the emerging Trump team and its agenda. Gaetz, who resigned his House seat after the announcement, 'will weaponize the Justice Department to protect themselves,' the email said. It said Democrats 'must stop them from executing Trump’s plans for revenge and retribution' and noted that 'even his Republican allies are shocked by this' Cabinet choice. Another appeal followed Friday in Harris' name. 'The light of America's promise will burn bright as long as we keep fighting,' the email said, adding that 'there are still a number of critical races across the country that are either too close to call or with the margin of recounts or certain legal challenges.' The emails do not mention Harris' campaign or its finances. The 'Harris Fight Fund' is a postelection label for the 'Harris Victory Fund,' which is the joint fundraising operation of Harris’ campaign, the DNC and state Democratic parties. Despite the language in the recent appeals, most rank-and-file donors' contributions would be routed to the national party, unless a donor took the time to contact DNC directly and have the money go directly to Harris or a state party. The fine print at the bottom of the solicitation explains that the first $41,300 from a person and first $15,000 from a political action committee would be allocated to the DNC. The next $3,300 from a person or $5,000 from a PAC would go to the Harris for President 'Recount Account.' Anything beyond that threshold, up to maximum contribution limits that can reach into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, would be spread across state parties. Officials at the DNC, which is set to undergo a leadership change early next year, indicated the party has no plans to cover any shortfall for Harris but could not explicitly rule out the party shifting any money to the campaign. ___ Cappelletti reported from Lansing, Michigan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-politics/ap-kamala-harris-raised-1-billion-plus-in-defeat-shes-still-sending-persistent-appeals-to-donors/	2024-11-16T08:09:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6738c448c4f191.09734884.jpeg?w=900
Vaccine makers' shares drop after Trump chooses RFK Jr. for HHS	(NewsNation) — Shares in some pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including those that manufacture vaccines, fell this week after President-elect Donald Trump announced he chose Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. On Friday, Moderna, which produced COVID-19 vaccines, shares fell almost 7% after hitting their lowest level since April 2020, Reuters reports. Since Trump was announced the winner of the 2024 election, shares of Moderna went down about 30%. Pfizer, which also makes vaccines saw a 4.5% decrease on Friday as well, after the Wall Street Journal reported they dropped by 2.5% on Thursday. As of noon EST Friday, NewsNation partner The Hill reported Eli Lilly fell 4.2% percent, Amgen 4.9 percent and Novo Nordisk more than 3.1 percent. Noravak,which Reuters said only has one product, the COVID-19 vaccine, lost almost 2% Friday, Reuters wrote. Kennedy has made false claims about vaccines and spread debunked conspiracy theories about them, such as the false idea that they can cause autism. However, he still insists that he's not anti-vaccine, but that he wants them to be vigorously tested. Doctors and researchers have proven that risks from disease are generally far greater than the risks from vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in protecting people from hospitalization and death in multiple studies and trials. An estimated 154 million lives have been saved in the past 50 years because of vaccines, according to the The World Health Organization. Stephen Ubl, president of The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement to The Hill Thursday that the trade association wants to 'work with the Trump administration to further strengthen our innovation ecosystem and improve health care for patients.' Speaking to NBC right after the election, Kennedy said he wouldn't 'take away anybody's vaccines' if given a role in a second Trump administration. 'If vaccines are working for somebody, I’m not going to take them away. People ought to have choice, and that choice ought to be informed by the best information,' he told the news outlet. 'So I’m going to make sure scientific safety studies and efficacy are out there, and people can make individual assessments about whether that product is going to be good for them.' The Senate still needs to confirm Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

UAP whistleblower says they need greater protections	(NewsNation) — An unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) whistleblower is calling for greater protection for fellow whistleblowers so that there can be greater transparency on the issue. Former Navy pilot Ryan Graves, the first active-duty pilot to come forward publicly about regular sightings of UAPs, joined 'Morning in America' on Saturday to discuss the latest Congressional hearing. Several whistleblowers testified at a House of Representatives committee this week regarding the existence of UAPs or UAP-related government programs. '[They made] another major step forward in this conversation,' Graves said of the whistleblowers. UFO House hearing witness: Pentagon ‘clearly covering something up’ 'It's no longer just the last three witnesses that gave testimony last year. It's a continuing story that I think is prime for further conversation with the new administration coming in.' For a greater breadth of information, more security is needed according to Graves. 'I think we need to look to the Department of Justice, Congress, and the executive branch, to be able to provide those protections, so that these people that are willing to come forward have the ability to do so without fear of repercussions,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/uap-whistleblower-greater-protections/	2024-11-16T07:56:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2184177259.jpg?w=900
Progressive fault lines emerge after Harris's loss	Progressives are at odds with one another over how to hone their message to voters after losing the White House again to President-elect Trump. There’s little disagreement that things need to change. Democrats’ most recent electoral strategy has been rendered ineffective, delivering Trump back to Washington with his party’s full control of Congress. But there’s no consensus about what the left should do next. One camp says the future is with economic populists, a group that puts financially disadvantaged voters of all demographics at the forefront. They believe that if Democrats prioritize class struggles over culture wars on the national stage, they will alienate fewer people and have a shot at winning again. The other group of progressives sees room for several top-tier priorities, with shifting orders of importance. They believe their wing can emphasize all aspects of identity politics, while also standing up for democracy, the rule of law and a brighter economic future all at once. 'The idea of economic populism being the actual patriotic lane is really good,' said Pete D’Alessandro, a former senior campaign aide to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) from Iowa. The distinction, some argue, is very subtle. The progressive wing is in agreement that class and identity are intersectional and there’s a deep belief that no group should be sacrificed at the expense of another. However, fault lines are emerging within progressive circles over the order and magnitude of each topic, foreshadowing a debate that’s likely to play out as Trump is sworn into office and as Democrats prepare to govern and reshape their party in the minority. Progressives who came of age in the Sanders wing have started conducting their own autopsies post-Nov. 5, hoping to get out ahead of various narratives that place economic realities low on the list of reasons why Vice President Harris lost to Trump. A grassroots group formed after Sanders’s first presidential campaign, Our Revolution, polled 12,000 progressives and found that 91 percent said 'the party has long neglected the multiracial working class.' 'The neglect of working people, the failure of the Democratic Party, the late switch from Biden to Harris and the campaign’s misguided focus on Cheney Republicans and celebrities' were key reasons for defeat, according to their poll of progressive respondents. Sanders has been on his own path after Harris’s campaign loss, trying to steer the conversation among progressives back to economic strife that played out in exit polls explaining part of Trump’s victory. He’s taken to legacy media, from cable news to The New York Times, to explain why a working-class agenda should be core to Democrats’ DNA. In recent discussions, the senator has emphasized that identity is inherently tied to struggles of different diverse working-class segments. 'You can say, ‘We are going to fight for a bigotry-free America' — that’s an ongoing struggle. We made progress, got a long way to go,' Sanders told the Times’s podcast 'The Daily' this week. 'But at the same time we can stand up for the working class in this country, which by the way, happens to be significantly African American and Latino and women, who are the bulk of the working class,' he stressed. 'It’s going forward in both directions. That is a winner.' The ascendant Sanders wing — which progressives agree is in the talent search phase for new, younger leadership — is also sharply critical of the notion that the composition of voters who supported Trump are inherently prejudiced. 'Some of the Democrat pundits say, ‘Well the problem is all of these Trump people are racist and they’re sexist and they’re homophobes.' Well no doubt that some of them are, and that’s true. Most of them are not,' Sanders said. 'They are, in large numbers, working class people, and we’ve got to speak to them in an economic perspective that is clear and straightforward.' Stevie O'Hanlon, communications director for the Sunrise Movement, said a key problem is that 'most Democrats have failed to present themselves as a credible voice for working people.' 'For the first time in years, the Democratic nominee lost the votes of households making less than $100,000 and won those making more than that. This is the cost of decades of policy and rhetoric from Democratic leadership that has allowed Trump claim to be the champion for working class and middle-class people,' O'Hanlon told The Hill. While Sanders is making that case outwardly, others on the left who share his world view are tailoring the message to fit their personal brands. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a staunch Sanders ally and member of the 'squad,' removed her pronouns from her bio on the social platform X this week. 'I think it’s a small thing,' said one source familiar with Ocasio-Cortez’s messaging. Still, the use of pronouns as personal descriptors has been widely adopted among Capitol Hill progressives, who see issues of gender identity as critical to the Democratic Party’s bid for inclusiveness. Liberals have created space for communities that have faced disproportionate discrimination, including the LGBTQ population, to strike a contrast with the GOP. While losses for Democrats were widespread, progressives added their first openly transgender member of Congress to their slate with Rep.-elect Sarah McBride (D-Del.), who offered a unique perspective in a press briefing with Congressional Progressive Caucus leadership. 'What I was hearing was that the American dream is increasingly unaffordable and inaccessible,' McBride said about running in Delaware’s only congressional district, which spans throughout major urban and suburban as well as rural areas and crosses into the Philadelphia media market. McBride said that being in that market exposed voters to Trump and Republicans’ attempt to divide over gender and identity, an approach that ultimately didn’t work. 'I didn’t run on my identity, but my identity was not a secret,' she said. The millennial congresswoman’s X bio simply reads: 'Delaware's Congresswoman-elect. Working to deliver for ALL Delawareans.' 'When people can't afford rent or food, they look for people to blame,' O’Hanlon said. 'Trump and far-right politicians have told people to blame immigrants or trans people or people of color. That was a core part of Trump's closing message: ‘Kamala Harris cares more about X group than you.’ Democrats need to stand up forcefully against these attacks and work overtime to show they are fighting to deliver for people.' As a growing group focuses on economic populism, others in the progressive movement are interested more immediately in issues that may arise under Trump. They see threats to the judicial branch on the horizon that some believe can be minimized before the president-elect reclaims the Oval Office. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who many college-educated and affluent liberals credit for emphasizing cultural issues, outlined her vision for Democrats rooted in bulletproofing democracy. 'While still in charge of the Senate and the White House, we must do all we can to safeguard our democracy,' Warren wrote in a new op-ed in Time. 'Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer must use every minute of the end-of-year legislative session to confirm federal judges and key regulators — none of whom can be removed by the next President.' The Warren-aligned Progressive Change Campaign Committee circulated a petition titled: 'Protect Democracy while you can,' asking for support for key legal structures. Warren is poised to take on an elevated role within the Senate minority, where she’s pledged to uplift 'working families' as the Banking Committee’s leading Democrat. While the Massachusetts senator also promotes an agenda for low-income Americans, her use of 'families' is another slight distinction from Sanders’s rhetoric about working class people, which does not necessarily specify a family unit. Some populist progressives say it’s an easy bridge between the two camps, which are already in agreement that the drivers of income inequality are mass concentration among the country’s wealthiest individuals and the dominance of corporate influence to keep the status quo intact. 'I’m not as worried about them,' D’Alessandro said about the two approaches. 'I’m more worried that the pendulum swings too far the other way and we get more of the Buttigieg, Ritchie Torres '70s Republican kind of politicians.' 'I think with the Warren folks it’s an easier discussion because it’s tactics. Nobody is saying don’t stand for those things,' he said. 'It’s more of what to lead with. If we fight each over tactics the corporate Dems like the guys I mentioned will just zip through the opening.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/progressive-fault-lines-emerge-after-harriss-loss/	2024-11-16T07:51:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Progressive-Battle_111624_AP_Brynn-Anderson.jpg?w=900
Iranian official met with Musk in a possible step to ease tension...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Iran successfully sought a meeting with Elon Musk, according to a U.S. official, one in a series of steps that appeared aimed at easing tensions with President-elect Donald Trump. Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani met with Musk — a Trump ally named this week to advise his administration on ways to cut the federal government — on Monday in New York, according to a U.S. official briefed on the meeting by a foreign colleague. The official said he had been informed that the discussion covered a variety of topics, most notably Iran’s nuclear program, its support for anti-Israel groups throughout the Middle East and prospects for improved relations with the United States. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a non-U.S. governmental meeting, said no immediate decisions were taken by either side. The official said the Iranians sought the meeting with Musk, the world's richest man, and that it did not take place at the Iranian mission to the U.N. The Trump transition team would not confirm or deny the meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times. 'The American people re-elected President Trump because they trust him to lead our country and restore peace through strength around the world. When he returns to the White House, he will take the necessary action to do just that,' Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump transition, said in a statement. However, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported on Saturday that Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei denied the country’s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani met with Musk in New York and expressed surprise at the extensive media coverage by American outlets on this matter. Iran's outreach comes as Trump has been announcing picks for key foreign policy posts — including Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Rep. Mike Waltz for national security adviser — who are expected to be tough on Iran. Intelligence officials have said Iran opposed Trump's second term, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Trump’s administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge. The Justice Department this month revealed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Trump, charging a man who said he had been tasked by an Iranian government official in September with planning Trump's assassination. The Iranian foreign ministry rejected the report. The plot was part of what federal officials have described as ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. government officials, including Trump, on U.S. soil. Last summer, for instance, the Justice Department charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in a murder-for-hire plot targeting American officials. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials, that Iran told the Biden administration in a written message delivered on Oct. 14 that it would not try to kill Trump. It was a response to an earlier warning from the U.S. that an attempt on Trump's life would be considered an act of war, the Journal reported. In response to inquiries about reports in the Journal and other outlets, Iran's U.N. mission said it does not issue public statements about 'official messages exchanged between the two countries.' 'The Islamic Republic of Iran has long declared its commitment to pursuing Martyr Soleimani’s assassination through legal and judicial avenues, while adhering fully to the recognized principles of international law,' its statement said. While Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, has repeatedly expressed his own disgust with Trump, Iran’s new reformist president has kept the door open to talks with Trump to seek relief from international sanctions. The Trump transition team did not respond to messages seeking comment on the Iranian mission's statement Friday. ___ Lederer reported from the United Nations. AP reporter Michelle L.

Israel's warfare in Gaza 'consistent with genocide:' UN special c...	(NewsNation) — Israeli actions in Gaza are 'consistent with the characteristics of genocide,' a United Nations Special Committee wrote in a report published this week that cited 'mass civilian casualties and life-threatening conditions intentionally imposed on Palestinians.' 'Since the beginning of the war, Israeli officials have publicly supported policies that strip Palestinians of the very necessities required to sustain life — food, water, and fuel,' the committee said. 'These statements along with the systematic and unlawful interference of humanitarian aid make clear Israel’s intent to instrumentalize life-saving supplies for political and military gains.' Israel's attacks on Gaza have killed over 43,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to The Associated Press. The war started after Hamas militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage, the AP wrote. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The report covers the period from October 2023 to July 2024. Israel's 'indiscriminate bombing campaign,' the UN special committee wrote in it, resulted in the widespread killing of civilians and 'mass destruction of civilian infrastructure, raising grave concerns of violations under international humanitarian law.' Attacks on civilians the report brought up include those on schools currently acting as shelters. Targeting systems enhanced with artificial intelligence that are being used by Israel to direct military operations have exacerbated the problem, the report states. Israeli soldiers, because they were relying on AI-assisted targeting, accelerated their decision-making and authorized strikes in a matter of seconds, the report said. Home-tracking of targets and night strikes also have disproportionately increased civilian casualties, report authors added. 'The committee is profoundly concerned about the indiscriminate loss of life apparently caused by these artificial intelligence-enhanced targeting systems, especially when combined with the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects,' the report said. In addition, Israel's destruction of vital water, sanitation and food systems have created a 'lethal mix of crises that will inflict severe harm on generations to come,' the committee said. A Palestinian youth mourns nine people killed in an Israeli strike in Bureij refugee camp, Gaza Strip, Friday, Nov. 15, 2024. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana) Earlier this week, the AP reported that the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians is at its lowest level of the 13-month war. Aid groups say the Israeli military has hindered or even blocked aid shipments to Gaza even amid food security experts warning that a famine may already be underway. The situation in the West Bank, which the committee said is an 'apartheid system,' has also dramatically worsened since Oct. 7, per the report. Report authors said there has been escalating violence there, including a dramatic rise in child casualties, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. The report is scheduled to be presented to the UN General Assembly on Monday. The United Nations’ top court in January demanded Israel try to contain death and damage as it continues its military offensive in Gaza, calling on the country to 'take all measures' to prevent a genocide of the Palestinians. South Africa brought the case accusing Israel of genocide to the International Court of Justice last year. Israel has denied allegations it is committing genocide.

Trump has promised 'concealed carry reciprocity.' What would it d...	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's promises to sign a nationwide 'concealed carry reciprocity' law could soon become reality, and gun violence prevention groups are concerned. Donald Trump Jr. posted a video of his father on Instagram with the caption: 'BOOM! My father just announced full concealed carry reciprocity! The 2nd Amendment will stay and remain protected.' In the 2023 video, the president-elect outlines his plans to end crime, saying: 'I will protect the right of self-defense everywhere it is under siege. And I will sign concealed carry reciprocity. Your Second Amendment does not end at the state line.' RFK Jr. ‘not open to rationality’: Infectious disease expert What is concealed carry reciprocity? Reciprocity would make it legal for gun owners with concealed carry permits to carry weapons across the nation, even in states that don't honor out-of-state concealed carry permits. It's important to note that current law does permit a law-abiding gun owner to transport guns through states, just not carry or conceal the weapons under their clothing in some states. Gun safety group Everytown for Gun Safety is concerned that a blanket rule would pose a threat to public safety. 'States set their own standards for having guns and for carrying concealed handguns in public. These standards vary dramatically state-by-state,' the group said. 'States also decide which out-of-staters may carry concealed handguns within their borders.' Resident of senior living facility shoots employees: Police The group pointed out how reciprocity would hinder law enforcement's ability to know who is lawfully carrying a gun, with Everytown’s senior vice president of government affairs Monisha Henley telling ABC News, 'Gutting state gun laws just makes it easier for dangerous people to carry a hidden weapon with no training, with no questions asked.' Trump's Republican-controlled House passed the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act during his first term in the White House, though it was later scrapped by the Democratic-controlled Senate.

RFK will clean up FDA ‘corruption’: ‘The Food Babe’	(NewsNation) —Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will face tough questions from Congress about his controversial opinions regarding vaccines and drugs. But the work already done to make food safer by the nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services is what the country needs, according to one food industry observer. 'Half of the FDA budget is funded by industry. This is the type of corruption that he is going to remove when he is in Washington,' said influencer and author Vani Hari, aka 'The Food Babe.' She is especially focused on improving the quality of children’s breakfast cereals. 'There are 92 million boxes of Froot Loops sold every year in this country. 18% of American children have had at least one bowl of Froot Loops this week, because it’s served in schools,' Hari told NewsNation’s 'The Hill.' RFK Jr. ‘not open to rationality’: Infectious disease expert 'Our American companies cannot use ingredients that are banned and heavily regulated in other countries in the same exact products that they sell overseas. They’re using better, safer ingredients in Canada, in all of Europe, in Australia, in India. 'It’s extremely un-American to continue to do this. This is something that’s unethical and hypocritical and needs to stop immediately.' Hari also noted Kennedy’s lead in the longstanding battles with Monsanto over its weedkiller Roundup. The firm has paid more than $2 billion in compensatory and punitive damages to people who blamed the pesticide for their cancer diagnoses. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? When it comes to how Kennedy may shake up all of HHS, Peter Pitts, a former associate commissioner of the FDA, is all for it. Pitts told NewsNation's 'On Balance' that, though he doesn’t agree with many of Kennedy’s stands, 'but he is against the status quo. And I think giving the status quo a swift kick in the ass is a good thing. It keeps people on their toes. It’s creative destruction.' 'If we can get some positive outcomes where people are actually thinking about doing something different, that’s all to the good,' Pitts added. Trump tests GOP with controversial Cabinet picks Hari said that Kennedy is a strong advocate for regenerative agriculture, 'which would dramatically reduce the pesticides being used on our food that are decimating our American health at enormous rates.' Hari has written 'The Food Babe' blog for 13 years and has also written two books about food safety and ingredients. She has also been the target of criticism over the accuracy of some of her claims about the dangers of some food.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/rfk-fda-corruption-the-food-babe/	2024-11-15T18:34:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-151296637.jpg?w=900
Trump should share Prince Harry immigration docs: Heritage Founda...	(NewsNation) — The Heritage Foundation will be calling on President-elect Donald Trump's administration to release Prince Harry's immigration records, Nile Gardiner, director of the think tank's Margaret Thatcher Center, said on 'The Hill' Friday. 'Prince Harry is one of the most public figures in the world,' Gardiner said. 'I do hope that the new Trump presidency will release Prince Harry's immigration records for the American people to see for themselves — what is exactly in those records?' Since 2020, Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, have lived in California. After the couple left their full-time positions in the monarchy, Harry criticized and alleged racism and other mistreatments from the royal family. How will new Trump administration staff picks reshape the US? Harry, the son of King Charles III and fifth in line to the British throne, formally confirmed he was a U.S. resident in April. The Heritage Foundation sued the Department of Homeland Security to release Harry's immigration records. They say Harry lied on his visa documents regarding a history of drug use. Harry wrote in his memoir 'Spare' that he experimented with cocaine and psychedelic mushrooms. In September, the Heritage Foundation lost that lawsuit, with the Biden administration saying Harry is entitled to his privacy. Speaking to GB News ahead of the election, Trump said he would ensure 'appropriate action' is taken if Harry is found to have lied on his visa documentation about the use of illegal drugs.

RFK Jr. ‘not open to rationality’: Infectious disease expert	(NewsNation) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s potential leadership of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) presents clear risks to the country’s overall health, according to an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. 'I think this is an irresponsible pick,' said Dr. Amesh Adalja. 'RFK Jr. can only be seen as a destroyer of health — not somebody who is going to promote health.' Adalja pointed to Kennedy’s views on vaccines in particular while criticizing his resume in public health. 'If he can be someone who questions vaccines, who smears vaccines, who lies about vaccines — that tells you that he's really trying to go after one of humankind's greatest achievements. And to me, that's not somebody that you want to be in power to be able to wield the force of government,' Adalja said. Florida doctor accused of deadly hit-and-run of man in wheelchair Kennedy has pushed back against critics who say he has anti-vaccine views. During a June 23 town hall hosted by WMUR-TV, Kennedy said if he were president, he would mandate prelicensing safety trials for vaccines and 'allow parents to make of their minds about whether they want to use vaccines for their children.' For Adalja, however, that’s mostly empty rhetoric. 'Whatever (RFK Jr.) may say about other things, his cognitive approach to vaccines colors everything else. This is how this man thinks — or doesn't think,' he said. RFK Jr. became fixated on a belief that many vaccines were not safe about 15 years ago. He’s since emerged as one of the leading voices in the anti-vaccine movement, and his work has been described by public health experts and even members of his own family as misleading and dangerous. How will Trump’s tariffs impact everyday Americans? '(RFK Jr.) is not open to rationality,' Adalja said. 'This is a fixed idea in his mind, and I don't think that someone susceptible to that style of nonthinking is someone you want making decisions about any kind of anything regarding health.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/rfk-jr-irrational-says-infectious-disease-expert/	2024-11-15T15:25:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2170581633.jpg?w=900
Police: Trump cabinet pick Hegseth involved in 2017 sexual assaul...	MONTEREY, Calif. (KRON) -- Pete Hegseth, who Donald Trump recently tapped to lead the Department of Defense, was part of an investigation into sexual assault in 2017, the Monterey Police Department said. Police shared few details about the case but confirmed that an investigation. The alleged assault happened at 1 Old Golf Course Road, near the Del Monte Golf Course in Monterey between midnight and 7 a.m. on Oct. 8, 2017. It was reported to police four days later. Hegseth is not specifically named as an alleged assailant in the department's press release. Disgraced San Jose councilman Omar Torres denied bail There were no weapons or property involved, and the victim had contusions on their right thigh. Police did not reveal what came of the investigation. MPD said it is not releasing any more information because it is not required to under the California Public Records Act. Here are a few things to know about Hegseth: He called to 'clean house' at the Pentagon Hegseth complains in his latest book that 'woke' generals and the leaders of the elite service academies have left the military dangerously weak and 'effeminate' by promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. He says rank and file soldiers are undermined by 'feckless civilian leaders and foolish brass,' adding that 'the next commander in chief will need to clean house.' He mocks and misgenders transgender servicemembers and says the military is turning off recruits. 'America’s white sons and daughters are walking away, and who can blame them,' he writes in 'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.' Trump’s defense choice stuns the Pentagon and raises questions about the Fox News host’s experience Like Trump, he espouses a traditional view of masculinity, writing that men are innately drawn to fight, compete and prove their strength. Also like Trump, he is sharply critical of NATO allies that he says are not spending enough on their own defense, calling them 'self-righteous and impotent nations asking us to honor outdated and one-sided defense arrangements they no longer live up to.' He calls the political left, 'America’s domestic enemies' and 'America-wreckers.' Hegseth’s writing is contemptuous of the policies, laws and treaties that constrain warfighters on the battlefield, from restrictive rules of engagement to the Geneva Conventions, which he suggests are outdated against enemies who don’t abide by them. He has little patience for the moral questions surrounding war. Of the Americans who dropped nuclear bombs on Japan to end World War II, he writes, 'They won. Who cares.' He calls to rename Defense Department back to its original moniker, the War Department, and implement a 10-year ban on generals working for defense contractors after retiring from the military. He's gone viral — with an ax Hegseth went viral and was later sued after he struck a U.S. Army master sergeant in the arm with an errant ax throw during a 2015 'Fox &amp; Friends' segment. Video of the incident shows the ax flying over a target and hitting Jeffrey Prosperie, a drummer in West Point’s Hellcats field band, who had been invited to the show for the 240th anniversary of the Army’s founding. Records show that the lawsuit was discontinued in 2019, and Brandon Cotter, Prosperie's attorney, said in an email Wednesday that 'The parties have resolved the matter and will make no further comment.' Prosperie did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Fox News, which was also named in the lawsuit, called the incident 'unfortunate and completely unintentional,' said it immediately apologized to him and offered medical assistance, which he declined. Prosperie has since returned to the network to perform with the West Point band. He’s questioned the role of women in combat Hegseth has pushed for making the military more lethal and said that allowing women to serve in combat roles hurts that effort. 'Everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat, means casualties are worse,' Hegseth said during an interview last week on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' podcast to promote his new book. 'I’m straight up just saying that we should not have women in combat roles — it hasn’t made us more effective, hasn’t made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.' While he said that diversity in the military is a strength, Hegseth also said it was because minority and white men can perform similarly, something he said isn’t true for women. By opening combat slots to women, 'we’ve changed the standards in putting them there, which means you’ve changed the capability of that unit,' Hegseth said in the podcast interview. Since then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter opened all combat roles to women in 2016, women have successfully passed the military’s grueling tests to become Green Berets and Army Rangers, and the Naval Special Warfare’s test to serve as a combatant-craft crewman — the boat operators who transport Navy SEALs and conduct their own classified missions at sea. He’s defended service members accused of war crimes In 2019, Hegseth urged Trump to pardon U.S. service members who had been accused of war crimes. He advocated for the servicemen’s cases on his show and online, interviewing relatives on Fox News. He posted on social media that pardons from Trump 'would be amazing,' and added hashtags with the names of those accused to reporting mentioning his private lobbying of the then-president. The effort was successful, with Trump that year pardoning a former U.S. Army commando set to stand trial in the killing of a suspected Afghan bomb-maker, as well as a former Army lieutenant convicted of murder for ordering his men to fire upon three Afghans, killing two. Trump also ordered a promotion for a decorated Navy SEAL convicted of posing with a dead Islamic State captive in Iraq. He’s a military veteran Hegseth has served in the military, although he lacks senior military or national security experience. After graduating from Princeton University in 2003, Hegseth was commissioned as an infantry officer in the Army National Guard, serving overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as at Guantanamo Bay. He was formerly head of the Concerned Veterans for America, a group backed by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, and also unsuccessfully ran for the Senate in Minnesota in 2012. According to his Fox News bio, he has a master’s degree in public policy from Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. As Trump formulated his first Cabinet following his 2016 win, he reportedly considered Hegseth to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. He again considered Hegseth when Secretary David Shulkin faced criticism before his ouster in 2018. He's a Fox News personality and author Co-host of Fox News Channel's 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend,' Hegseth has been a contributor to the network for a decade. He developed a friendship with Trump through the president-elect's regular appearances on the show. In a statement, a Fox News spokesperson complimented Hegseth's military knowledge, saying his 'insights and analysis especially about the military resonated deeply with our viewers.' He's also written a number of books, several for the network's publishing imprint, including 'The War on Warriors.' In announcing Hegseth's nomination, Trump complimented that book, noting its 'nine weeks on the New York Times best-sellers list, including two weeks at NUMBER ONE.' He would come to the job during a series of global crises Hegseth would lead the Pentagon with burgeoning conflicts on multiple fronts, including Russia’s war in Ukraine, the ongoing attacks in the Middle East by Iranian proxies, the push for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah, and escalating worries about the growing alliance between Russia and North Korea. While the Pentagon is considered a key job in any administration, defense secretary was a tumultuous post during Trump’s first term. Five men held the job during Trump's four years. Trump’s relationship with his civilian and military leaders during those years was fraught with tension, confusion and frustration, as they struggled to temper or even simply interpret presidential tweets and pronouncements that blindsided them with abrupt policy decisions they weren’t prepared to explain or defend. Many of the generals who worked in his first administration — both on active duty and retired — have slammed him as unfit to serve in the Oval Office. He has condemned them in return.

Sylvester Stallone calls Trump 'the second George Washington'	(The Hill) — Sylvester Stallone says President-elect Trump is as legendary as America's first commander in chief, praising him as the 'second George Washington.' 'When George Washington defended this country, he had no idea that he was gonna change the world,' the 'Rocky' star said while speaking at the America First Policy Insititute gala on Thursday at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort home in Florida. 'Because without him, you could imagine what the world would look like,' Stallone told the crowd. 'Guess what? We got the second George Washington,' Stallone said to applause. The 78-year-old actor also compared Trump to the title character in his 1976 film.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) 'When I did 'Rocky,' remember the first image was a picture of Jesus,' Stallone said. In the opening scene of the movie, Stallone recalled, 'the image pans out from Jesus onto Rocky being hit.' 'And at that moment, he was a chosen person. And that's how I began the journey. Something was going to happen. This man was going to go through a metamorphosis and change lives — just like President Trump,' Stallone said. 'We're in the presence of a really mythical character. I love mythology. And this individual does not exist on this planet. Nobody in the world could've pulled off what he pulled off — so I'm in awe,' Stallone said as he introduced Trump at the right-wing think tank's gala event. Stallone has been spotted several times at Mar-a-Lago over the years. In 2018, Trump said he pardoned late heavyweight boxing great Jack Johnson at the urging of Stallone.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/sylvester-stallone-calls-trump-the-second-george-washington/	2024-11-15T15:14:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Trump-Stallone-e1731686113166.jpg?w=900
Trump's stance on China looms over Biden's meeting with Xi	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at an economic summit in Peru on Saturday. NewsNation Washington correspondent Kellie Meyer says the trip will likely be overshadowed by Donald Trump's hard-line stance on China. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called competition with China a top concern as President Biden hands the reins to President-elect Trump. He said the meeting takes place during a 'critical moment between the US and China' and will 'ensure that we don't run into any problems in the next two months in this transition of power.' Live: Jose Ibarra stands trial in Georgia student Laken Riley’s death Sullivan was opaque about how Biden and administration officials will answer expected questions from Xi and his aides about the incoming Trump administration. 'Transitions are uniquely consequential moments in geopolitics. They’re a time when competitors and adversaries can see possibly opportunity,' Sullivan said. 'And so part of what President Biden will communicate is that we need to maintain stability, clarity, predictability through this transition between the United States and China.' During his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump promised to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S., a move that would jolt the already tumultuous relationship between Beijing and Washington.

Why votes are still being counted after the election was called	(NewsNation) — More than a week after Election Day, officials are still making their way through votes in several races that remain uncalled. Voters are waiting in the lurch on House races in California and Alaska, and Pennsylvania's Senate race has gone into an automatic recount due to the slim margin between the contenders. Each state has its own rules on ballot counting, which affects the speed of tabulations and release of results, leading to different lag times. And even though most races have been called, these are unofficial results projected by media outlets and not certified by election officials. That process could take several more weeks depending on state deadlines. Track your state’s election results What’s the difference between called and certified races? The election results reported on election night are never the final, certified result. Instead, those are unofficial projections called by media outlets or local election officials after polls close. Decision Desk HQ, used by NewsNation, uses forecasting models to provide the probabilities of each candidate winning each state in the presidential election and accurate estimates of the probability of Republican and Democratic victories in individual House and Senate elections. Local election officials will also aggregate data and report unofficial results for state and federal offices. However, these numbers are not officially certified, which means they are not final. Election certification refers to the process of 'election officials attesting that the election results are a true and accurate accounting of all votes cast in a particular election,' according to the Elections Assistance Commission. Presidential appointments: How do they work? Certification of election results varies between states and sometimes even between local jurisdictions within a state depending on the contest being certified, according to the EAC. After every valid vote has been included in the final results and all required processes have been completed, the election results will be certified. States have different timelines for the certification. What races still haven’t been called? Three House races in California and the single House seat that represents Alaska are still pending calls by Decision Desk HQ. In California’s 45th Congressional District, Republican incumbent Michelle Steel leads Democratic challenger Derek Tran by just 236 votes out of more than 300,000 votes cast as of Friday afternoon, when 93% of votes were in. In Central California, Republican incumbent John Duarte holds a two-point lead over Democrat Adam Gray in the 13th District with 84% of votes in. The state’s 21st Congressional District is also yet to be called. Democratic incumbent Jim Costa is leading against Republican Michael Maher, a former FBI agent, by 3% — or 4,739 votes — according to Decision Desk HQ, with 78% of the vote in. California is known for taking its time to count ballots. The state allows mail ballots to be counted if they are received up to seven days after Election Day, and it also sends mail ballots to all registered, active voters, which means its volume of mail ballots is much higher than other states, reported The New York Times. What to know about Trump’s inauguration Mail-in ballots require additional verification steps where each must be opened individually, validated and processed. The state’s deadline to certify and submit election results is December 13. Alaska’s ranked-choice voting system has contributed to the time it takes to tabulate results, which may still be a few more days. Ranked-choice voting allows voters to rank candidates by preference on their ballots. As of Friday, Republican challenger Nick Begich has a three-point lead over Democratic incumbent Mary Peltola. Two other candidates account for about 5% of the vote in the race for Alaska’s single congressional district. Alaska’s deadline for certification is November 30th. The U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania between Democratic incumbent Bob Casey and Republican David McCormick is headed for a statewide recount, which will take days for results as the process starts over. NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ called the race in favor of McCormick. Who is Matt Gaetz, Trump’s pick for AG? As of Friday, Casey received 48.54% of the vote with 3,364,650 votes, and McCormick had 48.8% with 3,388,453, according to the Department of State. Under state law, a 0.5% margin between opponents triggers a statewide recount. A noon deadline passed Wednesday for Casey to waive his right to a statewide recount, and Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s top election official, Secretary of State Al Schmidt, a Republican, announced that preliminary results had triggered a legally required statewide recount. By law, counties must begin the recount no later than Nov. 20 and must finish by noon on Nov. 26. The recount process largely involves running paper ballots through high-speed scanners, a process that former election officials say might not change the outcome by more than a few hundred votes.

What does the Department of Education do?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump pledged to eliminate the Department of Education and to return school choice to the states. Under new proposed policies for his second term, Trump said he would remove 'the radicals who have infiltrated the federal Department of Education, and get to Congress reaffirm the president’s ability to remove recalcitrant employees from the job.' What is the Department of Education? The federal agency, established in 1979, primarily oversees funding for K-12 public schools while also supporting college students. The majority of Department of Education funding goes to student financial aid. Federal Student Aid, an office of the U.S. Department of Education, is the largest provider of student financial aid in the nation. FSA makes postsecondary education possible for more than 9.7 million students each year. How elementary schools use DOE Funding for elementary schools and secondary schools supports economically disadvantaged school systems, USA Facts reports. Title I provides funding for children from low-income families. This funding is allocated to state and local education agencies based on Census poverty estimates. Annual funding to state and local governments supports special education programs to meet the needs of children with disabilities at no cost to parents. School improvement programs, which amount to nearly $6 billion each year, award grants to schools for initiatives to improve educational outcomes. How higher education uses DOE The DOE administers two programs to support low-income students attend college: Pell Grants and the federal student loan program, USA Facts reports. Pell Grants provide assistance to college students based on their family’s ability to pay. The maximum amount for a student in the 2024-25 school year is $7,395. In a typical year, Pell Grant funding totals around $30 billion. The federal student loan program subsidizes students by offering more generous loan terms than they would receive in the private loan market, including income-driven repayment plans, scheduled debt forgiveness, lower interest rates, and deferred payments. Why does Trump want to abolish it? Trump has accused the department of 'indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material.' 'Our schools must be totally refocused to prepare our children to succeed in the world of work,' Trump said in a September 2023 address. In the early stages of the presidential race, Trump laid out 10 principles for his education policy plan. What will happen to Title IX and transgender athletes? Keeping men out of women's sports has been a pillar of Trump's and some other Republican lawmakers' education policies. Transgender athletes are in jeopardy of being able to play sports that are in line with their gender identity. For example, a transgender girl who wants to play on a girl's softball team would be required to play boys' baseball under Trump's policies, which violates Title IX under its current directions. Title IX is a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in educational settings that receive federal funding. Will student loans be forgiven under Trump? Student loan forgiveness was not a focus of the Trump campaign, unlike Biden's promise to cancel student loan repayment during his run for president. Trump largely has not addressed this topic, but it's possible that eliminating DOE may impact student loans. Will Trump fully dismantle the department? According to an American Enterprise Institute senior fellow, Trump is unlikely to fully dismantle the entire Department of Education. Michelle Dimino, the director of Third Way’s Education program, says the repercussions of dismantling the Department of Education would be far-reaching and very alarming.

(NewsNation) — Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters emailed school districts Thursday, demanding they show students a video of him promoting Christianity in schools and leading a prayer for President-elect Donald Trump. The email, obtained by Oklahoma NPR collaborator StateImpact, included a link to a video of Walters blaming 'woke teachers’ unions' for pushing 'a hatred for this country.' He also invited students to join him in prayer, nothing that they didn’t have to participate. American farmers brace for new tariffs under Trump 'I pray for our leaders to make the right decisions,' Walters said, according to StateImpact. 'I pray in particular for President Donald Trump and his team as they continue to bring about change to the country.' Walters went on tout his new Office of Religious Liberty and Patriotism. He created the office 'in line with one of President Trump’s top education priorities, ‘Freedom to Pray,’' Walters said in a news release. The Office of Religious Liberty and Patriotism will oversee 'the investigation of abuses to individual religious freedom or displays of patriotism,' according to the release. It’s unclear what specific actions that might entail. Walters also announced Thursday the purchase of more than 500 Bibles for use in advanced placement government classes. It’s unclear what funds he used to purchase the Bibles.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/ryan-walters-filmed-praying-trump-made-students-watch/	2024-11-15T11:16:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/01/AP24030591042271.jpg?w=900
Malcolm X's family alleges FBI, CIA played role in his death	(The Hill) -- The estate of Malcolm X is suing the federal government, accusing it of playing a role in the 1965 assassination of the civil rights leader. In a lawsuit filed against the Department of Justice (DOJ), the FBI, the CIA and the New York Police Department (NYPD), the estate alleges the agencies all played a significant role in the events leading to Malcolm X's slaying and then engaged in a decades-long cover-up of their involvement. The complaint says the DOJ, FBI, CIA and NYPD were aware of credible threats against Malcolm X’s life but failed to intervene. 'As a direct result of the Defendants' intentional, bad faith, willful, wanton, reckless, unreasonable and/or deliberately indifferent acts and omissions, Malcolm X was deprived of his federal constitutional rights, was robbed of his life and freedom, and sustained severe physical, emotional, and monetary damages, including conscious physical pain and suffering,' the lawsuit states. LAPD Chief says police aren’t called on enough Malcom X, who was born Malcolm Little, was gunned down at age 39 by three men on Feb. 21, 1965, at the Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan, where he was set to deliver a speech. His pregnant wife, Betty Shabazz, and four daughters were in the front row. He was shot 21 times in the attack. The suit, brought by Malcolm X's daughter Ilyasah Shabazz and other family members, calls for $100 million in restitution. It also demands answers to questions still surrounding the assassination. Though three men were initially convicted for the killing, two were exonerated in 2021. That same year, a letter written by a former NYPD officer alleged that the NYPD and FBI covered up details of the assassination. Longest-waiting child in Arkansas foster care system finds forever family The officer, Raymond Wood, wrote that he was ordered to coerce members of Malcolm X's security team to commit felonious federal crimes 'so that they could be arrested by the FBI and kept away from managing Malcolm X's door security on Feb. 21, 1965.' The lawsuit alleges that under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover, then-head of the FBI, the entities 'went beyond mere allegedly illegal surveillance of Malcolm X, actively conspiring to reduce his protection and leaving him vulnerable to an attack they knew was imminent.' 'For decades, these agencies viewed Black activism as a threat to national security, resulting in the unchecked targeting of prominent leaders, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Marcus Garvey,' the family said in a press release. 'This lawsuit seeks accountability for the systemic negligence and intentional actions that deprived Malcolm X's family and the world of his life and legacy.' In total, the lawsuit lists nine causes of action, including excessive use of force against Malcolm X, deliberate creation of danger, failure to protect and the denial of access to the courts for his family. The suit also charges the defendants with conspiracy, fraudulent concealment and wrongful death. 'This cover-up spanned decades, blocking the Shabazz family's access to the truth and their right to pursue justice,' said civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the family in the suit. 'We are making history by standing here to confront those wrongs and seeking accountability in the courts.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/malcolm-x-federal-government-assassination-lawsuit/	2024-11-15T10:58:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/malcolmx_05161963ap-e1731695895630.jpg?w=800
Steven Chueng to serve as White House communications director	Steven Cheung, who has served as a top press aide on the Trump campaign for the past two years, will join the incoming administration as White House communications director, President-elect Trump announced Friday. While Cheung was not a regular presence on television like some of Trump's other aides, he has worked with the former president in a communications role for years, having served on Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns. Cheung also did a stint as a top communications official for The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a league headed up by Trump ally Dana White. The campaign spokesman is known for his combative presence on social media. How will Trump’s tariffs impact everyday Americans? The president-elect has yet to name a press secretary, which is a more forward-facing role in the White House. Campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt is widely viewed as the front-runner for that position. Politico first reported on Cheung's expected role. Cheung becomes the latest long-time campaign aide to secure a role in Trump's White House. Trump announced earlier this week that Dan Scavino, Stephen Miller, James Blair and Taylor Budowich would all take senior staff roles in the White House after playing prominent roles on the campaign trail.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/steven-chueng-white-house-communications-director/	2024-11-15T10:43:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/CheungSteve_052824_APPhotoSethWenig.jpg?w=900
What are recess appointments, and can Donald Trump use them?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Senate to allow him to use recess appointments to install his picks for high-level positions as he has already tapped some controversial nominees. How do recess appointments work? Using recess appointments as part of the general nomination process for an incoming administration is a break with tradition. The idea behind recess appointments is one of necessity if a position is vacated while the Senate is not in session, allowing the president to fill a role rather than leaving it open. In a recess appointment, presidents can bypass the usual confirmation process and unilaterally appoint whoever they like to fill the role. Gaetz nomination to head Justice Dept. in serious trouble: GOP senators However, partisan fights have prompted presidents to use recess appointments to skirt efforts by the minority party to block nominees. President Bill Clinton made 139 recess appointments, President George W. Bush made 171, and President Barack Obama made 32 recess appointments. Neither Trump nor President Joe Biden made any recess appointments during their time in the White House. A 2004 Supreme Court ruling put some limits on recess appointments, ruling that the Senate must be recessed for 10 days before a president can make unilateral appointments. What is the usual confirmation process for nominees? For high-level positions, including Cabinet members, judges and ambassadors, nominees must be confirmed by the Senate. The process includes vetting nominees with background checks, questionnaires and financial disclosures. Nominees also appear in a hearing before Senate members, where they face grilling from both majority and minority members. Here’s how much White House Cabinet members make The nominee is voted on by the committee and then by the full Senate, where a simple majority is required to confirm the role. Senate confirmations can become a lengthy process, especially when it comes to controversial nominees, and there are roughly 1,200 roles that an incoming administration will need approval for. Why does Trump want to use recess appointments? Trump has stated that recess appointments are needed so roles can be filled immediately. However, it's also likely the demand has to do with the nature of some of his nominees who will face a tough battle winning over Democrats and even some Republicans. Trump announced Wednesday that he was nominating Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to lead the Department of Justice, a pick that shocked some considering Gaetz was under review by the House Ethics Committee and has faced allegations of illicit drug use, sex trafficking and sexual activity with a minor. He has denied all of those allegations. Trump has also nominated former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, something not all Republicans have been on board with. American farmers brace for new tariffs under Trump Fox News commentator Pete Hegseth has been nominated for secretary of defense. While Hegseth served in the National Guard, he would be the least experienced person to hold the post in all of history. Trump has also chosen former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has also stirred controversy for his anti-vaccine arguments and promotion of conspiracy theories around health that have no scientific backing. Will Trump be able to use recess appointments for his nominees? Recess appointments have never been used prior to seating a new Senate, and it's not clear that Trump would legally be able to do so. His next option would be allowing the new Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-seat majority, to be sworn in and then making appointments when the Senate goes into recess. Newly-elected Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has said he is open to the idea of recess appointments, but not all Republicans may be on board with the idea of circumventing one of the key checks and balances on the executive branch. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The House can also prohibit the Senate from recessing in order to prevent such appointments. Should the Senate refuse to recess or the House block the Senate from doing so, Trump could use his presidential power to adjourn Congress in order to make his appointments without facing any opposition from Democrats or within his own party over nominees that may be considered unqualified.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/what-are-recess-appointments-trump/	2024-11-15T10:41:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2183887390_476145.jpg?w=900
Speaker Johnson urges Ethics panel not to release Gaetz report	Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is urging the House Ethics Committee to not release its investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), as pressure mounts on the panel to publish its findings about the Florida Republican who resigned from Congress immediately after President-elect Trump selected him to be attorney general. 'I do not, no,' Johnson told CNN and Politico reporters when asked if the panel should release its findings about Gaetz. 'I think it’s a terrible breach of protocol and tradition and the spirit of the rule.' 'I’m going to strongly request the Ethics Committee not issue the report because that is not how we do things in the House and I think that would be a terrible precedent to set.' The Speaker said he planned to talk to House Ethics Committee Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.) about the matter. Johnson later warned that issuing the report after Gaetz resigned Wednesday — and thus removed himself from the committee's jurisdiction — would 'open a Pandora's box.' Johnson’s lobbying for Gaetz is a striking break from the hands-off way House leaders have typically approached issues before the Ethics Committee in the past — and from what Johnson had said about the issues just two days prior. Gaetz nomination to head Justice Dept. in serious trouble: GOP senators 'As far as the timing of a release report or something, I don't know. The Speaker of the House is not involved in that — can’t be involved in that,' Johnson said Wednesday, shortly after he announced Gaetz had resigned from the House. The Speaker argued Friday that the 'House's tradition' on the matter is the panel not issuing reports after members leave the chamber. That move, however, is not entirely unprecedented; in 1987, the panel released its report into former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House. Asked about that example, Johnson said it reflected precedent being broken. 'I believe it is very important to maintain the House's tradition of not issuing Ethics reports on people who are no longer members of Congress,' the Speaker said. 'I think it would open a Pandora's box. It's a very important rule that should be maintained — if it's been broken once or twice, it should not have been.' 'If someone is no longer a member of Congress, we're not in the business of investigating and publishing a report of people who are not in this institution,' he later added. Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has repeatedly said Gaetz forced a vote to oust him because he refused to get involved in the Ethics Committee investigation. Gaetz denied that, citing strategy and policy disagreements as why he led the charge to remove the Californian. The Ethics panel has for years been investigating Gaetz, exploring whether he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. He has vigorously denied allegations of wrongdoing, and the Department of Justice, which previously investigated whether he had sex with a 17-year-old, declined to charge him with a crime. That Ethics Committee investigation, however, came to an abrupt end Wednesday, when Gaetz resigned from the House shortly after Trump nominated him to serve as attorney general. The Ethics panel does not have jurisdiction over former members of Congress. Pressure mounts on Ethics Committee to release Gaetz report Johnson declined to say if he has spoken with Trump about his stance on the release of the report. 'I'm not talking to anybody about what I said to Trump,' the Speaker said. It remains unknown what path the panel will follow with its Gaetz report. The committee was initially scheduled to meet Friday to vote on whether to publish its findings — a vote that had been on the calendar before Wednesday's developments — but the huddle was later canceled, two sources told The Hill. It remains unclear when the panel will meet next. 'It’s very fluid,' one of the sources said. Johnson said Gaetz abruptly resigned his seat in order to quickly start the process of electing a replacement and lessen his departure's impacts of the slim majority. Lawmakers have speculated Gaetz resigned his seat in an attempt to keep the report from coming out. Senators in both parties have said they want to see the Ethics panel’s findings before voting on his confirmation to the Cabinet position.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/johnson-panel-not-release-gaetz-findings/	2024-11-15T10:29:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/johnsonmike_111224gn17_w.jpg?w=900
American farmers brace for new tariffs under Trump	(NewsNation) — With President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House, his promise of increased tariffs is becoming closer to reality. On the campaign trail, Trump proposed at least a 10% tariff on all goods entering the U.S., with a 60% tariff on all imports from China. While these costs are attached to goods being imported to the country, they will likely also affect exports. During Trump's first term, a trade war over tariffs with China impacted key American crops, like soybeans and corn. The USDA said the dispute led to more than $27 billion in U.S. agricultural losses. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Farmers Ted Winter and John Fleming joined NewsNation's 'Morning in America' on Friday to share how these tariffs could impact the farming community and agriculture in the U.S. Winter, a Minnesota farmer and member of the Minnesota Farmers Union Executive Committee, said the tariff would impact farmers by reducing the amount of export sales they have to China and other parts of the world. 'That will impact our income and our bottom line for our farmers and our families,' Winter said. 'We need all the income we can right now because we're still suffering from the tariffs that were put on in his last term. Fleming, a North Carolina farmer and director of the American Soybean Association, agreed with Winter, saying farmers could lose about 14 to 16 million metric tons of soy export to China if the retaliatory tariffs were reinstated. 'We can look for other markets but there are no buyers in the marketplace big enough to absorb that volume,' Fleming said. Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security During the first Trump administration, Fleming said the American Soybean Association did recognize that soybean farmers were impacted by the tariffs and issued some tariff offsets to farmers that were helpful. However, Fleming said they are hoping they don't have to go down that road again. President Joe Biden kept most of Trump's China tariffs in place and increased them on China's electric cars and solar panels. Last year, U.S. soybean exports to China fell to around 26.4 million metric tons, which was down from 36.1 million in 2016. Winter said they haven't been able to regain the market and have lost more in the process since. 'China went to other places to buy their needs,' Winter said. He continued, 'If we can be in good trade relationships with China, and they buy our products, that gives us a market to move our crops into the marketplace. We don't need to have tariffs put on or increased by anyone.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/american-farmers-tariffs-trump/	2024-11-15T07:07:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2166486728.jpg?w=900
Here's how much White House Cabinet members make	(NewsNation) — A president's Cabinet is an advisory group of people who make up the heads of the 15 executive departments. Each is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. President-elect Donald Trump has announced some of his Cabinet picks, which include Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as the proposed secretary of state and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as the proposed Homeland Security secretary. If they pass the Senate's confirmation, their Cabinet salaries will be more than their previous compensations. Presidential appointments: How do they work? Average salaries for Cabinet members As of January, the annual rate of pay for Level I Executive positions is $246,400, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. These positions include all 15 Cabinet roles. Departments with leaders in the Cabinet include: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, Veterans Affairs and the Attorney General. In comparison, the salary for most U.S. senators and representatives is $174,000, which has remained unchanged since 2009. Exceptions include speaker of the House, president pro tempore of the Senate and the majority and minority leaders of both chambers, all of which are paid more. What is the net worth of Trump’s administration picks? Federal employee benefits As a federal employee, Cabinet members receive a generous employee compensation package beyond salary. Although many of Trump's picks are financially established and well off already, they can receive student loan forgiveness as a person in public service. They get 11 paid holidays, child care and commuter subsidies, paid parental leave up to 12 weeks, health and life insurance, retirement benefits and more.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/white-house-cabinet-members-salary/	2024-11-15T06:23:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1237563607.jpg?w=900
What is the net worth of Trump's administration picks?	(NewsNation) — Donald Trump’s proposed advisers for his second presidential administration comprises politicians, a TV news host, tech entrepreneurs – and billionaires. A billionaire himself, Trump is the richest American president in history, accounting for inflation, with a $5.2 billion estimated net worth as of Nov. 15, which is down from $6.7 billion on Oct. 31. His proposed Department of Government Efficiency would be led by billionaire friend Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump's Cabinet during his first term was considered to be the wealthiest Cabinet in previous administrations. While the DOGE position is not technically a Cabinet post, Trump's picks so far include plenty of wealthy individuals. But first, the president-elect needs the Senate to confirm his appointments, or he needs to arrange to install them via a temporary process known as recess appointments. Here is the net worth of the wealthiest members of Trump's proposed second-term administration. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far?

According to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list, as of Nov. 15, Musk has a net worth of $298.4 billion, owing to his tech companies. The X owner first appeared on Forbes’ billionaire list in 2012 with a net worth of $2 billion. Forbes reported that his net worth in October 2011 was $680 million.

He endorsed Trump and became a political surrogate for him throughout the election cycle. Ramaswamy, a Harvard graduate, earned his fortune through his pharmaceutical company Riovant Sciences, from which he stepped down as CEO in 2021. The entrepreneur’s net worth is $1 billion, according to Forbes as of Nov. 15. He was named to Forbes' America's Richest Entrepreneurs Under 40 list in 2016.

Live: Murder trial underway in Laken Riley's death	(NewsNation) — Opening statements will begin Friday in the trial of the man prosecutors say killed 22-year-old Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. Jose Ibarra, a Venezuelan national, is charged with murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, battery and tampering with evidence. If convicted, he could face life in prison without the possibility of parole. Prosecutors have said they won’t pursue the death penalty. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial earlier this week and instead opted for a trial by judge. Cigarette leads to man’s arrest in 1981 Indiana cold case: Documents The case became fodder for the national debate over immigration, but Riley’s family has said they don’t want her death exploited as a political wedge. The trial is expected to continue into next week. What we know about the case The investigation into Riley’s death began when a friend reported her missing on Feb. 22 after she didn’t return home from a run. Soon after, officers discovered her body on the University of Georgia campus in a forested area. The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Ibarra in connection to Riley’s death the following day. Prosecutors allege he beat the Augusta University student with an object and dragged her body to a secluded area off the jogging path. Police say the attack was random. People gather to mourn the loss of Laken Riley during a vigil for the Augusta University College of Nursing student at the Tate Plaza on the University of Georgia campus in Athens, Ga., Monday, Feb. 26, 2024. Riley, a nursing student at Augusta University's Athens campus, was found dead Thursday, Feb. 22, after a roommate reported she didn't return from a morning run in a wooded area of the UGA campus near its intramural fields. Students also gathered to pay tribute to a UGA student who committed suicide last week. (Joshua L. Jones/Athens Banner-Herald via AP) Fueling immigration concerns Riley’s death sparked widespread outrage over immigration policies in the United States. Immigration and customs enforcement quickly revealed that Ibarra and his brother were living in the country without proper documentation. Politicians and media outlets used Riley’s death to bolster false claims of a 'migrant crime wave' — an alleged phenomenon that statistics don’t support. 'I’d rather her not be such a political, how you say — it started a storm in our country,' Riley’s father Jason Riley told NBC News in March. 'And it’s incited a lot of people.' Multiple studies, including one published by the National Academy of Sciences, suggest U.S. citizens are more than twice as likely to be arrested for violent crimes, compared to the arrest rate of people in the country illegally. 'It makes me angry,' Jason Riley said. 'I feel like they’re just using my daughter’s name for that. And she was much better than that, and she should be raised up for the person that she is. She was an angel.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jose-ibarra-trial-opening-statements-laken-riley/	2024-11-15T04:51:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/snapshot-2024-08-02T091926.846.jpg?w=900
Gaetz nomination to head Justice Dept. in serious trouble: GOP se...	(The Hill) - Republican senators are warning that Rep. Matt Gaetz’s (R-Fla.) nomination to serve President-elect Trump’s attorney general is in serious trouble, even though Republicans will control 53 seats next year. Gaetz will get a chance to make his case for why he should lead the Justice Department, but Republican senators warn he faces an 'uphill' path to confirmation. In addition, Republican senators are supporting the call made Thursday by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) for the House Ethics Committee to release the findings of its investigation of Gaetz for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) questions Attorney General Merrick Garland during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on the Department of Justice, June 4, 2024, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Jacquelyn Martin, Associated Press) Two moderate Republican senators, Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), have already expressed strong reservations about Gaetz’s nomination to serve as attorney general. Four Republicans would need to vote against Gaetz to sink his nomination, and GOP members warn he is likely to encounter resistance from other members of their conference. 'He’s got an uphill climb,' Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said when asked about Gaetz’s nomination. Other GOP sources say Gaetz’s nomination is in serious trouble. Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who has a number of friends in the Senate GOP conference, told Bloomberg Television that Gaetz won’t secure the 50 votes he needs to become attorney general. 'Look, Gaetz won’t get confirmed,' he told the outlet. 'Everybody knows that.' Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told The Hill that McCarthy’s dire prediction is probably spot on. 'I think he’s pretty right, actually,' he said. But he said Trump’s decision to nominate Gaetz may have a strategic value that his GOP colleagues in the Senate — and political pundits — can’t understand at the moment. 'Donald Trump is a savvy guy. You never know his motivations,' he said. Cramer said, 'Gaetz is more than capable of litigating the case for why the [Department of Justice] should be turned on its head' but he added that Gaetz 'just doesn’t have the moral authority' to shake up the department after being embroiled in a federal sex trafficking investigation. 'I’m glad I'm not on Judiciary, put it that way,' he said, alluding to what is expected to be a fierce fight on the committee level over Gaetz. Some Senate Republican sources are speculating that Trump’s choice of Gaetz to head the Justice Department may be intended to draw scrutiny and opposition away from other controversial nominations. Two other controversial nominees are Pete Hegseth, the Fox News anchor Trump picked to head the Pentagon, and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), Trump’s choice to serve as Director of National Intelligence despite her past statements defending Syrian President Bashar Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Another bombshell dropped on Senate Republicans on Thursday afternoon, when Trump said he would nominate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has raised concerns about the safety of vaccines as well as fluoride in tap water. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Thursday that his panel should have access to the findings of the House Ethics Committee investigation of Gaetz. Cornyn said if the House panel found evidence of a crime, 'it would certainly be relevant.' 'I’m not going to speculate what the report shows, but that would certainly be a concern,' he said of evidence of sexual misconduct or illicit drug use.' Murkowski said Wednesday that Gaetz doesn’t pass muster with her. 'I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for attorney general. We need to have a serious attorney general,' she said. Collins said she was 'shocked' to learn of Gaetz’s nomination. 'I'm sure that there will be many, many questions raised at Mr. Gaetz's hearing, if in fact the nomination goes forward,' she said. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who was elected to take over as Senate majority leader next year, told reporters Wednesday that he won’t know whether Gaetz has the votes for confirmation until the Senate formally receives and begins to review his nomination. 'I don't know until we start the process, and that's what we intend to do with him and all the other potential nominees,' he said. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Gaetz has 'got some work cut out for him' to get enough votes to pass the Senate. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said his Republican colleagues' jaws dropped 'to the floor' when they learned of Gaetz's nomination. 'They're going to be faced with a very difficult decision. Many of them know Matt Gaetz. They know the investigations he's been under,' he told CNN in an interview. 'Matt Gaetz is being nominated because he will be and is today a political agent of Donald Trump. The ramifications of this pick, this particular pick, are stunning.' Trump’s controversial choices to head the Department of Justice, the Pentagon, the nation’s intelligence agencies, and the Department of Health and Human Services are already causing tension among Senate Republicans. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a loyal Trump ally, warned fellow Republican senators that they should get in line and vote for Trump’s nominees or face political consequences. 'Republicans if you’re not on the team, get out of the way,' Tuberville told Fox Business Network in an interview. And he suggested that Republican colleagues who vote against Trump nominees would face primary challengers. 'If you want to get in the way, fine. But we’re gonna try to get you out of the Senate too if you try to do that,' he said. He urged his GOP colleagues to let Trump fill his Cabinet with the people he wants and not to interfere, even though the Constitution provides the Senate with the role of providing advice and consent on executive and judicial branch nominees. 'Everybody’s got an opinion up here, but at the end of the day President Trump was elected by an enormous vote and he deserves the team around him that he wants,' he argued. 'It’s not us to determine that.' Those statements didn’t sit well with Murkowski, who as a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, will vote on Kennedy’s nomination to head the Department of Health and Human Services. She said senators have a duty to carefully evaluate nominees and judge their fitness to serve in key positions and not let worries about potential political reverberations drive their decisions. 'There is a process; it’s not discretionary,' she said of the Senate’s duty to provide advice and consent on nominees. She disagreed with Tuberville’s claim that 'it’s not us to determine' whether Trump’s nominees should serve in his Cabinet. 'It’s in the Constitution. It says, ‘This is the role of the Senate,’' she said. 'So I feel pretty strongly as a member of the Senate that we have our job to do just as the president has his authorities. 'I will not accept that the United States Senate should just be an extension of the White House. We are our own separate but equal institution,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/gaetz-nomination-gop-senators-reaction/	2024-11-15T04:45:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24156540230773-e1731668801536.jpg?w=900
Trump meets with Argentina's president, the first foreign leader ...	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Donald Trump met Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago club with Argentine President Javier Milei, the first foreign leader to meet with the president-elect since his victory in last week's election. The meeting was confirmed by a person who insisted on anonymity to discuss an event that hadn't yet been announced publicly. The person said the meeting went well and said Milei also met with investors. A short time later, Milei, a self-described 'anarcho-capitalist' and frequent recipient of Trump praise, addressed the America First Policy Institute gala at Mar-a-Lago. He spoke briefly in English, then gave a longer speech in Spanish, pausing to allow an interpreter to translate, in which he slammed left-wing ideologies and saluted Elon Musk, the owner of X, saying his social media site is helping to 'save humanity.' Milei criticized a political ruling class that he said was responsible for a system that used unfair tax systems to force 'the redistribution of wealth at gunpoint.' The president of Argentina also congratulated Trump on his 'resounding victory' in the election, saying, 'Today the winds of freedom are blowing much stronger' and calling the victory 'proof positive that the forces of heaven are on our side.' Trump also spoke to the gala crowd, congratulating Milei 'for the job you've done for Argentina' and saying it was an 'honor' to have Argentina's president at his club. 'The job you've done is incredible. Make Argentina Great Again, you know, MAGA. He's a MAGA person,' Trump said to applause. 'And you know, he's doing that.' Shortly after Milei’s election in November 2023, Trump posted on social media, 'You will turn your country around and truly Make Argentina Great Again!' Milei first met Trump in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in the Washington area. He has openly declared his admiration for Trump and when he saw him, he rushed to him screaming 'president!' and gave him a close hug before they posed for pictures. The Argentine president is known for his eccentric personality and first made a name for himself by shouting against Argentina’s 'political caste' on television. The right-wing populist campaigned with a chainsaw as his prop to symbolize his plans to slash public spending and scrap government ministries. ___ Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-trump-meets-with-argentinas-president-the-first-foreign-leader-hes-met-with-since-election/	2024-11-14T19:56:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6736c682523ce9.82994179.jpeg?w=900
RFK Jr. ‘has no vaccine denialism’: Dr. Drew Pinsky	(NewsNation) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is fully vaccinated, so is his family, and he is not a vaccine denier, according to Dr. Drew Pinsky. 'He wants vaccines subjected to the same scientific rigor as all the other medication … that are allowed by the FDA to bring to market,' Pinsky said Thursday on NewsNation’s 'On Balance.' 'There may be real significant problems with these vaccines. At least we should be able to ask the question,' he added. RFK Jr. wants to battle processed foods Pinsky says that in numerous conversations with President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, he learned of Kennedy’s plans to hold the scientific community accountable on several levels. '’I know how to dig into corrupt organizations,’' Pinsky quoted Kennedy. 'He said, ‘The first thing I’m going to do is I’m going to bring in the major (medical) journal editors and publishers, and I’m going to threaten them with a RICO action if they don’t disclose everything about their relationships with big pharma and straighten that out.’' Pinsky also said Kennedy will have success in his 'Make America Healthy Again' effort. Presidential appointments: How do they work? 'It is increasingly clear that at least part of the problem is the way we eat and the food we get,' said Pinsky, who blames the same system that gave us decades of denial about the addictive properties of tobacco. 'The very same lobbyists, scientists and marketing professionals moved over tobacco to food. So, no surprise (that) yummy, addictive food, heavy lobbying, and we have unhealthy populations.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-has-no-vaccine-denialism-dr-drew-pinsky/	2024-11-14T19:05:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/RFK-HHS_090624_AP_Evan-Vucci_f7cd5d.jpg?w=900
Trump’s criminal defense attorneys offered DOJ roles	President-elect Trump announced Thursday he will nominate three of his personal criminal defense attorneys to serve in senior Justice Department roles.Todd Blanche will serve as deputy attorney general, and Emil Bove will serve as principal associate deputy attorney general, the department's No. 3 official, Trump announced in a statement.Both men serve as Trump’s trial attorneys in his New York hush money case, which culminated in the first criminal conviction of a former president this spring, and Trump’s two federal criminal prosecutions brought by special counsel Jack Smith.Trump also announced Thursday he will nominate D. John Sauer, an appellate attorney who argued Trump’s presidential immunity case at the Supreme Court earlier this year, as solicitor general. That position is the fourth highest-ranking Justice Department role and decides which cases the government will appeal, including representing the administration before the nation’s highest court.The three attorneys will presumably serve under former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), whom Trump announced as his attorney general nominee one day prior, sending political shock waves through Washington.Unlike Gaetz, both Blanche and Bove previously worked as prosecutors in the Southern District of New York.Trump in his announcement highlighted that experience, making no mention of the duo’s work as his defense attorneys.'Todd is an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department, fixing what has been a broken System of Justice for far too long,' Trump said of Blanche.The president-elect similarly wrote of Bove, 'Emil is a tough and strong attorney, who will be a crucial part of the Justice Department, rooting out corruption and crime.'Both entered private practice before ultimately joining Trump’s criminal defense team last year.Blanche started representing the former president when he was indicted in New York on 34 counts of falsifying business records in April 2023, his first set of criminal charges. To do so, Blanche was forced to leave his partnership at a prominent law firm, and he created his own firm instead.Bove began working for Blanche’s new firm later in the year as Smith moved to indict Trump in Washington, D.C., on accusations of conspiring to subvert the 2020 election results and in Florida on charges of mishandling classified documents.Sauer, Trump’s solicitor general nominee, served as Missouri’s solicitor general for six years. He worked under Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) during their stints as state attorney general. Sauer also clerked for Antonin Scalia, the late conservative Supreme Court justice. In announcing Sauer, Trump did highlight the attorney’s work on his criminal defense: 'Most recently, John was the lead counsel representing me in the Supreme Court in Trump v. United States, winning a Historic Victory on Presidential Immunity, which was key to defeating the unConstitutional campaign of Lawfare against me and the entire MAGA Movement,' Trump wrote.Sauer also represents Trump in his appeal of a jury’s verdict in a civil suit finding the former president liable for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s.

Trump tests GOP with controversial Cabinet picks	President-elect Trump is quickly testing the will of Senate Republicans, asking them to back controversial picks to his Cabinet such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), while at the same time demanding they give him more power by easing recess appointments. His dual calls essentially demand loyalty from GOP senators to not only back his most divisive appointments, but to give up their power in general over the vetting process. And he's doing it at a moment where his own political power is at a high point. 'There are going to be a few tests in there,' said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), who is leaving the Senate to become the Indiana governor in January. 'I think that, in general, the slate of nominees has been sending that message that we’re going to shake the system up.' Republicans could be forgiven for feeling a bit of whiplash, particularly as Trump has offered a series of nominations with one more controversial than the next. On Tuesday evening, he said he would nominate Fox News host Pete Hegseth to lead the Pentagon, a choice few saw coming given his relative lack of experience. The next day, Trump formally announced his pick of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to be secretary of State, a much less controversial pick that might have left some GOP senators breathing a sigh of relief. Before they could complete those sighs, Trump tapped former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who has raised eyebrows in the past for remarks that seemed to echo Russian state media reports, to lead the office of the director of national intelligence. Minutes later, he outdid himself, announcing that he’d nominate Gaetz, who had been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other issues, to be attorney general. The Florida congressman, who was instrumental in getting former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) tossed from his position, is controversial with members of both parties. Not to be outdone, Trump on Thursday picked antivaccine skeptic Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. This was also a surprise, as many observers thought that RFK Jr. would get a position in the Trump administration that did not require Senate confirmation. The choices are rankling segments of Senate Republicans to varying degrees. However, they are also a sign that Trump is hellbent on delivering on what he sees as a mandate from voters — and some members acknowledge that he is following through on that promise. 'The president campaigned on being a disruptor. We’re not going to do things the way they’ve been done, and I think what happened in [2017] with some of his nominees is I think he found himself in a position where he had to make decisions more quickly, he didn’t have time to think about it,' said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of GOP leadership. 'Now, I think he’s making some quick decisions, but he knows what he wants from these people.' 'If you’re asking me if I think it’s a power play, I don’t think so,' she continued. 'I think it’s following through with what he said he’s going to do.' Heaping pressure on these tests of will among Senate Republicans is Trump’s out-of-the-blue call for the ability to ram through nominees via recess appointments, which caught them off guard on Sunday. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) signaled he was open to the idea but did not fully commit to it, even though he has loudly backed a swift and expeditious confirmation process for the president-elect’s Cabinet choices. But a number of Republicans are also pouring cold water on that idea. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), an ardent Trump backer, told reporters that senators should be especially wary of the idea of a nominee without the support of 51 senators, as opposed to being subject to an effort to bring confirmations to a crawl by Democrats. Senators are also generally displeased by the idea of going around the advise and consent role for nominations — a major role that members take pride in, especially as legislative fights on bills that are not must-pass items become few and far between. But some lawmakers still see merit in what Trump’s attempting, especially on that Cabinet appointment side. 'Donald Trump is the world’s greatest trial balloon flier,' Cramer said, pointing to Trump’s first presidency when he allowed Cabinet members to disagree with one another in public. 'That always kind of baffled people. I’ve always kind of loved it because he was testing, and [the nominations] may be something like that.' 'For the most part, I think Donald Trump is serious as a heart attack about all of these people,' he added. 'He wants disruptors. He’s said that. He ran as a disruptor. He was elected as a disruptor.' But among the major questions remains how Thune will handle some of these nominations, especially if they follow in the manner Gaetz’s has in little more than 24 hours, as multiple Republicans have effectively already deemed his choice dead on arrival. Although Thune has promised a speedy push to confirm Trump's Cabinet nominees, his inaugural test as leader may already have him between a rock and a hard place as he looks to placate not only his members, but the incoming president, who helped deliver major wins for the party. 'Anytime you’re a leader … there’s going to be a learning experience for it but he’s going to handle it,' said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). 'He does a good job and he speaks it well. 'He’s going to have to work his way through this threading the needle, so to speak,' he said. 'We all know that.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tests-gop-with-controversial-cabinet-picks/	2024-11-14T16:37:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24298067176719-e1731365319908.jpg?w=900
Pressure mounts on Ethics Committee to release Gaetz report	Pressure is building on the House Ethics Committee to release its findings on former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who President-elect Trump said he will nominate to be attorney general. Such a move would be highly unusual, since the committee has no jurisdiction to investigate a former lawmaker, and does not typically release information on investigations after members depart the House. But with Gaetz nominated to be the country’s attorney general, Democrats and some Republicans want to see what the committee found. 'I think there should not be any limitation on the House Judiciary Committee’s investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,' Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that would assess Gaetz’s nomination, told reporters on Wednesday. Cornyn added that he 'absolutely' wanted to see the Ethics panel’s findings. Gaetz’s abrupt resignation from the House on Wednesday came as the release of the Ethics Committee’s report was imminent, a source familiar with the matter told The Hill. The panel was scheduled to meet on Friday to vote on whether or not to release the report about Gaetz, the source said, as first reported by Punchbowl News. While such a move is very rare, there is precedent for the committee releasing a report after a member resigned. In 1987, the committee released its report on former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House. Some senators are expecting that the upper chamber will get the report. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said that the report will 'clearly become part of the record, even if it’s a secure record,' as the Senate Judiciary Committee considers the Gaetz nomination. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in a statement on Thursday called on the House Ethics panel to preserve and share its findings on Gaetz. 'The sequence and timing of Mr. Gaetz’s resignation from the House raises serious questions about the contents of the House Ethics Committee report. We cannot allow this valuable information from a bipartisan investigation to be hidden from the American people,' Durbin said in the statement. The committee has already broken from its normal posture once in the 118th Congress, when it released a report on former Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) even though federal charges against him were unresolved. The Ethics Committee typically waits to take action until any ongoing legal proceedings have concluded, deferring to the Department of Justice. Santos later pleaded guilty to fraud charges. The committee is comprised of five Republicans and five Democrats, and makes most of its decisions on simple majority votes. If Republicans on the panel do want to release the report on Gaetz, they must weigh their distaste for Gaetz against the risk of Trump’s wrath. The committee was investigating whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. The congressional probe into Gaetz was opened in 2021, shortly after news reports emerged that the Department of Justice (DOJ) was reportedly investigating whether he had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl. Gaetz has vigorously denied allegations of wrongdoing, and the DOJ declined to charge him with a crime. In September, Gaetz said he would 'no longer voluntarily participate' in the 'nosy' Ethics probe and would not comply with its subpoena, accusing the panel of asking him for a list of adult women with whom he’d had sex over the last seven years. John Clune, a lawyer reportedly representing the 17-year-old victim at the center of the most serious allegations, also called on the Ethics Committee to release its findings. 'Mr. Gaetz's likely nomination as Attorney General is a perverse development in a truly dark series of events. We would support the House Ethics Committee immediately releasing their report. She was a high school student and there were witnesses,' Clune said in a post on the social platform X. Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.) said the general opinion among GOP members is that Gaetz resigned in order to try to block the report from coming out. 'It’s very suspicious that he all of a sudden resigned because other members who are being nominated for posts have not resigned,' Murphy said. 'I do know that if he continues to persist with this appointment, it will all come out.' Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), when announcing Gaetz’s resignation on Wednesday evening, said that Gaetz resigned in order to kick-start the process of replacing him, to lessen the impact of a slim House GOP majority. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) has also been selected to be national security adviser, and Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) was tapped to be U.N. ambassador. Some of Gaetz’s former GOP House colleagues, though, think the report should come out, or at least be shared with the Senate. 'Senators have an important decision to make, and I think they should have all the information necessary to make the right decisions,' said Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), adding if there is nothing that says the Ethics Committee can’t release the report, 'it would be a good thing for them to know the facts.' 'If he’s gonna continue through that process [of becoming attorney general], I think the Ethics report needs to come out,' Rep. John Duarte (R-Calif.) said. 'I just don’t want an attorney general who’s compromised with that kind of a report hanging out there that could be used to compromise him.' But the idea of the Ethics Committee releasing findings on a nonmember is getting some pushback in the House, where members could be personally affected by that kind of precedent. House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) said the Ethics Committee should not release its findings. 'He’s no longer a member. It’s moot to me,' Rogers said. Asked if he think Gaetz is qualified to be attorney general, he said: 'It's the president's decision.' House Ethics Committee Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.) declined to comment on any potential Ethics Committee meetings, or to comment further on the Gaetz situation. 'With the confidentiality that surrounds the committee, I can't publicly address any potential meeting dates the committee might be taking up,' Guest told The Hill. 'I can’t give you any information of any significance.' House GOP leaders are staying out of the debate. 'I don't know if there is a report that's coming out. Obviously, there are reports about it, but the Ethics Committee doesn't share that information with the rest of the membership,' House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) told The Hill.

Former primary challenger to Gaetz considering bid for now-open s...	Aaron Dimmock, who unsuccessfully challenged former Rep. Matt Gaetz in this year’s Republican primary for Florida’s 1st Congressional District, is considering a run for the seat again now that President-elect Trump’s shock pick for attorney general has resigned. 'I am taking a serious look at it and have already received numerous calls from constituents imploring me to run,' Dimmock told The Hill. Dimmock, a retired naval officer and leadership consultant, was boosted in his challenge to Gaetz by a PAC with reported ties to former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Gaetz led the charge to oust McCarthy from the Speakership. But Gaetz, who had ample support from his hard-line conservative allies in Congress, handily defeated Dimmock with 72.6 percent support to 27.4 percent. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) announced Wednesday that Gaetz had resigned in order to kick-start the process of filling the seat to lessen the complications of a razor-thin majority. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said on the social platform X on Thursday that he instructed the secretary of state to 'immediately' start the process of formulating a schedule for the special election. But Gaetz’s resignation has also put focus on a House Ethics Committee probe that has stretched for years. The Ethics panel has no jurisdiction to investigate a former member, but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling for it to release its findings on Gaetz. The committee was probing whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. The congressional probe into Gaetz was opened in 2021, shortly after news reports emerged that the Department of Justice (DOJ) was reportedly investigating whether he had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl. Gaetz has vigorously denied allegations of wrongdoing, and the DOJ declined to charge him with a crime. In September, Gaetz said he would 'no longer voluntarily participate' in the probe. The ethics probe was an issue in the August primary, as well. The PAC with connections to McCarthy allies spent more $3 million in the race — including on brutal ads that highlight the misconduct allegations against Gaetz. 'Your daughters are never safe with the real Matt Gaetz,' a narrator says in one ad from the Florida Patriots PAC, referencing the allegations against him. In an interview with The Hill in August, Dimmock said that voters in Florida 'are embarrassed by our incumbents. They can’t understand the chaos that he caused to the Republican Party over the last several years.' Gaetz, meanwhile, attacked Dimmock for working for the state of Missouri and called him a 'BLM supporting DEI instructor.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/former-primary-challenger-to-gaetz-considering-bid-for-now-open-seat/	2024-11-14T16:36:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Gaetz-Dimmock-AP.jpg?w=900
3 House races still too close to call: Decision Desk HQ	(NewsNation) — Decision Desk HQ is watching two House races in California and the single House seat that represents Alaska. As of Thursday afternoon, Republican incumbent Michelle Steel leads Democratic challenger Derek Tran by just 349 votes out of more than 300,000 votes cast in California’s 45th Congressional District, which is in Orange County. 'We still think there are tens of thousands of votes to be counted,' said Scott Tranter of Decision Desk HQ. He expects a lot of those votes to be counted Thursday night, but it still could be a couple of days before DDHQ can call that race. Dave McCormick projected to win Pennsylvania US Senate seat In Central California, Republican incumbent John Duarte holds a two-point lead over Democrat Adam Gray in the 13th District. Tranter expects to make a call on that race in a day or so. Alaska is a very different story, according to Tranter. 'This is ranked-choice voting. They count it a little differently. So, we get to do some very fancy math and wait for the state of Alaska to tell us exactly where this is going to shake out,' he said. As of Thursday, Republican challenger Nick Begich has a three-point lead over Democratic incumbent Mary Peltola. Two other candidates account for about 5% of the vote in the race for Alaska’s single congressional district.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/three-house-races-not-called/	2024-11-14T16:21:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/tranter.png?w=449
House Republicans probe allegations of FEMA discrimination in Flo...	(The Hill) — House Republicans are probing allegations of discrimination by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in Florida following the termination of an agency employee who advised a survivor assistance team to skip homes with President-elect Trump campaign signs. The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is calling on FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to brief the panel by Dec. 2 about the incident, what the agency is doing to help unaided families and what policies are being implemented to 'prevent future political discrimination.' ‘Carolina Blue’ song raises money for Helene victims in North Carolina The committee also asked FEMA to provide documents and information about the agency’s effort to reach and aid homes that were skipped because of the incident, along with other communications. 'As the FEMA Administrator, you are responsible for leading the Nation’s efforts to prepare for, protect against, and respond to natural disasters. The Committee is troubled that under your leadership FEMA failed to aid all Americans, regardless of party affiliation,' Republican House lawmakers said in a letter that was shared with The Hill. FEMA confirmed last week that it terminated an employee, Marni Washington, for telling workers canvassing in Lake Placid, Fla., in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton to 'avoid homes advertising Trump.' More than 20 homes were bypassed. 'This is a clear violation of FEMA’s core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation. This was reprehensible,' Criswell said last week regarding the employee’s termination. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) shortly after said that state officials were kicking off a probe into the incident. Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the chair of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, said Saturday that he sent a letter to Criswell demanding that she testify in front of the committee regarding FEMA’s response to hurricanes Helene and Milton and the recent incident regarding the terminated employee. 'Your inability to ensure that FEMA provide relief to all Americans affected by disasters, free of discrimination, represents a substantial failure of leadership,' GOP House lawmakers said in the letter. All 35 Republican members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee signed on to it. Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., is the chair of the committee. 'The blatant disregard of President-elect Trump supporters directly contradicts FEMA’s core mission and values,' Graves said in a press release. Close Thank you for signing up!

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Florida’s attorney general, Ashley Moody (R), sued the FEMA chief on Wednesday, saying that she 'agreed' to deny aid to Trump supporters in Florida alongside Washington. 'While the facts will continue to come out over the weeks and months, it is already clear that Defendant Washington conspired with senior FEMA officials, as well as those carrying out her orders, to violate the civil rights of Florida citizens,' the complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Pierce, Fla., said. Washington said in a Monday interview with journalist Roland S. Martin that the federal agency was scapegoating her and that homes were skipped because of 'verbal abuse' by those Trump supporters. 'They all alleged that these actions were made on my own recognizance and that it was from my own political advances. However, if you look at the record, there is what we call a community trend,' Washington said. 'And unfortunately, it just so happened that the political hostility that was encountered by my team — and I was on two different teams during this deployment — they just so happened to have the Trump campaign signage.' The committee said it is 'continuing its oversight of FEMA’s ability to adequately respond to natural disasters.' 'It is clear that, under the Biden-Harris Administration, FEMA has been ill-prepared to provide assistance and relief to many Americans in need,' the GOP lawmakers said in the letter.

Trump rewards legal defense team, picks lawyer Todd Blanche as No...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Todd Blanche, an attorney who led the legal team that defended the Republican at his hush money criminal trial, to serve as the second-highest ranking Justice Department official. A former federal prosecutor, Blanche has been a key figure on Trump's defense team both in the New York case that ended in a conviction in May, and the federal cases brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith. 'Todd is an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department, fixing what has been a broken System of Justice for far too long,' Trump said in a statement Thursday announcing his pick. If confirmed as deputy attorney general by the Republican-led Senate, Blanche would manage the day-to-day operations of the sprawling Justice Department, which Trump has vowed to radically overhaul. The announcement comes a day after the president-elect said he had chosen as attorney general Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, a Trump loyalist who once faced a Justice Department sex trafficking investigation that ended in no charges. Trump is appointing two other members of his defense team to high-ranking Justice Department positions. Emil Bove, an ex-federal prosecutor, will be the principal associate deputy attorney general and will serve as acting deputy attorney general until Blanche is confirmed, Trump said. Trump tabbed D. John Sauer, who successfully argued his presidential immunity case before the U.S. Supreme Court, to be the solicitor general, representing his administration before the high court. Sauer, who was previously Missouri’s solicitor general, was a Rhodes scholar and served as a Supreme Court clerk for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Blanche represented Trump in both the 2020 election interference case in Washington and the Florida case accusing the former president of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. In both cases, the defense team successfully mounted a legal strategy focused heavily on delaying the cases until after the election. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon last summer threw out the classified documents case, finding that Smith’s appointment by Attorney General Merrick Garland was illegal. The 2020 election case was stalled amid wrangling over Trump's claims of immunity from prosecution that went up to the Supreme Court. The Justice Department is now evaluating how to wind down the two prosecutions to comply with longstanding department policy that says sitting presidents cannot be indicted or prosecuted while in office. Blanche has also represented Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and succeeded in getting a mortgage fraud case against him dismissed in the same New York court where Trump was convicted. Blanche argued that case, brought by the Manhattan district attorney's office, was too similar to one that landed Manafort in federal prison and therefore amounted to double jeopardy. Blanche joined Trump’s defense team just prior to his April 2023 arraignment in the New York case. Trump was accused in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex. Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts, though his attorneys are urging the judge to overturn the guilty verdict. Blanche left the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft LLP, where he was a partner in the White Collar Defense and Investigations practice, to form his own practice. Blanche told colleagues at Cadwalader that he was resigning to represent Trump. He'd joined the firm in September 2017. In an email announcing his departure, he wrote: 'I have been asked to represent Trump in the recently charged DA case, and after much thought/consideration, I have decided it is the best thing for me to do and an opportunity I should not pass up.' Originally from the Denver suburbs, Blanche graduated from American University in Washington, D.C., and Brooklyn Law School. Blanche first joined the Justice Department as a paralegal in the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, while in law school. He was later a law clerk for federal judges and then a prosecutor in the same U.S. attorney’s office, which covers Manhattan, the Bronx, and northern suburbs, for about eight years and spent two years as co-chief of the office’s violent crimes unit. Bove, a star lacrosse player in college, joined Blanche’s law firm last year and handled many key arguments in Trump’s legal cases, including pending efforts to get the hush money conviction thrown out in light of his election victory. As a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, Bove was involved in multiple high-profile prosecutions, including a drug-trafficking case against the former Honduran president’s brother, a man who set off a pressure cooker device in Manhattan and a man who sent dozens of mail bombs to prominent targets across the country. ___ Sisak reported from New York.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-trump-rewards-legal-defense-team-picks-lawyer-todd-blanche-as-no-2-justice-official/	2024-11-14T15:41:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/67368aaedabd99.66971773.jpeg?w=900
Texas authorities on high alert for pre-Trump immigration ‘surge’	(NewsNation) — The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) is preparing for surges at the southern border as people try to enter the U.S. before Donald Trump returns to the White House. 'We still want to maintain a proactive posture. We don’t want to be reactive,' said Lieutenant Chris Olivarez of the Texas DPS. 'We want to be ready for anything, for any possible surge.' To that end, Texas DPS officers have been conducting 'mass migration response' exercises along the border. Among the strategies is stationing DPS officers in their vehicles, with flashing red and blue lights, every few hundred feet along the border. Agents rescue 4-year-old girl, baby from smugglers near border DPS said that strategy is in place in the Rio Grande Valley, Del Rio and El Paso Border Patrol sectors. Officers have also placed loudspeakers along the border that play back a short, pointed message that can be heard across the Rio Grande in Mexico. 'Atención, atención. Es ilegal cruzar aquí. Hay una cerca aquí. Este no es un puerto de entrada,' the message says in Spanish, translated as, 'Attention, attention. It is illegal to cross here. There is fencing here. This is not a port of entry.' While the Texas DPS and the U.S. Border Patrol prepare for a possible surge ahead of President Trump’s January 20 inauguration, it’s possible the surge might not happen thanks to Biden administration policies that have significantly slowed illegal crossings. 'We’ve seen a significant decrease in illegal border crossings, especially in Texas, where numbers are down nearly 86%,' said Olivarez. Homan outlines enforcement priorities as Trump’s ‘border czar’ The Biden policies include denying the right to asylum to anyone who arrives at the border away from an official port of entry and without an asylum appointment with Customs and Border Protection. But while individuals may think twice about illegally entering the U.S., the cartels are working harder than ever to smuggle people across. Two recent examples of the cartels’ desperation were the discovery of someone hiding inside the gas tank of a semi-tractor and people 'welded' into the body of a pickup truck. Border Patrol agents had to pry the sides of the truck to reveal people inside the body.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/texas-pre-trump-immigration-surge/	2024-11-14T15:30:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Horse-patrol-wall-arrest-101024.jpg?w=900
Trump taps ex-SEC chair to serve as US attorney for Southern Dist...	President-elect Trump announced Thursday that Jay Clayton, former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), will serve as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. The role is considered by legal experts to be one of the most powerful positions in the Justice Department. 'Jay is a highly respected business leader, counsel, and public servant,' Trump wrote on Truth Social, listing off Clayton's educational and professional accolades. 'Jay is going to be a strong Fighter for the Truth as we, Make America Great Again,' he said. A registered independent, Clayton began leading the SEC in May 2017, following his nomination to the post in January when Trump first took office. He was a partner at the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in New York, specializing in major corporate mergers and acquisitions, before his time at the SEC and returned to the firm in 2021. His SEC tenure focused largely on forging bipartisan compromises around financial market structure updates, establishing the commission's approach to cryptocurrency-related investment offerings and cementing rules for investment advisers. The former SEC chair was previously nominated to serve as the top prosecutor in the federal district covering Manhattan, after Trump fired then-U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in 2020 for refusing to step aside. But he faced stark opposition from Democrats, who portrayed the selection as an attempt by Trump to politicize the Justice Department, since that office had investigated his ex-fixer, Michael Cohen, and Rudy Giuliani, his then-personal attorney. 'Forty seven years ago, Elliott Richardson had the courage to say no to a gross abuse of presidential power. Jay Clayton has a similar choice today: He can allow himself to be used in the brazen Trump-Barr scheme to interfere in investigations by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, or he can stand up to this corruption, withdraw his name from consideration, and save his own reputation from overnight ruin,' then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement at the time. The scandal effectively snuffed out his chance at confirmation. Clayton announced soon after the 2020 election that he would step down from the SEC at the end of the year and was succeeded by Gary Gensler, President Biden's appointment to the role. The Southern District of New York at one point also investigated Trump himself but did not bring charges over hush money payments that would later underpin his future conviction in New York state court.

Proud Boys leader convicted of sedition intends to ask Trump for ...	A leader of the Proud Boys convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack intends to seek a pardon from President-elect Trump. Joe Biggs, a Florida Proud Boy and onetime correspondent for the far-right website 'InfoWars,' is serving a 17-year prison term after a jury last year found him guilty of sedition and other serious felonies. His lawyer, Norm Pattis, has written a letter requesting clemency from the former and future president but said it has not yet been sent. 'Congratulations on your re-election to the Presidency. You are now in a position to close a painful chapter in American history involving the prosecution and imprisonment of protesters at the Capitol on January 6, 2021,' Pattis wrote in the letter. 'On behalf of Joseph Biggs, I am urging you to do so by granting Mr. Biggs' request for a complete pardon for his actions on that day.' Biggs joins the ranks of other Jan. 6 rioters who have signaled they plan to seek pardons, including former Proud Boys national Chair Enrique Tarrio and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes. Both Tarrio and Rhodes were convicted of sedition and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to 'rapidly review' the cases of Jan. 6 defendants and 'sign their pardons on Day 1' if reelected. It remains to be seen whether he will pardon or commute the sentences of all 1,500-plus rioters charged for participating in the mob, some of them or none of them at all. In the letter, Pattis described Trump as 'no stranger to prosecutions warped by partisan vendetta' and claimed that Biggs is a victim of the same misuse of the law. He pointed to the Civil War, suggesting that wiping Biggs’s slate clean would 'close the book' on Jan. 6 and allow the nation to move forward, as it did when clemency was granted to thousands of Confederate supporters. 'These are divisive times,' Pattis wrote. 'The divisions were acute in 2020, when millions believed the election was stolen and turned out to make sure electoral integrity was preserved. Suspicions and bitterness about the election lingers to this day. 'A pardon of Mr. Biggs will help close that wound and inspires confidence in the future,' he said. Prosecutors said at trial that Biggs led members of the Proud Boys to the Capitol on Jan. 6 and spoke with the first rioter to breach police barricades just minutes before he acted. They requested a sentence of 33 years in prison. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who oversaw the Proud Boys sedition case, declined to hand down that lengthy of a sentence but did apply a terrorism enhancement to Biggs’s sentencing guidelines. Pattis represented Biggs at trial and has remained his attorney on appeal. He said in the letter that his office also intends to request pardons or amnesty for two of Biggs's co-defendants in that case, Proud Boys members Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/proud-boys-leader-convicted-of-sedition-intends-to-ask-trump-for-pardon/	2024-11-14T14:54:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/ProudBoys_081719_AP_Noah-Berger.jpg?w=900
What did Pete Hegseth say about women in combat roles?	(NewsNation) — Comments on women in the military made by President-elect Donald Trump's choice to head the Department of Defense, Pete Hegseth, have garnered criticism. 'I’m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles,' Hegseth said during an appearance on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' last week. 'It hasn’t made us more effective, it hasn’t made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.' While Hegseth said he’s served with women, and they’ve been 'great,' institutions shouldn’t have to 'incentivize' that in positions where 'men are more capable.' Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? While Hegseth cited a 2015 U.S. Marines Corps report that stated all-male units were faster and more lethal than mixed-gender units, critics said it was biased. Newsweek notes that the lobby group Women in International Security called its research methods 'fundamentally flawed.' After it came out, then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said he had problems with the study: namely, that 'it started out with a fairly large component of the men thinking this is not a good idea.' 'When you start out with that mindset, you're almost presupposing the outcome,' Mabus said. The 44-year-old current co-host of Fox News Channel’s 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend' served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and did tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois took Hegseth to task over his remarks on women in combat roles. 'We can't go to war today without our women military members,' Duckworth said. Duckworth is an Iraq war veteran and Purple Heart recipient who was one of the first women to fly combat missions as a U.S. Army helicopter pilot. When her helicopter was hit by a grenade in 2004, she lost both legs and some mobility in her right arm, NewsNation partner The Hill reports. If she could talk to Hegseth, 'I would ask him, 'Where do you think I lost my legs, in a bar fight?'' Duckworth said in an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday. Homan outlines enforcement priorities as Trump’s ‘border czar’ Women in the military Overall, the number of service numbers dropped 2.7% in 2022, though the percentage of women in the military inched upward, according to a Department of Defense report from 2023. Women, the Defense Department says, make up about 17.5% of the active-duty force. The number of uniformed women serving in special operations, including those in operator and support roles ― has increased significantly in recent years. The overall proportion of women in special operations forces went up from 7.9% in 2016 to 12% in 2023. More than 2 million of the veterans currently living in the United States are women. They are the fastest growing group of veterans as well — by 2040, women are projected to make up 18% of all veterans, the Department of Veterans Affairs said. NewsNation's The Hill and The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/pete-hegseth-women-combat-roles/	2024-11-14T14:14:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1127594195.jpg?w=900
Rudy Giuliani’s lawyers quit over ‘fundamental disagreement’	(The Hill) -- Rudy Giuliani’s attorneys on Wednesday asked to quit representing the former New York City mayor as he battles with two Georgia election workers over their efforts to collect a $146 million defamation judgment. Attorneys Kenneth Caruso and David Labkowski cited New York’s rules that allow attorneys to withdraw when they have a 'fundamental disagreement' with their client. A guide to key figures in Donald Trump’s orbit They also cited provisions allowing withdrawal when a client insists upon presenting a claim that can’t be supported in good faith and when a client 'fails to cooperate in the representation.' The attorneys had asked to seal their written requests entirely. U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman declined to do so but did agree to redact certain details, saying it involved privileged information. Liman still must accept their ask to withdraw. The Hill has reached out to Giuliani’s spokesperson for comment. The twist comes as Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, whom Giuliani defamed by spreading a baseless conspiracy that they were involved in mass election fraud in 2020, appear on the cusp of collecting their massive jury award after months of litigation. Liman had ordered Giuliani to turn over most of his assets — including his New York City apartment, Mercedes-Benz, luxury watches and signed Yankees memorabilia — to the mother-daughter duo, but their attorneys have repeatedly accused the former mayor of stonewalling the efforts. Giuliani was ordered to hand over his car by Nov. 11 after he was spotted driving it to a Florida polling place on Election Day. Rudy Giuliani bankruptcy shows Trump ally drowning in debt Though the election workers won a $146 million judgment, they are expected to collect far less. Giuliani, in previous court filings, estimated his assets amounted to roughly $10 million. The judge has yet to resolve whether the former mayor must hand over his Florida condo, or whether he can exempt it by declaring it his homestead. If that is denied, Giuliani has alternatively asked to keep his New York apartment. 'Wilkie Farr Law Firm is filled with a distorted left wing hate and vitriol,' Giuliani wrote Tuesday on X, referring to the election workers’ attorneys. 'Judge Liman doesn't seem to know the exemptions. They have seized all my money which wasn't much. I need legal representation against these evil people. I can't buy food.' Defiant Giuliani says he’s a victim of ‘political persecution’ On Wednesday, the election workers made a new ask to gain access to a storage facility Giuliani uses in New York, raising 'serious concerns' about property he purportedly moved out of the apartment. One of the election workers’ attorneys, John Langford, last week also asked to withdraw from the case, saying he was changing jobs.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/rudy-giuliani-lawyers-quit/	2024-11-14T13:57:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP23349813711702-e1731589557475.jpg?w=800
Musk's bold plans for 'Department of Government Efficiency' face ...	Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are set to take the reins of the brand new 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) under President-elect Trump — a panel with bold ambitions of slashing government costs and restructuring federal agencies. However, it is likely to face numerous roadblocks in its efforts to effect change in the next administration given its seemingly advisory role, experts said. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'There's the executive branch that might be in their way. The Congress might be in their way. The Constitution is a bit of an obstacle,' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of American Action Forum. 'Other than that, clear sailing,' he told The Hill. Trump announced Tuesday evening that the pair of tech entrepreneurs would jointly lead the panel, which will 'provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.' It will partner with the White House and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to 'drive large scale structural reform,' with its work set to conclude by July 4, 2026, Trump said in a statement. 'It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time. Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of ‘DOGE’ for a very long time,' the president-elect said. The panel created an official government account Wednesday on the social platform X — which is owned by Musk — writing, 'Working overtime to ensure your tax dollars will be spent wisely!' Examples of government waste, inefficiency as Trump announces DOGE Musk and Trump previously discussed the prospect of a cost-cutting panel during the campaign, as the tech titan threw his support behind the Republican candidate with multimillion-dollar contributions to his own pro-Trump super PAC and amplifications of Trump’s message on X. While DOGE is now set to become a reality, experts are skeptical about what it will actually be able to accomplish. 'It sounds to me like an outside commission that will give OMB recommendations on what they think should be done to improve government efficiency, and as such its powers are entirely advisory,' Holtz-Eakin said. 'They don't have any authority to do anything other than say, ‘We think this will be good,’' he said. 'Evidently, Mr. Musk has a lot of free time, and if he wants to waste it, that's fine.' Government commissions such as DOGE typically have a large staff and budget and produce a formal report with recommendations for Congress, explained Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution. What is Elon Musk’s plan for DOGE? 'But since this was not created by Congress, we don't know what its authority is and what status it has,' West said. 'I mean, any American can make suggestions on ways to cut the government budget, but the question — is anybody going to pay serious attention to this?' Any major budget cuts would have to be approved by Congress, he noted. While Republicans have secured control of both chambers, they are likely to have a narrow majority in the House and lack a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. 'It's not clear that any draconian measure is going to see the light of day,' West said. However, Musk’s close relationship with Trump is notable. The billionaire spent election night with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago, watching the results roll in, and Trump thanked the Tesla and SpaceX CEO in his victory speech, calling him a 'star.' In the days since the election, Musk has reportedly remained at Mar-a-Lago with the president-elect, sitting in on meetings and phone calls, including with world leaders, according to The New York Times. Trump aide Corey Lewandowski reacts to Elon Musk’s DOGE logo Musk also joined Trump at a Wednesday meeting with House Republicans on Capitol Hill, where the president-elect joked, 'Elon won’t go home. I can’t get rid of him. Until I don’t like him.' Trump met with Biden later that day, marking his first visit to the Oval Office since leaving the presidency in 2021. 'Musk has the ear of the president, so people have to take it seriously just for that reason,' West told The Hill. Republicans will also have two shots at passing major legislation through budget reconciliation, which could give Trump and the GOP several chances to enact sweeping changes without having to clear a Senate filibuster. Musk had said much of DOGE's focus will be on what the panel considers egregious misuses of federal spending. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know!' Musk posted Tuesday night. 'We will also have a leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars. This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining,' Musk continued. Shortly after the idea was floated earlier this year, ethics experts and former government officials raised concerns that Musk holding dual roles in his tech companies and the Trump administration could be a conflict of interest. Tesla and SpaceX have contracts worth billions of dollars with the same federal agencies he is likely to work with in his advisory role. This could risk the panel’s objectivity and fairness, some experts argued. Even the panel's name, DOGE, is a nod to a cryptocurrency often touted by Musk: Dogecoin, which riffs off a mid-2010's meme featuring a Shiba Inu. Dogecoin's value was up more than 90 percent over the past week as of Wednesday afternoon. 'Handing the keys of government to those looking to profit from our government is extremely dangerous and a massive conflict of interest,' Zach Moller, economic program director at Third Way, a center-left think tank, said in a statement. 'The idea of a Musk-run government efficiency commission is a farce and will lead to more waste, fraud, and rampant abuse of political power.' 'Americans would be right to suspect that Musk would use his newfound government powers to throw a lifeline to his teetering companies,' he added. Experts further pointed to Musk’s controversies and legal challenges at his other companies and how this could be a hint of his leadership style. 'Musk not only knows nothing about government efficiency and regulation, his own businesses have regularly run afoul of the very rules he will be in position to attack in his new 'czar' position,' Lisa Gilbert, the co-president of progressive consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen, wrote Wednesday. Musk has faced a number of legal challenges over his companies' conduct, including their hiring and termination practices, pay structure and product performance. While calling Musk a 'brilliant entrepreneur and a tech visionary,' Moller said the billionaire’s companies are 'deeply troubled and mismanaged.' Musk has not fully laid out whether his roles in his other companies will change with the new position, though he reposted one user who said Tesla investors should be 'reassured' by the group’s position outside of government and that it is limited to 21 months. 'Typically, with a government-created commission, members have to respect conflict of interest rules, and it's not clear how Musk is going to comply with that, or what the requirements would be, since this seems to be an ad hoc operation,' West noted. 'It allows him to avoid ethics rules, but it doesn't put him in a strong position to change public policy,' he added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musks-doge-roadblocks/	2024-11-14T13:54:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24318569633728-e1731532012925.jpg?w=900
Schools, colleges brace for 'a much more threatening political en...	(The Hill) - Educators and university leaders are on the edge of their seats as President-elect Trump makes his return to office with an aggressive posture toward K-12 and higher education. Trump has threatened multiple times to take away funding from schools if they do not align with his views on subjects such as diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and transgender rights. Texas school choice plans could indicate what to expect under Trump That threat has left institutions holding their breath as they try to prepare with how to deal the hostility they could face for the next four years. Trump has threatened to 'tax endowments, impose budget reconciliation, and fine institutions 'up to the entire amount of their endowment' if they are perceived as having promoted 'wokeism,' [which] risks eroding academic freedom, institutional autonomy and the democratic purposes of higher education,' said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities. The federal government gives billions of dollars to colleges and universities every year, from grants to research funding to direct financial aid. K-12 institutions receive a majority of their funding from state and local governments, while 7.6 percent came from the federal government in the 2019-2020 school year. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at PPG Paints Arena, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, in Pittsburgh, Pa. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Congress controls the power of the purse, and next year's GOP-majority House and Senate could be amenable to Trump's goals. 'The first Trump administration failed in its repeated attempts to cut student aid and academic research, largely because they were disorganized and poorly educated in the workings of the federal government, but also because of resistance from Congress,' said John Aubrey Douglass, senior research fellow and research professor at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley. Who will be the next — and potentially last — secretary of Education? 'Trump and his allies are exploring various ways to withhold federal funding for individual colleges and universities that would be punitive. That could come from a much expanded concept of presidential authority and bills passed by Congress, like the Stop Woke Act already passed by the House,' Douglass added. At a campaign rally this cycle, Trump went after multiple elite universities he accused of stifling free speech on campus, saying he would 'take away their endowments, and they will pay us billions and billions of dollars for the terror they have unleashed into our once-great country.' The president-elect has also said he would tax the endowments of schools that spend money on racial equity, and a 'portion of the seized funds will then be used as restitution for victims of these illegal and unjust policies, policies that hurt our country so badly.' He said K-12 schools that teach 'critical race theory, gender ideology or other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children' would also see a cut in federal funding. What Trump’s administration could mean for education With a GOP trifecta in Washington, 'there will be a much more accommodating Congress, at least until the midterms,' Douglass said. 'Democrats can muster filibusters in the Senate, but fights over the budget and bills and procedures meant to accommodate Trump, along with the assumption of unprecedented executive authority, provide a much more threatening political environment for America’s colleges and universities.' And there are some ways to get around Congress when restricting federal money. Trump’s Department of Education is likely to change the definition of Title IX as it stands under President Biden and remove language regarding discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. If the department creates rules against allowing transgender students in certain locker rooms or sports teams and schools refuse to comply, one of the punishments for violating the rule could be a restriction in federal funds. 'I think you'll see an effort to define sex in Title IX as binary and biological,' said Bob Eitel, co-founder and president at the Defense of Freedom Institute, adding there could be efforts by the Trump administration 'to investigate those school districts and colleges and universities that' go against the mandate. And there are specific threats to research funding under the second Trump White House, too. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to Texas universities: Freeze tuition 'Although it is speculative, the 'unitary executive theory' offers a path for withholding or impounding federal funds for research in areas thought by the Trump administrators to be antithetical to their political agenda, like climate change. That would likely be a nationwide restriction that, along with threats to drastically reduce funding for infrastructure costs of doing federal research, would create a huge hole in the financial model for research universities.' Douglass said. The fluid situation leaves schools in a position of trying to figure out how to prepare without fully knowing what comes next. 'Institutional leaders are holding their breath but are also doubling down on seeking protections for DACA students, international students, and those most impacted by the removal of DEI offices and programs designed to ensure that campuses are places of welcome and belonging for all students — from first-generation students, LGBTQ students and students of color to veterans and students with disabilities,' said Pasquerella.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/schools-colleges-political-environment/	2024-11-14T13:51:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24310037862899-e1731443933262_4c0b6a-e1731583886104.jpg?w=900

Senate Judiciary Republican 'absolutely' wants to see Ethics repo...	Republican Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he 'absolutely' wants to see the House Ethics Committee’s report on former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) after his nomination for attorney general. 'I think that there should not be any limitations on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,' Cornyn told reporters Thursday. ABC’s Rachel Scott asked the senator if he wants to see the report created by the House Ethics Committee, which was investigating whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. 'Absolutely,' Cornyn responded. President-elect Trump's surprise announcement Wednesday left Capitol Hill reeling. Gaetz resigned from his position in Congress following the announcement. Since the announcement, calls to see the report have been growing. Although the committee’s investigation ended since Gaetz resigned from Congress, the panel could still vote to release its report. Before the announcement and Gaetz’s resignation, the committee was set to meet Friday to vote on whether to release its findings. Cornyn argued Thursday the Senate Judiciary Committee deserves to see the report. Trump’s pick of Gaetz sent shock waves through Washington, both for Republican and Democratic lawmakers. A source in the room where House Republicans were waiting to start leadership elections said there were audible gasps when the announcement was made, and a number of GOP senators expressed bewilderment. Some Republicans have said they will not support Gaetz's nomination, while Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) urged Republicans to 'give Matt a chance.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/senate-judiciary-republican-absolutely-wants-to-see-ethics-report-on-gaetz/	2024-11-14T12:30:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/cornynjohn_091624gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Dave McCormick projected to win Pennsylvania US Senate seat	(NewsNation) — NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ has called the race for the U.S. Senate seat for Pennsylvania in favor of Republican Dave McCormick. See all Pennsylvania race results here. He won over Democrat incumbent Sen. Bob Casey Jr. However, the Associated Press writes that the race is headed for a statewide recount, as counties continued Wednesday to sort through outstanding ballots and the campaigns jousted over which ones should count. Casey still hasn't conceded. During a brief exchange with reporters this week Casey said votes are still being counted 'and will be for days.' His campaign manager said in a statement Wednesday that 'McCormick and his allies are trying to disenfranchise Pennsylvania voters.' A lawyer representing Casey's campaign said Republicans were challenging the provisional ballots of registered Democrats, delaying the vote counting process. 'What we are seeing this year is more organized, more disciplined, more directed and more comprehensive than what we saw in 2020,' attorney Adam Bonin said. However, McCormick's campaign consultant said it was Democratic-controlled counties that were dragging out the process by not adding the results of processed ballots to vote totals. Casey sought a fourth term as the senior senator from Pennsylvania, making him the longest-serving Democratic U.S. senator in state history. Casey is the son of former Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey Sr. and won his most recent election in 2018 by 13 points. He announced he would seek another term after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2023 and underwent successful surgery. Before he was elected to the Senate, Casey, who is an attorney, served as Pennsylvania’s state treasurer and auditor general. Throughout his political career, Casey has focused on issues of public health care, children’s welfare and public infrastructure. He centered his 2024 reelection campaign around protecting LGBTQ and workers' rights, preventing the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, fighting fentanyl and securing the border, among other issues.

Meanwhile, McCormick made an unsuccessful bid for Pennsylvania’s other Senate seat in 2022, losing in the Republican primary by 950 votes to Dr. Mehmet Oz. In the general election, Oz was defeated by now-Sen. John Fetterman. McCormick is a former hedge fund executive and CEO of Bridgewater Associates who worked previously for the U.S. Treasury Department under President George W. Bush. He was endorsed in 2024 by Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump. McCormick is a West Point graduate and former U.S. Army captain who returned to his alma mater, where he taught economics. He also holds a doctorate from Princeton University. During his campaign, McCormick pushed to align Casey with Vice President Kamala Harris’ political stances on issues such as immigration, energy and the economy. The Republican candidate built his 2024 Senate bid on issues that largely mirror the GOP’s platform — advocating for tighter border security measures, ending drug and human trafficking, 'restoring America’s military might,' growing Pennsylvania’s energy sector with an 'all of the above' energy strategy, among other issues. Pennsylvania has remained a battleground state where Democratic presidential candidates won the state in seven straight elections before Trump won the state in 2016 against Hillary Clinton. Trump won the state by 0.7 percentage points in 2016 before the state returned to the Democrats in 2020 when Biden won over Trump by 1.2 points. Less than a month before the election, The Hill/ Decision Desk HQ Election Center forecast that Casey had a 72% chance of winning his reelection bid in November. Casey also far outraised and outspent McCormick, raising $31.2 million and spending $23.3 million to the Republican’s $17.7 million raised and $9.4 million spent, according to Open Secrets.

Presidential appointments: How do they work?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump has until his Jan. 20 Inauguration Day to build out his administration and fill thousands of roles. That means assigning leaders to oversee every executive department, including national security, public health, labor, and the Justice Department among others. A president typically appoints about 4,000 positions across the federal government. Of those, about 1,200 appointments require Senate approval, according to Partnership for Public Service’s Center for Presidential Transition estimates. Examples of government waste, inefficiency as Trump announces DOGE Common appointments that require Senate approval include cabinet secretaries, agency heads and ambassadors. Other roles, like advisors, aids, and senior officials in various agencies, are also filled by presidential appointees but don’t require Senate approval. Trump has announced the names of several people he hopes to appoint to serve in his administration. You can track his selections here. How does a nominee get appointed? The president-elect's transition team is busy identifying possible candidates for each role and making recommendations to the incoming president. For roles that require approval, the incoming president's formal written nomination for an appointment will trigger Senate scrutiny. The vetting process varies by position. Cabinet nominees are generally subject to FBI background checks, financial disclosure reviews and pre-Senate hearings. Trump has pressured lawmakers in the Senate to allow him to appoint some nominees without a Senate vote while the chamber is on recess. That would be considered a recess appointment — something the Senate hasn’t allowed presidents to make since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling made it more challenging. Which positions does Trump need to fill? Trump will need to appoint people to leadership roles within his Cabinet and elsewhere in his administration. The heads of 15 executive departments make up the Cabinet and are often considered the president’s closest advisors. Departments with leaders in the Cabinet include: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, and the Attorney General. What are Trump’s plans for Medicaid? The Cabinet also includes the White House Chief of Staff, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, the Director of National Intelligence, and the US Trade Representative, and the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Management and Budget, Council of Economic Advisers, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Small Business Administration. Cabinet members guide the president and keep him informed about each respective office. They also play a role in the line of succession, should the president no longer be able to serve. The president also appoints the heads of more than 50 independent federal commissions. Those include the Federal Reserve Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, federal judges, ambassadors and other officials.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/presidential-appointments-work/	2024-11-14T11:28:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2182353743.jpg?w=900
How will Trump's tariffs impact everyday Americans?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump plans to impose sweeping tariffs in his second term, but following through on that promise could come at a high cost for everyday Americans. 'If we were to see the full panoply of tariffs that candidate Trump proposed, you would see a substantial increase in the price of almost everything we buy every day,' said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes Trump hasn't been shy about his love for tariffs — which are a tax on goods imported from other countries — calling them 'the greatest thing ever invented' on the campaign trail. But economists warn those taxes, which are almost always paid by the importer, largely get passed onto consumers. As a candidate, Trump proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China as well as a 10% to 20% 'universal' tariff on all imports, arguing his plan would reduce the trade deficit and protect American jobs. Frustrated Americans await the economic changes they voted for with Trump The president-elect has also threatened a 25% tariff on Mexico, the United States' top trading partner, if the country doesn't do more to stop what he described as an 'onslaught of criminals and drugs' coming into the U.S. If that happens, shoppers can expect to pay more at the grocery store, particularly for items like fresh produce, much of which gets imported from abroad, Lincicome pointed out. The Tax Foundation — a nonpartisan tax policy nonprofit — recently looked at a dozen estimates analyzing Trump's proposed tariffs, and every study consistently found his proposals would negatively impact the U.S. economy. Other commentators are less worried, arguing that Trump's tariff threats are merely a negotiating tactic to gain leverage. 'He has talked about using those as a negotiating tool to keep China from stealing our technology, to get China to allow our goods and services to go into China … we need to have more pressure on China to have them accept American goods and services, which they’re not doing now,' Grover Norquist, the Republican founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform, told 'NewsNation Prime' this month. During a recent NewsNation town hall, now Vice President-elect JD Vance defended his running mate's tariff policies, pointing out that inflation was low during Trump's first term despite aggressive tariffs. How would tariffs be different in a second Trump term? Trump's new tariffs are expected to have far greater consequences than his previous ones because of the sheer magnitude of the proposals. 'Because we're talking about a wider range of products and a higher level of tariffs and consumer-facing goods, the direct price pain would be more obvious and significant this time around,' Lincicome said. Items like smartphones and laptops, which weren't subject to previous tariffs, could be hit especially hard. Under Trump's proposed tariffs, consumers could see laptop and tablet prices rise 46%, and smartphone prices jump 26%, according to a Consumer Technology Association report. The 60% tariff on Chinese goods alone would represent a near tripling of the current tariffs on imports from China, economist Pierre Lemieux noted in a report. 'Trump claims the tariffs would boost the economy and working-class families. In fact, they would hit hard the American economy and lower-income families,' Lemieux wrote. Retaliation is also a concern. China and Mexico would likely respond with tariffs of their own, which could hurt American exports. 'What we saw during the first Trump term was a lot of actual tariffs imposed, and almost no governments backing down in response to those tariffs,' Lincicome said. Mexico's government has already signaled it could hit back with its own trade restrictions — a move that would have serious consequences for American farmers, chemical manufacturers and other sectors. Altogether, U.S. exports to Mexico were $362 billion in 2022 and accounted for almost 16% of all American exports that year, according to the most recent figures from the Office of the United States Trade Representative. How much could Trump's tariffs push prices up? An analysis by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates Trump's proposed tariffs would cost a typical U.S. household more than $2,600 a year. 'High tariffs also imply a massive shifting of the tax burden from richer taxpayers toward lower-income Americans,' the report said. A separate estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale estimates Trump's tariffs could raise consumer prices by 1.4% to 5.1%. That's the equivalent of $1,900 to $7,600 per household. The uptick in prices would likely show up at the grocery store. That's because much of the food consumed in the United States — about 60% of fresh fruit and 38% of vegetables — is imported, according to Department of Agriculture data. Consumer products like apparel, toys, furniture and footwear, are also expected to get more expensive with new tariffs, the National Retail Federation (NRF) said earlier this month. The NRF warned the proposed tariffs would have a 'significant' and 'detrimental' impact on a wide range of items and reduce Americans' spending power by $46 billion to $78 billion each year they're in place. A $90 pair of athletic shoes is expected to jump to $106-$116, the NRF estimated. Meanwhile, an $80 pair of men's jeans would cost $90 to $96. It's also worth mentioning: Trump's first-term tariffs didn't send prices skyrocketing across the board, but they did come at a cost. After accounting for direct costs and efficiency losses, economists estimate the tariffs increased costs for average American households by about $830 per year. For example, Trump imposed a tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018. Researchers estimate the price of washing machines increased by around 12%, about $86 per unit. Do tariffs protect jobs? One of Trump's main arguments in favor of tariffs is that they prevent American businesses from offshoring jobs, but it's not that simple. Workers who produce the specific goods covered by tariffs often benefit, but tariffs can also hurt workers in other industries that rely on those imports. 'You can protect the steel industry with tariffs, but higher steel prices are going to harm manufacturers that need steel in the United States and are going to harm all those workers,' Lincicome said. In other words, a government tariff may be trading jobs in one industry at the expense of jobs in another. Going back to the washing machine example, researchers determined the policy created about 1,800 new jobs, but at a steep cost of as much as $817,000 per job. The Tax Foundation estimates Trump's proposed tariffs would bring down total employment by 684,000 jobs — an estimate that doesn't include the effects of retaliation. A 2024 paper by a group of top economists looked at Trump's 2018 tariffs and found that 'import tariffs on foreign goods neither raised nor lowered US employment in newly-protected sectors.' However, retaliatory tariffs had 'clear negative impacts,' primarily in agriculture.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/trumps-tariffs-prices/	2024-11-14T10:45:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/6550cf841f1d47.44211312.jpeg?w=900
Examples of government waste, inefficiency as Trump announces DOG...	(NewsNation) — Tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut federal spending and 'wasteful expenditures.' NewsNation compiled a list of existing wasteful and inefficient government spending examples. What is Elon Musk’s plan for DOGE? Congressional funding for expired programs The Congressional Budget Office recently found that Congress provided $516 billion in appropriations this fiscal year to programs that had expired under federal law. The funds were associated with nearly 500 expired authorizations, according to the CBO's July report. 'Nearly two-thirds ($320 billion) of that $516 billion was provided for activities whose authorizations expired more than a decade ago,' the report said. According to CBO's estimates, about half of the authorized appropriations in the report expired at least 10 years ago, and the oldest expired in 1980. In 2023, the amount of funding for expired authorizations was $519 billion. What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes Payment errors The federal government made $247 billion worth of payment errors in fiscal year 2022 and $236 billion in 2023, according to the Government Accountability Office. These errors, also known as improper payments, include overpayments or payments that should not have been made, such as to someone who died or someone no longer eligible for government programs. Estimates show the federal government spent $2.7 trillion in payment errors since 2003. In 2022, the majority of improper payments spanned across 82 programs, a majority coming from Medicaid ($81 billion) and Medicare ($47 billion). 'Improper payments and fraud are long-standing and significant problems in the federal government,' said House testimony from GAO in September. What Kristi Noem’s DHS appointment could mean for the border Maintaining empty buildings Federal government agencies are using just 12% of the space in their headquarters buildings on average, according to the Public Buildings Reform Board, which is an independent federal agency focused on recommending the disposal of underutilized federal properties. 'Even before the pandemic, of the federal properties analyzed, federal occupancy was low, particularly in Washington D.C.,' the board's report to Congress in March said. These spaces must be furnished, which also costs money. The House Oversight Committee spent $3.3 billion on furniture over the past few years. Apparently, to furnish office spaces left mostly empty under maximum telework. Some agencies spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on updating empty conference rooms 'Hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer funds are spent annually just to maintain government-owned properties that should be sold off,' said Chairman Rep. James Comer of the House Oversight Committee in a hearing last year. 'A billion dollars or more could be saved annually by terminating unneeded federal office space leases. Unused federal space was an issue prior to the pandemic — federal property management has long been on GAO’s High-Risk List — but it’s now become one that is simply too big — and too costly — to ignore.' Kamala Harris campaign now millions in debt Producing pennies A penny may cost one cent for people using it to pay for goods and services, but it costs triple that for the government to produce it. For 19 years, the cost of producing pennies has surpassed the value of the coin. The same is true for nickels. Though valued at five cents, a nickel costs 11.5 cents for the government to produce one. Producing these two coins last year cost the U.S. Mint $179 million. Federal agency recommendations The Government Accountability Office reports more than 5,300 open recommendations for federal agencies to make the government work better. In July, GAO estimated taxpayers could save between $106 billion and $208 billion if the recommendations were implemented.

Trump's Rubio pick divides Republicans	Tensions are brewing over President-elect Trump’s move to tap Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to serve as secretary of State, with some of the president-elect’s allies voicing concerns about the pick. The choice has already set into motion the process of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) choosing a replacement for Rubio in the Senate, and some senators have already said they would vote to confirm Rubio. But while Trump’s choice of Rubio received praise from various Republicans and Democrats, those in the so-called MAGA wing of the GOP have expressed a mix of surprise and disappointment about the pick, with many hoping Trump would choose former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell. 'I’ve been most surprised with the Rubio pick,' said one source close to the transition, who described the Florida senator as 'not that MAGA.' The delay in formally announcing Rubio raised questions about whether Trump was navigating how to move forward amid the internal disagreement, but Trump’s announcement came shortly after Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) was elected Senate majority leader. 'To me what that looks more towards was making sure that Rubio was being able to be a part of the Senate majority leader elections,' said Alex Stroman, Trump’s 2017 inaugural spokesperson and a personal friend of Grenell’s. Stroman said Rubio is someone Republicans are happy about and the kind of person Trump wanted from the outset. 'Anytime that you have nominations for a president’s Cabinet, there are discussions that play out both publicly and privately,' he said. The source who expressed surprise about Rubio suggested the pick may have been influenced by Susie Wiles, Trump’s incoming chief of staff who has worked for decades in Florida politics. The New York Times first reported late Monday that Trump was expected to name Rubio as his secretary of State nominee, and Trump on Wednesday confirmed the choice in a statement. 'He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,' Trump said. On Monday, following reports that Trump would pick Rubio, conservative activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk warned his followers to not 'jump to conclusions.' 'If Trump hasn’t confirmed it on Truth, don’t jump to conclusions and don’t believe everything you see,' Kirk wrote. And earlier this week, a source familiar with the matter told The Hill that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had expressed opposition to the prospect of Rubio being nominated for the position. The decision to make Rubio secretary of State is far from the most controversial choice Trump has made during his transition so far. Shortly after announcing his intention to nominate the senator, Trump also announced he had picked another Florida Republican, Rep. Matt Gaetz, to be attorney general, a move that drew stunned responses from many Republicans on Capitol Hill. While many in MAGA world have expressed displeasure at the idea of Trump appointing Rubio, others seem to be on board with the scenario if it means Lara Trump, the president-elect’s daughter-in-law, will fill his Senate seat. On Tuesday, Maye Musk posted on the social platform X that Lara Trump should be Rubio’s replacement and called the upper chamber 'an old man’s club.' Elon Musk reposted his mother’s post, writing that 'Lara Trump is genuinely great.' Elon Musk’s approval of Lara Trump in the position is notable given his recent close proximity to President-elect Trump. Musk has been a constant presence around Mar-a-Lago and even appeared in Trump’s family photo following his election win. Several other Trump allies have weighed in to support the idea of Lara Trump being the pick, including Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who argued in a post on X that appointing the president-elect’s daughter-in-law would help avoid a 'messy primary' in 2026. With the president-elect's decision to nominate Rubio, the choice of his replacement in the Senate will fall to DeSantis. A source familiar with the matter told The Hill that DeSantis’s chief of staff was favored for the position and that the other candidates include Florida’s lieutenant governor and attorney general. The source said that the president-elect may push for his daughter-in-law, but later added 'our governor has not gotten a call about appointing Lara.' Sources have been reluctant to openly discuss the dynamics surrounding the nomination and the subsequent domino effect on Florida politics and in MAGA world. Rubio has had something of a winding journey to become one of Trump’s closer allies. He and Trump were fierce rivals during the 2016 GOP primary, with the two exchanging insults about their manhood. But the senator became an informal adviser to Trump during his first term, and Rubio was one of three finalists considered to be Trump’s running mate this year before Vice President-elect JD Vance got the nod. To be sure, the Rubio pick has gotten a warm reception from members of both parties. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) said he would vote to confirm Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) praised the choice. But Rubio has also faced criticism from some Trump allies for being too much of a foreign policy hawk, a term Trump has used disparagingly to talk about rivals like former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). However, his tough approach to China and Iran largely aligns with Trump’s talk on the campaign trail, and Rubio has in recent weeks argued the Ukraine-Russia conflict will need to end through a negotiated agreement, something that also echoes what Trump has said on the topic. Grenell, comparatively, has been one of Trump’s staunchest allies dating back to the start of his first term, and he had been something of an envoy for the president-elect while he was out of office. Grenell previously served as ambassador to Germany and acting director of intelligence during Trump’s first term. He joined Trump during a recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and he was an active presence on the campaign trail. In what could be seen as a tacit acknowledgment of the divisions over Trump's choice, Grenell congratulated Rubio on X on Wednesday night. The Florida senator promptly responded. 'Thank you! Kind words from a great American who will be a vital part of protecting America and Americans in the years to come!' Rubio tweeted.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-rubio-pick-divides-republicans/	2024-11-14T03:31:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/rubiomarco_011824gn02_w.jpg?w=900
Trump 'border czar': Cartels need terrorist label due to death co...	(NewsNation) — Former ICE Director Tom Homan, tapped to lead border enforcement in President-elect Donald Trump's administration, says he will prioritize deporting criminals and national security threats while pushing to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations. 'There's more than one priority,' Homan said Wednesday on NewsNation's 'CUOMO,' revealing that authorities have identified more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions and final deportation orders who remain in the United States. The incoming border chief outlined three major policy changes he believes Congress should implement: Reform the Flores Settlement Agreement to allow longer detention of migrant families Modify the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to enable faster processing of unaccompanied minors Overhaul asylum laws and reinstate the 'Remain in Mexico' program Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Homan defended Trump-era policies, saying border crossings dropped to historic lows under the previous administration's approach. He criticized the policies of President Joe Biden’s administration, saying they led to record-high encounters and overwhelmed Border Patrol resources. 'If we don't secure the border, more migrants are going to die. More women are going to be raped. There's no downside in securing the border,' he told NewsNation. 'Congress needs to fix this. Immigration enforcement is very controversial, is very emotional. I get it, but we have to secure the border because a secure border is going to save lives,' Homan said. Tom Homan: Cartels should be labeled as terrorist organizations Homan, who served under six presidents and faced recent death threats from cartels, strongly backed Trump's plan to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations, noting they have 'killed more Americans than every terrorist organization in the world combined.' Democratic Party has 'lost touch': Rep. Seth Moulton 'The criminal cartels in Mexico is like a Fortune 500 company,' Homan said, describing their expansion into 42 countries and growing control of drug distribution networks within the U.S. Tom Homan pledges to find missing migrant children Homan revealed plans to launch a major initiative to locate approximately 300,000 unaccompanied migrant children who entered the U.S. but cannot be accounted for by authorities. 'Some are going to be in forced labor. We already found some in forced labor ... Some are gonna be sex trafficking. Some are living with pedophiles,' Homan said, pledging to make finding these children a top priority. 'Border czar' Tom Homan: All we want to do is enforce the law When pressed about the potential economic impact of mass deportations, particularly on industries heavily reliant on immigrant labor, Homan said that enforcement would focus on criminals and security threats rather than indiscriminate roundups. Trump accused of avoiding press after controversial admin appointments 'If you're in the country illegally, you're in violation of law, so you're not off the table, but we're going to prioritize what we do,' Homan said. Homan pushes for asylum system reforms Homan cited data showing about 85% of asylum claims at the southern border are ultimately rejected, arguing the system needs significant reform. He said the current process allows too many migrants to enter the U.S. based on an initial screening with a 'very low' threshold of proof. 'They learned a few key phrases from the cartels of what to say to make yourself pass that first interview,' Homan said. He advocated for raising the standard of proof in initial screenings to match the higher burden required in court hearings. 'If you're really escaping fear and persecution from your home government, you're going to wait in Mexico to escape that fear and persecution,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-border-czar-tom-homan-priorities/	2024-11-13T20:03:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/snapshot_6d5094.jpg?w=900
Democratic Party has 'lost touch': Rep. Seth Moulton	(NewsNation) — Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., is critical of his party and the role it played in losing the 2024 election. 'We need to look ourselves in the mirror as Democrats and ask, 'How do we reconnect with the majority of American voters?'' Moulton said Wednesday on 'CUOMO.' 'We've clearly lost touch.' Democrats’ election reckoning pits liberals against centrists Moulton was recently quoted in a story from The New York Times about Democratic finger-pointing after Vice President Harris lost the 2024 election, saying his party had leaned too heavily into identity politics, forging a path for President-elect Trump and Republicans to a decisive victory. He has faced backlash from his party, with Massachusetts Democratic Party Chair Steve Kerrigan, for example, telling the Boston Globe that Moulton’s comments 'do not represent the broad view of our party.' Moulton responded to backlash about his transgender athlete comments, saying the response to them proves his point. 'I was just speaking authentically as a dad about one of many issues where I think we’re just out of touch with the majority of voters, and I stand by my position,' Moulton said during an MSNBC appearance. 'The backlash I’ve received proves my point that we can’t even have these discussions as a party.' Moulton told 'CUOMO' that if his party doesn’t 'come up with a new strategy, a winning strategy going forward, then we're never gonna be able to stop Trump.' Matt Gaetz is Trump’s pick for attorney general Moulton doesn’t oppose transgender rights, but says the party has been too focused on that cause and similar social issues. He was first elected to Congress in 2015 and is a member of the Congressional Equality Caucus. The caucus promotes LGBTQ equality in the House and has strongly opposed efforts to bar trans athletes from sports teams that best align with their gender identity. His 2024 reelection campaign was endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ advocacy group.

UFO House hearing witness: Pentagon 'clearly covering something u...	(NewsNation) — Independent journalist Michael Shellenberger testified Wednesday at a House of Representatives committee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP. 'The Pentagon is clearly covering something up,' Shellenberger said Wednesday on 'Vargas Reports.' 'The Pentagon is treating us like children. It's a very paternalistic attitude. They just need to release the information, obviously make sure that nothing gets out to our enemies. But we're long overdue for this sort of disclosure and transparency.' What is Donald Trump’s position on UFOs? Shellenberger, who has written extensively about a program called 'Immaculate Constellation,' testified during Wednesday’s hearing that members of Congress have expressed growing frustration since 2021 over the military and intelligence community’s refusal to reveal 'concrete' information. What is Immaculate Constellation? Shellenberger detailed his reporting on the alleged 'Immaculate Constellation' secret government program. A whistleblower revealed the alleged UFO program, in which the Pentagon collects and quarantines information on UFO sightings, Shellenberger says. Department of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough has previously denied the existence of records regarding the program. Shellenberger highlighted the need for Congress and the White House to address UFOs. Michael Gold, a former NASA administrator, outlined new ways for the space agency to be helpful on the UAP issue. Currently chief growth officer at Redwire Space, Gold stressed in his testimony that he is speaking on his own behalf and not for any other organization. 'Agencies such as NASA have much to offer when it comes to understanding UAP,' Gold's prepared testimony read.

Trump accused of avoiding press after controversial admin appoint...	(NewsNation) — Unlike his most recent predecessors, President-elect Donald Trump has not answered questions explaining his key and at times controversial appointments or explaining his priorities now that he has been elected. Trump transition officials are not providing details about when he will have a general news conference. Trump has had two limited exchanges with reporters — one-on-ones with NBC and the New York Post. 'President Trump was the most press-accessible candidate in the race, by far,' Trump spokesman Steve Cheung told NewsNation. 'He will continue to engage with the press regularly and his team will remain committed to providing timely answers on a wide range of inquiries. Stay tuned!' Trump, Biden meet to discuss peaceful transfer of power Political analyst Chris Cillizza calls the decision not to hold forth before the cameras 'UnTrumpy.' In 1992, Bill Clinton held his first formal news conference eight days after being elected. In that event, Clinton announced some of his first appointments, but his Cabinet picks came later in a series of news conferences. Clinton did answer some questions two days after the election as he was leaving the Arkansas State Capitol. And Clinton held a news conference three days after defeating Robert Dole in 1996, in which he announced a change in his chiefs of staff. FBI should probe Gabbard, Gaetz before confirmation: John Bolton The election of 2000 was different because both Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush answered many media questions in various forums as the election outcome and the various court fights dragged on until Dec. 12. When he was reelected in 2004, Bush held a formal news conference with White House reporters two days later — Nov. 4. Barack Obama was quicker to face the press after he won in 2008. He talked to reporters three days after the election and announced his chief of staff selection. After his reelection, Obama waited eight days later before holding a news conference to talk about his second term. Joe Biden held his first news conference as president-elect a week after his 2020 election. While Trump held news conferences during the 2016 and 2020 campaigns and criticized both of his general election opponents for the lack of media accessibility, he also did not face reporters for six weeks (Dec. 19) after winning in 2016. What Kristi Noem’s DHS appointment could mean for the border? Since his victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, all of Trump’s personnel announcements have been made through prepared statements released in his name. Cillizza argues that 'providing statements is the not the same as taking questions at a press conference.' Also: the Trump transition team is not holding regular briefings to discuss appointments or what policies the new administration will pursue.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-media-appointments/	2024-11-13T18:34:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66e356c4c660d2.57860006.jpeg?w=900
FBI should probe Gabbard, Gaetz before confirmation: John Bolton	(NewsNation) — John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under George W. Bush and a former national security adviser in the first Trump administration, said President-elect Donald Trump’s intention to nominate former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Rep. Matt Gaetz to his Cabinet shows Trump is not serious about intelligence gathering. 'With his (Trump) announcement of Tulsi Gabbard to be the director of national intelligence, he’s sending a signal that we’ve lost our mind when it comes to collecting intelligence,' Bolton told NewsNation’s 'The Hill.' But Bolton says Gabbard isn’t the worst pick Trump has made. Trump names top campaign aides as senior White House staff 'Up until a few hours ago, I would have said that (Gabbard) was the worst Cabinet appointment in recent American history. Since Matt Gaetz’s nomination (to be attorney general), he clearly has taken the lead on that score,' Bolton said. Gaetz, who said Wednesday he is immediately resigning from Congress after being nominated to be attorney general, faced a yearslong Justice Department investigation into allegations of sex trafficking and obstruction of justice. Last year, the department said it would not bring charges. Gaetz is still the subject of a House Ethics Committee investigation as well as a civil lawsuit involving allegations of a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. Republicans win control of the US House of Representatives 'I don’t think either she (Gabbard) or Matt Gaetz ought to have a confirmation hearing until they have both had full-field FBI investigations,' said Bolton. 'Given the Russian propaganda that she (Gabbard) has espoused … I think she’s a serious threat to our national security. I think Republican senators should reject both of them.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/gabbard-gaetz-need-fbi-probes-bolton/	2024-11-13T17:20:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/image_a7cc50.png?w=900
House Republicans strike deal to make it harder to oust Speaker	Hard-line conservatives have struck a tentative deal with House Republicans concerned about chaos in the chamber, agreeing to raise the threshold to force a vote to oust the Speaker in exchange for concessions on rule changes — potentially putting Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on a glide path to keep the gavel come January. The deal — which multiple sources confirmed to The Hill — would significantly weaken the House 'motion to vacate' rule, eliminating the threat of any one member triggering the kind of snap vote that resulted in the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). That historic ouster has loomed over Johnson’s tenure in the top job. Under the agreement, hard-line conservatives would agree to raising the threshold to force a vote on ousting the Speaker from one member to nine members. The mechanism has been a key point of contention within the House GOP conference since McCarthy’s ouster. Hard-line conservatives were adamant about keeping it to one lawmaker before Wednesday. In exchange for that concession, other members would drop the proposed rules changes — spearheaded by those in the Main Street Caucus — that aimed to punish members for rebelling against the majority of the party in ways that risked grinding legislative activity to a halt. Proposed penalties included removing members from committees if they support a motion to vacate against a Republican Speaker. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who has been a vocal opponent of the rule changes, called them a 'nonstarter.' 'All of the targeting amendments and stuff, those are all gone. And that was, as I tweeted out earlier, those were a nonstarter,' he said. 'Those were a deal-killer.' The deal was hatched shortly before Republicans voted on a nominee for Speaker, and after President-elect Trump threw his support behind the Louisiana Republican. Johnson, members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and those in the self-described pragmatic Main Street Caucus were involved in the discussions. Johnson met members and allies of the Freedom Caucus minutes before Wednesday’s internal election, two sources told The Hill. Conservatives who balked at the proposed changes — many of whom are members of the Freedom Caucus — had plotted to oppose Johnson’s nomination to the Speakership in Wednesday’s internal GOP elections as a form of protest. First they planned to nominate a last-minute protest candidate, then they planned to force a recorded vote on Johnson’s nomination to showcase opposition. But after the agreement, Johnson was nominated to remain Speaker by unanimous voice vote. No member voiced opposition, according to multiple sources in the room. That is good news to the Speaker, who will have another slim majority and will need near unanimity to be elected Speaker on the House floor when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3. Speaker Johnson appeared with Main Street Caucus Chair Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) and Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) to confirm the deal later on Wednesday. Dusty Johnson said that Harris had reached out to him earlier in the day to strike the deal. 'That motion to vacate will be set at nine in return for getting rid of some amendments that probably would have divided this conference,' Dusty Johnson said. 'Andy did a good job of explaining to Main Street leadership why those amendments would have divided the republican conference.' Harris noted that Trump had visited the conference earlier in the day and asked for Republican unity. 'We've been able to work across the conference to eliminate the controversial issues that could have divided us and move forward together to deliver on the President's agenda,' Harris said. Some lawmakers, however, are warning that the situation is tenuous. Roy, a leading voice on the Speakership talks, wrote on the social platform X that there is 'much more work to be done' when discussing the agreement. 'For now - those offering the retaliation amendments agreed to set aside ALL of them while conversations continue about organization, so @SpeakerJohnson was chosen as Speaker,' he wrote. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), meanwhile, told reporters 'they are still going to be negotiating that as we get to January.' Proponents of the 'accountability amendments' in question were bitter about the chaos that plagued the House GOP over the last two years, not only from the weeks of standstill after McCarthy’s ouster, but from legislation that hard-liners blocked by tanking procedural votes. They worried such actions could impede President-elect Trump’s agenda as he takes office, and pointed to the rebellions as a reason why Republicans did not win more House seats. But the hard-line conservatives balked at the proposals, which were antithetical to their goals of further democratizing power. Such punishments for breaking from the party would prevent members from representing their constituents, they argued. An internal memo circulated among conservatives before the deal was struck Wednesday said that the amendments would be 'sowing seeds of division' when Republicans will have 'no room for error in the next Congress,' and argued the rules would 'punish those who fought for President Trump and his agenda for years and provide excuses for those who will likely obstruct it.' One proposed amendment from Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.) would have consequences for members who support a 'motion to vacate' the Speaker, removing them from committees. 'We need to have cohesion and unity. We need to have parameters set,' Van Orden told The Hill in an interview on Wednesday morning, before the deal was struck. Van Orden said that if unified Republican control of government does not change how the House GOP operates, 'then Republicans don’t deserve the majority.' 'If we don't act boldly and decisively, then we have no business governing. And that is a flag that I'm planting in the ground. So we've got the House, we've got the Senate, got the White House, and if we don't act on the mandates that were given by the American people, we don't deserve it.' Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) proposed two rules changes, the first of which would remove members from committees if they voted against the 'rule' — procedural votes that govern debate and consideration of legislation on the House floor that are considered tests of party loyalty. His second proposal would have imposed similar consequences for those who vote for the party’s 'Speaker Designate' on the House floor, a scenario that led to the House taking days to officially elect McCarthy as Speaker in January 2023, preventing the House from conducting any legislative activity. Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.), too, had an amendment to remove members from committees if they defy the party on a procedural vote. Johnson told Politico on Tuesday that he was not in favor of those rule changes, saying he was 'not in favor of punitive measures and rules.' But the hard-liners had wanted to see him explicitly advocate against the proposed rule changes. 'He can say he opposes them, but he's not going to try and stop them or whip against them,' Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) said. Johnson, according to Crane, told House Republicans that he would not put his thumb on the scale and that it would be up to the House GOP to decide on the rules. That fueled the risk of a formal show of opposition to Johnson. But the brokering of a deal, which caused a slight delay to the start of leadership elections as it was negotiated on Wednesday, ended with unanimous approval for the Speaker in a massive win for him.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/house-republicans-strike-deal-to-make-it-harder-to-oust-speaker/	2024-11-13T16:44:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/johnsonmike_091824gn19_w.jpg?w=900
Gaetz resigns from Congress after AG nod	Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) will resign from Congress 'effective immediately' after being nominated to serve as attorney general by President-elect Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) announced on Wednesday. The news came hours after Trump sent shockwaves throughout Washington with his pick of Gaetz — a staunch ally of the president-elect — for attorney general. Gaetz still faces Senate confirmation. Johnson postulated that the Florida Republican decided to leave the House early to speed up the process to replace him, with hopes that his successor can be decided by the time the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. 'I think, out of deference to us, he issued his resignation letter effective immediately, of Congress. That caught us by surprise a little bit, but I asked him what the reasoning was and he said, well, you can’t have too many absences, so under Florida state law there’s about an eight-week period to select and fill a vacant seat. And so by doing so today that allows me, I’ve already placed a call to Gov. DeSantis in Florida and said let’s start the clock,' Johnson said.

Are UAPs a threat to national security and US airspace?	(NewsNation) — Experts and former military officials who testified before a U.S. House of Representatives committee exploring unidentified anomalous phenomena Wednesday admit that there is a heightened sense of awareness about the possible existence of unidentified technology, which some people fear could be threatening American airspace. Former Pentagon official Luis Elizondo, retired U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Timothy Gallaudet, independent journalist Michael Shellenberger and former NASA official Michael Gold all testified before the committee. The experts were questioned by committee members on a number of topics surrounding UAPs and what many lawmakers consider a lack of transparency by the federal government on the subject. What is the Langley AFB Incident? Security around Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia was increased after a Wall Street Journal report detailed more than a dozen cases of drones flying over the military installation in late 2023. What UAP witnesses recommend for congressional action The report suggested that the cases took place over a 17-day period when unidentified drones flew over the base where F-22 Raptor stealth fighters are based. The report indicated that at this time, it remains unknown whether the drone presence equates to a threat to the nation’s security. That led committee members to ask experts Wednesday to link the presence of UAPs and military installation sites like Langley. 'There’s definitely enough data out there to suggest that there is certainly some sort of relations between sensitive U.S. military installations and also our nuclear equities and also some of our Department of Energy sites,' Elizondo testified when asked about the 2023 incident. 'There is a long historical record … that demonstrates this. This is not a new trend. This has been going on for decades, and this information has been obfuscated, unfortunately, from (lawmakers). 'I think that’s problematic because ultimately, at the end of the day, we have a significant situation here. We have something that can enter into U.S. airspace completely with no attribution.' Gallaudet said there were other instances of drones over Langley before the Wall Street Journal brought the details of the 2023 activity to light. In addition, he said there is evidence to suggest other incidents took place in and around other U.S. military installations over the past 50 years. Elizondo added that he believes that while UAPs may be targeting U.S. military installations, it is possible there is also greater technology being used to monitor the presence of UAPs. He said that there is a program within the Department of Defense and intelligence committee called IPB (Initial Preparations of the Battlespace) and that specific technologies are being used to prepare those locations. Elizondo added that there is a calculus of capabilities versus the intent of whether something rises to the level of a threat to national security that must be figured out. 'Certainly, if I were wearing my national security hat, even if there were a 2% chance that there was some sort of hostile intent here, that’s 2% higher than we can really accept,' Elizondo told committee members. Why was the 'Tic Tac' video not released? House committee members also questioned experts about the 'Tic Tac' incident that took place in 2004. On Nov. 14 of that year, U.S. Navy aviators were sent to intercept a UAP that resembled the popular breath mint due to its shape and color. Pentagon officials have since struggled to explain what happened. What is the Pentagon’s alleged ‘Immaculate Constellation’ program? When asked why video of the incident was not released, Gallaudet testified he does not believe there is 'any good reason' for the Department of Defense to withhold important information and data from Congress. He said that is especially the case when matters of national security are involved. 'I will speculate that they don’t want to share that kind of information because it reveals weaknesses in our ability to monitor and protect our airspace,' Gallaudet said. Gallaudet testified Wednesday that earlier this year, he met with the Department of Defense’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office in what he said turned out to be an hourslong influence operation on the retired U.S. Navy rear admiral. Gallaudet said the committee attempted to convince him of the validity of the 'very flawed and error-ridden' historical records report. The group also attempted, he said, to have the former Navy officer question incidents like 'Tic Tac' and to get him to admit 'Tic Tac' was American technology. What are the threats UAPs could pose? As the House committee exploring UAP continues to push for transparency and answers, the biggest question surrounding the phenomena is what kind of threat they pose to national security and if foreign countries could be behind them. Gallaudet said during his testimony that he believes Wednesday’s hearing should be used as a catalyst 'to improve and bolster' the country’s air defense capabilities as well as its maritime awareness capabilities. He said that between 2020 and 2022, a government task force that investigated UAPs in the Department of Defense was active, but it is now inactive. During their testimony, the group of experts all called for more whole-of-government efforts that could provide answers about the origins of UAPs and the threat they may pose to national security. 'Obviously, there’s holes in it,' Gallaudet said. 'Whether it be UAP of nonhuman (intelligence) direction or China or any other adversary.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/uap-threat-national-security-airspace/	2024-11-13T14:24:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/AARO-UAPS-sighting-Nexstar-4212023.png?w=900
Pete Hegseth: What to know about Trump's pick for Defense Secreta...	(NewsNation) — Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Pete Hegseth as the next Secretary of Defense has gotten a lot of attention. While some praised the 44-year-old current co-host of Fox News Channel’s 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend,' others criticized Hegseth as lacking experience. If confirmed by the Senate, Hegseth would be the second youngest Secretary of Defense, after Donald Rumsfeld, who was confirmed in 1975 at the age of 43. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First,' Trump said in a statement Tuesday. 'With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice — Our military will be great again, and America will Never back down.' Pete Hegseth’s time in the military, Fox News Hegseth served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and did tours in Afghanistan and Iraq after graduating from Princeton University in 2003. He earned two Bronze stars. Formerly head of the Concerned Veterans for America, which the Associated Press writes is backed by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, Hegseth ran for U.S. Senate in Minnesota in 2012, but lost his race. Hegseth has been contributing to the Fox News Channel for a decade. A Fox News spokesperson. to the AP, said Hegseth's 'insights and analysis especially about the military resonated deeply with our viewers.' DNC staffers resign with Kamala Harris campaign $20M in debt He is an author of books including, 'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.' Pete and his wife Jenny live in Middle Tennessee and have seven children, according to his website. Pete Hegseth on women in military Comments Hegseth made on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' about women in combat are getting a lot of attention. 'I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles,' Hegseth said. 'It hasn't made us more effective, it hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.' While Hegseth said he's served with women and they've been 'great,' institutions shouldn't have to 'incentivize' that in positions where 'men are more capable.'

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) Pete Hegseth criticizes 'woke' military In his book, Hegseth wrote that the next president of the United States needs to radically overhaul Pentagon senior leadership to make us ready to defend our nation and defeat our enemies. 'Lots of people need to be fired,' Hegseth wrote, according to Reuters. Trump in June told Fox News he would fire generals he called 'woke.' Hegseth has decried so-called programs that promote equity and inclusion, and previously accused the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General C.Q. Brown, of 'pursuing the radical positions of left-wing politicians.' Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump When Trump was creating his first cabinet, he reportedly considered Hegseth to be head of the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2016, the AP wrote, and then again in 2018 when Secretary David Shulkin faced criticism before being ousted. Hegseth confirmed on a podcast last week that he was interviewed multiple times for the VA position in 2016. 'Ultimately I think (Trump) thought I was a little young,' Hegseth said during his appearance on 'The Shawn Ryan Show.' In 2019, Hegseth encouraged Trump to pardon U.S. service members accused of war crimes on his Fox News show, and said on social media that the President-elect doing so 'would be amazing.' This was despite warnings from U.S. officials and organizations that it would damage the military justice system's integrity. Trump ultimately pardoned a former U.S. Army commando set to stand trial in the killing of a suspected Afghan bomb-maker and a former Army lieutenant convicted of murder for ordering his men to fire upon three Afghans, killing two. Years before that, on a 2015 'Fox &amp; Friends' segment on the 240th anniversary of the Army’s founding, Hegseth went viral when he struck a master sergeant in the arm with an ax. Both he and Fox News were named in a lawsuit that was discontinued in 2019, according to the AP. UFOs ‘enigmatic and frustrating:’ witness says in House hearing Reactions to Hegseth’s appointment Sources NewsNation has spoken to are shocked at his being tapped by Trump to lead the Department of Defense, echoing criticisms that he is inexperienced. Retired Army Major General William Enyart told NewsNation that if Hegseth is confirmed, U.S. adversaries will view Hegseth as a 'pretty boy from TV.' 'Trump picking Pete Hegseth is the most hilariously predictably stupid thing,' Former U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., said on X. Speaking on CNN’s Anderson Cooper, though, Kingziner called Hegseth 'very smart when it comes to things like defense policy.' Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he's concerned Hegseth won't be able to tackle Pentagon bureaucracy. Report names ‘Immaculate Constellation’ UAP program: Journalist 'I confess I didn’t know who he was until 20 minutes ago,' Smith told reporters, according to POLITICO. 'And he certainly doesn’t seem to have any background whatsoever in DOD policy.' Speaking to The Hill, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass, a former Marine Corps officer said he believes Hegseth is 'going to try very hard to politicize the military.' 'That’s been his MO at Fox News and in his variety of positions since he got out of the National Guard as well, and so that’s not going to be a good influence,' Moulton said in an interview with The Hill. However, Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla, who will also become a new member of Trump's administration as national security adviser, said Hegseth is going to be a leader who has the grit to bring 'real reform' to the Pentagon. 'Congratulations to my friend @PeteHegseth — a combat decorated veteran — and let’s re-establish deterrence through America’s strength,' Waltz said. NewsNation reached out to Trump's team for comment on the backlash Hegseth has gotten. In response, they sent back Trump's initial statement announcing the pick, in which the President-elect says Hegseth will be a 'courageous and patriotic champion' of his 'Peace through Strength' policy.

What is Elon Musk's plan for DOGE?	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk has been tapped to lead a new advisory group on government spending in Donald Trump’s second administration, and the tech entrepreneur has been dropping breadcrumbs on what he plans to do. President-elect Trump announced Tuesday that Musk, along with Vivek Ramaswamy, would lead his 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE), an initiative meant to 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? There is still little known about DOGE, but in a statement shared by Trump, Musk said it will 'send shockwaves through the system and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!' What is DOGE or Department of Government Efficiency? The Department of Government Efficiency is a new initiative put forth by Trump once he takes office in January. Trump said that DOGE would 'provide advice and guidance from outside of government' and partner with the White House Office of Budget and Management (OMB) to drive large-scale structural reform. 'It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time. Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of 'DOGE' for a very long time,' the president-elect added. The Manhattan Project was a secret World War II government program to develop and deploy the world’s first atomic weapons. The idea appeared to have come from Musk, who discussed the need for a 'government efficiency commission' while campaigning alongside Trump. The president-elect said DOGE’s work will 'conclude' no later than July 4, 2026, in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. What are Elon Musk’s plans for DOGE? Musk has provided some tidbits on what could be in store for DOGE since Trump’s announcement on the agency. 'Incentives matter. There should be rewards for wise spending, but those who waste taxpayer funds cannot be allowed to keep doing so without consequences,' Musk posted on X of DOGE on Wednesday, hinting that cuts will be imminent under his guidance. Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security He also said the department would provide 'maximum transparency' and that all of DOGE’s actions will be posted online. 'Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know!' Musk posted. Musk also said that DOGE would create a 'leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending' of tax dollars, which he said would be 'extremely tragic and extremely entertaining.' While Trump has given DOGE less than 18 months to complete its work, Musk said Wednesday that it 'will be done much faster.' One item that might be on Musk’s chopping block is the defense budget, which the billionaire called 'pretty gigantic' in a video posted on the X account of a PAC founded by Musk that he reshared on Tuesday. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk speaks during an interview. (Czarek Sokolowski, Associated Press) 'It's a trillion dollars. The interest we owe on the debt is now higher than the defense budget. This is not sustainable. That's why we need the Department of Government Efficiency,' he said in the video. Musk had floated the idea of a government efficiency department before Trump’s win while on the campaign trail, telling voters it was time to 'drain the swamp.' During an October Trump rally in Pennsylvania, Musk said, 'We're going to bankrupt the country' without lowering government spending, adding that it would take 'some pretty big moves.' What Trump’s administration could mean for education Musk also spoke at the controversial Madison Square Garden rally in New York leading up to the election and told crowds there that he wants to cut at least $2 trillion in federal spending. 'All government spending is taxation ... your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that,' Musk said What is Vivek Ramaswamy's role in DOGE? Pharmaceutical entrepreneur Ramaswamy, who was one of Trump's most vocal supporters, was tasked to run DOGE alongside Musk. 'DOGE is ready to help the U.S. government conform to the U.S. Constitution once again. @elonmusk and I are ready to serve,' he posted. He added, 'We will not go gently @elonmusk.' Vivek Ramaswamy speaking during the second day of the Republican National Convention on Tuesday, July 16, 2024, in Milwaukee. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) During his own unsuccessful bid for the presidential nomination, Ramaswamy campaigned on eliminating federal agencies, including the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Education Department; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and the Food and Nutrition Service within the Agriculture Department. What to know about Trump’s inauguration On Wednesday, he posted on X that 'DOGE will soon begin crowdsourcing examples of government waste, fraud, &amp; and abuse. Americans voted for drastic government reform &amp; they deserve to be part of fixing it,' on X. Is there a connection between DOGE and Dogecoin? Cryptocurrency dogecoin has been surging in value since Trump named Musk as one of the heads of DOGE, as the acronym plays on the same word usage as the memecoin and is also the ticker symbol under which dogecoin trades. The close word association has generated increased excitement around the cryptocurrency, which Musk has promoted in the past. Dogecoin was trading at $0.4006 on Wednesday, an increase of more than 15% in the past 24 hours and 121% over the last week, reported Quartz. The cryptocurrency became associated with Musk after he played a character on 'Saturday Night Live' who went by the nickname the 'Dogefather.' He has also called it his favorite cryptocurrency. In 2022, Musk became more closely associated with dogecoin after he suggested Twitter should perhaps accept it as payment for subscriptions. He continued promoting dogecoin on various platforms, leading to its inclusion in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, the outlet reported.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musks-trump-doge-ramaswamy/	2024-11-13T11:24:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2176138679.jpg?w=900
What UAP witnesses recommend for congressional action	Join Ross Coulthart for a LIVE Q&amp;A on NewsNation’s YouTube, X and Facebook pages at 4p/3C today following a House hearing on UAPs. Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and Retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. Shellenberger will join Elizabeth Vargas Reports at 5p/4C to recap today’s hearing. Find out how to watch at JoinNN.com. (NewsNation) — The four witnesses who testified before a U.S. House of Representatives committee on unidentified anomalous phenomena, aka UFOs, all presented possible solutions as federal lawmakers search for answers about the government’s role in providing more transparency in the possible existence of UAPs. The witnesses took part in a hearing entitled 'Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,' which is part of the committee’s ongoing efforts to provide more information about what the government knew or didn’t know about UAPs. Lue Elizondo Elizondo, a former Pentagon insider, testified during the hearing that the following recommendations need to be made moving forward. Scientists hunt for signs of life beyond earth The former Pentagon official said that America’s greatness depends on three elements: a watchful Congress, a responsive executive branch and an informed public. He proposed the three principal actions: Congress and the president should create a single point of contact responsible for a whole-of-government approach to the UAP issue. He said that the White House, CIA, NASA, the Pentagon, the U.S. Department of Energy and others currently play a role, but no one seems to be in charge. This, he said, has led to unchecked power and corruption. A national UAP strategy needs to be developed to promote transparency and help restore the American public’s trust at a time when trust is at an all-time low, he said. He said the strategy should include a whole-of-government approach, including the academic and scientific communities, the private sector and international partners and allies. Congress should create a protected environment so that whistleblowers, who he said are desperate to do the right thing, can come forward without fear. Elizondo said that whistleblowers suffer because of stigma, a code of silence and concerns over forms of retaliation. He said policies and procedures should ensure protection for whistleblowers. For those who refuse to cooperate, lawmakers should wield subpoena power against hostile witnesses and prevent additional funding to those UAP efforts that remain hidden from congressional oversight. Timothy Gallaudet The retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and former acting undersecretary and assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere testified in the hearing that he wants Congress to take the following action: Establish proper oversight of the executive branch’s management of UAP programs, information and materials Pass provisions of the UAP Disclosure Act involving the UAP Records Review Board into law After the UAP Disclosure Act is passed, Congress should consider strengthening it in a future reauthorization with additional provisions to establish a whole-of-government approach to UAP. Michael Shellenberger The independent journalist, who has written extensively about 'Immaculate Constellation,' testified during Wednesday's hearing that members of Congress have expressed growing frustration since 2021 over the military and intelligence community’s refusal to reveal 'concrete' information. The ‘tic tac’ incident: Inside one of the most consequential UFO encounters of all time Congressional leaders are seeking to expand upon the UAP transparency legislation that was passed in 2023. The UAP Disclosure Act would force the military, intelligence community and any private entity to turn over recovered 'technologies of unknown origin' and associated 'biological materials' and provide all UAP records to an independent review board for potential public disclosure, he said. The legislation would also expand protections for whistleblowers and require the Government Accountability Office to review the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office's work. He added that while it is clear UAPs remain mysterious, it’s clear that the U.S. government is not being straight with the American people. He also called on Congress to work with President-elect Donald Trump to make government more transparent and release long-held secrets on everything from COVID origins to files associated with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and UAPs. Michael Gold The former NASA official testified that his former organization could assist in the process of providing more information about UAPs by doing the following: Review archival data Combat the stigmatization of UAP Reach out to international partners Solicit, archive, review and release civil and commercial UAP data 'In much as the same way that AARO is responsible for collecting UAP data for the national security community, NASA could serve a similar role for civilian and commercial operators,' Gold testified Wednesday. 'Of course, a dramatic difference would be the data collected by NASA would be open to all, and the agency would continue its historic dedication to transparency and sharing scientific discoveries with the nation and world.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/uap-witnesses-congressional-action/	2024-11-13T10:52:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/01/snapshot-2024-01-09T183232.833.jpg?w=900
Jack Smith expected to resign ahead of Trump inauguration	(The Hill) -- Special counsel Jack Smith plans to wrap up his work and resign from his post before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. Trump has boasted that he plans to fire Smith 'within two seconds' of taking office and has also made other threatening remarks about the special counsel, including that he should be arrested. The New York Times first reported the development. Smith on Friday asked for a suspension of deadlines in Trump’s election interference case, noting both the unprecedented nature of a president entering office while facing charges as well as a Justice Department (DOJ) memo barring the prosecution of a sitting president. As Smith winds down Trump cases, GOP eyes its own probes The government needs 'time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy,' the department wrote. DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) advises against the criminal prosecution of a sitting president, concluding in 1973 that 'criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.' Smith’s office declined to comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/trump-investigation/jack-smith-expected-to-resign-ahead-of-trump-inauguration/	2024-11-13T05:49:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP23213812288789-e1731505415939.jpg?w=800
Senate GOP set to vote on Mitch McConnell's replacement	(NewsNation) — Senate Republicans will elect a new leader to replace Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, stepping aside after 17 years at the top of the Senate GOP. Three candidates are vying to replace McConnell: South Dakota Sen. John Thune, Texas Sen. John Cornyn and Florida Sen. Rick Scott. The race will largely come down to who will do the most to achieve President-elect Donald Trump's agenda. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Trump is expected to meet with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill on Wednesday before meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House. It's unclear if the incoming president has a favorite for Senate majority leader. While Thune — currently the No. 2 Republican in the Senate — would appear to be the favorite in the race, staunch Trump ally Scott seems to be the front-runner. Scott — the most aggressively reform-minded candidate — has received endorsements from several MAGA figures, including Elon Musk, Tucker Carlson and Florida Republican Congressman Byron Donalds. Utah Sen. Mike Lee endorsed Scott on Tuesday, saying he believes Scott is the most closely aligned with Trump’s priorities. Scott has said he'd push the Trump agenda through Congress, including plans to allow the president-elect to make recess appointments to his cabinet. That would allow Trump to add members to his administration without Senate confirmation. The secret ballot vote is expected at 9:30 a.m. ET. This story is developing.

Trump to meet with Biden at White House	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump heads to the White House on Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden for a high-profile transition of power meeting. Biden will welcome Trump to the Oval Office at 11 a.m., a traditional part of the peaceful handoff of power and a ritual that Trump himself declined to participate in four years ago. Trump skipped Biden's inauguration in January of 2021 and Biden recently called Trump's supporters 'garbage,' which could set the stage for an awkward interaction. Bill O'Reilly: Admin picks will be Trump's 'eyes and ears,' not leaders The president-elect also planned to meet with Republicans from Congress as they focus on his Day 1 priorities and prepare for a unified government. His arrival amid GOP congressional leadership elections could put his imprint on the outcome. Ahead of the visit, House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Republicans are 'ready to deliver' on Trump’s 'America First' agenda. Planning for a peaceful transfer of power Biden has insisted that he’ll do everything he can to make the transition to the next Trump administration go smoothly. That’s despite having spent more than a year campaigning for reelection and decrying Trump as a threat to democracy and the nation’s core values. Biden then bowed out of the race in July and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him. Wednesday’s visit is more than just a courtesy call. 'They will go through the top issues — both domestic and foreign policy issues — including what is happening in Europe and Asia and the Middle East,' Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS of Wednesday’s meeting. 'And the president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things … and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these issues when he takes office.' Biden called to congratulate Trump on his victory last week and expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition, emphasizing the importance of working to bring the country together, according to the White House. DNC staffers resign with Kamala Harris campaign $20M in debt Trump's new administration Trump has been busy over the past week, announcing his picks for his next administration one after the other. He has turned to loyalists and government outsiders to shape his cabinet. Most recently, Trump tapped tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead his 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE), an initiative meant to 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. He said they'll advise the White House and work with other offices to drive large-scale reforms. Trump also nominated Fox News weekend anchor Pete Hegseth to serve as the nation's secretary of defense. Hegseth, 44, an army veteran and author, would be the second-youngest head of the Department of Defense if he's confirmed by the Senate. Others who have been nominated for Trump's administration include Susie Wiles for White House chief of staff, Stephen Miller for deputy chief of policy, Tom Homan as the new 'border czar,' New York Rep. Elise Stefanik for U.N. ambassador, Lee Zeldin for EPA administrator, Florida Rep. Mike Walz for national security adviser, Florida Rep. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem for Homeland Security secretary.

How will new Trump administration staff picks reshape the US?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump has started rapidly filling his administration, with familiar names including Susie Wiles, Tom Homan, Marco Rubio and many more potentially snagging top spots come January 2025. The plethora of Republicans joining Trump's team will serve to diversify his policies, former White House chief of staff under Trump and NewsNation contributor Mick Mulvaney told 'The Hill on NewsNation.' 'It sort of brings some balance. What have we said before? Donald Trump likes to have differing opinions. He likes loyalty,' Mulvaney said. 'But that's not the same as saying you can't have your own opinions.' Mulvaney noted that some choices — like tapped CIA Director John Ratcliffe and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz — are more 'hawkish' than Trump when it comes to policy, while others back him wholeheartedly. A diversified Cabinet could also lead to conflicting opinions about some of the United States' most important policies, despite loyalty to Trump. Bill O'Reilly: Admin will be his 'eyes and ears,' not leaders President-elect Donald Trump’s administration nominations are carefully selected to serve his centralized idea of a second term, Bill O’Reilly tells 'CUOMO.' O’Reilly adds that 'those who burned him are not going to reappear' in the White House, and true power will be among Trump’s top advisers rather than department heads. Some with true power include Wiles and Rubio, who O'Reilly says will help the 47th president make most of his political moves this term. Meanwhile, people like nominated Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, will simply monitor people Trump finds suspicious. 'It's a top-down on Trump. Trump is going to run everything, and he wants eyes and ears in all of these areas reporting back to him,' O'Reilly said. 'That's how this country is going to be run.' Elon Musk, Ramaswamy land Trump admin roles Panel says Trump Cabinet will shift foreign policy Other experts, including Michael Allen, the former national security council senior director, and Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, discussed the president-elect's choices on 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' Here's what they're saying about Trump's picks, and how it will impact America's place overseas: Middle East 'I think in the Middle East, you're going to see Netanyahu with a longer leash. I think you're going to see an Iran that ought to be more worried about enforced sanctions, particularly in their oil sector,' Allen said. Rubio, who was tapped by Trump as secretary of state, has talked extensively about America's relationship with Iran and called for harsher action to be taken. 'What everyone has looked for and has not seen for several years is peace through strength rather than accommodation,' Volker said. 'You're going to see a tougher approach on Iran, holding Iran accountable for the actions of its proxies, the Houthis, Hamas, Hezbollah.' Volker believes that, with Trump back in the White House and vocal administration officials like Florida Reps. Rubio and Mike Waltz, America will 'lay a foundation for working together with Saudi Arabia again.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

'I think after Oct. 7, all of the old structures of thinking about the Middle East, Gaza — two state solution, one state solution — all of those things have to be rethought. I don't think we can go back to where we were,' Volker said. Mulvaney said he was surprised by Huckabee's nomination, telling NewsNation's Blake Burman: 'This is a name I would not have picked out of a hat, but the Jewish-American community seems to like it very much, and that's a good sign.' Trump administration picks may limit House majority Ukraine Trump and most of his picks have said they would immediately end the war in Ukraine, despite the president-elect's friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Allen referred to Trump as 'the art of the deal' president, characterizing his foreign policy choices as more transactional than most, 'but he'll have met his match with Vladimir Putin.' 'It's very similar to what we just talked about with Iran. You have to put on the table consistent support for Ukraine that will tell Putin he's not going to get any more and it's going to get worse,' Volker said. 'Sanctions are the number one thing.' 'But we've got to convince Vladimir Putin that it is not worth it to him to try this again,' Volker added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-administration-foreign-policy/	2024-11-12T19:32:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/bill-0-11-12-color.png?w=800
Elon Musk, Ramaswamy land Trump admin roles	President-elect Trump has tapped tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead an advisory group focused on cutting federal spending and reducing the size of the government Trump announced Tuesday that Musk and Ramaswamy would lead his 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE), an initiative meant to 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. Trump said that DOGE would 'provide advice and guidance from outside of government' and partner with the White House Office of Budget and Management (OMB). Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time. Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of 'DOGE' for a very long time,' the President-elect added. It was not immediately clear whether DOGE would be an official part of the Trump administration or advise the White House from outside the government. 'To drive this kind of drastic change, the Department of Government Efficiency will provide advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management &amp; Budget to drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before.' In a statement shared by Trump, Musk said DOGE will 'send shockwaves through the system and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!' Tulsi Gabbard: ‘I’d be honored to serve’ in Trump’s cabinet The announcement of DOGE and Musk’s role in it comes after months of floating the idea and Trump’s rising alliance with the tech entrepreneur. Ramaswamy briefly ran in the Republican presidential primary before suspending his bid at the beginning of this year and backing Trump. 'I look forward to Elon and Vivek making changes to the Federal Bureaucracy with an eye on efficiency and, at the same time, making life better for all Americans. Importantly, we will drive out the massive waste and fraud which exists throughout our annual $6.5 Trillion Dollars of Government Spending. They will work together to liberate our Economy, and make the U.S. Government accountable to 'WE THE PEOPLE,' Trump wrote. The President-elect said DOGE’s work will 'conclude' no later than July 4, 2026 in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-ramaswamy-trump-doge/	2024-11-12T17:19:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24279824699291-e1731459405275.jpg?w=900
Trump to nominate Kristi Noem to lead Homeland Security	President-elect Trump on Wednesday announced he has selected South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) to lead the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). A source familiar confirmed the news earlier Tuesday to The Hill. Trump made it official in an announcement later that day. 'Kristi has been very strong on Border Security,' Trump said in a statement. 'She will work closely with 'Border Czar' Tom Homan to secure the Border, and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries.' Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Noem was previously floated as a possible running mate for Trump, but her consideration fizzled after the release of her autobiography, in which she described having killed a dog that was 'untrainable.' Instead, the Republican governor is tapped to lead the sprawling agency tasked with protecting the U.S from terror threats, securing the borders and enforcing U.S. immigration law. Trump has also tasked DHS with carrying out the 'largest deportation operation in American history.' The pick of Noem is the latest sign of Trump's intention to take a hard line on immigration policy, with an agenda he has said will represent the largest deportation in U.S. history. If confirmed, Noem would work closely with Stephen Miller, whom Trump tapped to serve as his deputy chief of staff for policy. Miller was instrumental in shaping many of Trump's toughest immigration policies in his first term. Trump also selected Tom Homan as his 'border czar,' welcoming back an early proponent of child separation under the first Trump administration who, in discussing the forthcoming Trump administration's immigration plans, recently said 'families can be deported together.' Tulsi Gabbard: ‘I’d be honored to serve’ in Trump’s cabinet Noem has little national security experience, but she did send the South Dakota National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border and has been vocal on immigration issues. 'South Dakota won't be taking any illegal immigrants that the Biden Administration wants to relocate. My message to illegal immigrants... call me when you're an American,' Noem wrote on social platform X in 2021, shortly after President Biden took office. She also supported Trump’s Muslim travel ban while serving as a member of Congress and also supported pausing some refugee screening. 'I share the President's concerns about our ability to screen refugees—especially those from terrorist hotbed areas,' Noem said in 2017. 'I support putting a temporary pause on accepting refugees from terrorist-held areas—at least until the administration can certify that asylum-seekers do not present a safety threat to the U.S.' Noem was also previously floated as a possible Interior secretary. Kamala Harris campaign now millions in debt 'I love being Governor of South Dakota, and President Trump knows that I’ll help him however I can,' Noem said at the time. Noem was a regular with Trump on the campaign trail, including at one event that turned into a music listening session after multiple medical emergencies among attendees. DHS contains a number of key public safety agencies. Beyond its immigration duties, it also contains the Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It also contains the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is tasked with helping companies prevent cyberattacks as well as attacks on physical infrastructure. The Hill has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. Brett Samuels contributed.

Trump taps Fox News host Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary	President-elect Trump on Tuesday announced he was choosing Pete Hegseth, an Army veteran and a Fox News host, to serve as Defense secretary. Hegseth served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and did tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, earning two Bronze Stars. He is currently a co-host for 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend.' 'Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice - Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,' Trump said in a statement. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The president-elect also used his statement to promote Hegseth's new book, as well as his work with veterans advocacy groups. 'Nobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our 'Peace through Strength' policy,' Trump added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-taps-fox-news-host-pete-hegseth-for-defense-secretary/	2024-11-12T16:30:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/hegseth_pete042921.jpg?w=900
Speculation swirls over Rubio's Senate successor	The impending vacancy in the Senate following President-elect Trump’s planned nomination of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R) for secretary of State is already sparking speculation about who will be his successor. If Trump goes forward with nominating Rubio as the U.S.’s top envoy, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) would be tasked with appointing a replacement for him in the upper chamber. There will then be a special election for the seat in 2026. A number of names have already been floated, including DeSantis’s chief of staff, the state’s lieutenant governor, the state’s attorney general and even Florida first lady Casey DeSantis. The move to replace Rubio could have a chain reaction in the state’s political circles as Republicans, including DeSantis, keep their own political futures in mind. 'Honestly, I just don’t see how a succession plan does not involve a DeSantis, particularly Ron DeSantis,' said one Republican strategist. On Tuesday, Capitol Hill was abuzz with a number of different names. Alabama Sen. Katie Britt (R) floated Trump’s daughter in-law and Republican National Committee co-Chair Lara Trump to fill the role. A source familiar with the matter told The Hill that DeSantis’s top aide, James Uthmeier, is favored for the position. Other candidates include Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez and state Attorney General Ashley Moody. The source added that President-elect Trump may push for his daughter-in-law for the position. One of the big questions surrounds DeSantis and what he plans to do next after his term as governor ends in 2026. While he did not clinch the Republican presidential nomination this cycle, the 46-year-old governor is still seen as a rising star within the GOP. A second presidential run is not out of the question, and the Republican strategist argued that they could see the Senate as a launching pad for DeSantis. 'You’ve got to have a perch,' the strategist said. 'Remember, people forget about you real quick.' 'What, are you going to walk out of the governor’s mansion and start running for president?' the strategist added. 'How are you going to get oxygen? Because the day after the midterms, what happens? Everyone starts running for president.' Sources who spoke to The Hill think the governor will name his own chief of staff to be a placeholder for him before 2026. If DeSantis were to appoint Uthmeier, DeSantis would have a strong loyalist in the seat until 2026, when a special election would take place. DeSantis could then theoretically run for a full term that year. There could also be a scenario where DeSantis appoints himself to the Senate seat. In order to do so, he would have to resign as governor and appoint Nunez to the governor’s mansion. Nine former governors have taken this route, including former Minnesota Gov. Wendell Anderson (D), who replaced former Vice President Walter Mondale in the upper chamber after he was elected in 1976. It could be a risky move if DeSantis follows that route. Out of the nine governors who have essentially appointed themselves to the Senate, only one won a later election. Others argue that DeSantis does not need to be in the Senate in order to launch a 2028 presidential bid, noting that the next presidential campaign will kick off right after the 2026 midterms. DeSantis launched his presidential bid in May of 2023, while former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley launched her bid in February 2023. Additionally, DeSantis would likely want to emphasize his executive role as governor of Florida. But with Trump only being able to serve one more term, it’s unclear what a 2028 Republican primary would look like with Vice President-elect JD Vance as the heir apparent. 'JD Vance may honestly be the first Republican vice president since George H. W. Bush who may actually have a credible chance at the way things are going,' the Republican strategist said. Other Republicans throw cold water on the notion that a potential Vance presidential bid would hinder other figures, like DeSantis, from launching their own bids in 2028. The speculation comes as Florida has played a central role in the second Trump transition after significant gains for the GOP in 2022 and 2024. In addition to Rubio appearing on track to be nominated for secretary of State, Trump also nominated Florida Rep. Mike Waltz (R) to serve as his national security adviser. Additionally, Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach has served as the center of the transition, with veteran Florida political operative and incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles at the reins. Meanwhile, Rubio’s colleague Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) is launching his own bid for Senate majority leader, receiving support from a number of Trump allies, including Elon Musk. 'The only thing we don’t have is a House Speaker from Florida,' the GOP strategist quipped.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/speculation-swirls-over-rubios-senate-successor/	2024-11-12T15:18:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/rubiomarco_071024gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Who is Michael Gold? Ex-NASA official to testify at UAP hearing	Join Ross Coulthart for a LIVE Q&amp;A on NewsNation's YouTube, X and Facebook pages at 4p/3C Wednesday following a House hearing on UAPs. Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA admin Michal Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and Retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. (NewsNation) — Former and current industry officials will discuss unidentified anomalous phenomena, aka UFOs, at a House of Representatives hearing Wednesday. Held by the House Oversight Committee, the hearing, titled 'Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,' will begin on the 13th at 11:30 a.m. ET Sparked by whistleblower David Grusch's claims about an alleged UFO retrieval program, the hearing will feature testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. NewsNation has spoken exclusively to three of the four. Who is Michael Gold? Gold is NASA's former associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the organization's independent UAP study team. He's also worked in the private sector as an executive at the now-defunct Bigelow Aerospace, headed by Robert Bigelow. Currently, he works as chief growth officer at Redwire, an American aerospace manufacturer and serves as treasurer for the Commercial Spaceflight Federation. He was awarded NASA’s Outstanding Leadership Medal in 2021. UFO House Hearing: What witnesses plan to say Why is Michael Gold testifying at UAP hearing? As a member of NASA's independent UAP study team and the aerospace community's commercial sector, Gold has a stake in the UFO game. According to testimony published the day before the hearing, Gold is expected to urge cooperation between NASA and those investigating UAPs in order to 'combat the stigmatization' of the research. What could Michael Gold say Wednesday? Gold's testimony is expected to focus on NASA's ability to aid in UAP research. 'I believe NASA would be effective in collecting and disseminating data on UAP due toits successful track record of collating information on aviation safety issues,' his testimony reads in part.

John Ratcliffe chosen as Trump’s pick to lead CIA	President-elect Trump announced Tuesday that he will nominate John Ratcliffe, his former head of intelligence, to lead the CIA. Ratcliffe, a former Texas representative, was critical of investigations into Trump while in Congress and later served as a member of his impeachment team during Democrats’ first effort to boot Trump from office. A statement from Trump praises Ratcliffe for 'exposing fake Russian collusion to be a Clinton campaign operation,' being a critic of a national security program that greenlights foreign surveillance, and for criticizing those who first called into question the legitimacy of a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden. 'John Ratcliffe has always been a warrior for Truth and Honesty with the American Public,' Trump said in a statement.' 'I look forward to John being the first person ever to serve in both of our Nation’s highest Intelligence positions. He will be a fearless fighter for the Constitutional Rights of all Americans, while ensuring the Highest Levels of National Security, and PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.' Ratcliffe served as one of Trump’s Directors of National Intelligence, but faced a rocky path to the position. Trump in 2019 withdrew his nomination after pushback over concerns that Ratcliffe did not have a sufficient security background or relevant experience to lead an office that coordinates all U.S. intelligence agencies. He also faced questions over whether he had embellished his experience working terrorism cases as a former prosecutor on his resume. 'Our great Republican Congressman John Ratcliffe is being treated very unfairly by the LameStream Media,' Trump wrote at the time. Trump nominated him again just a few months later, prompting backlash from Democrats. Then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called him a 'highly partisan operative' while then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) complained he 'has shown an unacceptable embrace of conspiracy theories.' He was ultimately confirmed in a party-line 49-44 vote. Ratcliffe was a regular critic of the FBI and Justice Department before entering the intelligence community. Trump’s nod to Ratcliffe’s position on foreign surveillance, governed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), comes after the then-lawmaker was a vocal critic of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation into Trump, including the FBI’s flawed process for securing a warrant to wiretap Carter Page. On Tuesday, Trump credited Ratcliffe with 'catching the FBI’s abuse of Civil Liberties at the FISA Court.'

UFO House Hearing: What witnesses plan to say	Join Ross Coulthart for a LIVE Q&amp;A on NewsNation’s YouTube, X and Facebook pages at 4p/3C Wednesday following a House hearing on UAPs. Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and Retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. (NewsNation) — At a House of Representatives committee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena Wednesday, lawmakers will hear from a number of witnesses about what they have seen and heard about UFOs. Held by the House Oversight Committee, the hearing, titled 'Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,' will begin at 11:30 a.m. ET. Luis Elizondo, a former Pentagon insider, veteran and investigator; retired Navy Rear Adm. Timothy Gallaudet; journalist Michael Shellenberger and Michael Gold, a former NASA administrator, are scheduled to give their testimony. This hearing is the first since the summer of 2023, which was sparked by career intelligence official David Grusch's allegations that the Pentagon has been operating a secret UFO retrieval program. 'If the UFO hearings catch on with the public, we could be in for quite a ride,' Bryce Zabel, UFO author and cohost of the podcast 'Need to Know' with Ross Coulthart, told NewsNation. 'Back in 1973, all of America was riveted to the Senate Watergate hearings, and the cover-up Nixon orchestrated will seem small compared to the one that would have been necessary to hide the truth about alien contact for nearly eight decades now.' ‘We’re gonna learn some things’ about UFOs: Rep. Tim Burchett What will UAP witnesses say at hearing? Elizondo's book 'Imminent: Inside the Pentagon’s Hunt for UFOs' alleges that the United States military has been running a UAP retrieval and reverse engineering program for years, even recovering nonhuman specimens. 'Let me be clear: UAP are real. Advanced technologies not made by our Government – or any other government – are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe,' Elizondo will say, according to testimony published the day before the hearing. He will talk about what actions the government should be taking regarding the UAP issue. Gallaudet, in his testimony, plans to repeat a claim he's made before to NewsNation: that an email that contained what is known as the 'Go Fast' video, disappeared from his and his colleagues' email servers. 'Go Fast' shows a fighter pilot’s encounter with a UAP. Shellenberger will detail his reporting on the alleged 'Immaculate Constellation' secret government program. A whistleblower revealed the alleged UFO program, in which the Pentagon collects and quarantines information on UFO sightings, Shellenberger says. Department of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough has previously denied records of the program. The 'tic tac' incident: What we know about the UFO encounter Shellenberger will highlight the need for Congress and the White House to address UFOs. Michael Gold, a former NASA administrator, will outline new ways for NASA to be helpful on the UAP issue. Currently Chief Growth Office at Redwire Space, Gold stresses in his testimony that he is speaking on his own behalf, and not for any other organization. 'Agencies such as NASA have much to offer when it comes to understanding UAP,' Gold's prepared testimony reads. UFO Whistleblower Sparks Conversation Much of the current conversation surrounding UFOs started when Grusch came forward last year with his claims that the government was operating a secret program dedicated to retrieving crashed UAPs and was in possession of nonhuman craft and biological remains of nonhuman beings. The Defense Department has denied these allegations. Still, they sparked the 2023 congressional hearing on the subject — the first in more than 50 years —where Grusch testified with former Navy pilot Ryan Graves and Navy Commander David Fravor. Fravor talked about his experience encountering a UAP. Both Graves and Fravor said they were concerned about the risks UAPs pose to the military, regardless of origin. Netflix faces lawsuit over ‘The Manhattan Alien Abduction’ Lawmakers asked about the secret program referenced by Grusch, and eventually, the hearing led to the formation of a bipartisan UFO Caucus, informally led by Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. An official report issued by the Pentagon from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office found no evidence of a secret program. Furthermore, it said the government has no evidence that UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin. However, the Department of Defense did admit to a proposed program known as Kona Blue, which was developed to reverse-engineer any alien technology recovered by the government. This never got off the ground, the DOD said, as no such technology was ever located. NASA, in a report of its own, said there's no evidence for extraterrestrial contact with Earth, though the agency said there needs to be more rigorous research in the area and less stigma around the topic as a whole.

What is Donald Trump's position on UFOs?	Join Ross Coulthart for a LIVE Q&amp;A at 4p/3c this Wednesday following a House hearing on UAPs. Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. NewsNation has talked exclusively with three of the four witnesses. (NewsNation) — Lawmakers are holding a new public hearing on UFOs on the heels of the election of President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he supports UFO disclosure. Trump has said he supports transparency on the subject of UFOs but has not necessarily expressed deep interest in the subject. Wednesday's hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) comes as a bipartisan group of lawmakers has pushed for answers in the wake of whistleblower allegations the Pentagon is operating a secret UFO retrieval program. What we know about UFOs from whistleblowers to secret programs UFO whistleblower allegations Former Air Force intelligence officer David Grusch came forward last year with allegations about such a program and suggested the government may even have the remains of nonhuman entities. Following Grusch's revelations, others have come forward with similar allegations, including former Pentagon employee Lue Elizondo and former Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet. Recently, independent journalist Michael Shellenberger revealed another whistleblower report, which he claims documents a program called 'Immaculate Constellation' that collected intelligence information on UAPs. It is the first time any whistleblower has ever given a specific name to a program. Pentagon denies secret UAP programs The Pentagon has responded with denials of any programs and said there is no evidence UAPs are extraterrestrial in nature. A report from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates UAP reports for the Defense Department, said most UAP sightings were misidentifications of drones, natural phenomena or classified technology. Close encounters: America’s UFO fascination The agency did admit to plans for the Kona Blue program, which would have reverse-engineered UAP technology. However, the program was never put into practice because no such technology has ever been recovered. NASA also issued a report saying there was no evidence so far to support extraterrestrial involvement, though the agency also called for the destigmatization of the subject and stronger data collection on UAPs. Presidential interest in UFOs Presidential interest in UFOs is not a new concept. In 1948, following a wave of sightings, including the famous 1947 Roswell incident, President Harry Truman pushed for more investigation into UFO sightings, though his concern was likely as motivated by the arms race of the Cold War as interest in alien contact. At least one president has had an even closer encounter with unexplained objects. President Jimmy Carter observed something unidentifiable in the sky one night in 1969. Carter documented the incident just before he ran for president. Most dismissed the sightings, and Carter himself did not necessarily believe the object was alien. In 2016, a researcher explained the sighting as a barium cloud from a high-altitude rocket. Did the government confirm aliens exist? President Ronald Reagan also had an unexplained encounter with an object spotted trailing his plane in 1974. He would go on to ask the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, if the country would support the U.S. in the event of an attack from outer space. Will Trump bring transparency on UAPs? Of course, a president can only be transparent if they are aware of what is going on. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have all admitted to being briefed on the subject of UFOs. Clinton and Obama had specifically expressed interest in the topic and requested information on alleged recovered UFOs or aliens that some insist the government possesses. Later, they would say there was no evidence to support the decadeslong rumors. 'Multiple presidents have promised over many, many decades to get to the bottom of the UAP mystery, and all of them have failed miserably,' said NewsNation's Ross Coulthart. The ‘tic tac’ incident: Inside one of the most consequential UFO encounters of all time There is a chance those presidents were withholding information because of national security concerns. However, some have suggested the presidents themselves were lied to by officials intent on maintaining the secrecy of any information or technology the U.S. has on UAPs. In one conversation with his son, Donald Trump Jr., Trump suggested that he did have knowledge about UFOs supposedly recovered from Roswell in 1947 but declined to share what he knew. It's possible Trump would not be given full information on UFOs, particularly given his history in handling classified information and fears he would breach national security. 'We should take what former President Donald Trump is saying with a grain of salt,' Coulthart said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/trump-position-ufos/	2024-11-12T14:14:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24303574162285.jpg?w=900
Conservatives plot challenge against Johnson in internal Speaker ...	Hard-line conservatives are plotting to challenge Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) for the gavel during Wednesday’s internal House GOP elections, four sources familiar with the matter told The Hill. The sources — who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive internal deliberations — said the conservatives are planning to nominate an alternative candidate to Johnson for Speaker during Wednesday’s internal GOP elections. The sources said they are still discussing whom to nominate, and one source cautioned that the opposition could fall apart. 'There will be a nomination,' one of the sources said. The intent is to show opposition within the House GOP to Johnson’s bid to continue as Speaker, one of the sources said. The House GOP is set to consider Johnson for Speaker during internal GOP elections on Wednesday. Johnson has been bullish on his chances of retaining the gavel, especially with President-elect Trump — who has spoken highly of him in the past — on his way to the White House. On Tuesday, Johnson said he is confident that he will win the gavel on the first ballot in January. 'I am [confident]. I’m talking with everyone,' he said. 'I think you’ll have total unity in the party.' Johnson must only win a majority vote in the internal elections. On the floor, when Democrats would be expected to vote for their own Speaker, he would have less leeway and would only be able to afford a few defections. Decision Desk HQ projected Monday night that the House GOP would retain its majority. Its margin is expected to be very narrow, with Johnson perhaps only able to afford a handful, assuming Democrats are united. The Speaker does face some resistance in his conference. During an interview on Fox News over the weekend, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said there are 'a lot of Republicans' who are concerned with Johnson’s leadership effort. 'Mike Johnson is going to have to demonstrate that he can corral this Republican conference to deliver for the American people and deliver for President Trump. That needs to happen over the next several weeks,' Roy said. 'And I’m gonna be sitting down with Mike this week, sitting down with other members of the conference, but we have no choice but to deliver.' 'We’ve got to deliver, no more excuses. That’s what I want to hear out of the Speaker. But he’s got a lot of Republicans who are still concerned,' he added. 'We’ve got to figure out how to get everybody on the same page.' Johnson faced an ouster threat in May — led by Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) — which failed overwhelmingly after Democrats and Republicans joined forces to kill the effort. A total of 11 GOP lawmakers, however, voted against tabling the measure, a sign of some resistance to the Speaker’s leadership. Those talking about backing an alternative to Johnson likened the situation to what occurred in November 2022, when Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) challenged then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for the Speakership nomination. That effort failed but highlighted opposition to McCarthy’s leadership, and foreshadowed his later struggles to officially secure the gavel and his eventual ouster. The final vote was 188-31, and McCarthy went on to face opposition on the House floor in January, which forced the Speaker race to run for 15 rounds over several days.

What is the Pentagon's alleged 'Immaculate Constellation' program...	Join Ross Coulthart for a LIVE Q&amp;A on NewsNation’s YouTube, X and Facebook pages at 4p/3C today following a House hearing on UAPs. Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and Retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. Shellenberger will join Elizabeth Vargas Reports at 5p/4C to recap today’s hearing. Find out how to watch at JoinNN.com. (NewsNation) — Independent journalist Michael Shellenberger told NewsNation a whistleblower has revealed the existence of an alleged Pentagon UFO program called 'Immaculate Constellation.' Shellenberger told NewsNation's Ross Coulthart about the whistleblower report, which comes on the heels of similar allegations from former Air Force intelligence officer David Grusch and former Pentagon employee Lue Elizondo. Here's what we know about the program so far. What is 'Immaculate Constellation'? According to the whistleblower, the Pentagon program collects and quarantines information on UFO (also commonly known today as 'UAPs,' or 'unidentified anomalous phenomena') sightings and encounters. The program allegedly includes information from different types of intelligence, including high-quality image intelligence and measure and signature intelligence. What is Donald Trump’s position on UFOs? Who is the whistleblower? Shellenberger did not reveal the whistleblower's precise role or whether they were employed as a Defense Department employee or as a contractor. He did tell NewsNation that he met with the whistleblower and verified their credentials and also independently confirmed the existence of the program with unrelated sources. How was the program discovered? According to Shellenberger, the whistleblower discovered the program by accident after stumbling upon a database containing UFO information. What kind of UAP incidents were described in the report? In one encounter reportedly detailed by the whistleblower, a group of orbs surrounded an F-22 and forced it out of its designated patrol area.

Has the Pentagon responded to the allegations? Department of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough denied records of the alleged program in a statement to NewsNation Tuesday evening. 'The Department of Defense has no record, present or historical, of any type of SAP called ‘IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION,'' she wrote. Has the Pentagon acknowledged any UAP programs? The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is a publicly-known Pentagon program that collects and investigates reports of UAPs. In a report, AARO denied any evidence that UAPs are alien in nature. The report did acknowledge the existence of the Kona Blue program, which was intended to reverse-engineer any recovered UAP technology. The report said the program never went into effect because no such technology was ever recovered. What's next for UAP disclosure? A bipartisan group of lawmakers has already pushed for more disclosures around UAPs. While nothing specific has been announced in relation to this report, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., has announced plans for a UAP hearing held by the Senate Armed Services Committee following the election, and Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., announced plans for a UAP hearing in the House set for Nov. 13.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/what-is-immaculate-constellation/	2024-11-12T13:40:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/02/AP21154653187711-e1709218226777.jpg?w=800
Trump picks Mike Huckabee as US ambassador to Israel	President-elect Trump announced Tuesday he will nominate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) to serve as ambassador to Israel, a major diplomatic role that will take on added importance amid heightened tensions in the Middle East. 'Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years,' Trump said in a statement. 'He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!' For over a year, Israel has carried out war against Hamas following the terrorist group's attacks in October 2023 that killed more than 1,000 Israeli citizens. Trump has urged Israel to 'finish the problem,' even as he has been critical of how it has carried out its military campaign. Tensions have also been on the rise between Israel and Hezbollah, the militant group with a major presence in Lebanon. Huckabee served as governor of Arkansas from 1996-2007, winning two full terms after taking over for then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker (R), who resigned. He ran unsuccessful presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2016. Huckabee has sometimes weighed in on the current war in Gaza, telling NewsNation in June that he did not see a reason to support an Israel-Hamas cease-fire, maintaining that the terrorist group should not be negotiated with and that the only way to end the war was their complete surrender. The former governor has not held a diplomatic post previously. His nomination, which will require confirmation by the Senate, comes as Trump will face pressure to quell tensions in the Middle East. He was reportedly offered the role of ambassador to Israel during Trump's first term in office, though he denied those reports. He did not serve in the first Trump administration, though his daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, did a stint as Trump's White House press secretary. Trump's ambassador to Israel during his first term was David Friedman, who worked on brokering the Abraham Accords to normalize relations between Israel and Arab nations.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-picks-mike-huckabee-as-us-ambassador-to-israel/	2024-11-12T11:12:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1175377257-2-e1721419621962.jpg?w=900
Judge delays ruling on whether to scrap Trump's conviction in hus...	NEW YORK (AP) — A judge postponed a decision on whether to undo President-elect Donald Trump’s conviction in his hush money case, after his lawyers called for freezing and ultimately dismissing the case so he can run the country. New York Judge Juan M. Merchan had been set to rule Tuesday on their earlier request to throw out his conviction because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling this summer on presidential immunity. Instead, he told Trump's lawyers Tuesday he'd delay the ruling until Nov. 19. According to emails filed in court, Trump lawyer Emil Bove asked for the delay over the weekend, arguing that putting the case on hold — and then ending it altogether — is 'necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.' Prosecutors agreed to the delay. Trump won back the White House a week ago but the legal question concerns the Republican's status as a past president, not an impending one. A jury convicted Trump in May of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in 2016. The payout was to buy her silence about claims that she had sex with Trump. He says they didn’t, denies any wrongdoing and maintains the prosecution was a political tactic meant to harm his latest campaign. Just over a month after the verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that ex-presidents can’t be prosecuted for actions they took in the course of running the country, and prosecutors can’t cite those actions even to bolster a case centered on purely personal conduct. Trump’s lawyers cited the ruling to argue that the hush money jury got some evidence it shouldn't have, such as Trump’s presidential financial disclosure form and testimony from some White House aides. Prosecutors disagreed and said the evidence in question was only 'a sliver' of their case. Trump's criminal conviction was a first for any ex-president. It left the 78-year-old facing the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison. The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his personal attorney for the Daniels payment. The lawyer, Michael Cohen, fronted the money. He later recouped it through a series of payments that Trump’s company logged as legal expenses. Trump, by then in the White House, signed most of the checks himself. Prosecutors said the designation was meant to cloak the true purpose of the payments and help cover up a broader effort to keep voters from hearing unflattering claims about the Republican during his first campaign. Trump said that Cohen was legitimately paid for legal services, and that Daniels’ story was suppressed to avoid embarrassing Trump’s family, not to influence the electorate. Trump was a private citizen — campaigning for president, but neither elected nor sworn in — when Cohen paid Daniels in October 2016. He was president when Cohen was reimbursed, and Cohen testified that they discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office. Trump has been fighting for months to overturn the verdict and could now seek to leverage his status as president-elect. Although he was tried as a private citizen, his forthcoming return to the White House could propel a court to step in and avoid the unprecedented spectacle of sentencing a former and future president. While urging Merchan to nix the conviction, Trump also has been trying to move the case to federal court. Before the election, a federal judge repeatedly said no to the move, but Trump has appealed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/trump-investigation/ap-judge-set-to-rule-on-whether-to-scrap-trumps-conviction-in-hush-money-case/	2024-11-12T07:09:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673370293fadb2.00180565.jpeg?w=900
Trump administration picks may limit House majority	(NewsNation) — The GOP has resumed control over the House, which added to the list of political wins for Republicans. However, that could change depending on the president-elect's administration picks. Almost a full week after Election Day, NewsNation's partners at Decision Desk HQ made a pair of critical calls in House races, officially declaring Republican Gabe Evans the winner in Colorado’s 8th District. Just hours later, the race for Arizona's 6th District was called in favor of incumbent Rep. Juan Ciscomani. Those two race wins for Republicans were enough for the party to claim the House majority and complete control of the federal government — at least for now. 2024 Election results Trump's cabinet could impact majority As it stands right now, at least three of President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet picks impact the GOP majority in the Senate and in the House. Trump's choices of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as secretary of state, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., as UN ambassador and Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., for national security advisor will leave immediate openings on Capitol Hill for Republicans. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would appoint a replacement for Rubio until a special election can be held during the 2026 midterms. However, voters will elect replacements for Stefanik and Waltz. Americans should not expect a dramatic change in the balance of power with both lawmakers having handily won re-election. Stefanik won by nearly 25% and Waltz won by more than 30%. The timing of these appointments and when their replacements get sworn in could mean a slimmer majority in the House for Republicans, which could make it tough for the House speaker to navigate between meeting demands from moderates and hardliners. Allan Lichtman explains why he didn’t predict Donald Trump’s win Race for leadership roles in Congress Plus, there's been some rumblings about a potential challenge to House Speaker Mike Johnson. However, the race getting the most attention right now involves the next Senate majority leader. For the first time in nearly two decades, Sen. Mitch McConnell is stepping down from the role. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla.; Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas; and Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., are all vying for the position. Florida Rep. Byron Donalds told NewsNation why he believes Scott is the best candidate for the role. 'He's going to work tenaciously every single day, use every piece of the rule structure here in the Senate to accomplish an agenda for the American people. That matters more than any one senator or any one member of Congress to be frank with you. Number two, look, no disrespect to the two Johns, but they've been at this for quite some time. We might need some fresh blood here in the senate to lead the senate forward,' Donalds said. Trump has not endorsed a candidate for Senate majority leader yet, but that could change.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-administration-picks-limit-house-majority/	2024-11-12T04:55:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2183214745-1.jpg?w=900
Trump transition 'already breaking the law': Senator Warren	(The Hill) - Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said on Monday that President elect-Trump 'and his transition team are already breaking' a law on presidential transition. 'Donald Trump and his transition team are already breaking the law,' Warren said in a post on the social platform X. 'I would know because I wrote the law. Incoming presidents are required to prevent conflicts of interest and sign an ethics agreement.' 'This is what illegal corruption looks like,' she added. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks to reporters as she arrives to the Capitol for a procedural vote regarding a judicial nomination on Wednesday, September 11, 2024. (Greg Nash/The Hill) Warren was responding to a report from CNN on Saturday that said a conflict of interest pledge included in the Presidential Transition Act was, in part, keeping multiple transition agreements from being submitted by president-elect's team to the Biden administration. The Presidential Transition Act instructs candidates from major parties to join in memorandums of understanding (MOU) with the current president as well as the General Services Administration (GSA) so staff may get their hands on relevant resources like facilities, documents, executive branch employees and national security information in the period between the election and the inauguration. Those agreements also feature an ethics plan. Last month, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), raised concerns in a letter to Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance over their campaign’s failure to go into presidential transition agreements with the federal government. Raskin warned that the hold up could have an unfavorable impact on the transfer of power in the upcoming year. 'Breaking the precedent set by every other presidential candidate since 2010, you have rejected these resources and refused to commit to a smooth transition,' Raskin wrote. 'Your actions depart from well-established norms of the federal government and demonstrate a spectacular disregard for the successful continuation of the essential institutions of American democratic government,' he added. The Hill has reached out to a spokesperson for Trump, the White House and the GSA for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-transition-already-breaking-the-law-senator-warren/	2024-11-12T04:55:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/warrenelizabeth_091124gn01_w-e1731408767919.jpg?w=900
DNC staffers resign with Kamala Harris campaign $20M in debt	(NewsNation) — Following the vice president’s Election Day loss, the Kamala Harris campaign is now $20 million in debt, per a source familiar with the campaign. Lindy Li, a member of the DNC finance committee, tells NewsNation’s Rich McHugh the internal strife and monetary confusion at the center of the party have led some staffers to leave altogether. Li says she helped raise millions for the campaign, much of which went to digital media, polling, advertising and travel. She says she was told this was an 'eminently winnable race,' but she says it wasn't. 'We lost all the swing states. We lost in every county in America,' Li said. 'This is just astounding. This is not some like blip. This is an avalanche.' Republican former President Donald Trump won the 2024 race with 312 electoral votes. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Kamala Harris campaign’s $20 million debt A source familiar with the campaign confirmed to NewsNation that the campaign is $20 million in the hole after Nov. 5, even though the campaign took in at least $1 billion and reported $118 million in the bank as of Oct. 16. Li, on behalf of confused voters and disappointed donors, has been speaking out about the party's financial woes. 'It's been tumultuous, to say the least, but I'm so glad I did, because if we don't correctly diagnose the problem, we're never going to change,' Li said. 'If we don't make drastic changes to the party, there are a number of things, not only on the finance side, but also if we don't recognize that America is fundamentally shifting to the right, we're going to keep losing.' Party leadership in the Democratic National Committee is 'absolutely in turmoil,' Li says. 'People are stepping down,' Li said. 'And there are going to be elections.' Asked about DNC leadership, Li said: 'Almost everyone's going to be gone.' Li believes the Democratic Party needs a 'postmortem' to assess its problems rather than relying on election fraud narratives that have circulated on social media in the days since Trump’s victory. 'This wasn't a loss. This was a shellacking,' Li said. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

'She was handed this,' Li said. 'She did the best she could under the circumstances. She had 107 days. I love her; maybe she's upset with me. I love her.' Harris is a good person, Li said. However, 'the way that the campaign was run and the way that the finances were handled — it left much to be desired,' Li added. 'Top donors have not gotten any sort of briefing or an apology or any sort of explanation as to where our money went,' Li said. 'We haven't gotten any sort of follow-up other than her concession speech. Does that count?' Former staffers who have called Li for help say they have not gotten paid for work done from August. Campaign debts The Harris campaign can still raise money to recoup some of these debts and pay those who still need it. According to the Federal Election Commission, some House and Senate campaigns end with outstanding debts, such as those owed to campaign vendors. Roll Call, in March 2023, reported that 18 members of the House and Senate started the year with campaign committees with at least $100,000 in unpaid bills. Republicans win control of the US House of Representatives Campaigns must report these debts, the FEC said, and when raising funds to retire them, certain rules must be followed. These rules include one stating that contributions designated for a particular election cannot exceed the campaign’s net outstanding debt. Donald Trump weighs in on Kamala Harris campaign debt Trump seized on reports about the Harris campaign being in debt on X. 'I am very surprised that the Democrats, who fought a hard and valiant fight in the 2020 Presidential Election, raising a record amount of money, didn’t have lots of $’s left over,' Trump said. Trump went on to say that the campaign is 'being squeezed by vendors and others.' 'Whatever we can do to help them during this difficult period, I would strongly recommend we, as a Party and for the sake of desperately needed UNITY, do,' Trump wrote. 'We have a lot of money left over in that our biggest asset in the campaign was 'Earned Media,' and that doesn’t cost very much.'

(NewsNation) — With 49.3% of the vote, NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ has called the race for Arizona’s District 6 seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in favor of Juan Ciscomani. See the results of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate races around the nation here. Incumbent Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani sought a second term after being elected in 2022 as the first naturalized American citizen from Mexico ever to be elected to Congress from Arizona. Since being elected, Ciscomani has served on the House Appropriations Committee and has focused on fiscal responsibility. He was challenged by Democrat Kirsten Engel, who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. Engel lost the 2022 U.S. House race to Ciscomani by less than 5,300 votes. She previously served in the Arizona state legislature before resigning in 2021 to seek election to the U.S. House. Engel is also a professor at the University of Arizona’s School of Law. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. During the lead to Tuesday’s election, Ciscomani and Engel clashed on several issues, including abortion, which was among the ballot initiatives facing voters in Arizona. Engel supports a woman’s right to make decisions about her reproductive health and said that there should be no 'artificial time limits' when it comes to ending a pregnancy. Arizona’s law bans abortion after 15 weeks. Ciscomani said that he supported the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade and agreed with former President Donald Trump that abortion should be an issue decided at the state level. He said that he rejects the idea of a federal abortion ban and that he trusts women, cherishes life and rejects 'the extremes' when it comes to abortion.

During his first term, Ciscomani focused largely on immigration and border security and supported building a border wall. Heading into Tuesday’s election, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives were up for election. Republicans control the chamber with a narrow majority of 220 seats, while the Democrats occupy 212 with three vacancies.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/juan-ciscomani-projected-to-win-arizona-congressional-district-6-race/	2024-11-11T16:15:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Thumb-Arizona-Juan-Ciscomani.jpg?w=900
Republicans win control of the US House of Representatives	(NewsNation) —The Republicans have won control of the U.S. House of Representatives after the party took 218 seats in national elections, NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ called. Click on the map to see results from your state. All 435 House seats were up for reelection leaving the chamber’s balance of power up for grabs. House members are elected to two-year terms. Going into the election, the GOP had a narrow majority in the House with 220 seats over the Democrats, who held 212, and three seats being vacant prior to Tuesday’s election. In taking the House, Republicans have solidified total control of Congress and the White House, which will create a smoother path for the GOP to lay down its platform. How often does the US see a unified government? Republicans took back the House by a slim margin during the 2022 midterm elections, flipping key seats in Washington, New York and California. In 15 House races in 2022, winners came out on top by fewer than 2 percentage points over their opponents, and this year, seven of those races were rematches between incumbents and the same challengers. In California’s 13th District, Republican freshman Rep. John Duarte faced Democratic challenger Adam Gray once again, while in the state’s 22nd District, Republican Rep. David Valadao and former California Assemblyman Rudy Salas also met in a rematch. While there were hundreds of races, just a tenth were deemed 'competitive' by the Cook Political Report. Twenty-five were considered toss-ups, and 18 races were rated as either leaning Democratic or leaning Republican. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Much of the lack of competition has been attributed to redistricting that took effect this year. Five states changed their congressional district lines since the 2022 midterm elections. Alabama, Louisiana and Georgia were mandated to redraw their lines by federal courts, which found that the old lines violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965. North Carolina and New York had their old maps thrown out by their state supreme courts, which allowed each state legislature to redraw the lines. Republican Rep. Barry Moore left Alabama’s 2nd District to run in the 1st District to give himself a better shot at reelection. In Louisiana, freshman Democrat Rep. Don Davis was challenged by Republican and retired Army Col. Laurie Buckhout in the 1st District, which was redrawn in hopes of giving Republicans a better chance of winning.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/house-balance-of-power-2024-republicans/	2024-11-11T16:15:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/HOUSE-THUMBNAIL-1.png?w=900
Trump 'border czar' says administration will conduct workplace im...	(The Hill) – Incoming 'border czar' Tom Homan said Monday that President-elect Trump's administration will crank up workplace raids as part of its broader immigration crackdown. Speaking on 'Fox &amp; Friends,' the former director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said workplace raids would address labor and sex trafficking. 'Where do we find most victims of sex trafficking and forced labor trafficking? At worksites,' Homan told Steve Doocy. Who is Trump’s new border czar Tom Homan? But advocates say that approach is unlikely to help combat trafficking. 'He’s conflating the traffickers with the people being trafficked,' said Heidi Altman, director of federal advocacy at the National Immigration Law Center. 'Tom Homan is skilled at using public safety rhetoric to justify vicious tactics that tear families apart.' Homan, an early proponent of the 'zero tolerance' policy that separated more than 4,000 children from their parents in the first Trump administration, said he will prioritize 'public safety threats and national security threats' for deportation as border czar. But Homan said foreign nationals with orders of deportation 'became a fugitive,' suggesting immigrants without criminal records but with final orders of deportation would be high on the list of deportation priorities. Homan told Doocy that the Biden administration 'has lost over 300,000 children that were smuggled in this country by criminal cartels,' a reference to a debunked campaign claim voiced both by Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance regarding a report published by the Homeland Security Office of Inspector General in August. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? According to the report, 291,000 unaccompanied children had not received a notice to appear in court as of May 2024, and a further 32,000 received a notice but did not appear. Those figures related to nearly 450,000 unaccompanied children released by ICE to the Department of Health and Human Services between October 2018 and September 2023, meaning a number of them were released by the first Trump administration. 'This is not a ‘missing kids’ problem; it’s a ‘missing paperwork’ problem,' Jonathan Beier, associate director of research and evaluation for the Acacia Center for Justice’s Unaccompanied Children Program, told The Associated Press in October.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/trump-border-czar-workplace-immigration-raids/	2024-11-11T15:49:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP18080757487453.jpg?w=900

See the results of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate races across the country here. In one of a host of congressional races that could determine control of the U.S. House, Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo was looking to secure the seat against Republican challenger Gabe Evans. Caraveo entered the race seeking a second term after winning the seat in 2022 against Republican Barbara Kirkmeyer. Evans, a former police officer and veteran of the U.S. Army and Colorado National Guard, was seeking the congressional seat after serving one term in the Colorado House of Representatives. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Evans received endorsements from former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson given his chance to flip a seat for the Republicans. The race was pegged by the Cook Political Report as the lone toss-up in Colorado’s congressional representation. District 8, which is the state’s newest drawn district, covers a large swath of north Central Colorado and is heavily Hispanic. Caraveo, a physician, was attacked from both sides during her push for a second term in Washington.

Donald Trump's new administration: Who has he chosen so far?	(NewsNation) — Republican President-elect Donald Trump has made several announcements in the last 24 hours about the members of his new administration. On Sunday, Trump posted that former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Tom Homan would be joining as the 'border czar,' and the next day, he said his former adviser, Stephen Miller, would be deputy chief of policy. Trump is set to meet Wednesday with President Joe Biden at the White House to discuss the transition of power.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Sen. JD Vance was chosen to be Trump’s running mate in July, with Trump announcing him as the Republican National Convention kicked off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Republican from Ohio gained national prominence through his bestselling memoir, 'Hillbilly Elegy.' During his time in the Senate, Vance, who was once one of Trump's biggest critics, later became one of the fiercest defenders of Trump’s 'Make America Great Again' agenda, especially when it comes to foreign policy, trade and immigration. In 2021, he secured Trump’s endorsement during the Senate primary to fill the vacancy left by retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman. Vance then won the general Senate race against Democratic candidate Tim Ryan and took office in January 2023.

Wiles will be the first woman to be a White House chief of staff. Since her start as a scheduler for Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign, she's also worked for Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. She is the daughter of the late NFL player turned broadcaster Pat Summerall.

'Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.'

A senior adviser in Trump's first term who crafted many of the president-elect's speeches, The Associated Press reports Miller's been a central figure in many of his policy decisions, including the move to separate thousands of immigrant families as a deterrence program in 2018. After Trump left office, Miller became president of America First Legal, which the AP says was fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union that challenged the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others. Tom Homan, 'border czar' Homan will be charged with overseeing the United States' borders.(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Homan, as 'border czar,' is expected to make deportation a top priority. At the Republican National Convention, he said that he had a message to the 'millions' of undocumented migrants in the country: 'You better start packing now.' As acting director of ICE from January 2017 through June 2018, Homan backed Trump's zero tolerance policy at the border in his first term, which resulted in thousands of families being separated at the southern border. He's previously said that workplace raids would resume in the Trump administration. Before joining ICE, Homan was a police officer in West Carthage, New York, and later had positions as a Border Patrol agent, investigator and supervisor. Former Democratic President Barack Obama appointed Homan to be the executive associate director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2013. Homan retired as acting ICE director in 2018 and joined the Heritage Foundation, where he contributed to its Project 2025.

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., Trump's pick for ambassador to the United Nations, was elected to the House of Representatives at the age of 30 in 2014, making her the youngest woman elected to Congress in United States history at the time. She currently serves as chair of the House Republican Conference, a position she was chosen for when former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from the post after publicly criticizing Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election. 'I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,' Trump said in a statement. 'Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.' Stefanik said she had a conversation with Trump where she told him 'how deeply humbled' she was to accept the nomination. 'I stand ready to advance President Donald J. Trump’s restoration of America First peace through strength leadership on the world stage on Day One at the United Nations,' Stefanik said on X Monday.

From 2015 to 2023, he served New York’s 1st Congressional District as a U.S. representative, and he ran for governor of the state in 2022, losing to current Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. Zeldin was on active duty in the United States Army for four years and is currently a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve. 'Lee, with a very strong legal background, has been a true fighter for America First policies,' Trump said in a statement. 'He will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet.' Zeldin said on X that 'it is an honor' to join the administration. 'We will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI,' Zeldin said. 'We will do so while protecting access to clean air and water.' What to know about Trump’s inauguration Who won't be on Trump's team As he's been talking about who will be in his next administration, Trump has also highlighted who won't be. One of them is former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who held the role of ambassador to the United Nations during Trump's first term, and the other is former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. In a tweet, Trump said he won't be inviting them back, though he 'very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously.' 'I was proud to work with President Trump, defending America at the United Nations,' Haley said in response on X. 'I wish him, and all who serve, great success in moving us forward to a stronger, safer America over the next four years.' Pompeo also said that he was proud to work in that previous administration and that it was time to put America first.

What to know about Trump's inauguration	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump will regain control of the White House in January, four years after he lost the presidency to President Joe Biden. In this election cycle, Trump won the popular vote and the Electoral College. Biden and Democratic nominee Vice President Harris both vowed a 'peaceful transfer of power,' with the president inviting Trump to a meeting at the Oval Office. Biden's inauguration in 2020 was on the heels of the Jan. 6 riots and Trump refusing to concede the election, claiming election fraud. Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security Here's what we know so far about Trump's impending second inauguration: Trump's Inauguration Day logistics Trump will be sworn into office as the 47th president of the U.S. on Jan. 20 at U.S. Capitol building in Washington D.C. The inauguration is planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and events include the swearing-in ceremony, the inaugural address, and the pass in review. Around noon, he will recite an oath in accordance with Article II, Section I of the U.S. Constitution. He is also expected to give an inaugural address where most incoming presidents highlight their goals and vision for the next four years in office.

Trump's decision to skip the ceremony is a notable break from recent precedent as we look back on Trump's own inauguration 4 years ago on Jan. 20 2017. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images There will also be an honorary departure where the outgoing president and first lady leave the Capitol to begin their post-presidential lives. There is also a pass in the review where the new president stands on the East Front steps of the Capitol to review military troops before leading a procession of ceremonial military regiments, citizens’ groups, marching bands and floats down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. The day will also include a luncheon and photo opportunities. Trump's inauguration day security Capitol police have warned of post-election violence and protests. In a Capitol Police intelligence assessment report released earlier this month, obtained by ABC News, authorities expect the trend of 'civil unrest' seen in 2020 to repeat in 2024. They noted there have been fewer threats to members of Congress this go around. What happens after Election Day? Key dates to know Police expect demonstrations on the electoral certification process and protests related to the war in Israel. What happens before Trump's inauguration? State executives must certify their presidential electors by Dec. 11, and the Electoral College will convene Dec. 17. They must submit their votes officially by Christmas Day. The incoming Congress members will be sworn in on Jan. 3 and will count electoral votes three days later. The winner, presumably Trump, will take the oath of office Jan. 20. Selecting an administration is a top priority for Trump as he prepares to take over the White House.

Diddy's ex-bodyguard sues rape accuser for defamation	(NewsNation) — Sean 'Diddy' Combs’ ex-bodyguard has filed a lawsuit against a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her with the music mogul in 2001, calling her accusations 'outrageous and disgusting.' Joseph Sherman filed a lawsuit alleging defamation and emotional distress in New York federal court Friday against Thalia Graves, who named him in a lawsuit along with Combs in September, USA Today reported. Sherman called Graves’ allegations of rape 'utterly false and untrue' and that she and her lawyers 'made outrageous, disgusting, and life-altering statements … without any regard for the truth,' the outlet reported. He also says Graves is trying to 'blackmail him' and that she had messaged him to see if he would provide 'false testimony against Sean Combs' in exchange for being left out of the legal proceedings, the outlet reported. What we know about the Diddy investigation 'Joseph Sherman has never met Thalia Graves, let alone raped her,' the filing stated, according to USA Today, and he 'continues to suffer severe reputational harm, emotional distress, and financial damages.' Graves filed a lawsuit in September alleging that Combs and Sherman 'viciously raped her' at the Bad Boy Records studio in the summer of 2001, according to court documents obtained by NewsNation local affiliate KTLA. She also alleged that the assault was filmed and then shared without the victim’s consent — including selling it as pornography.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) 'By raping the plaintiff and recording it, the defendants caused the plaintiff to be depicted in a video image unclothed and with intimate body parts exposed and engaged in sexual conduct with another person,' her attorney, Gloria Allred, said at a news conference in September. Court documents show that Graves didn’t report it for decades out of fear they 'would use their power to ruin her life, as they had repeatedly, explicitly threatened to do.' The incident left her traumatized and contemplating suicide, according to the filing. Diddy case: Rappers, stars and more are worried over ‘Diddy Files’ 'The trauma of the assault has taken a toll on my mental health. I’ve had PTSD, depression and anxiety,' she said at a September news conference. 'It has been hard for me to trust others, create relationships or even feel safe in my own skin. The combination of physical and emotional pain has created a cycle of suffering from which it is so hard to break free.' Combs is accused of using his music empire to engage in sex trafficking and accused of having a pattern of abusing women. He was arrested Sept. 16 after months of allegations and a federal raid on two of his properties. He pleaded not guilty in New York court the next day. The music producer was indicted last month on three felony charges after months of speculation surrounding a possible federal investigation that could be connected to a slew of civil lawsuits that allege abuse and sexual assault by multiple victims spanning over 30 years. A May 5 trial date was set on Oct. 10 for him to face sex trafficking and racketeering charges. One week after his indictment, Combs and Sherman were both named in a lawsuit by Graves, making her the 11th accuser to file a suit against him.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/diddy-bodyguard-sues-rape-defamation/	2024-11-11T10:57:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1771555002.jpg?w=900
Dry weather fuels wildfires on both coasts	(NewsNation) — Fire crews are battling a wildfire on the New York-New Jersey border that has already resulted in the death of one volunteer firefighter and prompted air quality alerts in the region. The fires in New Jersey are in a densely wooded area where around 3,000 acres are burning, and the fire is only 10% contained as of Sunday. Smoke has diminished in the area after it rained Sunday night, but the amount of rainfall was not enough to make a dent in the fire. How could Trump influence military policies? One aspect that complicates the fire is the underground root systems, which are dry, decayed, and rotting. That means the fire is also burning underground, which is hard to capture. 'Make no mistake, though precipitation is forecasted, that's not going to solve the problem we have here with this wildfire,' said New Jersey Forest Fire Service Chief Bill Donnelly. 'It's inevitable that this fire is going to continue to burn until it reaches our control line.' Donnelly told NewsNation they are hoping to secure control lines and contain the fire by the end of the week. But it's a difficult task, with New Jersey not well equipped to handle something that is very out of the norm for the region. Volunteer firefighter Dariel Vasquez, 18, died when a tree fell on him as he was trying to fight the Jennings Creek fire in New York. That fire straddles two states. It began in New York and has spread thanks to drought and high winds. At one point, there were around 11 burning across New Jersey, with the cause for all of them under investigation. In one case, an arrest has been made. A man in Ocean County, New Jersey, allegedly fired a shotgun and sparked a fire with an ember from the shotgun shell. Jury deliberations resume in Delphi murder trial against Richard Allen Other fires, which are at various stages of containment, are also being investigated. One fire was 100% contained on Sunday, but others are still spreading in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. Even New York City has been affected, with a brush fire breaking out in Brooklyn's Prospect Park on Friday. On the opposite coast, Southern California is also battling wildfires that have resulted in thousands of evacuations and more than 100 destroyed structures. Wetter weather is in the forecast there as well, which could aid firefighters in their efforts to contain the blazes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/dry-wildfires-both-coasts/	2024-11-11T10:36:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2182629589.jpg?w=900
Who is Trump's new border czar Tom Homan?	(NewsNation) — Tom Homan has been announced as the incoming Trump administration's 'border czar,' overseeing America's border sovereignty. President-elect Donald Trump announced the appointment via Truth Social on Sunday. 'I am pleased to announce that the Former ICE Director, and stalwart on Border Control, Tom Homan, will be joining the Trump Administration, in charge of our Nation’s Borders,' Trump wrote. How could Trump influence military policies? Here's what you need to know about Homan. Who is Tom Homan? Homan, 62, has extensive experience in law enforcement and politics, previously serving in the Obama and Trump administrations and as Trump's acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). A New York native, Homan began his career as a police officer in his hometown of West Carthage before moving into border enforcement. Homan was a border patrol agent, later ascending to supervisor before former President Barack Obama appointed Homan to Executive Associate Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2013. Homan will be charged with overseeing the United States' borders. Obama gave Homan a Presidential Rank Award in 2015, which recognizes 'extraordinary achievements by career executives in Federal service,' according to the Chief Human Capital Officers Council. Trump previously made Homan a senior immigration official in his last administration. He served as the acting director of ICE. What will Homan's role be as border czar? Trump outlined some of Homan's responsibilities in his Truth Social post on Sunday, reflecting what one may imagine for a border czar. They include but are 'not limited to the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,' according to the president-elect. 'Tom Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,' Trump added. Homan joined Fox News on Monday morning to discuss his new role, suggesting he would be a 'hypocrite' if he did not accept Trump's offer after repeatedly criticizing the Biden administration's border policies. Jockeying kicks off to fill Vance vacancy in Senate 'I'm honored the president asked me to come back and help solve this national security crisis, so I'm looking forward to it,' he said. 'Public safety threats and national security threats will be the priority,' Homan told Fox of his and Trump's vision. 'Another priority, this administration has lost over 300,000 children that were smuggled into this country by criminal cartels... we need to save these children,' Homan added. 'Some of these children are in forced labor, sex trafficking, some of these children are living a life of hell every day. We need to save these children and get them back with their families.' Homan's view on border, deportation Homan recently solidified his position on deportation, as he readies to follow through on Trump's pledge for the largest deportation of migrants who entered the country illegally. 'You have a historic illegal immigration crisis where you have numbers we’ve never seen before, in the millions and millions, of illegal aliens released in this country [and] we know the vast majority will not get asylum, so they don’t qualify,' Homan told The Times. 'The ideal success is: Crime rate goes down, illegal immigration goes down, lives are saved. That’s the ideal outcome,' Homan added. Who is Susie Wiles, Trump’s WH chief of staff? As for mass deportation, Homan rebuked the idea that the Trump administration is heavy-handed by enforcing the law upon those who break United States law by entering the country illegally. 'You have a right to claim asylum,' Homan told Fox on Monday. 'You have a right to see a judge, and we make that happen. But, at the end of that due process, if a judge says 'You have to go home,' then we have to take them home. 'What is the option? Let them all stay? If that's the option you want, you're never going to fix the southern border, because you send a message to the whole world; 'Come to the United States, enter the country illegally - which is a crime - but you still get to stay. That doesn't work.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/tom-homan-border-czar-trump-adminstration/	2024-11-11T09:48:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-886264880.jpg?w=900
Delphi murder trial verdict is in, in case against Richard Allen	(NewsNation) — Jurors have reached a verdict in the trial against Delphi murder suspect Richard Allen. Jurors began their fourth day of deliberations and will consider the evidence against Allen, 52, who is accused of killing Liberty German, 14, and Abigail Williams, 13, in February 2017 after allegedly luring them to their deaths while they were on a hike not far from their home. The girls’ deaths had gone unsolved for more than five years when Allen, then a pharmacy worker, was arrested in the case that has drawn attention from true crime enthusiasts. State police announced his arrest in October 2022. Sex trafficking allegations close Texas massage parlor After an evidence leak, several legal filings, the removal and reinstating of the original court-appointed defense team and other delays in the Delphi murder case, Allen’s trial is nearing its end. Allen faces four counts of first-degree murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping in the killings of Williams and German. If convicted of both killings, Allen could be sentenced to up to 130 years in prison. Delphi murders trial against Allen The jury, consisting of seven women and five men, began deliberations Thursday afternoon after hearing closing arguments in the weekslong murder trial. Over three days, jurors met for 14.5 hours before standing down Sunday. Saturday’s session lasted 4.5 hours and included viewing of videos previously entered into evidence. The state made its case: A crime lab technician matched a bullet found at the crime scene to Allen’s gun; a camera captured Allen’s car near the murder scene; he admitted he was on the bridge on the day of the murders and confessed to the crime dozens of times, including in jail phone calls to his wife and mother. Wife of Illinois judge charged with his murder The defense countered: The state had no DNA, social media or digital forensic evidence linking Allen to the crime; his time in solitary confinement warped his mind and led to false confessions; the state’s investigation was bungled from the beginning; and the bullet evidence was inconclusive at best. The trial started with jury selection on Oct. 14 in Allen County. Due to the high profile of the case and its prominence in central Indiana, Special Judge Fran Gull decided to pull jurors from Allen County. Since the murders happened in Carroll County and a number of key witnesses and investigators lived near or around Delphi, the trial itself was held at the Carroll County Courthouse. The prosecution and defense delivered closing arguments on Nov. 7, 2024 — seven years, eight months and 25 days after the girls’ bodies were found.

Southern border towns brace for migrant influx	(NewsNation) — With January’s presidential inauguration nearing, Texas authorities are bracing for a potential migrant surge and an increasing number of unaccompanied children making the journey alone. In Eagle Pass, Texas, migrant encounters are rising. Over the weekend, Texas Department of Public Safety troopers encountered 116 migrants, including 11 children traveling alone — some as young as seven years old. These children often rely on strangers or pay smugglers to guide them through cartel-controlled areas, adding extreme risks to their journey. Donald Trump names Tom Homan ‘border czar’ Texas DPS has reported a surge in unaccompanied minors, with over 100 children arriving alone in the first half of October, many marked with colored wristbands by cartels, signaling payment for crossing through dangerous areas.

Names written in marker on blue, green and yellow bracelets littered along the river banks on private property in Eagle Pass—The latest area to be exploited… pic.twitter.com/wRZhybw2dw&mdash; Ali Bradley (@AliBradleyTV) October 22, 2024 When these children encounter authorities, they often have little more than a note with a 'sponsor' address. Recently, a group of unaccompanied minors was found with addresses to sponsors in states like New York, California, Colorado and Florida. As of Nov. 1, there were 6,100 unaccompanied children in the care of the Department of Health and Human Services. The average stay per child lasts about 34 days and the department said it is focused on reducing the stay time while ensuring the child's safety. As more children cross alone, the surge is already a reality in Eagle Pass — even before the election results were known. Now, authorities are preparing for what could be an even bigger influx as January’s inauguration approaches. Nearly 50 migrant deaths at border in first 40 days of FY2025 With the anticipated surge before January’s inauguration, Texas has ramped up security under Operation Lone Star. In Brownsville and El Paso, National Guard soldiers, alongside local law enforcement, are running intense, battle-ready drills. Captain Daniel Mannon of Task Force East said these exercises keep teams prepared for swift, coordinated action if large groups arrive. In Eagle Pass, National Guard soldiers from Texas and Louisiana are fortifying key sections with razor wire and expanding the border wall in Cameron and Maverick Counties. Officials believe these measures can help manage the surge, but the pressure is building, and they’re staying on high alert as January draws closer.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/southern-border-towns-migrant-influx/	2024-11-11T08:21:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Texas-DPS.jpg?w=900
Jockeying kicks off to fill Vance vacancy in Senate	Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) is facing a key decision on whom to tap to fill the term of Vice President-elect Vance as jockeying among Ohio Republicans for the coveted appointment is set to become a knife fight. Vance will be departing the upper chamber only two years after winning his seat, creating a vacancy that will have ramifications both immediately and down the line. The appointed senator would be staring down back-to-back campaigns: a high-stakes special election in 2026 and a race in 2028. With a rare opening, Republicans are expecting an intraparty battle in a state that has become increasingly red in recent years. '[The] jockeying will be intense,' Rep. Dave Joyce (R-Ohio) said. Discussions are still in their infancy, but speculation is running rampant over whom DeWine may pick, with the governor’s office already receiving a steady stream of outreach from interested parties. 'A lot of people are calling,' DeWine told reporters Thursday. 'We’re just going through the process of starting to think about this and see who would be the best person.' DeWine also acknowledged that whoever is chosen must be ready to hit the ground running and have the ability to run and win the pair of coming Senate races, much like what Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.) is trying to accomplish. The senator is also expected to be a consensus pick, rather than someone either purely in the mold of DeWine, a moderate GOP governor, or cut wholly from MAGA cloth. 'I suspect that DeWine is going to pick someone that's broadly acceptable to the whole party,' a Trump World source told The Hill. 'I don't expect him to pick some crazy MAGA person, but also he won't pick someone who will anger Trump and his supporters.' According to a handful of GOP sources, Jane Timken is widely believed to be among the leading early contenders for the appointment. The former Ohio GOP chair finished in a disappointing fifth place during the 2022 GOP Senate primary that Vance emerged from, but she has put herself in a solid position for an appointment due in part to her close relationship with DeWine. She ran the Ohio GOP during the opening years of his gubernatorial stint. Timken was also a top ally of Vance leading up to the 2022 the general election. One Ohio GOP insider described her as a 'bridge builder,' something that would likely appeal to DeWine. But she is also known for her cautious approach and would have to instill confidence that she can win back-to-back Senate bids, especially after the failed primary run. 'Jane makes all the sense in the world. ... But that's also why she maybe won't get it,' one GOP operative with Ohio ties said. 'She makes sense as the favorite on paper.' DeWine also has a history of appointing women to open posts and positions, multiple operatives noted. But after Timken, there is little consensus. Among the smattering of Republican names being mentioned are Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy and Rep. Mike Carey (Ohio). Sources also noted that DeWine may opt to use the appointment as an opportunity to cull the herd of potential opponents in the state’s looming GOP gubernatorial primary. Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted (R) is DeWine’s favored choice as successor, but he could square off against the likes of Yost or Vivek Ramaswamy, the former presidential candidate and a favorite of President-elect Trump. This could lead DeWine to pick either of the two possible challengers, operatives believe, though Yost would be the more likely of the pair. Strategists are also quick to note that DeWine, a former two-term senator himself, is sure to take the selection process particularly seriously — something the governor acknowledged while discussing the heightened importance of the role, especially given the double dose of elections the pick will face. 'It has to be someone who will serve well in the Senate. I think I have a pretty good idea of what it takes,' DeWine said, adding that he’s looking for someone who will focus on both Ohio and national issues, show strong work ethic and wants to 'get things done.' 'These are qualifications I think that are very important.' 'This is not for the faint-hearted,' he continued. 'This is not for someone who just wants to get a seat. This has to be someone who really wants to do the job and do the work and who we think has the ability to do that.' Two names that are considered unlikely to receive DeWine’s call from the bullpen are state Sen. Matt Dolan (R) and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R), both of whom lost the Senate primary to Sen.-elect Bernie Moreno (R) in the spring. Dolan is unlikely to fall into that boat of being a consensus pick because he is widely viewed as a moderate who would upset Trump and his backers. His selection would also likely prompt a contentious primary challenge — something Republicans of all stripes would like to avoid. As for LaRose, he put up an underwhelming performance during the Senate run, having led at stages before ultimately finishing behind Moreno and Dolan. He also struggled on the fundraising side, especially against two self-funders. It also remains to be seen what role Vance plays in who succeeds him. Multiple sources noted that Vance and DeWine have a strong personal relationship despite their political differences, with the Trump World source pointing to the lack of a response from Vance after DeWine called him out for his comments about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. While the vice president-elect is likely to have conversations with the governor, DeWine is also expected to lean on counsel of advisers and keep the selection process close to the vest. Trump's role in selecting Vance's successor is also unclear at this point, but sources say he will have some level of influence. But one thing that’s universally agreed on is that this is the governor’s choice, no matter how much Vance and others weigh in. 'At the end of the day, it’s a DeWine thing,' the Trump World source said. The timing of filling the vacancy remains unclear because it is unknown when Vance will officially resign from the upper chamber. According to a DeWine spokesperson, the governor is mindful of appointing someone as early as possible, especially in order to give the new senator seniority over the incoming class of members who will be inaugurated on Jan. 3.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jockeying-kicks-off-to-fill-vance-vacancy-in-senate/	2024-11-11T06:58:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/vance-seat_weaver_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
How could Trump influence military policies?	(NewsNation) — Republicans are poised to win full control of Congress and, with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office in January, that could mean some changes for the United States military. Among those possible changes is a renewed ban on transgender service members. Trump announced the ban during his first term but President Joe Biden lifted that restriction. Other possible changes under Trump Another policy that’s potentially on the chopping block provides paid leave and reimbursements for service members who travel to another state for an abortion. The U.S. military implemented that policy last year. The Defense Department says it was used 12 times across all military branches between June and December, costing $45,000. Trump nominates Stefanik for UN ambassador Trump has pushed to cut back wasteful government spending, which could potentially lead to cuts in defense spending. The official 2024 Republican platform includes plans to invest in military research and advanced technology and supports higher pay for troops. Military recruitment The Army, Air Force, Marines and Space Force all met their recruitment goals during the previous fiscal year. Live results: Balance of power in Congress One of the top Pentagon leaders for personnel says a recruitment crisis is the biggest challenge the military has faced since its inception. The Defense Department recently reported that the armed services recruited 12.5% more people in the past fiscal year, compared to the year prior. Challenges, however, have included a low unemployment rate, competition from private companies that can offer better pay and benefits, and the eligible public’s fewer ties to friends and family members who have served. ‘We’re gonna learn some things’ about UFOs: Rep. Tim Burchett Before this past cycle, the Army fell short of its recruitment goals for two consecutive years, including a 25% shortfall in 2022. New enlistments have also declined. 2023 saw about 30,000 fewer enlistees than 2019.'We need to remain cautiously optimistic about the future recruiting operations as we continue to recruit in a market that has low youth propensity to serve, limited familiarity with military opportunities, a competitive labor market and a declining eligibility among young adults,' the Director of Military Accession Policy Katie Helland said in an official statement last week. The Defense Department has touted the success of a training program that gives low-performing recruits 90 days to get up to standards for basic training.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/how-trump-influence-military-policies/	2024-11-11T05:54:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2178633197.jpg?w=900
Trump to nominate Stefanik for UN ambassador	President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) as his choice to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, choosing one of his staunchest allies in the House to take on a top diplomatic post. Trump confirmed the choice in a statement to The New York Post late Sunday. 'I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,' Trump said. CNN first reported that Trump had offered Stefanik the role. The congresswoman, who is likely to get confirmed by a majority GOP Senate, is expected to be a combative presence at the United Nations and an outspoken advocate for Trump’s 'America First' foreign policy, which pushes allies to contribute more to shared defense efforts and takes a critical approach to major institutions like the U.N. itself. Stefanik has limited foreign policy and diplomatic experience. She has served on the House Armed Services Committee and on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. She is an outspoken supporter of Israel and has previously decried the United Nations as 'antisemitic.' Stefanik addressed the Knesset in Jerusalem in May to pledge continued U.S. support for Israel. The choice of Stefanik could have repercussions for Trump’s efforts to get his agenda through the House. Republicans are expected to have an extremely narrow majority, and that margin will temporarily become slimmer if Stefanik vacates her seat to join the administration. Stefanik, 40, had long been considered a GOP rising star, and she has broken through in recent years as she became an outspoken Trump ally. She fiercely defended Trump during his first impeachment in 2019, joined GOP leadership in 2021 and sharply questioned Ivy League presidents about campus antisemitism after the October, 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel. She has served as chair of the House Republican Conference since 2021 and has represented an upstate New York congressional district since 2015. She was 30 when she first won election, making her the youngest woman elected to Congress at the time. She previously worked in the George W. Bush White House. The role of ambassador to the United Nations was held during Trump’s first term by Nikki Haley and later by Kelly Craft. Trump announced Saturday Haley would not have a role in his second administration. The congresswoman had publicly spoken about her willingness to serve in the Trump administration, including immediately after Trump’s election victory last week. 'He needs strong allies. I’m honored to have my name in the mix, but I’m focused on serving the president however he sees fit, whether that’s passing the agenda in Congress or serving in his administration,' Stefanik said last week on a New York City radio show.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-stefanik-un-ambassador/	2024-11-11T04:28:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24020104266726-e1719023126539.jpg?w=900

Donald Trump names Tom Homan ‘border czar’	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump plans to appoint Tom Homan, who was acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term, to be his 'border czar.' 'I am pleased to announce that the Former ICE Director, and stalwart on Border Control, Tom Homan, will be joining the Trump Administration, in charge of our Nation’s Borders ('The Border Czar'), including, but not limited to, the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,' Trump posted on his Truth Social platform late Sunday. 'I’ve known Tom for a long time, and there is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders. Likewise, Tom Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin. Congratulations to Tom. I have no doubt he will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job,' Trump added. Trump: Senate GOP leader candidates must agree to recess appointments Homan served as acting director of ICE from January 2017 through June 2018. He oversaw the early stages of the Trump administration’s controversial family separation policy, in which migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without permission were criminally charged or referred for prosecution. Last year, Homan defended the controversial policy of separating family members of those who entered the U.S. illegally. 'I’m sick and tired hearing about the family separation,' Homan told the Conservative Political Action Conference last year. 'You know, I’m still being sued over that, so come get me. I don’t give a s***, right. Bottom line is, we enforced the law.' Oklahoma superintendent issues memo on dismantling US education dept. 'When I was a cop in New York and I arrested a father for domestic violence, or someone for [driving under the influence], I separated that family,' he continued. 'When you violate the law with a child, you’re going to be separated.' Homan voiced an equally strong message at the Republican National Convention in July. 'I got a message to the millions of illegal aliens that Joe Biden has released into our country in violation of federal law: You better start packing now,' he said. Fact check: Both Harris, Trump won states with no voter ID laws Homan’s career began in West Carthage, New York, where he was a police officer. Later, he joined what was then known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service. After positions as a border patrol agent, investigator and supervisor, he was appointed by then-President Barack Obama to be the Executive Associate Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2013. Since retiring as acting ICE director in 2018, Homan joined the Heritage Foundation, and was a contributor to its Project 2025, the purported blueprint for Trump’s second term.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/donald-trump-names-tom-homan-border-czar/	2024-11-10T21:06:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/03/HomanTom_061322_AP_Matt-York.jpg?w=900
Trump: Senate GOP leader candidates must agree to recess appointm...	President-elect Trump demanded on Sunday that the next Senate GOP leader allow him to make recess appointments, which would effectively let him fast-track his nominees and appointments without needing Senate approval. Recess appointments, which are intended for emergencies, can last for up to two years, without the Senate ever giving their advice and consent. Trump on Sunday suggested using the practice as a way to avoid facing opposition in the Senate to his picks. 'Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,' Trump wrote in a post on the social platform X. Tariffs a ‘helpful’ negotiating tool for Trump: Grover Norquist 'Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more. This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!' Trump’s post comes as attention centers on the three-way race to succeed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). The race is set between Senate Republican Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who served as Senate GOP whip during Trump’s first two years in the White House. Scott, whose bid to replace the outgoing Senate leader has long been seen as a long-shot, has gained momentum in recent days among some allies of President-elect Trump’s, after his victory helped boost GOP chances in the upper chamber. Scott immediately embraced Trump’s view on recess appointments, writing on X, '100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible.' Former Harris aide calls for Biden to resign so she can be president briefly Thune and Cornyn took a more measured approach but still stressed the importance of getting Trump’s picks confirmed and installed in their offices. 'We must act quickly and decisively to get the president’s nominees in place as soon as possible, &amp; all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments. We cannot let Schumer and Senate Dems block the will of the American people,' Thune wrote on X. 'It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump‘s cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent. Additionally, the Constitution expressly confers the power on the President to make recess appointments,' Cornyn wrote on X, before citing the section of the constitution granting the president to fill vacancies while Congress is in recess. Trump also called for Republicans to try to block judges appointments for the remainder of the year, until Republicans retake control of the White House and Senate. 'Additionally, no Judges should be approved during this period of time because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. THANK YOU!' Trump wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-senate-gop-leader-candidates-must-agree-to-recess-appointments/	2024-11-10T20:55:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Zoom-in-Trump_110624_AP_Alex-Brandon.jpg?w=900
We’re gonna learn some things' about UFOs: Rep. Tim Burchett	(NewsNation) — It may not be 'total disclosure,' but one lawmaker who has advocated for UFO whistleblowers is optimistic that some significant information will come from Wednesday’s House hearing on UFO/UAP. 'I think we’re gonna learn some things. It’s peeling back the layers of an onion,' said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. 'The best pilots in the world, that are our pilots, are telling us that these things are flying in close proximity to their aircraft,' Burchett told 'NewsNation Prime.' What is the Pentagon’s alleged ‘Immaculate Constellation’ program? One expert from Great Britain who will be watching the hearing believes that we will learn something, but not everything. 'Disclosure is a process, rather than a single event. So I don’t think we’re going to see on Wednesday a sort of parting of the curtains ‘this is it’ definitive explanation,' said Nick Pope, UFO expert and retired U.K. Defense Ministry official. Also appearing on 'NewsNation Prime,' Pope said he’s especially looking forward to the testimony of former U.S. Navy Admiral Tim Gallaudet, who knows about a part of the UFO/UAP issue that many people have never heard about: underwater phenomena. 'This … is extremely sensitive because some of these things have apparently been tracking our ballistic missile nuclear submarines,' he said. Mystery drones flew over US base Burchett agrees, adding that Gallaudet 'has very compelling evidence' Two subcommittees of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee are holding the Nov. 13 hearing titled 'Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.' Many advocates of disclosure have high hopes for the new Trump administration when it comes to releasing files that have been secret for decades. 'He’s dropped heavy hints that he knows something,' said Pope. 'He’s been pressured … to release the rest of the JFK files, which he says he’s going to do early in his second term. Clearly in President Trump’s mind, he links the UFO issue to the JFK issue – perhaps just in terms of public interest and the suggestion that there’s a coverup and a conspiracy,' Pope added. Netflix faces lawsuit over ‘The Manhattan Alien Abduction’ Burchett is also optimistic that Trump wants to share more of what government agencies have compiled over the decades. 'I hope so. That’s the signals I’ve been given. I’m convinced that that’s what he wants, and that he trusts the American public,' he said. 'President Trump will move towards total disclosure.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/were-gonna-learn-some-things-about-ufos-rep-tim-burchett/	2024-11-10T20:47:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1813803078.jpg?w=900
Tariffs a ‘helpful’ negotiating tool for Trump: Grover Norquist	(NewsNation) — Grover Norquist, the Republican founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform, tells 'NewsNation Prime' he believes President-elect Donald Trump’s tariffs and tax cut plans will help America’s deficit decline. Trump has pledged to implement several economic initiatives, including a plan to eliminate personal income taxes in exchange for at least a 10% tariff on all important imported goods and a 60% tariff on products imported from China. 'He has talked about those using those as a negotiating tool to keep China from stealing our technology, to get China to allow our goods and services to go into China ... we need to have more pressure on China to have them accept American goods and services, which they're not doing now,' Norquist said. These stocks have soared since Trump’s victory 'As a negotiating tool, tariffs can be helpful,' he added. The Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump’s plan to expand his Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 would, in 2024 dollars, cost $3.2 trillion over 10 years and $10.3 trillion over the next 30 years. If the cuts aren't expanded, taxes could rise as much as 4% for certain income brackets, while the child tax credit could be cut in half. According to the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics, if these tariffs were enacted, a typical middle class family would see $1,700 in additional costs yearly. 'Free market economists recognize that Trump's pro growth policy is the way to keep the deficit down. Economic growth is the most important thing we can do to bring the deficit and the debt down,' Norquist said. The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, shows that the Trump tax proposal benefits American workers in various income brackets following an election in which many voters considered the economy their top concern. Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security The Wharton project also estimates that the Trump tax plan would increase the nation’s primary deficits by $5.8 trillion over 10 years on a conventional basis and by $4.1 trillion on a dynamic basis, the report finds.

Sanders: Sotomayor stepping down not 'the sensible approach'	Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stepping down is not the 'sensible approach' as Democrats float the idea of packing the court before President-elect Trump takes office. Sanders joined NBC’s 'Meet the Press' host Kristen Welker on Sunday, where he was asked for his thoughts about the idea. Former Harris aide calls for Biden to resign so she can be president briefly 'Is that something you would support, do you think she should step down?' Welker asked. 'No, I don’t,' Sanders replied. Welker continued, asking if he had 'heard any talk' about the idea. 'A little bit, yes,' Sanders said. 'I don’t think it’s a sensible approach.' Sotomayor has made it clear she has no plans to step down from the Supreme Court, CNN reported Sunday after speaking with people close to the justice. Some on the left have called for President Biden to name a successor — someone younger — to serve a lifetime appointment before Trump enters office. Trump in phone call advised Putin not to escalate in Ukraine: Report Sotomayor, 70, is in 'great health, and the court needs her now more than ever,' one person close to the justice told CNN. With 71 days until Trump’s inauguration, there are concerns that a Supreme Court nomination would take too long, and Sotomayor’s hypothetical open seat would allow the president-elect to nominate a conservative.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/sonia-sotomayor-stepping-down/	2024-11-10T15:09:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24172679018758-e1720523163554.jpg?w=900

(The Hill) -- San Francisco 49ers star defensive end Nick Bosa was fined by the NFL after he crashed a postgame interview wearing a MAGA hat. The league fined Bosa $11,255 after he crashed the live interview after his team’s win against the Dallas Cowboys late last month, a league source told CNN and The Associated Press. Bosa spoke with the media after it was announced the presidential race would go for President-elect Trump. He said if the NFL fined him for jumping into the interview, it wouldn’t matter much to him. 'I don’t know,' he said Wednesday when asked if he thought he would get a fine. 'I haven’t gotten one yet, but if it comes, it comes.' He added that he knew he could get a fine from the NFL, but it was 'well worth it' to wear the hat.

(AP Photo/Jed Jacobsohn, File) The NFL has rules that throughout game day, when a player is visible to the stadium and those watching at home, they are prohibited from wearing or displaying personal messages that have not been approved. These NFL teams eat the most Uncrustables in a week, report finds Bosa said his position supporting Trump is not going to change, saying the 'nation spoke' in the election. After he crashed the postgame interview, he was asked during a press conference about his political statement. He said he wasn’t going to speak too much on the topic but called it an important time. Bosa was also asked whether he was tempted to show support for Trump in the past. He said it’s 'definitely a little easier nowadays,' but he doesn’t feel 'too inclined' to publicly support the president-elect. Bosa and Trump met at the UFC fight in Miami earlier this year and took a picture with Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/49ers-star-nick-bosa-fined-for-crashing-interview-wearing-maga-hat/	2024-11-10T15:00:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/64f8f1f390df08.02103318-e1731279346984.jpeg?w=800
Mpox vaccine’s high cost concerning: Health experts	(NewsNation) — Finding the vaccine to prevent the spread of mpox is not difficult. But paying for it could be very difficult in the U.S., especially for those at the highest risk of contracting what used to be known as monkeypox. Private insurance companies in the U.S. aren’t required to cover the cost of the mpox vaccine Jynneos, which costs $270 a dose. The firms will be required to cover the vaccine starting on Jan. 1. 'This is a massive bump in the road, and especially because it’s happening in the middle of deep concern about another outbreak,' Dr. Stacey Trooskin told The New York Times. Trooskin is the executive medical officer of the Mazzoni Center, a large sexual health clinic in Philadelphia. Standing desks aren’t making you healthier: Study Along with the high cost, privacy may also be a factor in some reluctance to seek out the vaccine. Health professionals say that gay and bisexual men, those living with HIV and sex workers should seek out the vaccine. However young gay men may not have health insurance, and others may be reluctant to get the Jynneos vaccine because they are not out to their families. Last month, the city of El Paso, Texas confirmed two cases of mpox. The latest iteration of the virus is responsible for thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths in central Africa. Cases have also been confirmed outside of Africa, including Sweden and the U.K. Ozempic can lead to muscle mass loss: Study Earlier this year, the White House announced that it would donate one million doses of the mpox vaccine to the Central African countries at the center of the deadly outbreak. There may be some alternatives, however. Some local health departments, such as Chicago, Los Angeles County and the state of Virginia, are offering the mpox vaccine for free.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/mpox-vaccine-high-cost/	2024-11-10T14:55:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2181249026.jpg?w=900
Former Harris aide calls for Biden to resign so she can be presid...	Jamal Simmons, a former aide to Vice President Harris, called for President Biden to resign so that the vice president can have his role for a short amount of time. 'Joe Biden’s been a phenomenal president, he’s lived up to so many of the promises he’s made. There’s one promise left that he could fulfill, being a transitional figure,' Simmons said on CNN’s 'State of the Union' on a panel featuring anchor Dana Bash, in a clip highlighted by Mediaite. White House says Biden will continue push for Ukraine aid, cease-fire 'He could resign the presidency in the next 30 days, make Kamala Harris president of the United States,' he continued, drawing shocked reactions from others. President Biden dropped out of this year’s race for the White House in late July, following a rising tide of concern about his age and mental fitness that came in the wake of a rough debate performance against President-elect Trump a month before. Harris then took his position at the top of the ticket, but eventually lost to Trump a few months later. Simmons said Harris stepping into her boss’s role 'would make sure that it would dominate the news, at a point where Democrats have to learn drama and transparency and doing things the public will wanna see.' Harris’s loss to Trump and the loss of control of the Senate in the 2024 elections has rattled Democrats, many of whom view the president-elect as a threat to democracy. Trump in phone call advised Putin not to escalate in Ukraine: Report Democrats have also taken to infighting in the wake of the election, with those on the left saying their party didn’t go far enough in their direction to excite the party’s base, while centrists have said the party went too far left and frightened moderate voters. 'We are out of touch with the crisis of meaning/purpose fueling MAGA,' Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Sunday in a thread on the social platform X. 'We refuse to pick big fights. Our tent is too small.'

Immigration advocates brace for Trump: 'Buckle up'	Immigration advocates are bracing for Trump 2.0, whose pledge of mass deportation is sending waves of panic and anger throughout the movement. Even before President-elect Trump’s resounding victory on Tuesday, immigration advocacy was facing an identity crisis after decades of relying on Hispanics as their primary voting constituency and with neither political party fully embracing their priorities. 'I think that part of the challenge … has been the movement has been very insular. The movement has been focused on undocumented immigrants,' said Marielena Hincapié, a scholar at Cornell University's Immigration Law and Policy Program. 'When I was heading up the National Immigration Law Center, I would be the person to be like, 'I'm a Latina, and this is so much more than just about [Latinos],' right? It's about Asian Pacific Islanders. It's about Black immigrants. But it also has to be like, when we talk about — or the directly impacted, the directly impacted by immigration is not just someone who is undocumented, right? It's about the U.S. citizen spouses. It's the U.S. citizen children. It's the business owners that are relying on them. It's the homeowners whose houses are being rebuilt in, you know, Asheville, North Carolina, or Florida after Milton.' The immigration advocacy umbrella has grown since the first Trump administration, notably with the elevation of Haitian American civil rights groups and closer ties between advocacy and business through organizations such as the American Business Immigration Coalition. In 2023, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called on Congress to move forward a series of bipartisan bills directed toward border security and immigration reform. 'The antiquated legal immigration system and its woefully insufficient supply of worker visas have for years significantly hindered the ability of companies to meet their workforce needs. In addition, the vast shortcomings of the legal immigration system are a significant contributing factor to the continuing challenges at the southern border,' wrote Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the Chamber, in a letter to Congress. But neither the outgoing, divided Congress nor the Democratic-controlled Congress of the first half of the Biden administration made any headway on immigration — a pattern that’s held for nearly four decades — or on border security, a government duty that’s been institutionally stagnant but consistently growing in scope and cost over the past two decades. That’s a painful bottom line for a movement whose main goals are to modernize and humanize the immigration system and to curb the growth of the detention-deportation industrial complex. 'When you look beyond the binaries served up to American voters this election cycle — a felon or democracy, toughness or chaos, a ban or a welcome — you see them as false choices that overshadow real, necessary and in many cases broadly supported policy solutions. The pressures of irregular migration and the recycling harms of crime and incarceration will not go away on their own, nor can they be blotted out by sheer bravado. They must be reckoned with in ways that create lasting change,' said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an organization that bridges big tech and immigration advocacy, in a statement. Trump’s victory sent private prison operator stocks soaring. Investors are betting on his promises of mass deportation and mass internment coming true, funneling millions in tax dollars to those companies. As of midday Friday, the GEO Group’s stock grew nearly 75 percent over five days, and CoreCivic stock went up nearly 68 percent. But some remain skeptical that Trump will be able to — or truly want to — build the infrastructure needed to carry out millions of deportations. 'Is he going to deport 20 million people? I really don't think so. That's unrealistic,' said Rob Wilson, president of Employco USA, a national human resources firm. Still, Wilson said companies should prepare for Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids by screening for proper work authorization. 'The good thing is unemployment — it's turned back to an employer market versus an employee market so the employers can be a little bit more selective. A couple of years ago, when people still weren't working coming off of COVID, it was the employees who were really running the marketplace. And now those have flipped. So as an employer, I just think you've got a little bit more flexibility,' said Wilson. That flies contrary to two central tenets of the immigration advocacy world: belief in Trump’s threats and that the U.S. economy is dependent on undocumented labor. According to Hincapié, Democrats have historically missed the opportunity to communicate the latter. 'You can just do three bullets and say that message time and time again to shift the conversation away from just the border to human beings who everybody in the United States relates to in one way or the other,' she said. 'If you eat in this country, you owe that to immigrants. If you go to a restaurant. You go to, you know, shopping. You have children who need to be taken care of. You have an elderly or a family member who is ill, guess what? Who is taking care, who is rebuilding our cities after climate disasters, is immigrants, and so they just haven't done that, right? They haven't told the stories of who we are and who will be impacted by Trump's agenda.' Though Trump’s immigration message has been the through line of his political career, his pledge to fix economic woes is what most resonated with voters; according to NBC News exit polling, 32 percent of voters in key states named the economy as their top issue, while only 11 percent pointed to immigration. 'While the dust is still settling on how Latinos actually voted in this election, it's clear that our community is primarily concerned with the economy and the same pocketbook issues as other Americans, such as the rising costs of food, housing and other essentials. Deep concerns with inflation and making ends meet almost singularly drove how Hispanics voted in this election,' said Janet Murguía, president of UnidosUS, in a postelection statement. Of the 11 percent of voters who prioritized immigration, 90 percent voted for Republicans and only 9 percent for Democrats, showing that Vice President Harris’s immigration pitch resonated much less than her positions on abortion or on defending democracy, the top issue for 34 percent of voters in the poll. 'In a year where the stakes could not be higher, young, Black, Brown, queer, and working-class communities urged Vice President Harris and Democrats as a whole to embrace pro-immigrant policies that resonate with the majority of young people,' Michelle Ming, political director of United We Dream Action, said in a statement. 'By refusing to run on a bold, progressive agenda, Democrats failed to lead with the message voters needed to stop an authoritarian from taking back the White House. We demand the Biden-Harris Administration, Congress, and state and local officials across the country leave no stone unturned in delivering vital protections for immigrants at this moment. No matter what, we are ready to put our bodies on the line to protect our communities.' For decades, advocates have fought an uphill battle to keep immigration a priority for Latino voters, many of whom have never seen Congress pass significant legislation on the issue. Though the dispersion of the Latino vote — gender, national origin, age and geographical gaps tell the story of the 2024 Hispanic electorate — makes it a precarious constituency, in poll after poll large majorities of Latinos say they favor a path to citizenship. 'The obligatory question is what could Democrats have done to stop the erosion among the voters that comprise their base, like Latinos. For decades, Democrats have been told they cannot assume they have absolute support among specific sectors. They have to invest and court that vote and not only go out looking for it during election season. The Democrats knew about the erosion of support among Latino men. Still, they didn't have a sense of urgency, perhaps thinking they would win the Hispanic vote at any rate, even with a lower percentage,' wrote Maribel Hastings, a senior adviser for America’s Voice, in an op-ed widely distributed throughout Spanish-language media. America’s Voice is a leading progressive immigration advocacy group, formed by longtime advocate Frank Sharry in 2008, amid comprehensive immigration reform negotiations that momentarily brought the far sides of the political spectrum to the same table. Even before Trump’s first term, lines of communication between immigration advocates and restrictionists had been severed, and there will be little motivation to mend that rift in a second Trump administration. But immigrant advocates have been laying the groundwork for advocacy on economic terms, highlighting immigrants, documented and undocumented, as a force in both the labor and consumer markets, and they see an opening to engage a broader electorate concerned with civil rights under Trump. 'I know that there is a broader political constituency that we haven't been tapping into, and that that is who we need to build with. And frankly, I would say that there are a lot of people that supported Trump, that voted for Trump, that voted because of the economic issues or for other issues, or because, you know, strong man attitude, like whether it was machismo that led that, whatever, for whatever reason, we need to bring them back. We need to get them to understand,' said Hincapié. The prevailing frustration and anger in the immigration advocacy world is not only directed at Trump, but at those voters. 'Despite everything, people in the United States gave him a second term,' wrote Hastings in her Spanish-language op-ed. 'Buckle up because there is a lot of turbulence ahead.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/immigration-advocates-brace-for-trump-buckle-up/	2024-11-10T13:08:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/migrants_mexico_11072024ap.jpg?w=900

Trump's win cements Florida as deep-red state	Former President Trump cemented Florida’s status as a deep-red state on Tuesday, flipping multiple counties up and down the state. Miami-Dade County saw a Republican win at the presidential level for the first time in 36 years, while the greater Tampa area also went red. Trump also flipped Jacksonville’s Duval County and large swaths of blue-leaning Central Florida. South Dakota Republican says Thune will ‘be a great leader’ for Senate Trump carried the state by 13 points on Tuesday, dramatically improving on his roughly 3-point margin in 2020 and his 1-point margin in 2016. While Florida has been on a GOP trajectory for nearly ten years, Trump’s victory and Vice President Harris’s underperformance underscores the degree to which he has tightened his political hold on the state and is also emblematic of the former president’s over-performance on election night. 'I looked at Duval and I said Duval is a microcosm of Georgia,' said Florida Republican strategist Ford O’Connell. 'He wins this by five, he’s going to win Georgia for sure.' The economy and immigration reigned supreme for voters’ top issues in Florida, like in much of the country. According to the AP VoteCast, 41 percent of voters said the economy was their most important issue, followed by immigration at 23 percent and abortion at nine percent. Trump’s GOP skeptics in Congress face lonely path forward 'Now we have Trump crushing it by 13 points. Part of that is kind of an affirmation of [Trump’s] agenda on issues like immigration, economy and inflation,' said Justin Sayfie, a Florida-based Republican strategist. Other Republicans have attributed the increased success in the state, in part, to a conservative populist message on issues like immigration and the economy. 'What Trump helped add to the conversation is he helped a lot of Florida politicians speak populist conservatism. I mean, that’s how you win Miami Dade,' O’Connell said. The messaging played well with the state’s Latino population, particularly in South Florida’s Miami Dade County and Central Florida’s Osceola County. Trump notably flipped Osceola County, which was carried by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden by double digits, by just over one point. Miami Dade is home to a large Cuban American population, while Osceola County is home to a sizable Puerto Rican population, Sayfie and other Florida Republicans argue that Tuesday night’s results were the culmination of a number of factors, like over 10 years of population growth in the state, Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R) widely praised handling of the coronavirus pandemic and a strengthened GOP infrastructure. Trump notably made Florida the center of the Republican universe when he became a resident of the state in 2020. Trump resistance rises in states led by Democratic governors 'This didn’t happen overnight,' O’Connell said. 'Mechanically it started with Rick Scott,' he continued, referring to Scott’s first gubernatorial victory in 2010. 'After that first one, the Florida Republican Party really started the voter registration drive,' O’Connell said. There are currently over one million more registered Republicans than Democrats in the state. Scott, who served two terms as governor, won reelection to the Senate on Tuesday, improving on his past statewide margins of victory in Florida. The senator in the past had narrowly won his election and reelection bids in the state, but defeated former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel Powell (D-Fla.) by over 12 points on Tuesday. Chris Hartline, a senior adviser to the Scott campaign, attributed much of the victory to Republicans’ voter registration advantage in the state. 'It’s really hard to compare Florida to what’s happening in other places in the country,' Hartline said. 'We won Hillsborough, we won Pinellas, we won Seminole, we performed better in Orange. Is that because of a failure of Harris with suburban voters or is it because we have more registered Republicans in the state than we used to?' 'And it’s hard to not completely ignore the tactical side of it, which is Florida Democrats do not have a functioning party,' he added. Florida Democrats argued that there were bright spots on Tuesday, including a 25-percent increase in turnout from 2022, and the fact that a majority of voters favored legislation that would have enshrined abortion rights in the state. The measure ultimately failed because it did not meet the 60-percent threshold. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

But like Democrats across the country, the party in Florida is grappling with what went wrong nationally and within their home state. 'Democrats had a disaster at the top of the ticket, which I publicly stated at the beginning of the race,' said John Morgan, a prominent Central Florida-based attorney and Democratic donor. 'Florida is officially Texas and Pennsylvania is officially Florida,' he continued. However there are Florida Republicans that are urging their colleagues to not get too comfortable in the state, warning that the same conditions that helped Republicans in the state could help Democrats down the road. 'At this moment, Florida is a red state, but I don’t think the Republicans can get cocky and the reason is simple. You have a very transient population and things change and eventually the Democrats may get it together,' O’Connell said. 'Parties are set up in our two-party system so they can reinvent themselves. That’s why you can’t get cocky.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-florida-deep-red-state/	2024-11-10T12:02:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/florida_manchester_AssociatedPress.jpeg?w=900

'I’ve known John Thune since the 1980s, he's gonna be a great leader,' Rounds told NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt on 'The Hill Sunday.' Ruben Gallego projected to win Arizona US Senate seat 'But the nice thing for Republicans is we've got three really quality individuals that are vying for the top office as the majority leader, and so, I've got nothing bad to say about any of the other two candidates, but I think we've got a real winner in John Thune,' he added. Thune is facing off against Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) for long-serving Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) position. Republicans are also set to take control of the Senate in January due to the results of Tuesday’s election. 'And here's part of the deal,' Rounds said in his 'The Hill Sunday' appearance. 'He wants change in the Senate. He wants the Senate to actually get back and actually work. Let's actually try to get some things done on time for a change.' Thune has recently been pushing President-elect Trump to not intervene in the race for leadership of the Senate Republicans, and has said that it is in the president-elect’s 'best interests' to not take a side.

'He’s terrified. He knows that Trump won’t endorse him. If he knows that, then Trump getting involved hurts him,' a Senate Republican aide said.

Dog the Bounty Hunter expands search for Tennessee teen missing s...	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — It's been roughly nine months since Sebastian Rogers, 15, disappeared from his Hendersonville, Tennessee, home, launching extensive search efforts by several law enforcement agencies. A celebrity bounty hunter, who recently joined the search for Sebastian, says it may be time to expand it internationally. In the first few months after Sebastian's February disappearance, agencies continued to actively search for the teen but never came across any sightings of him. Law enforcement has since pulled back to focus on the 'investigative side.' However, Seth Rogers, Sebastian's biological father, never stopped searching. In September, Duane Chapman, also known as Dog the Bounty Hunter, joined the search efforts. His first act was to raise the reward money for information from $50,000 to $100,000. PREVIOUS | Bounty hunter Duane ‘Dog’ Chapman joins search for Sebastian Rogers 'This is one of the most horrendous cases of missing children that we’ve ever, ever worked on,' Chapman, well-known for his TV show, 'Dog the Bounty Hunter,' previously explained. Last week, Chapman raised the reward amount for information again to $175,000 after his team said he received 'valuable' information and leads in Oregon and New York. Bryndis Davis, the lead high-task force investigator for AtNight Intelligence Agency and Dog the Bounty Hunter, told Nexstar's WKRN she hopes the increase in reward money will develop further assistance from the public. 'We want to motivate anyone with information to please step forward and potentially help break the case wide open,' Davis expressed. 'We are signaling to the public that help is crucial right now.' Father of missing teen, Dog the Bounty Hunter file lawsuit against influencers However, investigators with Chapman's team are not ruling out any possible leads in Canada and along its border. According to the AtNight Intelligence Agency, two notifications were issued requesting immediate awareness on ports of entry into the United States and Canada. 'We have pinpointed some credible leads in Oregon and New York, near the Canadian border,' Davis said. 'There are several active investigation zones where we are working on the case closely with locals and initiated a rapid reach notification to all U.S. towns that border Canada.' The documents request vigilance from national law enforcement agencies with specific attention to motels, hotels, bus stations, and similar public facilities. 'It's about how seriously we take these new leads and our dedication to using every tool at our disposal to find answers,' Davis concluded. In the meantime, the investigative group is looking to add more team members by February and March. Anyone who has any information concerning Sebastian's whereabouts can call Chapman’s tip line at 833-835-5364, call the Sumner County Sheriff’s Office at 615-451-3838, or contact the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation at 1-800-TBI-FIND or TipsToTBI@tbi.tn.gov.

NY forest ranger dies fighting fires; air quality warnings are is...	POMPTON LAKES, N.J. (AP) — A New York forest ranger died battling one of a number of wildfires in New Jersey and New York amid dry conditions that have prompted air quality warnings in both states, authorities said Sunday. The Eastern Dutchess County Fire and Rescue said the New York state forestry service reported that the forest ranger, whose name was not released, died when a tree fell on him Saturday afternoon as he battled a major brush fire along the New York-New Jersey border, officials said. 'Rip brother your shift is over job well done,' the post said. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Forest Fire Service reported the sprawling blaze had spread to more than 3 square miles (about 8 square kilometers) near the border in Passaic County’s West Milford and Orange County, New York. Dubbed the Jennings Creek wildfire, it was threatening two homes and eight buildings in the Long Pond Ironworks Historic District. Health advisories were issued for parts of New York and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality due to smoke from the fires. People were urged to limit strenuous outdoor physical activity if possible; those especially sensitive included the very young and very old and people with ailments such as asthma and heart disease. New Jersey officials, meanwhile, reported 75 percent containment of a 175-acre (70-hectare) fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County that was threatening 55 homes, although no evacuations had been ordered. Progress was also reported on fires in the Bethany Run area on the border of Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees townships; a blaze along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County; and the Pheasant Run wildfire in the Glassboro wildlife protection area of Gloucester County. Prosecutors in Ocean County on late Saturday afternoon announced arson and firearms charges in connection with a 350-acre (142-hectare) Jackson Township fire that started Wednesday. They said it was sparked by magnesium shards from a shotgun round on the berm of a shooting range. Officials said firing that kind of 'incendiary or tracer ammunition' was barred in the state. The majority of the blaze has been contained, officials reported Friday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/ap-ny-forest-ranger-dies-fighting-fires-air-quality-warnings-are-issued-in-new-york-and-new-jersey/	2024-11-10T08:15:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6730dc787aaa26.84095364.jpeg?w=900
Young Black, Latino men say they chose Trump because of the econo...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Brian Leija, a 31-year-old small-business owner from Belton, Texas, was not surprised that a growing number of Latino men of his generation voted for Donald Trump for president this year. Leija had voted for the Republican in 2016 and 2020. Leija's rationale was simple: He said he has benefited from Trump’s economic policies, especially tax cuts. 'I am a blue-collar worker,' Leija said. 'So, tax breaks for small businesses are ideal for what I do.' For DaSean Gallishaw, a consultant in Fairfax, Virginia, a vote for Trump was rooted in what he saw as Democrats' rhetoric not matching their actions. 'It’s been a very long time since the Democrats ever really kept their promises to what they’re going to do for the minority communities,' he said. Gallishaw, 25, who is Black, also voted for Trump twice before. This year, he said, he thought the former president’s 'minority community outreach really showed up.' Trump gained a larger share of Black and Latino voters than he did in 2020, when he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and most notably among men under age 45, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters. Even as Democrat Kamala Harris won majorities of Black and Latino voters, it wasn’t enough to give the vice president the White House, because of the gains Trump made. Economy and jobs made men under age 45 more open to Trump Voters overall cited the economy and jobs as the most important issue the country faced. That was true for Black and Hispanic voters as well. About 3 in 10 Black men under age 45 went for Trump, roughly double the share he got in 2020. Young Latinos, particularly young Latino men, also were more open to Trump than in 2020. Roughly half of young Latino men voted for Harris, compared with about 6 in 10 who went for Biden. Juan Proaño, CEO of LULAC, the nation’s largest and oldest civil rights organization for Hispanic Americans, said the election results make it clear that Trump's messaging on the economy resonated with Latinos. 'I think it’s important to say that Latinos have a significant impact in deciding who the next president was going to be and reelected Donald Trump,' Proaño said. '(Latino) men certainly responded to the populist message of the president and focused primarily on economic issues, inflation, wages and even support of immigration reform.' The Rev. Derrick Harkins, a minister who has served Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, has overseen outreach to Black American religious communities for more than a decade. He said that Trump's hypermasculine appeal worked to win over some younger men of color. 'I think that Trump with this bogus machismo has been effective amongst the young men, Black, white, Hispanic,' Harkins said. 'And I think unfortunately, even if it’s a very small percentage, you know, when you’re talking about an election like we just had it can be very impactful.' Black and Latino voters’ priorities changed from 2020 While about 4 in 10 young voters under 45 across racial and ethnic groups identified the economy as the top issue facing the country, older white and Latino voters were likely to also cite immigration, with about one-quarter of each saying that was the top issue. A clear majority of young Black voters described the economy as 'not so good' or 'poor,' compared with about half of older Black voters. Majorities of Latino voters, regardless of age, said the economy is in bad shape. That belief made it more difficult for Harris to highlight the actual numbers in the economy, which show that inflation has receded dramatically, unemployment remains low and wages have risen. These voters simply did not feel that progress. This is the first time Alexis Uscanga, a 20-year-old college student from Brownville, Texas, voted in a presidential election. The economy and immigration are the issues that drove him to vote for Trump, he said. 'Everything just got a lot more expensive than it once was for me,' Uscanga said. 'Gas, grocery shopping even as a college student, everything has gone up in price and that is a big concern for me and other issues like immigration.' Having grown up selling tamales and used cars, and washing cars, Uscanga knows how hard it can be to make a living. When Trump was president, he said, it did not feel that way, he said. 'Under the Trump presidency more opportunities were abound,' Uscanga said. 'I was not very fond of President Trump because of his rhetoric in 2016 but I look aside from that and how we were living in 2018, 2019, I just felt that we lived a good life no matter what the media was saying and that’s why I started supporting him after that.' Though the shift of votes to Trump from Black and Latino men was impactful, Trump could not have won without the support of a majority of white voters. 'Men of color are really beginning to emerge as the new swing voters,' said Terrance Woodbury, co-founder of HIT Strategies, a polling and research firm that conducted studies for the Harris campaign. 'For a long time, we talked about suburban women and soccer moms who can swing the outcome of elections. Now men of color are really beginning to emerge as that, especially younger men of color, who are less ideological, less tied to a single party, and more likely to swing either between parties or in and out of the electorate,' Woodbury said. Desire for strong leadership made Trump more appealing A majority of voters nationally said Trump was a strong leader; slightly fewer than half said the same about Harris. Among Hispanic voters, even more saw Trump as strong in this election. Roughly 6 in 10 Hispanic men described Trump as a strong leader, compared with 43% who said that in 2020. About half of Hispanic women said Trump was a strong leader, up from 37%. Black men and women were about twice as likely as in 2020 to describe Trump as a strong leader. David Means, a purchasing manager in Atlanta who is Black, abstained from voting in the election because he did not feel either Harris or Trump was making the right appeals to Black men. But the results of the election did not disappoint him. 'I’m satisfied with the result. I don’t feel slighted. I wasn’t let down. I wasn’t pulling for Trump or Kamala, but I did not want a woman in that position, he said. And if it were to be a woman, Means said, 'I’d rather have a really strong and smart woman, for example, like Judge Judy.' ___ Figueroa reported from Austin, Texas.

The Army's answer to a lack of recruits is a prep course to boost...	FORT JACKSON, S.C. (AP) — Index cards taped to a large board on the wall at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, reveal the sometimes blunt and gritty reasons that new recruits took a chance at a last-ditch program to get into the Army. 'Eviction notices motivate me,' one said. Others talked about getting free college, a good job and a way to better themselves. Known as the 'Why Wall,' the board is meant as an inspiration for the recruits who could not meet the Army's physical and academic test standards, so they went into the Future Soldier Prep Course. It provides weeks of instruction to help them bring up their scores. Started as a trial program two years ago to help boost dismal recruiting numbers, the prep course is fueling the Army’s enlistment comeback. Recruiting has suffered for all the military branches in recent years coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, amid low unemployment and stiff competition from private companies able to pay more and provide similar or better benefits. By the end of this budget year on Sept. 30, the Army had made its recruiting goal of 55,000, and service leaders said more than 13,000 of those recruits — or 24% — came into active duty through the prep course. Army leaders increased the goal to 61,000 for this year and are relying on the prep course to provide a significant chunk again. During a recent visit to Fort Jackson, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth spoke with recruits and program leaders to see how the course is going and what changes may need to be made. She said the successful program, which more than 31,000 trainees have gone through since it started, deserves to be made permanent. Wormuth said the Army may make adjustments based on a long-term study on the recruits coming out of the course, including looking at how well they did in their first enlistment and whether there were behavioral or disciplinary problems. 'We really want to see what kind of soldier kind of comes out at the back end of that first term, how do they do in terms of discipline,' Wormuth said. Drill sergeants have expressed concerns that they are seeing more discipline issues, disrespect and complaints from trainees in the academic course. And they say trainees whose first language is not English have a more difficult time understanding orders and dealing with computers. While they see fewer discipline issues from recruits in the fitness section, they do see more injuries, including ankle, knee and hip problems. Those trainees, they say, may need to be brought along even more slowly, to increase their strength and conditioning, rather than moving them to basic training the minute they hit the minimum level of requirements. Commanders told Wormuth that the fitness program aims to give trainees a healthy foundation in eating and working out. Instructors said they do not want to break the recruits before they get to basic training, so they do a lot of yoga, stretching and other exercises to help avoid injuries. In the classrooms, they are learning basic math, English and other academic skills. The bulk of recruits going through the program are in the academic course. So far, Wormuth said, the data does not reflect some of the concerns expressed by drill sergeants and commanders. Instead, she and other Army leaders said that on average, the graduation rate from basic training is a bit higher — about 94% — for those who went through the program versus those who did not, which is about 92%. But so far, they are taking inspiration from the thoughts scrawled on the 'Why Wall.' Company commanders came up with the idea last year, to let recruits lay out their goals in their first few days so they can go back every week to get motivated or see their progress. A bright yellow sign atop the board tells recruits: 'Your WHY will keep you going even when you want to QUIT the most.' The answer for many was they had something to prove — to themselves and others. 'I joined the Army because my family thought I couldn’t accomplish anything in life. So I had to prove them wrong,' one said. Another wrote: 'I wanna show my family I’m worth something.' Others said they wanted to 'be a better man,' 'gain my independence' and 'prove to myself that I can accomplish something and I'm not a quitter.' One recruit was blunt: 'To prove to her I’m not gonna turn into who she said I’d become.' Recruits lined up near the wall told Wormuth that the physical fitness program is working for them. Couper Godleski, from Pennsylvania, said that in 10 weeks he had lost 20 pounds. Britney Vaughn, from Louisiana, said she had lost 30 pounds in six weeks. And while she said she is missing her 3-year-old daughter, 'I feel like everything will be worth it.' On the academic side, recruits told Wormuth that even as they struggle with math or English comprehension, they are getting help from instructors while learning the structure and discipline of the Army. A key goal, said one female recruit, is 'to be a role model to my nieces and nephews' and get money for college so she doesn't have to be in debt. For Wormuth, the visit confirmed Army leaders' intention to keep the program going. Recruiting challenges are not going to end, she said. 'I think we’re going to probably continue to see pretty low unemployment. We’re still going to see 60% go to college. It’s a more competitive labor market,' she said. 'So we’re going to have to keep fighting hard for our new recruits.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/ap-the-armys-answer-to-a-lack-of-recruits-is-a-prep-course-to-boost-low-scores-its-working/	2024-11-10T04:48:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6730ac696fc928.12210338.jpeg?w=900
Ruben Gallego projected to win Arizona US Senate seat	(NewsNation) — NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ has called the race for the U.S. Senate seat for Arizona in favor of Ruben Gallego. See all Arizona race results here. The race between U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., and Republican Kari Lake, who unsuccessfully ran for Arizona governor two years ago, was one of the closest watched Senate races this election cycle. The battle to replace outgoing Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who decided not to seek reelection, has been a critical race for Democrats to maintain their razor-thin majority in the U.S. Senate. Arizona has also been a battleground state that is critical for Democrats to win in order to stay in the White House. Gallego, a Marine combat veteran once serving in the Iraqi invasion, received endorsements from dozens of Republicans, including former aides to the late Republican Sen. John McCain, who was also a veteran. He was also endorsed by the Arizona Police Association, a blow to Lake who’d been backed by the group in 2022. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Lake, a former news anchor, has been a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, vehemently repeating his unfounded claims that he won the 2020 election. Her support was reciprocated with endorsements from the former president in both 2022 and 2024. 'If you want to get to President Trump, you have to get through me,' her Senate campaign website reads. Lake narrowly lost her 2022 gubernatorial bid to then-Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs but refused to accept the results, falsely blaming election fraud and voter disenfranchisement. Gallego’s campaign centered around raising the federal minimum wage, reinstating abortion rights and improving veterans' rights. The son of a single, immigrant mother, Gallego has voted for funding to hire and deploy thousands more Border Patrol agents and says he supports border security. Lake’s campaign also focused on increased border security, along with making America energy-dominant, reducing inflation and returning abortion policy decision-making to the states.

Watch live results from the presidential election, important swing states and the balance of power in Congress. NewsNation will also be tracking your local state elections and impactful ballot initiatives around the country. As of late September, Gallego held a 3-1 fundraising advantage and a double-digit polling advantage over Lake. This was one of eight open Senate races where the incumbent did not run for re-election. A total of 34 Senate seats are up in 2024 with 23 being held by Democrats and independents. Republicans can retake control of the upper chamber of Congress by stealing two seats from Democrats or by winning the 2024 presidential election and stealing just one other seat. As a result, the outcome of this race will affect the balance of power within the Senate in 2025.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/arizona-senate-results-lake-gallego/	2024-11-09T18:04:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Thumb-Arizona-Ruben-Gallego.jpg?w=900
Qatar suspends its mediation efforts on Gaza and the Hamas office...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Qatar has suspended its key mediation efforts between Hamas and Israel, it said Saturday, after growing frustration with the lack of progress on a cease-fire deal for Gaza. It wasn't immediately clear whether the remaining Hamas leadership hosted by Qatar must leave, or where it would go. Hamas has good relations with Iran and Turkey, and some of its leaders are now in Lebanon. However, Qatar is highly likely to return to mediation efforts if both sides show 'serious political willingness' to reach a deal, according to an official with Egypt, the other key mediator. Qatar told Israel and Hamas it can't continue to mediate 'as long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith' and 'as a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose' in Qatar, a diplomatic source briefed on the matter said. Qatar told Hamas it will have to leave if it isn't ready to engage in serious negotiations, the source said. In Washington, a U.S. official said the Biden administration informed Qatar two weeks ago that the Hamas office's continued operation in Doha was no longer useful and the Hamas delegation should be expelled. A senior U.S. official said that after Hamas rejected the last proposal for a cease-fire, Qatar accepted the advice and informed the Hamas delegation of the decision 10 days ago. A senior Hamas official said they were aware of Qatar’s decision to suspend mediation efforts, 'but no one told us to leave.' Hamas has repeatedly called for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza as a condition for any cease-fire deal. Israel seeks the return of all hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and insists on a presence in Gaza. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The Israeli prime minister’s office had no comment. Late Saturday, the state-run Qatar News Agency published comments attributed to Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, confirming that Doha informed parties in the talks 10 days ago that it 'would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round.' 'Qatar will resume those efforts with its partners when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war and the ongoing suffering of civilians,' the report said. There continued to be no end in sight to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon, where Israel’s military said it struck command centers and other militant infrastructure in Beirut’s southern suburbs and elsewhere. An Israeli airstrike on the southern port city of Tyre late Friday killed at least seven, officials and a resident said. Hezbollah 'should continue (the fight) and we will continue to back them up even if we lose our families, our homes, and end up in the dirt,' said one Beirut resident, Mohammed Mekdad, as people searched the smoking rubble. In Gaza, Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people on Saturday, Palestinian medical officials said, while Israel announced the first delivery of humanitarian aid in weeks to the territory's hungry, devastated north. One strike hit a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City’s eastern Tufah neighborhood, killing at least six people, the territory's Health Ministry said. Two local journalists, a pregnant woman and a child were among the dead, it said. Israel's army said the strike targeted a militant belonging to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, offering no evidence. Another Israeli strike killed seven people, including two women and a child in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital. Israel's army didn't respond to a request for comment. And an Israeli strike hit tents in the courtyard of central Gaza’s main hospital, killing at least three people and wounding a local journalist, Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah said. It was the eighth Israeli attack on the compound since March. Israel says aid trucks reach northern Gaza The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, said 11 aid trucks containing food, water and medical equipment reached the enclave's far north on Thursday. It's the first time any aid has reached there since Israel began a new military campaign last month. But not all the aid reached the agreed drop-off points, according to the the U.N. World Food Program. In the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya, Israeli troops stopped one convoy bound for nearby Beit Lahiya and ordered the supplies to be offloaded, WFP spokesperson Alia Zaki said. Israel’s offensive has focused on Jabaliya, where Israel says Hamas had regrouped. Other areas affected include Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun just north of Gaza City. U.S. deadline is looming for Israel The aid announcement came days before a U.S. deadline demanding that Israel improve aid deliveries across Gaza or risk losing access to U.S. weapons funding. The U.S. says Israel must allow a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying food and other supplies. A report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, issued Thursday said there's a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in parts of northern Gaza, the territory's most isolated area. COGAT rejected those findings and said the report relied 'on partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests.' No emergency services functioning north of Gaza City The U.N. estimates that tens of thousands of people remain in northern Gaza. Earlier this week, the Health Ministry said there were no ambulances or emergency crews operating north of Gaza City. The conflict has left 90% of Palestinians in Gaza displaced, according to U.N. figures. More than a year of war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They don't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third believed to be dead. 'It has been 400 days and the hostages are still in Gaza. There is a war without a direction. It’s so sad,' said Eial Tiskim, who attended the latest protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday night to demand a cease-fire deal. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Lee from Washington.

Trump names inaugural committee co-chair, rules out Haley and Pom...	Former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler will co-chair President-elect Trump’s inaugural committee alongside Steve Witkoff, Trump's campaign announced Saturday. The Republican leader said the committee will 'honor' his victory in the 2024 election. 'The Trump Vance Inaugural Committee will honor this magnificent victory in a celebration of the American People and our nation,' Trump said in a statement. 'This will be the kick-off to my administration, which will deliver on bold promises to Make America Great Again,' he added. 'Together, we will celebrate this moment, steeped on history and tradition, and then get to work to achieve the most incredible future for our people, restoring strength, success, and common sense to the Oval Office.' Trump resistance rises in states led by Democratic governors Loeffler was appointed to the Senate in 2019 by Gov. Brian Kemp (R) due to a resignation from former Sen. Johnny Isakson (R). While in office, she was a staunch supporter of Trump and supported a lawsuit seeking to overturn the 2020 election results but spoke out against the measure after the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. The selections come after Trump tapped longtime senior advisor Susie Wilkes to serve as chief of staff. She will be the first woman in history hold the position. A guide to key figures in Donald Trump’s orbit On Truth Social, the incoming president also mentioned two people who won't be joining his administration: former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State and CIA Director Mike Pompeo. 'I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,' the president-elect said in the Saturday post. 'I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country,' he continued. 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' While campaigning, Trump's opponents alleged he did not like to be 'challenged by women' and Trump received flack for telling people he’d protect the demographic whether they 'like it or not.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-names-inaugural-committee-co-chair-rules-out-haley-and-pompeo/	2024-11-09T16:59:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP21005187029238-e1694210693733.jpg?w=900
Jury convicts two men accused of plotting to kill Border Patrol a...	(NewsNation) — A jury in Missouri has convicted two men on a long list of charges stemming from their alleged conspiracy to murder U.S. Border Patrol agents, and for shooting at FBI agents when the two men were captured. The federal court jury in Jefferson City, Mo., on Thursday found Jonathan S. O’Dell, of Warsaw, Mo., and Bryan C. Perry, of Clarksville, Tenn., guilty in connection with what prosecutors said was a plan to recruit members to their group called the '2nd Amendment Militia' in 2022. American woman, 3 migrants charged with running Texas migrant stash house 'Perry posted a video on TikTok in which he discussed illegal immigrants coming into the United States from Mexico,' said the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri. 'Perry stated that the U.S. Border Patrol was committing treason by allowing these illegal immigrants to enter the United States, and that the penalty for treason was death,' the statement added. In later posts, Perry said he was 'ready to go to war against this government,' and that 'we were going out huntin’'. On Oct. 7, 2022, the day before the men said they were going to travel to the border, FBI agents raided O’Dell’s home. After an exchange of gunfire, O’Dell and his girlfriend surrendered, but Perry aborted his apparent surrender and fought with agents who eventually subdued him. El Paso Sector sees people trying to cross border before Trump win Between their capture and their trial, O’Dell escaped from a county jail and was on the run for three days before being recaptured in Ray County, Mo. According to the U.S. Attorney’s statement, both Perry and O’Dell face mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years in federal prison without parole. The maximum sentence would be life without parole. There is no word yet on when the two will be sentenced.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/militia-convicted-border-patrol-agents/	2024-11-09T14:39:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-57610138.jpg?w=822
FEMA employee fired for directing team to avoid homes with Trump ...	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — A FEMA employee was terminated over the weekend after reportedly advising her survivor assistance team not to go to Florida homes with yard signs supporting President-elect Donald Trump. In a statement sent out Saturday afternoon, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell confirmed that the employee had been fired, adding that her actions were 'reprehensible.' Judge agrees to pause Jan. 6 case after Trump’s election win 'This is a clear violation of FEMA's core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation,' Criswell said. According to FEMA, the matter was referred to the Office of Special Counsel, and officials have been working to ensure similar acts do not happen again. The agency did not specify which neighborhoods in Florida were being canvassed by the employee's team. However, the incident comes as relief workers have been aiding those affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton in several parts of the state. 'I want to be clear to all of my employees and the American people, this type of behavior and action will not be tolerated at FEMA, and we will hold people accountable if they violate these standards of conduct,' Criswell added in her statement. Hurricanes, storms cost US $500 billion this year: Analysis FEMA did not provide any additional details on how officials were notified of the employee's actions, nor the exact circumstances surrounding the incident. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took to social media to comment following initial reports of the alleged misconduct. In a post on X, DeSantis said he had directed state officials to investigate the matter further. 'The blatant weaponization of government by partisan activists in the federal bureaucracy is yet another reason why the Biden-Harris administration is in its final days,' the governor wrote. 'At my direction, the Division of Emergency Management is launching an investigation into the federal government’s targeted discrimination of Floridians who support Donald Trump.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/fema-employee-fired-trump-sign/	2024-11-09T13:31:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/YardSignsHarrisTrumpGettyImages-2174737008-e1730401432832_4af2cd.jpg?w=800
Diddy files for bail for 4th time, judge rejects gag order reques...	(NewsNation) — The last 24 hours for Sean 'Diddy' Combs has been a period of denial, developments and details. Diddy's lawyers filed a fourth request for bail in a Manhattan federal court Friday, citing new evidence in his case on sex trafficking and racketeering charges. Also on Friday, a judge rejected his 'unprecedented' gag order request, filed last month, that would bar victims and their lawyers from speaking publicly about the case. The rapper's attorneys claimed 'inflammatory extrajudicial statements' were impeding his right to a fair trial. But Judge Arun Subramanian contended implementing a gag order would violate the victims' free speech under the First Amendment.

Mitchell told NewsNation's 'Banfield' Thursday that her client, Courtney Burgess, was given 11 flash drives containing at least eight sex tapes involving eight celebrities. Diddy’s team 'is pissed, to say the least,' she said. Diddy’s lawyer: ‘Improper pretrial publicity’ preventing fair trial In September, Mitchell told NewsNation that another client of hers was contacted about the sale of one of the musician's alleged sex tapes.

US will appeal judge's ruling that 9/11 defendants can plead guil...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Defense Department will appeal a military judge's ruling that plea agreements struck by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, and two of his co-defendants are valid, a defense official said Saturday. The ruling this past week voided Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's order to throw out the deals and concluded that the plea agreements were valid. The judge granted the three motions to enter guilty pleas and said he would schedule them for a future date to be determined by the military commission. The department will also seek a postponement of any hearing on the pleas, according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss legal matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. Rear Adm. Aaron Rugh, the chief prosecutor, sent a letter Friday to the families of 9/11 victims informing them of the decision. The ruling by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, allowed the three 9/11 defendants to enter guilty pleas in the U.S. military courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and would spare them the risk of the death penalty. The pleas by Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi would be a key step toward closing out the long-running and legally troubled government prosecution in the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense lawyers under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at Guantanamo had approved the agreements. But the deals were immediately slammed by Republican lawmakers and others when they were made public this summer. Within days, Austin issued an order saying he was nullifying them. He said plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary. The judge had ruled that Austin lacked the legal authority to toss out the plea deals. The agreements, and Austin’s attempt to reverse them, have made for one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties. That includes years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants, given their torture in CIA custody. While families of some of the victims and others are adamant that the 9/11 prosecutions continue until trial and possible death sentences, legal experts say it is not clear that could ever happen. If the 9/11 cases ever clear the hurdles of trial, verdicts and sentencings, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would likely hear many of the issues in the course of any death penalty appeals. The issues include the CIA destruction of videos of interrogations, whether Austin’s plea deal reversal constituted unlawful interference and whether the torture of the men tainted subsequent interrogations by 'clean teams' of FBI agents that did not involve violence.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-us-will-appeal-judges-ruling-that-9-11-defendants-can-plead-guilty-and-avoid-the-death-penalty/	2024-11-09T09:43:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/672fa00ce1a564.94459298.jpeg?w=900

What a Trump administration could mean for education	(NewsNation) — 'Save American education' is one of President-elect Donald Trump's pillars to his approach in reforming the American school system. What does that look like? From changing Title IX to eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, Trump's proposed policies will affect the future of curriculum in public schools. Donald Trump has sweeping plans for a second administration. Here’s what he’s proposed Trump's main education policies In the early stages of the presidential race, Trump laid out 10 principles for his education policy plan. 'Rather than indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material, which is what we're doing now, our schools must be totally refocused to prepare our children to succeed in the world of work,' President Trump said in September 2023 address. He pledged to eliminate the Department of Education and to return school choice to the states. He vowed to 'restore' parental rights, meaning parents would know what their children are taught in the classroom, be able to openly communicate concerns with teachers and principals, protect children's privacy, be updated on acts of violence at schol, allow them to inspct professional development materials and be notified before an out-of-school guset speaks in class. They would also be able to review the budget and spending of the school, have the right to opt out of school healthcare services and be immediately notified if a teacher has 'worekd to change their children's name, pronouns or understanding of his or her gender.' Some of the proposed policies are already in place; parents can often have meetings with school staff, federal laws protect the privacy of children and schools notify parents through various channels of communication about violence or other concerning events that may occur. Trump also supports the election of principals by parents and will adjust increase or decrease funding to schools based on their policies. The future of the Department of Education Trump has voiced his desire to abolish the Department of Education since his first term in office. Under new proposed policies for his second term, Trump said he would remove 'the radicals who have infiltrated the federal Department of Education, and get to Congress reaffirm the president’s ability to remove recalcitrant employees from the job.' He also promised to cut federal funding for any school or program that pushes 'Critical Race Theory, gender ideology or other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children.' Critical race theory is defined as an academic field focused on the relationships between social conceptions of race and ethnicity, social and political laws and media. Trump said he would direct the DOE to open civil rights investigations into school districts engaging in 'race-based discrimination, including discrimination against Asian Americans.' Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security What will happen to Title IX? Keeping men out of women sports has been a pillar to Trump's and other Republicans' education policies. Title IX is a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in educational settings that receive federal funding. Transgender athletes are in jeopardy of being able to play in sports that are in line with their gender identity. For example, a transgender girl who wants to play on a girl's softball team would be required to play boys' baseball under Trump's policies, which violates Title IX under its current directions. Will student loans be forgiven under Trump? Student loan forgiveness was not a focus of the Trump campaign, unlike Biden's promise to cancel student loan repayment during his run for president. Trump largely has not addressed this topic, but some of his other policies, such as aboloshing the DOE, may impact student loans. What will Trump do on immigration, foreign policy? Trump's policies at a glance In summary, these are Trump's main education policies: Eliminate the Department of Education Cut federal funding for schools that promote critical race theory Bar transgender girls from playing in sports designated for boys Adjust funding for schools based on their policies 'Drastically' cut the number of school administrators including Diversity, Equity and Inclusion departments Adopt a 'Parental Bill of Rights' Implement a voting process to elect principals Allow parents to choose which public school their children attends Create a credentialing body to certify teachers Enhance discipline for students engaged in drug involvement Support concealed carry of weapons by teachers Protect the right to pray in schools Reinstate the 1776 Commission, which would adjust the history curriculum in schools	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-administration-education-policy/	2024-11-09T08:43:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/AP24081507390710-e1719339224991.jpg?w=800
Your paycheck may be larger in 2025, even if you don't get a rais...	(NEXSTAR) — While there's plenty of time left in November, you may already have something exciting to look forward to in 2025: a slightly larger paycheck, even without a raise. Why? Thank the IRS. As it does every year, the agency recently announced roughly five dozen changes to various tax provisions that will impact 2025 (and when we file taxes in 2026). Among the notable changes were standard deductions rising by 2.7% and individual tax brackets shifting. Will you have a three-payday November? How to tell Like others before it, the IRS's changes are meant to combat inflation. They are, however, smaller than we saw in 2024 and much smaller than in 2023. Those changes may have an impact on your paycheck, putting more money in your pocket — unless you got a raise of more than 2.7%, then that will also give you a boost. IRS tax provision updates can help cut back on 'bracket creep,' which occurs when inflation moves you into a higher income tax bracket or reduces how beneficial credits, deductions, and exemptions are, according to the Tax Foundation. Say, for example, you are making $101,000 this year. You fall into the third tax bracket, meaning you're taxed 10% on the first $11,600 you earn; 12% on the chunk between $11,601 and $47,149; then 22% on what you earn between $47,150 and $100,524; and 24% on every dollar above that. IRS unveils 2025 income tax brackets: Where do you fall? If you don't get a raise going into 2025, and remain at $101,000, you would not reach the 24% tax bracket. Instead, you would be taxed 10% on the first $11,925 you earn; 12% on the income between that threshold and $48,475; then 22% on the rest. (This is a simple example that did not take into account the standard deduction and other tax-related aspects.) If the brackets did not adjust, you would be stuck with a higher tax liability, despite your $101,000 salary having less buying power in 2025 because of inflation, the Tax Foundation explains. But, because the tax brackets are adjusting, you stand a chance of seeing less money withheld from your paycheck for federal taxes (your employer is able to calculate how much is withheld using your W2 and IRS documents). Gen Z is thriving financially in these US cities, new report says Even though your paycheck may grow in 2025, financial experts say it's important to remember you aren't exactly receiving 'extra' funds — they are intended to offset inflation. Inflation is down slightly in 2024 to 2.4%, U.S. Labor Department data from the previous 12 months, ending in September, shows. That's an improvement over 2023's 3.4% and 6.5% in 2022.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/your-paycheck-may-be-larger-in-2025-even-if-you-dont-get-a-raise/	2024-11-09T08:15:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1164644813-e1704995059280.jpg?w=800
Hurricanes, storms cost US $500 billion this year: Analysis	(The Hill) - Hurricanes and tropical storms have caused economic losses of nearly $500 billion as they have ravaged the country this year, according to analysis by AccuWeather. Experts estimated that the economic loss and damage from Hurricane Beryl, which hit the Gulf Coast in July, was between $28 billion to 32 billion. Hurricane Debby, which hit the Carolinas hardest a month later, imposed some $28 billion in damages, while Hurricane Francine cost about $9 billion. But the biggest economic trauma was delivered by hurricanes Helene and Milton, which swept through the South in late September in October, according to the AccuWeather experts. Hurricane Helene, which devastated parts of North Carolina, was estimated to have inflicted between $225 billion to $250 billion in total damage and economic loss — flooding homes, destroying roads, ripping up trees and leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without power, in some cases for weeks. To assist the state’s population, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dished out more than $194 million to individuals and households in the Tar Heel State, according to the agency’s data released late last month. Hurricane Milton, which ripped through Florida in early October, has caused between $160 billion and $180 billion in economic loss and total damage so far, according to the analysis. The storm intensified quickly, tearing through communities, destroying homes and filling the streets with mud as more than 3 million people were without power at one point. 'Our hearts go out to everyone impacted this hurricane season. This has been an incredibly costly and destructive hurricane season,' said AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter. But he noted the pain is far from over. 'It will take years for many of these communities, families and small businesses to recover. It could take a decade or longer to recover in some of the towns hit hardest by Helene,' he said. 'Some communities may never fully recover from the catastrophic inland flash flooding we witnessed this year.' The analysis comes as job growth in the month of October stalled at 12,000, according to data released by the Labor Department earlier this month. Some large strikes impacted the figure, but impacts from hurricanes Helene and Milton also played a role as forecasters had projected that the country would add around 115,000 jobs. 'The business and tourism losses are adding up quickly. Our estimates also consider the long-term healthcare costs,' Porter said. 'Hurricanes can take a tremendous toll on the health and well-being of people who survived these storms and were exposed to hazardous flood waters, toxic mud and dust, as well as mold and mildew inside damaged homes and apartments.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/climate/hurricanes-storms-cost-us-500-billion-this-year-analysis/	2024-11-09T05:55:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24287115642437-e1731096285758.jpg?w=900
Democrats' election reckoning pits liberals against centrists	The Democrats’ shellacking at the polls this week has triggered a feisty battle between the ideological wings of the party about what went wrong — and who bears the blame. Some liberals say the party didn’t tack far enough to the left to animate the base. Many centrists say it tacked too far to the left and scared away moderate voters in key battleground states. And Democratic leaders are now faced with the difficulty of working to ease the tensions and ally the feuding factions in order to form a unified front against President-elect Trump as he prepares to enter the White House for his second term. 'It will be a big challenge,' said Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), former chair of the House Democratic Caucus. The debate is hardly new. Democrats have repeatedly clashed over the party’s strategy after tough election cycles, and the battle lines are the same now as then, pitting liberals vs. moderates. But this year the stakes were higher. Heading into the polls this week, Democrats had warned that Trump was an existential threat to the nation’s democratic foundations, and their fight to keep him from regaining power was was framed as nothing less than an effort to rescue the republic and the institutions that sustain it. Following Trump’s runaway victory over Vice President Harris on Tuesday, the internal dispute over the party’s strategy, message and direction has taken on a new level of urgency and intensity. For some, the party’s woes revolve around mis-messaging on kitchen-table economic issues, like inflation, wages and the accelerating trend of wealth inequality. For others, the trouble stems from the explosive debate over the Israel-Hamas war. For still others, the problems relate to culture war battles, including that over transgender rights. Whatever the issue, Tuesday’s election results — and the subsequent reckoning that’s shaking the Democrats — is sure to consume all the oxygen in the party for some time to come as leaders, lawmakers, donors and strategists sift through the ashes in search of answers for why so many voters left them for Trump this year. The early stages of that process are spilling into public view. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a liberal icon who has built a career around issues of economic justice, made waves this week when he said there was 'no great surprise' that working class voters had fled the Democrats because the party establishment had 'abandoned' them in favor of moneyed interests. 'The American people are angry and want change. And they’re right,' he said. Moderates countered that it was, in fact, the progressive movement that had doomed Harris and the Democrats on Election Day. Many of them singled out the issue of transgender rights as the culprit — an issue the Trump campaign had put under a bright spotlight with tens of millions of dollars in spending on late-campaign, anti-trans ads. Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), who won by 2 points this week in a battleground Long Island district, told The New York Times that the Democrats are struggling because they are 'pandering to the far left.' 'I don’t want to discriminate against anybody, but I don’t think biological boys should be playing in girls’ sports,' he said. Rep. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) told CNN's Kasie Hunt that 'there are folks on the far left who alienate a ton of people,' pointing to the transgender debate as an example. And Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) echoed those warnings, telling the Times that Democrats are too concerned about offending the transgender community at the expense of addressing 'the challenges many Americans face.' 'I have two little girls, I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,' Moulton told the Times. The comments sparked some pushback from other Democrats on Capitol Hill, who accused the culture war critics of scapegoating. 'The Democratic Party needs to do some serious introspection to understand what went wrong and why our message isn’t resonating or reaching people,' Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) posted on social platform X. 'But one thing’s for sure — blaming trans kids isn’t the answer.' Other lawmakers noted that virtually no Democrats had focused their campaigns on the transgender issue this cycle. It was Republicans, they said, who exaggerated the Democrats’ support for trans rights in order to sow division and win votes. 'That's the problem. The Republicans created this strawman and then beat the shit out of it,' a Democratic lawmaker said. 'I just don't think any Democrats I know were out there rooting for biological boys to compete with biological girls in high school sports. This is just not something that we were talking about or prioritizing. But to hear Republicans, that was like our whole agenda. 'Trump, literally, was telling people that your child is going to come home from school one day with a gender reassignment.' Democrats are hardly the only party facing internal divisions. Since House Republicans took control of the lower chamber last year, their time in power has been practically defined by clashes between far-right conservatives, many of them in the Freedom Caucus, and party leaders and their more moderate allies. The divisions have prevented GOP leaders from passing even the most basic legislation, like bills to fund the federal government, without significant Democratic support. In the midst of their internal policy fights, Republicans toppled a sitting Speaker, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), for the first time in the nation's history and expelled another member of their conference, former Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), over corruption allegations that are expected to land him in prison early next year. Still, for all the chaos, Republicans were able to flip control of the Senate and White House, and they have the edge in the battle for the House, although it remains too close to call as the last ballots are counted and the last races are formalized. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a centrist Washington Democrat representing a Trump-won district, is leading in her race for a second term. She told the Times this week that her party is struggling because too many lawmakers fail to grasp the hardships facing working class voters — and talk down to them as a result. 'No one is listening to anything else you say if you try to talk them out of their lived experiences with data points from some economists,' she told the Times. As Congress prepares to return to Washington next week, Larson emphasized the difficulty facing Democrats as they seek to be a welcoming 'big-tent' party that can appeal to a broad array of voters without offending others. He warned against abandoning party values in the quest for that broader appeal, but acknowledged that the message probably needs some work. 'In the case of all 435 districts, you're going to hear different things — both culturally, and also in terms of economics,' he said. 'It doesn't mean you abandon the ideas and the sense of equality for all Americans. But there are perhaps better ways to state it, and show it, and demonstrate it, instead of having it perceived by the other side that this is all that we stand for.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-election-reckoning-pits-liberals-against-centrists/	2024-11-09T05:46:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/supporters_harris_110424gn03_w.jpg?w=900
North Korean GPS manipulation disrupted dozens of planes and vess...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s military said North Korea disrupted GPS signals from border areas for the second-straight day on Saturday, affecting an unspecified number of flights and vessel operations. Tensions between the rival Koreas have escalated as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un flaunts his advancing nuclear and missile program and engages in electronic and psychological warfare, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash and anti-South Korean propaganda leaflets in the South. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korean operations to manipulate GPS signals were detected from around the western border city of Kaesong and the nearby city of Haeju on Friday and Saturday, and said the activities disrupted dozens of civilian aircraft and several vessels. While warning aircraft and vessels near western border areas, South Korea’s military did not specify how North Korea was interfering with GPS signals or detail the extent of disruptions. 'We urge North Korea to stop GPS interference provocations immediately and strongly warn that it will be held fully accountable for any resulting consequences,' the South’s joint chiefs said in a statement. North Korea’s GPS signal disruptions and balloon campaigns highlight the vulnerability of South Korea’s Incheon International Airport, its main transportation gateway, analyst Sukjoon Yoon recently wrote on the North Korea-focused 38 North website. The airport, which carries 56 million people and 3.6 million tons of cargo annually, is less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from North Korea. 'No major aviation incidents have resulted to date, but GPS interference can endanger commercial airlines flying in poor visibility, and it is a violation of international conventions on navigational safety,' Yoon wrote. He said that in 2024, North Korean trash balloons halted the airport’s runway operations 12 different times for a total of 265 minutes. Kim has shown more hostility this year toward Seoul’s conservative government — which maintains a hard line on Pyongyang — with the North abandoning its long-standing goals of reconciliation with its war-divided rival and rewriting its constitution to cement South Korea as a permanent adversary. North Korea also blew up sections of its unused road and rail routes linked with the South in October in a symbolic display of anger toward Seoul, and opened November with a flight-test of a new intercontinental ballistic missile to dial up pressure on Washington. South Korean officials say North Korean activities to disrupt GPS signals from western border regions increased as the country began launching trash-carrying balloons toward the South in late May, which the North described as a retaliation against South Korean civilian activists flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Aside from North Korea’s weapons demonstrations and non-conventional provocations, there’s growing concern over its reported provision of military equipment and troops to Russia to support President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. South Korean officials say the deepening military alignment between Moscow and Pyongyang could possibly result in Russian technology transfers that increases the threat posed by Kim’s military nuclear program.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-north-korean-gps-manipulation-disrupted-dozens-of-planes-and-vessels-south-korea-says/	2024-11-08T20:50:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/672edb3214a837.35204222.jpeg?w=900

Dr. Mark Hyman: RFK Jr. on Trump Cabinet could improve health car...	(NewsNation) — A prominent physician and wellness expert says President-elect Donald Trump's expected health care appointee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., could help address what he calls 'the greatest epidemic of chronic disease in the history of humanity.' Dr. Mark Hyman, co-founder and chief medical officer of Function Health, said Friday that chronic disease transcends political divisions and requires urgent national attention. 'Six in 10 of us have chronic illness. Fifty-one percent of children have some type of chronic illness, including obesity,' Hyman said on NewsNation's 'CUOMO.' RFK Jr. wants to remove fluoride from water systems: What is it? The doctor emphasized that recent years have seen dramatic increases in various conditions, citing a 50% rise in heart disease, 30% increase in cancer and 150% surge in Alzheimer's cases alongside a 200-300% increase in pharmaceutical use. While acknowledging concerns about Kennedy, who is not a doctor and has expressed controversial medical opinions, Hyman argued for systemic changes to America's food and health policies. He criticized the current system, noting that 'ultra-processed food is the No. 1 killer in the world' and claiming it causes 11 million global deaths annually. Kennedy has been openly angling for a lead position in one of several public health agencies, hoping to make his 'Make America Healthy Again' platform a reality, especially around immunizations. How much of the vote did Robert F. Kennedy Jr. receive? The former presidential candidate said Wednesday there are 'entire departments' within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that 'have to go.' 'In some categories … there are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA … that have to go, that are not doing their job. They’re not protecting our kids,' Kennedy said during an interview on MSNBC. Kennedy allies and members of Trump’s close circle have started discussing a variety of places for the former independent candidate to have influence in a second Trump term, most recently around vaccine data, and are even floating workarounds to the confirmation process on Capitol Hill if he faces pushback. However, many public health experts have expressed opposition and are growing increasingly alarmed at the prospect of Kennedy holding any kind of senior position with influence over the U.S. health system. Some have sought to draw attention to his more controversial claims about the science of vaccinations and an unverified link between children, autism and shots as well as his founding of the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense. Who could be part of Donald Trump’s second administration? Another leading health expert, Georges Benjamin, who serves as executive director of the American Public Health Association, said people in the public listen to Kennedy, even if he has no credibility in the public health sector. Amplifying Kennedy’s voice could lead to distrust of scientific experts and undermine important messaging. Kennedy became particularly critical about vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, when over 1.1 million people died, according to U.S. health records, and partisan fights broke out over things like mask requirements and vaccine mandates in the workplace and public. 'I’m not going to take away anybody’s vaccines,' Kennedy told NBC News when asked whether there were specific vaccines that Kennedy would want to remove from the market. When asked if he would eliminate any health agencies, Kennedy told MSNBC, 'To eliminate the agencies, as long as it requires congressional approval, I wouldn’t be doing that.' 'I can get the corruption out of the agencies,' he added. Ozempic can lead to muscle mass loss: Study Dr. Mark Hyman says Ozempic is not the solution Addressing the popular weight-loss drug Ozempic, Hyman cautioned against viewing it as a comprehensive solution to America's health crisis. He estimated that providing such medications to all overweight Americans would cost approximately $5.1 trillion, arguing instead for dietary and systemic changes to the nation's food system. 'The problem is we live in a toxic food environment where the bad choice is the easy choice, and the healthy choice is the hard choice,' Hyman said. 'That needs to stop, and that can be stopped with policy.'

ChatGPT blocked over 250,000 presidential candidate images: OpenA...	ChatGPT rejected over 250,000 AI image requests in the month leading up to Election Day according to a Friday blog post from OpenAI. Users tried to generate photos of President-elect Trump, Vice President Harris, Vice President-elect Vance, President Biden and Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.) 'We’ve applied safety measures to ChatGPT to refuse requests to generate images of real people, including politicians,' the company wrote. 'These guardrails are especially important in an elections context and are a key part of our broader efforts to prevent our tools being used for deceptive or harmful purposes.' Meta rolls out new feature in hopes of protecting users Instead, ChaptGPT directed election related questions to CanIVote.org through a partnership with the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) in an effort to remain politically neutral. The platform is directing inquiries about the election results to news outlets like the Associated Press and Reuters. In recent weeks, OpenAI had to ban a foreign influence operation known as Storm-2035 which was pushing out influential Iranian political content. The company said it will continue to monitor ChatGPT to ensure responses are accurate and ethical. This year, the company applauded the Biden administration's efforts to outline policy regarding national security and AI technology.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/ai/chatgpt-blocked-over-250000-presidential-candidate-images-openai/	2024-11-08T18:17:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/659f06b85d37e5.26715849-e1707412990681.jpeg?w=900
Amsterdam violence against Jews ‘horrifying’: US diplomat	Warning: This video contains images of violence some may find disturbing. (NewsNation) — The top U.S. government antisemitism watchdog said she is horrified by Thursday night’s violence in Amsterdam in which roving gangs attacked people leaving a soccer match involving a team from Tel Aviv. 'There seemed to be a serious breach of security and response,' said Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt, the U.S. special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism. Lipstadt told NewsNation’s 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that while Amsterdam authorities appeared to do very little during the violence, they are now taking it 'very seriously.' 'Today, the Dutch government is responding strongly,' she said. Racist text messages sent to Black Americans may be from Poland Lipstadt would not directly compare the violence to the infamous Kristallnacht, the November nights in 1938 in which Nazis targeted Jews in several cities in Germany and Austria. That, she said, was government-organized terror. 'It (the Amsterdam violence) was a pogrom, but not in the sense of it being government-organized. I think we have to make that distinction,' Lipstadt added. Antisemitic attacks have been increasing for some time, she said, but they have been 'surging' since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israelis. Australia’s prime minister proposes social media age restriction 'This has been going on in many places, including the United States. We’ve seen it in London. We’ve seen it in Berlin. We’ve seen it in many places. The protestors feel that it’s open season and that nothing is going to happen to them. Unless there is consequences — unless there is enforcement — not only is this going to continuem but it’s going to get worse,' Lipstadt said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/amsterdam-violence-jews-us-diplomat/	2024-11-08T16:38:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/ams.png?w=652
GOP inches closer to retaining House majority	Control of the House has yet to be determined, as a number of critical races remain too close to call, leaving lawmakers — and voters — waiting to see which party will hold the majority next year. The sprint to 218 seats, however, is nearing the final stretch, after a handful of additional races were called in the days following election night. Republicans had secured 216 seats in the lower chamber as of Friday morning, with Democrats trailing at 204 seats, according to Decision Desk HQ. A total of 15 races have not yet been called: Democrats are leading in eight of the contests, while GOP candidates are ahead in the other seven. Republicans, nonetheless, are wasting no time in claiming victory even as the final tally remains unclear. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has said the House is poised to remain in GOP hands, and he has already launched his bid to retain hold of the gavel. Democrats, meanwhile, are holding out hope that they could eke out a razor-thin majority. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said Thursday it 'has yet to be decided who will control' the House next year, pointing to ongoing ballot counting in Oregon, Arizona and California. Several competitive House races have been called in the past couple days, including Rep. David Schweikert's (R) reelection in Arizona's 1st Congressional District; Rep. David Valadao's (R) reelection in California's 22nd Congressional District; April McClain Delaney's (D) election in Maryland's 6th Congressional District; Rep. Andrea Salinas's (D) reelection in Oregon's 6th Congressional District; Rep. Julia Brownley's (D) reelection in California's 26th Congressional District; and Rep. Linda Sánchez's (D) reelection in California 38th Congressional District. Here are the uncalled races to watch in the quest for control of the House. California’s 21st Congressional District Rep. Jim Costa (D) is fighting for his political life in California’s 21st Congressional District in a race that surprisingly emerged as a nail-biter this cycle. Costa, a 10-term lawmaker, was leading Republican Michael Maher, a former FBI agent, by 1.1 percentage points — or 1,476 votes — at the time of publication, according to Decision Desk HQ, with 62.7 percent of the vote in. The race was never expected to be close. The district broke for President Biden by 20.3 percentage points in 2020, and Cook Political Report rated the seat 'solid Democrat.' A victory by Maher would flip the district red. The current margin contrasts with that from 2022, when Maher challenged Costa for the seat and lost by 8.4 percentage points. California’s 9th Congressional District Rep. Josh Harder (D) is locked in a tight race against Stockton Mayor Kevin Lincoln (R) in California’s 9th Congressional District, a contest that is threatening to end the incumbent’s tenure on Capitol Hill. Harder, who was first elected to the House in 2018, was leading Lincoln by 1.4 percentage points at the time of publication, with 56 percent of the vote reported. A victory by Lincoln, who has served as mayor of Stockton since 2021, would be a boon for Republicans: Biden won the district by 12.6 percentage points in 2020, making the district reliably blue. Cook Political Report had rated the district 'likely Democrat.' California’s 47th Congressional District The race to succeed outgoing Rep. Katie Porter (D) in California’s 47th Congressional District is coming down to the wire, with Republican Scott Baugh, a former Assembly member, and Democratic state Sen. Dave Min running neck and neck for the seat. Baugh, who previously served as the state's Assembly minority leader and Orange County GOP chair, was leading Min by 0.2 percentage points — or 616 votes — as of publication, with 78.7 percent of ballots reported. A Baugh victory would flip the seat red and mark the first time the district has a GOP representative since 2003. Biden won the district by 11.1 percentage points in 2020; Cook Political Report rated the district 'lean Democrat.' Porter opted against running for reelection to vie for the Golden State’s Senate seat, which opened up after Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) died last year. Sen. Laphonza Butler (D) is temporarily filling the seat but elected not to run for a full term. Porter, though, lost to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) in the Democratic primary. Alaska’s at-large Congressional District Rep. Mary Sattler Peltola (D) is fighting for political survival in Alaska’s at-large Congressional District, where she is currently trailing Republican entrepreneur Nick Begich in the ranked-choice-voting state. Begich was leading Peltola 49.6 percent to 45.5 percent with 74 percent of the vote in at the time of publication. Alaskan Independence Party candidate John Howe secured 3.9 percent, and Democrat Eric Hafner pulled in 1 percent. The lone Alaska district is one of a handful that President-elect Trump won in 2020, making it a key pickup target for Republicans. That year, Trump beat Biden in the state by 10.1 percentage points. Cook Political Report rated the race a 'toss up.' Arizona’s 6th Congressional District The race in Arizona’s 6th Congressional District has become as close as it can be. Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.), a first-term lawmaker, was leading former Democratic state lawmaker Kirsten Engel by just 435 votes — or 0.1 percentage points — with 82 percent of ballots tallied. The district is as purple as any can get: In 2020, Biden won the area by 0.1 percentage points. Cook Political Report rated the race a 'toss up.' The race is a rematch from last cycle, when Ciscomani narrowly edged out Engel by 1.4 percentage points. California’s 13th Congressional District Rep. John Duarte (R) is leading former Democratic state Assembly member Adam Gray in California’s 13th Congressional District, but the closely watched race remains uncalled. With 58.4 percent of the vote in, Duarte — a first-term lawmaker — was ahead of Gray by 2.3 percentage points. The race has been one of the most closely watched contests this cycle, with Democrats hoping to pick off Duarte in the district after it broke for Biden by 10.9 percentage points in 2020 — a feat the party failed to achieve in 2022. That year, Duarte beat Gray by 0.42 percentage points — just 564 votes. Cook Political Report rated this year’s race a 'toss up.' California’s 27th Congressional District Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) is slightly ahead in his race against Democrat George Whitesides, the former Virgin Galactic CEO who also served as NASA chief of staff during the Obama administration — but the numbers are tight. Garcia is leading Whitesides by 1.4 percentage points — or 3,240 votes — with 76.1 percent of the vote in. A win by Garcia would let out a sigh of relief among Republicans, who were under pressure to defend the seat amid a strong Democratic effort. Democrats consider the district a top pickup opportunity, citing the fact that it broke for Biden by 12.4 percentage points in 2020. Cook Political Report rated the race a 'toss up.' California’s 41st Congressional District Rep. Ken Calvert (R) is fighting tooth and nail to hold his seat in California’s 41st Congressional District. Calvert — a 30-plus year veteran of the House who is a cardinal on the Appropriations Committee — was leading Democrat Will Rollins, a former federal prosecutor, by 3 percentage points with 71.2 percent of the vote in. The district has emerged as a key battleground. In 2020, it broke for Trump by 1.1 percentage points. Cook Political Report rated this year’s race a 'toss up.' Calvert is currently running ahead by a smaller margin than his victory against Rollins in 2022. That year, he beat the GOP challenger by 4.6 percentage points. Colorado’s 8th Congressional District Rep. Yadira Caraveo (D) is hanging on in Colorado’s 8th Congressional District by a slim margin against Republican state Rep. Gabe Evans. Caraveo, a first-term lawmaker, led Evans by 0.4 percentage points — or 1,321 ballots — with 85.5 percent of the vote in. Cook Political Report rated the seat a 'toss up.' Oregon’s 5th Congressional District Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R) is in danger of being defeated in Oregon’s 5th Congressional District, where Democratic state Rep. Janelle Bynum is leading the incumbent. Bynum was ahead of Chavez-DeRemer by 2.5 percentage points with 84.4 percent of the vote in. Independent Brett Smith earned 4.6 percent of the vote, Libertarian Sonja Feintech notched 1.5 percent, and Andrea Townsend secured 1 percent. A Bynum victory would flip the district blue in a huge success for Democrats, who zeroed in on the area after it broke for Biden in 2020. Chavez-DeRemer was one of the most vulnerable Republicans on the ballot this cycle. Cook Political Report rated the seat a 'toss up.' Washington’s 3rd Congressional District Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) looked poised to squeak out a victory against Republican Joe Kent, staying on despite being one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for reelection this cycle. Gluesenkamp Perez, a first-term lawmaker, was leading Joe Kent, a retired Green Beret backed by Trump, by 3.1 percentage points with 94.5 percent of the vote in. Republicans had their eyes on the district after it broke for Trump by roughly 4 percentage points in 2020. In 2022, however, Gluesenkamp Perez defeated Kent by 0.82 percentage points. This year’s race was rated a 'toss up' by Cook Political Report. California’s 49th Congressional District Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) is close to securing another two years in Congress, though the race has not yet been called as more ballots are counted. Levin, a three-term lawmaker, was leading Republican business owner Matt Gunderson by 2.2 percentage points as of publication time, with 77.4 percent of the vote accounted for. Cook Political Report rated the seat a 'lean Democrat,' which sits in a district that Biden won by 11.4 percentage points in 2020. California’s 6th Congressional District Rep. Ami Bera (D) is poised to win another term representing California’s 6th Congressional District, as he is leading Republican Christine Bish by a healthy margin. With 45 percent of the vote in, Bera, a six-term lawmaker, was leading Bish, a small business owner, by 13.7 percentage points, though the race had not yet been called by Decision Desk HQ. California’s 39th Congressional District Rep. Mark Takano (D) is likely to win another term on Capitol Hill, though votes are still being tallied in California’s 39th Congressional District. As of Thursday evening, Takano led Republican business owner David Serpa by 10.6 percentage points with 60.8 percent of the vote reported. California’s 45th Congressional District Rep. Michelle Steel (R-Calif.) has a healthy lead against Democrat Derek Tran, though the race has not yet been called. With 74.7 percent of the vote in, Steel, a two-term lawmaker, was ahead of Tran, a consumer rights attorney, by 3.8 percentage points. The district is one of the 17 areas Biden won in 2020 that are currently represented by a Republican, making it a top pickup target for Democrats. Biden won the area, which includes Orange and Los Angeles counties, by 6.1 percentage points in 2020. Cook Political Report rated the seat a 'toss up.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/gop-inches-closer-to-retaining-house-majority/	2024-11-08T16:19:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GOP_061824_Photo_GregNash.png?w=900
Kristi Noem: Democratic governors should work with Donald Trump	(NewsNation) — South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday that Democratic governors who have pledged to resist President-elect Donald Trump's immigration policies are being 'extremely irresponsible' and should instead seek dialogue with the incoming administration. 'If I had a new president in the White House, and even if he wasn't from my political party, the first thing I would do would be call him up and see if I could get a meeting,' Noem said on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' The Republican governor, who is reportedly being considered for interior secretary in Trump's cabinet, dismissed early opposition from Democratic governors like Illinois' JB Pritzker and California's Gavin Newsom as 'not a mature response' to Trump's election victory. Judge agrees to pause Jan. 6 case after Trump’s election win Newsom, a fierce critic of Trump, called on lawmakers Thursday to convene a special session later this year to safeguard the state’s progressive policies on climate change, reproductive rights and immigration ahead of another Trump presidency. The move — a day after the former president defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race — effectively reignited California’s resistance campaign against conservative policies that state Democratic leaders started during the first Trump administration. The move is also part of a growing discussion among Democratic state officials across the country seeking to protect policies that face threats under Trump’s leadership. Kristi Noem on interior secretary rumors: 'I will help Trump however I can' Regarding her own potential cabinet position, Noem deflected questions about reports she's being considered to lead the Interior Department, saying only that 'the only person who will make that decision is President Trump' while noting she 'love[s] being governor of South Dakota.' Charges brought in Iranian murder-for-hire plan targeting Trump The governor also expressed support for the Justice Department's decision to suspend investigations into Trump, saying it was 'a good first step' toward restoring faith in federal law enforcement agencies. She said Trump had assured her he did not plan to pursue political prosecutions once he was in office. 'Trump ally and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem is a possibility for Interior Secretary, according to a person familiar with the matter,' a Wall Street Journal story published Thursday that looked at a variety of potential cabinet appointments said. She was the only one mentioned for the Interior Department slot. If chosen and confirmed, Noem would replace the Biden administration’s Interior secretary, Deb Haaland, who, according to the department’s website, 'made history when she became the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary. She is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and a 35th-generation New Mexican.' Among the U.S. Department of Interior’s official responsibilities are federal relationships with tribal governments, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Indian Education. Who is Susie Wiles, Trump’s WH chief of staff? Noem, as governor, has faced ups and downs with tribal governments in South Dakota. She offered emergency assistance after flooding in 2019, moved the state Office of Indian Education from the state Department of Education to the state Department of Tribal Affairs, has been banned from many of the nine reservations at different times and shifted funding so the state’s law enforcement training program could conduct the first-ever class for tribal officers this year. Trump’s little-noticed campaign promise to shift thousands of federal employees who are in Washington, D.C., to ‘patriot-led states’ also points to a potential gain for South Dakota. Trump has won South Dakota all three times in his presidential bids. On Tuesday, he received 272,000 votes vs. 146,837 for Harris. That 63% was slightly more than the 62% Trump received from South Dakota voters in 2020 and 2016.

Who is Susie Wiles, Trump's WH chief of staff?	(NewsNation) — Trump has selected Susie Wiles — a longtime Republican strategist and the leader of president-elect's 2024 campaign — as his chief of staff. The announcement makes Wiles the first woman to fill the role. It comes about two weeks after Wiles fired back at billionaire Mark Cuban, who claimed Trump doesn’t typically surround himself with 'strong, intelligent women.' Harris loss: Democrats ask what went wrong 'I’m told @mcuban needs help identifying the strong and intelligent women surrounding Pres. Trump,' Wiles wrote on X — her first post in about two years. 'Well, here we are! I’ve been proud to lead this campaign. Complimented by @Linda_McMahon ,Chair for Transition Policy and @LaraLeaTrump, RNC Co-Chair.' The account Wiles posted from no longer appeared active as of early Friday afternoon. Who is Susie Wiles? Wiles, 67, is a longtime Republican strategist and the leader of Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. She also worked alongside Trump in 2016. Some lawmakers describe Wiles as someone who can handle egos and strong opinions. Her political career spans several decades and began as a scheduler for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.

She’s also worked for Trump allies such as Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Wiles was pivotal to DeSantis’ success in Florida’s 2018 gubernatorial race. DeSantis dismissed her after his win, leading Wiles to join Trump’s orbit and help the now-president-elect defeat DeSantis in the Republican primary election. Her relationship with Trump Wiles has a reputation for remaining loyal to Trump. She’s considered a trusted adviser who can help manage the president-elect and his impulses. Some have joked that Wiles is the only person Trump listens to. 'Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected,' Trump said. 'Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.'

No two relationships between a president and their chief of staff are identical, but chiefs often become integral members of the president’s inner circle of advisors, according to the Chief of Staff Association. They may also be tapped to stand in for the president to negotiate with Congress, speak to the media or meet with constituency groups.

Infighting, finger-pointing: Dems look inward after shellacking	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Democrats are still reeling from their Election Day loss, trying to figure out where it all went wrong and where the party goes from here, leading to infighting, finger-pointing and Monday morning quarterbacking. Team Biden advisers are pointing the finger at Team Harris advisers and vice-versa, going from blaming President Biden for running at all, to Vice President Harris for how the campaign was run. According to Axios, there was an all staff call Thursday evening where leaders pleaded with staffers not to talk to reporters. Harris, who was on the call, and told staffers, 'This sucks, and there's also so much good that has come from come of this.' One staffer reportedly said the message was detached from reality of what happened, saying, 'We are told the fate of democracy is at stake. And then the message was, we'll get them next time.' Justice Department brings charges in Iranian murder-for-hire plan targeting Trump Biden will leave office after leading the United States out of the worst pandemic in a century, galvanizing international support for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion and passing a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that will affect communities for years to come. But having run four years ago against Trump to 'restore the soul of the country,' Biden will make way after just one term for his immediate predecessor, who overcame two impeachments, a felony conviction and an insurrection launched by his supporters. Trump has pledged to radically reshape the federal government and roll back many of Biden's priorities. Only about 4 in 10 voters in the 2024 presidential election approved of how Biden handled his job as president, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. Roughly 6 in 10 disapproved, and Donald Trump won a strong majority of those voters who were dissatisfied with Biden. Some high-ranking Democrats, including three advisers to the Harris campaign, expressed deep frustration with Biden for failing to recognize earlier in the election cycle that he was not up to the challenge. The advisers spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. Thune urges Trump to stay out of race to replace McConnell Biden, 81, ended his reelection campaign in July, weeks after an abysmal debate performance sent his party into a spiral and raised questions about whether he still had the mental acuity and stamina to serve as a credible nominee. But polling long beforehand showed that many Americans worried about his age. Some 77% of Americans said in August 2023 that Biden was too old to be effective for four more years, according to a poll by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs. The president bowed out on July 21 after getting not-so-subtle nudges from Democratic Party powers, including former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. Biden endorsed Harris and handed over his campaign operation to her.

Jack Smith asks for pause in Jan. 6 case after Trump's election w...	(NewsNation) — Special counsel Jack Smith asked the federal judge in the Jan. 6 case against President-elect Donald Trump to pause any further proceedings while the Department of Justice considers its next steps after he won the 2024 election. 'As a result of the election held on Nov. 5, 2024, the defendant is expected to be certified as President-elect on Jan. 6, 2025, and inaugurated on Jan.20, 2025,' a filing from Smith said. 'The Government respectfully requests that the Court vacate the remaining deadlines in the pretrial schedule to afford the Government time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy.' Smith said he will give an update to the court on the status of these deliberations by Dec. 2. Smith charged Trump with four felonies, accusing him of conspiring to subvert the 2020 election results. Trump has pleaded not guilty.

Justice Department brings charges in Iranian murder-for-hire plan...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department on Friday disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Donald Trump, charging a man who said he had been tasked by a government official before this week's election with assassinating the Republican president-elect. Investigators learned of the plot to kill Trump while interviewing Farhad Shakeri, an Afghan national identified by officials as an Iranian government asset who was deported from the U.S. after being imprisoned on robbery charges. He told investigators that a contact in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard instructed him this past September to put together a plan within seven days to surveil and ultimately kill Trump, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in federal court in Manhattan. Two other men who the authorities say were recruited to participate in other assassinations, including a prominent Iranian American journalist, were also arrested Friday. Shakeri remains in Iran.

Garland said in a statement. The plot, with the charges unsealed just days after Trump's defeat of Democrat Kamala Harris, reflects what federal officials have described as ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. government officials, including Trump, on U.S. soil. Last summer, the Justice Department charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in a murder-for-hire plot. ____ Neumeister reported from New York. © Copyright 2023 Associated Press.

Thune urges Trump to stay out of race to replace McConnell	Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.) is urging President-elect Trump not to put his thumb on the scale in the race to elect a successor to outgoing Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), putting a new wrinkle in the high-stakes contest. Thune in recent days has declared his preference that Trump give Republican senators space to make their own decision about who should lead the new Senate GOP majority, arguing it would be in Trump’s 'best interests' to stay neutral. That argument has been echoed by Thune’s allies, such as Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), who told CNN earlier this week that Trump should 'stay out of the race.' Thune’s comments are creating a stir among Senate insiders two days after Trump won a resounding victory over Vice President Harris and helped Republicans regain the Senate majority. Allies of Thune’s two rivals in the leadership race, Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.), say that calls for Trump to stay out of the leadership race indicate that Thune is nervous that the president-elect would endorse either Cornyn or Scott — which would be a serious setback. 'He’s terrified. He knows that Trump won’t endorse him. If he knows that, then Trump getting involved hurts him,' a Senate Republican aide said. Thune’s rivals have a better relationship with Trump, especially Scott, who’s the closest to the president-elect of the three. Scott represents Trump’s adopted home state of Florida, and as National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman traveled to Mar-a-Lago in April of 2021, when Trump was still something of a pariah among GOP senators, to give him a 'Champion of Freedom' award. Scott was later challenged about it in an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, who asked if he was endorsing Trump’s 'lies' about the 2020 election. Trump on Thursday named Susie Wiles, who ran Scott's first campaign for governor in 2010, as his White House chief of staff. She served as his presidential campaign manager. He was also the first senator to travel to New York to attend Trump’s criminal trial on charges of falsifying business records. Scott and his allies are hoping that Trump will weigh in strongly on his behalf in the leadership race. Without Trump’s enthusiastic endorsement, he probably does not have a viable path to becoming majority leader, Senate Republican sources say. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who has endorsed Scott, called on Trump Thursday to intervene in the leadership race. 'Jesse, if you’ve got any influence with President Trump, ask President Trump to come out publicly and say he wants to work with someone as accomplished as Rick Scott to accomplish his agenda,' Johnson asked conservative podcast host Jesse Kelly in an interview. Cornyn, who served as Senate GOP whip during Trump’s first two years in the White House, doesn’t have as good a relationship with Trump as Scott but his supporters argue he’s closer to the president-elect than Thune. Cornyn spent time with Trump in recent weeks at a rally in Reno, Nevada, and a meeting in Austin, Texas. He was also a special guest at fundraisers for the Trump-Vance campaign in Laredo, San Antonio and Houston in August. The Texas fundraising swing raised 'well into the seven figures' for the Trump campaign, according to a source familiar with Cornyn’s political operation. Cornyn has reminded Trump of their accomplishments working together when he served as the No. 2-ranking Republican in 2017 and 2018, including passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and confirming conservatives Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. 'As I told President Trump, I’m interested in getting the band back together again,' Cornyn told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto. Thune has had rockier relationship with Trump in the past. It hit a low point after Thune opposed an effort to object to the certification of electoral votes for Joe Biden after the 2020 election. Trump got so made about Thune’s pledge to defeat objections to Arizona’s and Pennsylvania’s electoral slates four years ago that he called for the amiable South Dakota Republican to face a primary challenger in 2022. 'South Dakota doesn’t like weakness,' Trump tweeted in December of 2020. 'He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!' Thune, nevertheless, cruised to an easy reelection. Thune has since tried to mend fences with Trump. He visited the president-elect at his Mar-a-Lago home in March and spoke to him on the phone Wednesday. The No. 2-ranking Senate GOP leader has pledged to work closely with Trump to pass his legislative agenda in 2025 and 2026 if he is elected to become the next Senate majority leader. But he advised Trump on Wednesday to let Senate Republicans make their own decision about who should lead the conference next year, defending what Republican senators have long viewed as their prerogative to run their own conference. 'I’m staying in regular contact with him and with his team and, obviously, if he wants to, he could exert a considerable amount of influence on that but, honestly, I think my preference would be and I think it’s probably in his best interest to stay out of [the race,]' Thune told CNBC’s Joe Kernen. 'These Senate secret-ballot elections are probably best left to the senators and he’s got to work with all of us when it’s all said and done,' he said. Thune made similar comments in a Fox News interview, acknowledging that Trump could swing the race one way or another. 'The president obviously has tremendous influence if he chooses to use it. I think in leadership elections, particularly in the Senate … it is a very sort of inside baseball thing,' he said, arguing that Senate Republicans will be able to find the right person for the job without outside influence. 'I think if he lets it play out, we'll get the right person. I've had conversations with him and have told him that we want to get his team in place so that he can hit the ground running and get to work on an agenda to make sure that he and our team succeeds,' he said. The last time a president played a major role in picking a Senate majority leader was in late 2002. Sen. Bill Frist’s (R-Tenn.) close relationship with then-President President George W. Bush was a big reason why he was elected to succeed Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who resigned from the leadership after making controversial remarks at late-Sen. Strom Thurmond’s (R-S.C.) 100th birthday party. Frist had previously served as NRSC chairman but he didn’t work his way up the leadership ranks as other GOP leaders have done, and his management style as well as his deference to the Bush administration rankled some GOP senators.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/thune-urges-trump-to-stay-out-of-race-to-replace-mcconnell/	2024-11-08T09:06:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/thunejohn_070924gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Baja officials brace for 'elevated' deportations under Trump	SAN DIEGO (Border Report) -- Officials in Baja California expect a high increase in the number of deportations by the U.S. government once Donald Trump returns to office. Throughout the campaign, Trump promised to deport large numbers of migrants should he regain the presidency. Trump’s return to White House sets stage for far-reaching immigration crackdown 'Every time there are changes in the United States, it directly impacts us especially when people are being returned,' said Jorge Rivera Manzo, director of governmental migrant affairs with the state.. 'Some will go directly back to their countries, others will arrive in Mexico depending on agreements made with each country, but we are getting ready for elevated returns.' Rivera Manzo stated that right now, shelters are relatively quiet with 60% vacancy rates in Tijuana and 70% in Mexicali. Migrants urged to get legal aid as Trump promises mass deportations José María García Lara, who is in charge of a shelter called Movimiento Juventud 2000, said he is worried about the expected migrant traffic in the city with people deported through Tijuana as a result of Tuesday's election. 'When people are waiting for asylum, hoping the United States will help, it leads to a lot of uncertainty among the migrants we have here at the shelter,' he said. One of those migrants, Emir Garcia, says they are here out of necessity and not by choice. She remains hopeful Trump will decide to help the migrants. Texas’ border takeover a factor in migrant, US citizen deaths, activists say 'We're all afraid, all the migrants, we need his help,' Garcia said. 'We know he has to take care of his country, but he also needs to help others around the world.' Lucia Chique with her two children at the Movimiento Juventud 2000 shelter in Tijuana. (Jorge Nieto/Special for Border Report) Others like Lucia Chique, from Mexico, aren't expecting much from the incoming Trump administration. 'Donald Trump doesn't want us, he doesn't want Latinos, he doesn't want Mexicans,' she said. 'There are going to be a lot of deportations of those seeking asylum, it's going to get very complicated.' Chique also worries the CBP One app, which helps migrants land appointments to lawfully cross the border and ask for asylum, will be discontinued once Trump takes over. Right now, the app is providing 1,450 daily appointments to migrants. Troubled by illegal border crossings, Arizona voters approve state-level immigration enforcement Jesus Ramos is a migrant from Mexico staying athe the Movimiento Juventud 2000 shelter in Tijuana. (Jorge Nieto/Special for Border Report) 'We're using the application, but you hear rumors that he's going to eliminate it, it's going to get harder for migrants.' Other CBP One users, like Jesus Ramos, want Trump to continue the program. 'I've been waiting three months for an appointment, I just want to get to the U.S. to see my grandparents one more time,' he said. Ramos believes if Trump cuts access to CBP One, migrants will be forced to use smugglers. Visit the BorderReport.com homepage for the latest exclusive stories and breaking news about issues along the U.S.-Mexico border 'I'm going to cross regardless, I'll use a coyote (smuggler) if necessary.' Ramos says others in the shelter are prepared to do the same thing.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/baja-officials-brace-for-elevated-deportations-under-trump/	2024-11-08T09:03:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/juventud-2000-shelter.png?w=591
