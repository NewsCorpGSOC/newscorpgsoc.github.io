50+ people awaiting rescue on roof of Tennessee hospital	UNICOI COUNTY, Tenn. (WJHL) — More than 50 people were sent to the roof of a Tennessee hospital on Friday and were awaiting rescue as flooding cut the hospital off from land, according to Ballad Health. Ballad, a hospital chain headquartered in Tennessee, said at 10:45 a.m. that the Unicoi County Hospital had closed and suspended operations due to the threat of flooding. Unicoi County Emergency Management Agency told hospital leadership that the hospital needed to be evacuated due to the 'unusually high and rising water from the Nolichucky River.' There were 11 patients at the hospital that Ballad planned to transfer. However, ambulances sent to evacuate the patients could not safely get to them due to the rising water. 'The hospital has been engulfed by extremely dangerous and rapidly moving water,' Ballad said in a news release. The water started coming into the building and was moving so quickly, rescue boats weren't able to safely navigate the area. Ballad confirmed that as of 12:27 p.m., 54 people had been relocated to the hospital's roof. 'Due to high winds, no helicopters could safely fly in an effort to help evacuate the hospital,' the company said. By 2:50 p.m., conditions had improved and rescues by helicopter got underway. Nexstar's WJHL made attempts to get close to the hospital, but roads in the area are impassable. WJHL's Drone 11 was able to capture video of the people stranded on the roof. The drone footage also shows the extent of the flooding in the area. WATCH: Drifting boat ripped below bridge as Roan Mountain floods Photo: Carolina Avenue in Unicoi County.

Satellite video shows 'potentially historic' Helene from space	(NEXSTAR) – The view on land in Florida Thursday afternoon was overcast and stormy, but incoming Hurricane Helene looked even more ominous from space. The storm was upgraded to a Category 3 as it barreled toward the Florida coast. It could be seen churning over the Gulf of Mexico and picking up steam in satellite videos taken by NOAA. The bands of clouds stretching out from the hurricane's eye are so vast, they obscure almost the entire Southeastern United States when seen from space. Helene weakens to tropical storm, at least 4 dead This satellite image provided by NOAA shows Hurricane Helene advancing across the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida on Thursday, Sept. 26, 2024. (NOAA via AP) Helene was expected to make landfall Thursday evening along Florida's northwest coast. The National Weather Service office in Tallahassee forecast storm surges of up to 20 feet and warned they could be particularly 'catastrophic and unsurvivable' in Apalachee Bay. It added that high winds and heavy rains also posed risks. 'You cannot survive 20 feet or even 15 feet of storm surge,' said Jeff Berardelli, chief meteorologist at NewsNation affiliate WFLA. 'If you’re near the water and you know you’re going to flood, especially if you’re in a mobile home, too. You’ve got to go. You cannot take your chances. This is not survivable.' The dangerous impacts of Helene could extend far beyond Florida. While the hurricane will likely weaken as it moves inland, damaging winds and heavy rain were expected to extend to the southern Appalachian Mountains, where landslides were possible, forecasters said. For Atlanta, Helene could be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd. Close Thank you for signing up!

Trump rally moved over Secret Service staffing concerns	Former President Trump moved the venue for his Saturday campaign rally in Wisconsin amid concerns over Secret Service staffing, a senior official briefed on the planning confirmed to The Hill. Trump was reportedly expected to hold his campaign event at an outside airport, according to NBC and CBS News, which first reported details of the switch. The senior official confirmed that his event was moved to a smaller venue given a shortage of Secret Service staff – an event that also coincided with the United Nationals General Assembly. 'The agency was never configured to provide such an elevated level of protection for an increasing number of protectees. Our personnel and equipment are being pushed to their limits to sustain the current operational tempo,' the senior official said. How to watch the Vance-Walz vice presidential debate 'This proposed Wisconsin event also took place during the United Nations General Assembly, where the Secret Service is responsible for the safety and security of over 140 world leaders amid a challenged global threat level,' the senior official noted. The senior official also noted that acting U.S. Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe has been advocating for a 'paradigm shift.' 'This paradigm shift would also position the agency to enhance its operational readiness to reduce reliance on external partners when providing heightened protection,' the official said. An advisory on the Trump campaign website notes the event is scheduled to take place at the Prairie du Chien Area Arts Center. U.S. Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi noted that the agency could not offer specifics on resources allocated for the event. 'Former President Donald Trump is receiving heightened levels of U.S. Secret Service protection and our top priority is mitigating risks to ensure his continued safety at all times,' Guglielmi explained. 'Out of concern for operational security, we cannot provide specific details about resources allocated for event security or communications between agency personnel and our protectees.' How to register to vote The development comes as the U.S. Secret Service has been under heightened scrutiny amid two failed assassination attempts against the former president, with the first attempt causing injuries to Trump’s ear. A bipartisan House task force has been created to investigate the Trump assassination attempts, which held its first hearing on Thursday. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee separately released a report this week which detailed shortcomings around how the Secret Service handling of the July assassination attempt in Butler, Pa.

NYC Mayor Eric Adams to appear in federal court Friday	(NewsNation) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams will go before a New York federal judge Friday on charges alleging he accepted bribes and illegal foreign campaign contributions. Friday’s arraignment at noon ET will mark Adams’ first court appearance on federal conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery allegations. The court procedure typically involves a formal reading of the charges, often followed by an initial plea. It’s not uncommon for criminal defendants to plead not guilty at that time. It’s unclear whether Adams will turn himself in or if authorities will take the mayor into federal custody. Adams said Thursday he has no plans to resign. NewsNation will cover Friday’s court appearance and publish updates as they become available. Mayor Eric Adams corruption investigation, indictment: Timeline What is Eric Adams accused of? The accusations against Adams are outlined in a 57-page grand jury indictment that a judge unsealed Thursday. The indictment comes on the heels of a widespread ongoing investigation into the mayor’s administration and the resignation of several top city officials. Adams — who oversees public operations in the nation’s largest city — is accused of accepting bribes from foreign nationals and taking illegal campaign contributions in exchange for favors. Authorities said this included helping Turkish officials secure fire-safety approvals for a 36-story Turkish consulate building even though it didn’t pass inspection. The allegations of long-running corruption date back nearly a decade, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said at a Thursday news conference announcing the indictment. They include alleged straw donor contributions and abuse of a city program that promised to provide up to $8 in matching funds for each $1 of up to $250 in donations from New York City residents. That amounts to nearly $13,000 in matching funds during the 2021 election cycle, according to charging documents. Harris to visit southern border for first time in 3 years What's next for Eric Adams, New Yorkers? Adams addressed the charges at a news conference Thursday when he told New Yorkers to 'wait to hear our defense before making any judgments.' Several top city officials have announced their resignation from the Adams administration in recent weeks. It’s unclear if or how those resignations may be connected to the mayor’s criminal case. 'The conduct alleged in the indictment, the foreign money, the corporate money, the bribery, the years of concealment, is a grave breach of the public’s trust,' Williams said Thursday. 'We continue to dig, and we will hold more people accountable.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/eric-adams-new-york-city-charges-court/	2024-09-27T06:26:45-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/66005dbace75c0.94178341.jpeg?w=900
Harris to visit southern border for first time in 3 years	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris will visit the U.S.-Mexico border for the first time in three years Friday, and the first time since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, in hopes of addressing one of the biggest topics on voters’ minds. Harris will deliver a speech on immigration policy in Douglas, Arizona, a mostly Democratic border town with 16,000 residents. Harris and the Biden administration have faced criticism for their handling of border security and immigration. Former President Donald Trump has faulted her for spending little time at the border during her vice presidency. The last time she was publicly known to have been at the border was in 2021 when she toured a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing center in El Paso, Texas. Trump seeks to bolster advantage among male voters FILE - Vice President Kamala Harris talks to the media, June 25, 2021, after her tour of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Central Processing Center in El Paso, Texas. Harris visited the U.S. southern border as part of her role leading the Biden administration's response to a steep increase in migration. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) 'The American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games,' Harris plans to say in the speech, according to an excerpt of her remarks previewed by her campaign, the Associated Press reported. Douglas is an overwhelmingly Democratic border town in GOP-dominated Cochise County, where the Republicans on the board of supervisors are facing criminal charges for refusing to certify the 2022 election results. Trump was in the area last month, using a remote stretch of border wall and a pile of steel beams to draw a contrast between himself and Harris on border security. Harris struggles to break through with young Latinos On Thursday, Trump gave a speech in New York giving his opinion on Harris’ visit that hadn’t happened yet: 'Anything she says tomorrow, you know is a fraud because she was the worst in history at protecting our country. So, she’ll try and make herself look a little bit better. But it’s not possible.' Election day is less than six weeks away, and Arizona is a key battleground state with the potential to swing the election for either Harris or Trump.

Floridians who didn't evacuate hurricane should write info on leg...	(The Hill) — The Taylor County Sheriff's Office asked residents who did not evacuate to write contact information on their arms or legs for identification purposes to help with rescue and recovery efforts, following Hurricane Helene's landfall Thursday night. 'If you or someone you know chose not to evacuate, PLEASE write your, Name, birthday and important information on your arm or leg in A PERMANENT MARKER so that you can be identified and family notified,' the sheriff's office wrote in a post on Facebook. Hurricane Helene heads inland after landfall Officials requested that people provide information about whether their residence is inland or on the coast, their full address, and the names of individuals and animals so that search and rescue teams can prioritize certain locations. Although mandatory evacuations were ordered for the area, NBC reported that Sheriff Wayne Padgett said he estimated up to half of the population was staying. Damage is predicted to compare to the Asheville floods of 1916, which killed at least 80 people and caused millions of dollars in damage, and to exceed other extreme weather events in the region such as Tropical Storm Fred in 2021, the weather service said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/florida-sheriff-write-contact-info-on-leg/	2024-09-27T00:18:31-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24269442220437-e1727277251473.jpg?w=900
Journalist booted from X after publishing hacked Vance document	Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein was suspended Thursday from the social platform X after sharing materials about Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) that were allegedly obtained in an Iranian hack on former President Trump’s campaign. Klippenstein published the 271-page report compiled by the Trump campaign to vet Vance, now the Republican nominee’s running mate, on his Substack. Rudy Giuliani disbarred in DC over 2020 election subversion efforts An X spokesperson said in a statement that the journalist’s account was suspended for posting 'unredacted private personal information' about Vance. 'Ken Klippenstein was temporarily suspended for violating our rules on posting unredacted private personal information, specifically Sen. Vance’s physical addresses and the majority of his Social Security number,' the spokesperson said. The Trump campaign revealed last month that it had been hacked and internal documents had been leaked. The FBI later confirmed that Iran was behind the breach and that the country had attempted to disrupt both presidential campaigns. The documents were shared with various media outlets, but they opted not to publish the stolen materials. Vance, Walz face potential game-changing moment with VP debate Iran also attempted to share the materials with the Biden campaign, the FBI revealed last week. However, the Harris campaign said its staffers ignored what appeared to be phishing emails sent by Iran to their personal emails. Klippenstein explained his decision to publish the stolen materials on his Substack, arguing that 'it’s of keen public interest in an election season.' '[S]ince June, the news media has been sitting on it (and other documents), declining to publish in fear of finding itself at odds with the government’s campaign against ‘foreign malign influence,’' he wrote. 'I’m just not a believer of the news media as an arm of the government, doing its work combatting foreign influence,' he later added. 'Nor should it be a gatekeeper of what the public should know.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ken-klippenstein-jd-vance-x-document-hack/	2024-09-26T16:01:55-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24267776749023-e1727288498319.jpg?w=900
Trump says he's meeting with Zelensky on Friday	Former President Trump said Thursday he would be meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a move that came after the former president had earlier reportedly rejected a meeting with the Ukrainian president. 'As you know, President Zelensky has asked to meet with me, and I will be meeting with him tomorrow morning at around 9:45 in Trump Tower,' Trump said during a press conference in New York. 'And it's a shame what's happening in Ukraine, so many deaths, so much destruction. It's a horrible thing.' NBC News reported Wednesday that Trump had decided not to meet with Zelensky. The former president criticized the Ukrainian president, saying while in North Carolina on Wednesday, 'He’s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me,' according to the news outlet. Zelensky rankled Republicans after he called Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) 'too radical' during an interview with The New Yorker that was released earlier this week. Zelensky’s decision to join Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) during an ammunition factory tour was also interpreted by some members of the GOP as campaigning for Democrats. Trump’s announcement was made the same day that Zelensky visited the White House.

Nationally, the typical home was listed for 37 days before going under contract in August — six more than a year earlier. But in some markets, homes are sitting much longer. Florida has four of the top five metros with the slowest sales. Homes in West Palm Beach, Florida, took the longest to sell, spending a median 79 days on the market before finding a buyer. Fort Lauderdale (75 days), Jacksonville (65 days) and Miami (65 days) weren't far behind. Florida is home to the fastest-cooling housing markets in the US The recent cooldown in the Sunshine State is due to several factors. A surge in new construction has helped boost inventory and ease competition, alleviating supply pressures after Florida became a popular pandemic destination. Demand has also taken a hit amid severe weather concerns, rising insurance costs and climbing HOA fees. Meanwhile, homes continue to fly off the market in Seattle (12 days), Indianapolis (16 days) and Warren, Michigan (17 days). San Jose (18 days) and Oakland, California (20 days) rounded out the top five major metros with the fastest sales. Buyers have dealt with a competitive housing market for several years, and that's changed how they view homes that have been sitting for a while, Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather noted. Should you refinance your mortgage? Here’s what to consider 'Now if a home is still on the market after a few weeks, buyers assume there's something wrong with it,' she said. 'That's why it's so important to price your home to move quickly.' Last month, the typical home spent roughly the same amount of time on the market as in August 2019, an indication the uptick in 'extra stale' listings is more of a return to normal than a sign of turmoil. If the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates further, as it's expected to, mortgage rates may continue to fall — potentially drawing more buyers off the sidelines.

NYC Mayor Eric Adams indicted but says he won't resign	(NewsNation) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Thursday morning said he won't resign despite being indicted on on federal charges that he secured bribes from foreign nationals and took illegal campaign contributions in exchange for favors. Authorities said this included helping Turkish officials get fire safety approvals for a 36-story Turkish consulate building despite it not passing inspection. The 'long-running' corruption goes back nearly a decade, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said at a Thursday news conference. The investigation into Adams is continuing, Williams said. 'The conduct alleged in the indictment, the foreign money, the corporate money, the bribery, the years of concealment, is a grave breach of the public’s trust,' Williams said. 'We continue to dig and we will hold more people accountable.' Adams maintained his innocence, both in a statement to NewsNation and at a Thursday news conference of his own where he said he's not stepping down. 'I always knew that If I stood my ground for New Yorkers, that I would be a target—and a target I became,' the statement said. Mayor Eric Adams corruption investigation, indictment: Timeline To reporters, Adams said his 'day-to-day will not change.' 'From here, my attorneys will take care of the case so I can take care of the city,' Adams said. 'I ask New York to just wait to hear our defense before making any judgments.' Attorney Alex Spiro, who is representing Adams, said that the federal authorities were trying to 'tell a story' despite the mayor not doing anything 'illegal or wrong.' He argued that a free flight referenced by prosecutors happened years before Adams assumed his positions as mayor, and that the upgrades they alluded to were on airlines with open seats. 'We're going to see everybody in court, hopefully tomorrow. If not Monday,' Spiro said. A retired police captain who was elected as New York City’s 110th mayor nearly three years ago, Adams is now the first sitting New York City mayor to face criminal charges. Eric Adams indicted News of Adams' indictment comes weeks after the FBI raided the homes of multiple top Adams aides, City Hall sources confirmed to NewsNation local affiliate WPIX. Federal investigators had seized Adams’ electronic devices nearly a year ago as part of an investigation focused, at least partly, on campaign contributions and Adams’ interactions with the Turkish government. Prosecutors said Adams did not disclose free and discounted travel to places including France, China, Turkey, Sri Lanka, India and Hungary and created a paper trail to suggest he had paid it. One staffer was directed by Adams to make sure his activities in Turkey from 2021 were not made public, according to prosecutors. A senior official from Turkey's diplomatic establishment facilitated straw donations to Adams. 'The mayor had a duty to disclose these gifts on his annual public disclosure forms so that the public could see who was giving him what,' Williams said. 'But as we allege year after year after year, he kept the public in the dark.' In addition, Adams 'compounded his gains' from illegal contributions he allegedly obtained by gaming the city’s matching funds program, authorities said in the indictment. Through false certifications, Adams' campaign got more than $10 million in matching public funds, the indictment said. NYC investigations: Who’s resigned from Eric Adams’ administration? Recent resignations Several top city officials have announced their resignation from the Adams administration in recent weeks. So far, federal prosecutors have declined to comment on the investigations or provide details about their scope. Recent resignations include New York City Schools Chancellor David Banks, head of the largest school system in the U.S. He submitted his resignation Tuesday, effective at the end of the calendar year. Banks’ decision to step down came after federal agents seized his phone and other devices earlier this month, The Associated Press reported. New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan additionally announced he would resign early next year. Vasan was appointed in December 2021 while the omicron variant of COVID-19 was in full swing and was soon after confronted with the city’s first case of polio in a decade. He’s the third high-ranking city official to announce a resignation this month. Unnamed sources reportedly told NBC New York that Vasan’s announcement is unrelated to the investigation involving several other city officials. Former New York City Police Department Commissioner Edward Caban and chief legal counsel Liza Zornberg also announced their resignations in recent weeks. Caban, the city’s former police commissioner, resigned in early September — one week after investigators seized his phone. Federal officials seized phones from Caban and two New York police lieutenants who worked in the commissioner’s office and on his detail, sources told NewsNation local affiliate WPIX. Officials also took devices from the home of Caban’s twin brother, James Caban — a former police officer who now runs a nightlife consulting business, according to the AP. Zornberg is a former federal prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s office who led some of the investigative efforts into the Adams administration and also resigned abruptly around that time. Officials did not seize her phone, the AP reported. The Associated Press and NewsNation partner The Hill contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/eric-adams-indicted-wont-resign/	2024-09-26T10:44:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24270549143810.jpg?w=900
Florida man convicted of sex trafficking multiple women, girls	(NewsNation) — A federal jury this week convicted a Florida man of sex trafficking nearly a dozen girls and women, whom prosecutors say he threatened, abused and required to have sex with other men and himself. Shannima Yuantrell Session faces a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life in prison on 13 charges for sex trafficking. The 47-year-old from Lake Placid, Florida, is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 19. The convictions stem from allegations that Session made women engage in commercial sex acts between July 2011 and July 2013, and then from February 2016 to February 2019, according to a Justice Department news release. Suge Knight claims Diddy participated in abuse, assault with higher-ups Prosecutors said Session offered empty promises of legitimate work and housing assistance to people who were struggling with unstable living conditions. At times, he prevented them from eating if they didn’t obey his demands. He also often required them to engage in sex acts with him after making them perform commercial sex acts with as many as 18 men. Prosecutors additionally presented evidence at trial alleging Session beat and choked the women, held their heads underwater in a nearby lake and threatened to drown them, and used a firearm to threaten and control the women. 'The defendant used despicable and horrific means to terrify and coerce nearly a dozen women and girls to engage in commercial sex,' said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. 'The Justice Department is committed to protecting vulnerable victims from such cruel exploitation.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/florida-man-sex-trafficking-conviction/	2024-09-26T06:28:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/gavel_judge_court_Getty-e1712696847241.jpg?w=800
House panel investigating Trump assassination attempts is holding...	WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan congressional task force investigating the assassination attempts against Donald Trump is set to hold its first hearing Thursday as lawmakers rush to ensure candidate safety just weeks before the U.S. presidential election. The panel — comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats — has spent the last two months trying to decipher the security failures that allowed a gunman to scale a roof and open fire at the former president during a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania, killing a spectator. Now they are also investigating this month's Secret Service arrest of a man with a rifle on Trump's Florida golf course who also allegedly sought to assassinate the GOP presidential nominee. The suspect in the second assassination attempt, Ryan Wesley Routh, was allegedly aiming a rifle through the shrubbery surrounding Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course when he was detected by a Secret Service agent. The agent opened fire and Routh fled before being apprehended by local authorities. Rep. Jason Crow, the top Democrat on the task force, said the group is now shifting to 'a longer term, holistic look at both Butler and Florida.' The hearing Thursday will be the first time the task force will present its findings to the public after spending weeks conducting nearly two dozen interviews with law enforcement and receiving more than 2,800 pages of documents from the Secret Service. It will focus on the use of local law enforcement by the Secret Service, featuring testimony from Pennsylvania state and Butler County police officials. The Secret Service often relies on local authorities to secure bigger events where protectees like Trump appear around the country. But after the Butler rally, the Secret Service was heavily criticized for failing to clearly communicate what they needed from those local agencies that day. Thursday's session will be the fourth congressional hearing about the Butler shooting since July. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned one day after she appeared before a congressional hearing where she was berated for hours by both Democrats and Republicans for the agency's security failures. Cheatle called the attempt on Trump’s life the Secret Service’s 'most significant operational failure' in decades, but she angered lawmakers by failing to answer specific questions about the investigation. An interim report Wednesday from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is also conducting an investigation, said the Secret Service failed to give clear instructions on how state and local officials should cover the building where the gunman eventually took up position. Their report also said the agency didn’t make sure they could share information with local partners in real-time. The Secret Service has also released a five-page document summarizing the key conclusions of a yet-to-be-finalized agency report on what went wrong in Butler. The House panel is expected to propose a series of legislative reforms and issue their own final report before Dec. 13. While the oversight investigations have been bipartisan, Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on whether to give the Secret Service more money in the wake of its failures. A government funding bill that passed Wednesday includes an additional $231 million for the agency, even though many Republicans were skeptical and said an internal overhaul of the Secret Service is needed. As lawmakers prepare to probe the second attempt in Florida, they are also grappling with the major differences between the two assassination attempts. 'It’s going to be different in a lot of respects. I mean, the size of the event was very different. The use of local law enforcement was very different. The challenges were different,' Crow said. 'Whereas in Butler, there are very obvious series of cascading failures.' The Colorado lawmaker said the Justice Department and FBI have also informed Congress that given the ongoing criminal investigation into what happened in Florida and the prosecution of Routh, it will be more challenging for them to turn over documents or provide witness testimony. The shooter in Butler, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by a sniper.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-politics/ap-house-panel-investigating-trump-assassination-attempts-is-holding-its-first-hearing/	2024-09-26T04:46:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f54acab470d1.43705538.jpeg?w=900
Live: House panel probing Trump assassination attempts hold heari...	(NewsNation) — The bipartisan House task force investigating the plots to assassinate former President Donald Trump held its first hearing Thursday with testimony expected from several law enforcement officials. The public hearing comes just a day after a Senate subcommittee released a report on Secret Service failures in Butler, Pennsylvania, leading up to the July 13 attempt on Trump's life. Lawmakers claim 'foreseeable' and 'preventable' mistakes by the Secret Service 'directly contributed' to the July shooting. Mayor Eric Adams corruption investigation, indictment: Timeline To date, most of the panel's work has been conducted behind closed doors, including dozens of interviews with law enforcement agents and witnesses from the rally site where the former president was shot. Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. was among those the task force had spoken to prior to the hearing, especially now that the agency is under a microscope. However, no Secret Service member is anticipated to appear at Thursday's hearing. The only exception is a former agent slated to testify. While Thursday's hearing will focus exclusively on the shooting in Butler, last week the House held a vote to expand the purview of the task force to include an investigation into the second assassination attempt on Trump's life outside of his West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course. This opens the door to future hearings. Aerospace scientist says he can measure psychic abilities The House task force was scheduled to travel to West Palm Beach on Friday for a site visit; however, that trip has been postponed due to Hurricane Helene. Members of the task force told NewsNation they want to visit the site to gather critical information that would hopefully give them further insight and perspective to properly investigate the second assassination attempt.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/house-panel-trump-assassination-attempts-hearing/	2024-09-26T04:35:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2167843860.jpg?w=900
Minimum wage on the ballot in these 5 states	(NewsNation) — The federal minimum wage hasn't changed since 2009, but voters in several states will have the chance to raise hourly wages at the state level in November. Voters in Alaska, California and Missouri will decide whether to increase their state's minimum wage. If history is any indicator, those efforts are likely to be successful. From 1996 to 2022, voters approved 26 of the 28 minimum wage increase measures on the ballot, according to Ballotopedia.

Lebanese officials say an Israeli strike killed 23 Syrian workers...	BEIRUT (AP) — An Israeli airstrike in Lebanon hit a building housing Syrian workers and their families, killing 23 people, Lebanese officials said Thursday. It was one of the deadliest single strikes in an intensified air campaign against the militant Hezbollah group. The strike late Wednesday came as the United States and its allies called for an 'immediate' 21-day cease-fire to 'provide space for diplomacy.' Israel has threatened to launch a ground invasion, and the increasingly heavy exchanges of fire could trigger an all-out war. Lebanon's National News Agency said the strike occurred near the ancient city of Baalbek in Lebanon's northeastern Bekaa Valley, which runs along the Syrian border. It quoted Ali Kassas, mayor of the village of Younine, as saying that the bodies of 23 Syrian citizens were pulled from under the rubble. He said four Syrians and four Lebanese were wounded. Hussein Salloum, a local official in Younine, said most of the dead were women and children, and that rescue efforts lasted through the night and into Thursday morning. 'We dug through the rubble with our own hands' until a small bulldozer was brought in, Salloum told The Associated Press by telephone. 'We had very limited capabilities.' The Lebanese Red Cross said it recovered nine bodies, while others were recovered by the Hezbollah militant group’s paramedic service and the Lebanese Civil Defense. Lebanon, with a population of around 6 million, hosts nearly 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands who are unregistered — the world’s highest refugee population per capita. Israel has carried out days of heavy strikes across Lebanon, targeting what it says are Hezbollah rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. The militants have fired hundreds of rockets into Israel and on Wednesday targeted Tel Aviv for the first time with a longer-range missile that was intercepted. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is traveling to the United States for the U.N. General Assembly, has not yet responded to the cease-fire proposal. But his foreign minister, Israel Katz, said Israel would continue fighting 'with full force until victory.' Hezbollah has also not yet responded to the proposal. The militant group has insisted it would only halt its strikes if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears out of reach despite months of negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. Israeli strikes since Monday have killed more than 630 people in Lebanon, according to local health authorities, who say around a quarter were women and children. Several people have been wounded by shrapnel in Israel. Israel struck 75 sites overnight across southern and eastern Lebanon, the military said. At least 45 projectiles were fired from Lebanon early Thursday, all of which were intercepted or fell in open areas, it said. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack ignited the war in Gaza, hoping to pin down Israeli forces. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are close allies of Iran. The fighting has killed dozens of people in Israel and driven tens of thousands from their homes on both sides of the border. Israel has vowed to do whatever is necessary to allow its citizens to return, and it has moved thousands of troops to the northern border in preparation for a possible ground operation. ___ Lidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-lebanese-state-media-says-an-israeli-strike-killed-23-syrian-workers/	2024-09-26T02:51:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f52fec1aa961.91943472.jpeg?w=900
Hurricane Helene's arrival to bring 'unsurvivable' storm surge	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Helene is forecast to make landfall Thursday night as a Category 4 storm, threatening Florida’s coast and southern Georgia with the potential for 'unsurvivable' storm surges as high as 20 feet and 'catastrophic' winds up to 130 mph. Helene, the fifth hurricane of the Atlantic season this year, will deliver heavy rainfall, flash flooding and a life-threatening storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center. Before landfall early Thursday morning, sustained winds were near 90 mph, heading northward. The NHC predicts the winds will intensify reach 130 mph upon landfall. Could the Fujiwhara effect influence Helene’s path? As of 5 a.m. Eastern, Helene was a Category 1 storm about 350 miles southwest of Tampa, Florida, with a northward trajectory. After making landfall in Florida’s Big Bend area in the northwest part of the state, forecasters expect the storm to turn northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday. More than 20 counties were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders as of Thursday morning, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for most of Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster did the same, as wind damage is forecast to extend far beyond the storm’s center and inland across the southeastern U.S. 'There is a danger of catastrophic and unsurvivable storm surge for Apalachee Bay … this forecast, if realized, is a nightmare surge scenario for Apalachee Bay,' the National Weather Service in Tallahassee said, pleading with residents to 'please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously.' ‼️Situation Overview for #HurricaneHelene from our Hurricane Local Statement Product ‼️(https://t.co/Hr6fIdtCfA). PLEASE give this a read and do not take #Helene lightly. #FLwx #ALwx #GAwx pic.twitter.com/ZPvvAY4xCB&mdash; NWS Tallahassee (@NWSTallahassee) September 26, 2024 The storm surge causes normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The destructive Hurricane Ian in 2022 had storm surge levels of 10 to 15 feet above ground level. Helene, meanwhile, could produce storm surge of 15-20 feet in some areas. The NHC warns of prolonged power outages lasting days to weeks, damage to trees and powerlines and inaccessible roads. Tornadoes are also possible.

Mayor Eric Adams corruption investigation, indictment: Timeline	(NewsNation) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been indicted by a federal grand jury on criminal charges that are still sealed, according to two people familiar with the matter. The charges against Adams, a Democrat, were still sealed late Wednesday, according to the sources who spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Adams is a retired police captain who was elected as New York City’s 110th mayor nearly three years ago. The indictment makes Adams the first sitting New York City mayor to face criminal charges. NYC investigations: Who’s resigned from Eric Adams’ administration? Timeline of events in the federal investigation: Nov. 2, 2023 The investigation into Adams’ 2021 mayoral campaign fundraising became widely known in November 2023. That’s when FBI agents searched the home of Brianna Suggs, who was a fundraiser for Adams during his 2021 campaign, and Rana Abbasova, who worked in the mayor’s international affairs office. Nov. 6, 2023 Four days later, FBI agents seized phones and an iPad from Adams as he was leaving a public event in Manhattan. 'The mayor immediately complied with the FBI’s request and provided them with electronic devices,' lawyer Boyd Johnson’s statement said. 'The mayor has not been accused of any wrongdoing and continues to cooperate with the investigation.' Feb. 29, 2024 Federal agents raided two homes owned by Winnie Greco, Adams’ director of Asian affairs. It is unclear if the raid was connected to Adams. The search of the properties came months after Adams associates’ homes were searched as part of a federal corruption probe centered on the mayor’s 2021 election campaign, which allegedly conspired with the Turkish government to receive illegal foreign donations. Following the raid, Greco was put on leave. July 2024 Adams received his own subpoena from federal prosecutors seeking information from him, his campaign, and City Hall. Those subpoenas requested information about the mayor’s schedule, his overseas travel and potential connections to the Turkish government, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigations. Sept. 4, 2024 Federal agents on took devices from Adams’ police commissioner, his schools chancellor, two deputy mayors and several other advisers. None of the officials involved have been charged with a crime, but the wave of searches added to a cloud of suspicion around Adams. They also raised questions internally about the administration’s ability to stay focused on serving the nation’s largest city. Sept. 12, 2024 New York Police Department Commissioner Edward Caban resigned amid a federal investigation involving alleged corruption, according to Mayor Eric Adams. Caban said he decided to resign after the 'news around recent developments' had 'created a distraction for our department,' according to an email to the police department obtained by The Associated Press. 'I am unwilling to let my attention be on anything other than our important work, or the safety of the men and women of the NYPD,' he added. Sept. 14, 2024 City Hall announced Lisa Zornberg’s abrupt departure. She had advised Adams and other city officials on legal strategy for over a year and often parried legal questions from the media on his behalf. She was not his personal lawyer. 'It has been a great honor to serve the City. I am tendering my resignation, effective today, as I have concluded that I can no longer effectively serve in my position. I wish you nothing but the best,' Zornberg wrote in a three-sentence resignation letter to Adams. Officials did not seize her phone, the AP reported. Sept. 16, 2024 Two former New York City Fire Department chiefs were in custody Monday on charges that they solicited tens of thousands of dollars in bribes before ensuring the department’s fire-safety division gave preferential treatment to some individuals and companies. Anthony Saccavino and Brian Cordasco were arrested on bribery, corruption and false statements charges alleging that they solicited and accepted the bribe payments from at least 2021 through 2023, authorities said. Sept. 20, 2024 Federal prosecutors subpoenaed the director of the city’s Office of Asylum Seeker Operations to testify before a grand jury. Molly Schaeffer, who coordinates the city’s efforts to get housing and social services for newly arrived migrants, received the subpoena at her Brooklyn home in September, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the subpoena. The authorities did not seize Schaeffer’s electronic devices — as they had done to several other Adams’ aides in recent weeks — but served her a subpoena requesting her presence in front of a federal grand jury in Manhattan, the person said. Sept. 25, 2024 U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called on Adams to resign, the first nationally prominent Democrat to do so. She cited the federal criminal investigations into the mayor’s administration and the string of unexpected departures of top city officials. 'I do not see how Mayor Adams can continue governing New York City,' Ocasio-Cortez wrote on the social platform X. Adams reacted with scorn, dismissing Ocasio-Cortez as self-righteous. In a statement to NewsNation on Wednesday night, Adams maintained his innocence. Eric Adams indicted on federal criminal charges: Sources 'I always knew that If I stood my ground for New Yorkers that I would be a target—and a target I became. If I am charged, I am innocent and I will fight this with every ounce of my strength and spirit,' Adams said.

Suge Knight claims Diddy participated in abuse, assault with high...	(NewsNation) — Suge Knight, co-founder and former CEO of Death Row Records tells 'CUOMO' that Sean 'Diddy' Combs is 'not the only one' to put younger artists through humiliating sexual acts, describing various industry practices throughout the decades. The video above contains excerpts of his live, exclusive interview with Chris Cuomo. Combs, who has gone by various aliases including P. Diddy, Diddy, Puffy and Puff Daddy, was arrested on Sept. 16 following a grand jury indictment for several felonies, including sex trafficking and racketeering. The arrest came as the producer faced a mounting list of civil lawsuits alleging abuse and assault spanning over three decades. He's being held in Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center, and two of his bids for a bail release have failed. Diddy has pleaded not guilty to all charges. What we know about the Diddy investigation Knight, who has been serving a 28-year prison sentence in California for voluntary manslaughter, tells NewsNation he sees Diddy's current situation as a product of a corrupt industry, saying Diddy 'stepped in this s--t. Even if he wiped off his shoe, it still stinks. But he's not the only one. They got all the tapes.' Knight: Abuse was learned from industry Knight claims Diddy 'was taught from people before him, and he did it to the younger people after him.' It's an industry that, according to Knight, has a long history of sexually abusing and assaulting its newest members. He said one practice, called an 'egg test,' went as follows: 'Those guys pull their pants down and bent over. They stick (the egg) up their a--. Their eggs break. They say they're not ready yet, they ain't put enough work in. This is Hollywood,' Knight said. Without attending 'those butt naked parties,' it's hard to comprehend what happened — but that doesn't mean it was a secret, according to Knight. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs arrest and indictment: A timeline of key events 'Because this been going on in the industry for a whole bunch of years, for decades and at the same time. You know, nobody wanted to be true, and it shouldn't have to be true,' Knight said. Knight also said he believes Diddy's allegations stem from his own experiences. 'You know, hurt people hurt people ... Someone was sexually abused, they wind up being a perpetrator. Is that what you're suggesting about Sean Combs, that he was sexually abused, and he now sexually abuses?' NewsNation's Chris Cuomo asked. 'Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. I think it was done to him,' Knight said. Knight accuses others in industry In his exclusive interview with NewsNation, Knight accused other industry professionals including a man whose 'job was to bring underage girls and girls and have sex with employees and other artists, to the point where his friend got caught up with the same thing,' Knight said. Knight went on to mention that Interscope and Universal have a policy of not dealing with artists who get into trouble and are often the ones paying off the alleged victims of their artists.

He claimed the company put her on the payroll as a means of repayment, with Knight adding he believes 'she had to pay taxes.' 'I shouldn't say that, because I'm trying to protect her, her image, but he beat the s--- out of her and Cassie. He did things to her you should never do to a woman,' Knight said. He also mentioned artists by name who should have been 'whistleblowers,' including Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross, among others. Knight called for change in the industry, telling Cuomo, 'If we don't fix it and do something about it, history will constantly be repeating itself.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/suge-knight-claims-diddy-participated-in-abuse-assault-with-higher-ups/	2024-09-25T12:21:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-51236760.jpg?w=900
Mexican cartels targeting police with tire spikes	(NewsNation) —Mexican cartels are becoming increasingly confrontational with law enforcement, using tire deflation devices like caltrops to disable vehicles during pursuits to evade arrest. While these devices have been in use quietly for nearly two decades, there has been a recent resurgence and Border Patrol has issued an alert to agents warning them of an uptick in tire deflation tactics by smugglers. Cartels and criminal smugglers are finding 'ways to evolve based on what we're doing as law enforcement, they're going to change their tactics,' Texas Department of Public Safety Lt. Chris Olivarez told NewsNation. Is Arizona the new migrant hotspot as Texas beefs up security? 'If they are constantly being pursued by law enforcement, getting arrested by law enforcement, they have no other way to get away.' The use of tire deflation devices Tire deflation devices, like caltrops, were seen by DPS as early as 2008 when drug smugglers would use them against law enforcement to protect drug loads and evade law enforcement, Olivarez said. But they became less common over the years. Caltrops are devices with four metal points arranged so that when any three are on the ground, the fourth spike projects upward to puncture tires. While they look different, the devices act similarly to the tire deflation mechanisms law enforcement uses and has the same goal. 4 family members sentenced for human smuggling ‘family enterprise’ in South Texas The use of a caltrop or other tire deflation device against an officer is a third-degree felony. 'We started seeing caltrops now this particular instance, we haven't seen them in years,' Olivarez said. Olivarez said he is concerned with the resurgence as the agency has been contending with human smuggling on a daily basis. Cartels and smugglers are starting to get 'desperate,' now, he said. 'They want to evade law enforcement by any means whatsoever, and if that means using a weapon such as caltrops, and that's what we could possibly start seeing in the future.' Caltrops are likely used by a more advanced smuggler who has been working for the criminal cartels for years, he added. Incidents where tire deflation devices used Tire deflation devices have long been used by the Texas DPS, which works under the state’s Operation Lone Star program, created by Gov. Greg Abbott. Since Operation Lone Star launched in 2021, troopers have made 9,730 human smuggling arrests and filed nearly 2,200 charges for the offense. In one incident, a truck driver fled from DPS troopers in La Salle County, leading troopers to deploy a tire deflation device causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle and leading to his arrest. Venezuelan gang member arrested again for human smuggling During a chase in Kinney County, two teenage smugglers who had been paid $9,000 to move migrants hit a light pole after their tires were punctured. Both were arrested and charged. But now, it appears the tables have turned with smugglers employing the same tactics. Both law enforcement and civilian vehicles have been damaged in these attempts to escape. Texas DPS officers found caltrops in a vehicle used to smuggle undocumented migrants after a car pursuit resulted in the suspects fleeing near Uvalde, Texas. Neither the driver nor the occupants of the vehicle were found. 'Clearly, those devices are meant to stop the pursuit, to allow them to evade,' Olivarez said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/mexican-cartels-targeting-police-with-tire-spikes/	2024-09-25T10:22:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/AP24022754027378-e1706546059657.jpg?w=800
Trump counters Harris speech with ‘prebuttal’ in North Carolina	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak Wednesday in North Carolina about the economy to counter a speech by Vice President Kamala Harris later in the day. Trump's campaign said the former president's so-called 'prebuttal' in Mint Hill would focus on his 2019 executive order that forced federal agencies to buy products made with more American components. He is also expected to revisit how he strengthened the Buy American Act. Where are Harris, Walz, Trump and Vance today? Wednesday's visit to the Tarheel State comes as new Gallup polling shows the 2024 election environmental is favorable for the Republican Party. GOP gubernatorial fallout However, the North Carolina governor's race took a turn after a CNN report last Thursday that GOP gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson made many inflammatory comments concerning race, gender and sexual preferences. Robinson said Tuesday his campaign hired a law firm to help investigate the CNN report, saying the lawyers will look at how what Robinson calls 'false smears' originated. New national polling from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ now shows Robinson's opponent Democrat Josh Stein leading by nearly 11 points. The scandal has left Republicans seeking distance from Robinson, and most of his top campaign staffers also quit in the aftermath of the report. Republican officials are anxious that Robinson’s situation could pull down Trump and help Harris in the battleground state, and threaten the outcomes of other key races on the ballot. Robinson was endorsed by Trump before the primary and has spoken at the former president’s in-state rallies. But, he was not involved in a Trump rally in Wilmington last weekend and Trump didn’t mention him. Speaking Monday in Charlotte, Trump running mate Sen. JD Vance said it was up to North Carolina voters to decide what they think of Robinson’s messages and whether they believe Robinson’s defense.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-economic-speech-north-carolina/	2024-09-25T09:57:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24263004455564.jpg?w=900
Kentucky sheriff accused of killing judge due in court	(NewsNation) — The Kentucky sheriff arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of a local judge in his courthouse chambers is set to appear virtually in court Wednesday morning. Authorities say Letcher County Sheriff Shawn 'Mickey' Stines, 43, shot District Judge Kevin Mullins multiple times last Thursday following an argument in the courthouse. Mullins, 54, died at the scene. Stines, according to The Mountain Eagle, allegedly walked into the judge’s outer office, then told court employees and others gathered there that he needed to speak with Mullins alone. After the two walked into the judge's chambers, witnesses heard shots. Stines walked out with his hands up and surrendered to police. Letcher County official shares what he knows about shooting Stines was charged with one count of first-degree murder. Police have not revealed a motive. According to the Associated Press, a brief arrest citation from Thursday says: 'Perpetrator used a firearm to shoot ... Letcher County District Judge Kevin Mullins. Judge Mullins succumbed to his injuries after the shooting.' Mullins was shot at 2:55 p.m., and Stines' arrest came five minutes later, per the citation, which has no other information related to the shooting.

Judge to weigh $600M East Palestine train derailment settlement	(NewsNation) — A federal judge could decide Wednesday whether to approve Norfolk Southern’s $600 million class-action settlement offer, more than a year after the 2023 toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. The hearing comes on the heels of an Associated Press analysis that raised concerns about the Environmental Protection Agency’s handling of contamination data from the derailment site. Many residents question the agency’s transparency about potential resulting health risks. The hearing will start at 10 a.m. CT at the Northern District Court of Ohio in Youngstown. A rally in support of the people affected by the derailment is planned for the same time outside the courthouse. NewsNation will publish updates here as they become available. 2 injured on United flight after plane tries to avoid collision A black plume rises over East Palestine, Ohio, as a result of a controlled detonation of a portion of the derailed Norfolk Southern trains, Feb. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) East Palestine train derailment A Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals derailed just before 9 p.m. local time Feb. 3, 2023, in East Palestine. Some 1,500 residents were told to evacuate. Fearing an explosion, officials vented and burned five tank cars, releasing the carcinogen vinyl chloride into the air. Minutes later, a toxic plume of smoke smothered the region. Three days after the derailment, the EPA said it hadn’t detected contaminants at 'levels of concern' and gave the all-clear for residents to return. Those who did reported developing rashes and feeling ill. In March 2023, an independent testing expert confirmed residents’ fears that carcinogens undetected by the Ohio EPA were in the water. More tests revealed dioxins — the most toxic compounds on the planet — in the soil, water and residents’ air filters. Today, those who remain in East Palestine and the surrounding area say their health problems are getting worse. Secret Service failures before Trump rally shooting were ‘preventable,’ Senate panel finds FILE - Norfolk Southern Railroad CEO Alan Shaw speaks during an interview Wednesday, June 21, 2023, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/John Bazemore, File) Norfolk Southern settlement The rail company agreed in April to pay $600 million in a class-action lawsuit settlement tied to the derailment. Residents, however, worry the money won’t cover potential future health needs and won’t amount to much once it’s divided among recipients. Attorneys for East Palestine residents filed a motion in August asking the judge to reevaluate the settlement. 'To accept, we would have to say that Norfolk Southern is not liable for anything, when, in fact, they were guilty of so many crimes here,' East Palestine resident Tammy Tsai told NewsNation ahead of Wednesday's hearing. The residents' complaint focused on allegations that settlement lawyers buried a contracted exposure expert’s findings about the state of soil and water in the affected area. They argue the settlement agreement was rushed and allege lawyers are colluding with Norfolk Southern. That exposure expert, Stephen Petty, was among several people who filed affidavits with the court and the EPA's inspector general. 'It is one of the few times where I’ve been involved, where I don’t think that the information that should get out there is getting out there,' Petty told NewsNation in an exclusive interview earlier this week.

Passenger killed in hijacking, pursuit of MTA bus in Los Angeles	(KTLA) — One person was fatally shot when an MTA bus was hijacked and then pursued by police from South Los Angeles to downtown early Wednesday morning. Officers responded to a 'Call 911' sign seen flashing on the bus around 12:45 a.m. at South Figueroa Street and Manchester Avenue in the Vermont Knolls neighborhood of South Los Angeles, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed. The bus driver had posted the emergency after a suspect pulled out a gun during some type of dispute. Watch live: One of Titan submersible owner's top officials to testify Several passengers quickly exited the bus but at least two others were still on board when the bus driver took off with the suspect then holding a gun to his head. Officers deployed spike strips, which flattened the tires of the bus and the pursuit came to an end at East 6th Street and South Alameda Street in downtown L.A., the spokesperson said. SWAT officers arrived at the scene and deployed flash-bang devices during a standoff with the suspect. Video showed the bus driver getting out of the bus through a window with the assistance of police. At least one passenger was also rescued from the bus.

Helene now a Category 1 hurricane as it moves over Gulf toward Fl...	(NewsNation) — Helene strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane Wednesday as it moved over the Caribbean into the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida. Floridians along the peninsula's west coast have been preparing for another hurricane forecast to bring strong winds and dangerous flooding as soon as Thursday across the Gulf Coast. What was a tropical storm early Wednesday morning continues to strengthen ahead of its anticipated landfall in the United States on Thursday. Helene is anticipated to be the fourth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this year. Thousands along Florida's coast have been advised to evacuate as Helene approaches — especially those living in areas previously hit hard by recent hurricanes. Brad Reinhart, a senior hurricane specialist, said in a phone interview with the Associated Press that Helene could become a Category 3 by the time it reaches the Gulf Coast. 'People in the Florida Panhandle and the west coast of Florida certainly need to pay close attention,' Reinhart said. 'It’s a pretty aggressive forecast for intensification over the next few days. ... People need to remain on high alert.' Could the Fujiwhara effect influence Helene's path? Tracking Helene's movement in the Gulf As of Wednesday morning, Helene was about 500 miles southwest of Tampa, Florida, with maximum winds of 80 mph. Helene, which formed Tuesday in the Caribbean, is expected to move over deep, warm waters, fueling its intensification. People in regions under hurricane warnings and watches should be prepared to lose power and should have enough food and water for at least three days, forecasters warned. President Joe Biden declared an emergency in Florida and deployed Federal Emergency Management Agency teams to Florida and Alabama to support local first responders. Federal authorities were positioning generators, food and water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams, the White House said. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency in 41 counties. On Tuesday morning, the storm moved through the Caribbean Sea near Cuba and the Cayman Islands, according to the National Hurricane Center. 'Prepare that it's going to be as strong as possible,' DeSantis said. 'The wind you can hide from ... it's the water that can be really, really devastating if you remain there when you're told to evacuate.' The storm is anticipated to be unusually large and fast-moving, meaning storm surges, wind and rain will likely extend far from the storm’s center, the hurricane center said. States as far inland as Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana could see rainfall. Can this caterpillar really predict winter weather?

(AP Photo/Luis Alberto Cruz) Watches and warning have been issued for parts of the Yucatan Peninsula, western Cuba, Grand Cayman and Florida, according to the Weather Channel. A hurricane warning was in effect for the Anclote River to Mexico Beach, Florida; and Cabo Catoche to Tulum, Mexico including Cozumel. A hurricane watch is in effect for the Cuban province of Pinar del Rio; and in Florida, from Englewood to Anclote River, including Tampa Bay. Hurricane watches mean that hurricane conditions are possible. They are usually issued 48 hours before forecasters predict the first occurrence of tropical storm-force winds. In Florida, a storm surge warning was in effect for Indian Pass southward to Flamingo; Tampa Bay; and Charlotte Harbor. This means there's a possibility of life-threatening 'inundation' in those areas for the next 36 hours. The Dry Tortugas; all of the Florida Keys; the Florida west coast from Flamingo to Anclote River, includingTampa Bay; west of Mexico Beach to the Walton/Bay County Line; the Florida east coast from Flamingo northward to the mouth of the St. Mary's River; Lake Okeechobee; Rio Lagartos to Cabo Catoche, Mexico; and Cuban provinces of Artemisa, Pinar del Rio, and the Isle of Youth are under a tropical storm warning. A tropical storm warning indicates tropical storms conditions are expected in the next 24-36 hours. The Georgia and South Carolina coasts north of the mouth of the St. Mary's River to the South Santee River are under a tropical storm watch, so these conditions are possible in the areas within 48 hours. In the coming days, people in regions under storm watches and warnings should be prepared to lose power, Lisa Bucci, a hurricane specialist, told AP. Bucci added that those in affected areas should stock up on enough food and water for at least three days. 'Now is the time to start preparing. If you’re in an evacuation zone, you should evacuate,' Bucci said. 'Don’t be fooled by the way the storm looks at the moment. We are expecting it to rapidly intensify.'

Hezbollah fires a missile at Tel Aviv in deepest strike yet after...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Hezbollah hurled dozens of projectiles into Israel early Wednesday, including a missile aimed at Tel Aviv that was the militant group's deepest strike yet and marked a further escalation after Israeli strikes on Lebanon killed hundreds of people. The Israeli military said it intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, which set off air-raid sirens in Tel Aviv and across central Israel. There were no reports of casualties or damage. The military said it struck the site in southern Lebanon where the missile was launched. Hezbollah said it fired a Qader 1 ballistic missile targeting the headquarters of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, which it blames for a recent string of targeted killings of its top commanders and for an attack last week in which explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies killed dozens of people and wounded thousands, including many Hezbollah members. The Israeli military said it was the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel. Hezbollah claimed to have targeted an intelligence base near Tel Aviv last month in an aerial attack, but there was no confirmation. The Palestinian Hamas militant group in Gaza repeatedly targeted Tel Aviv in the opening months of the war. The launch ratcheted up tensions as the region appeared to be teetering toward another all-out war, even as Israel continues to battle Hamas in the Gaza Strip. A wave of Israeli strikes on Monday and Tuesday killed at least 560 people in Lebanon and forced thousands to seek refuge. Fleeing families have flocked to Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon, sleeping in schools turned into shelters, as well as in cars, parks and along the beach. Some sought to leave the country, causing a traffic jam at the border with Syria. Hezbollah's latest strikes included dozens of rockets fired Wednesday into northern Israel, with one hitting an empty home and sparking a fire in the city of Safed. The Israeli military said that at one point the militants fired 40 projectiles simultaneously. Israel responded with its own new strikes on Hezbollah. In Lebanon, at least three people were killed and nine wounded in an Israeli strike near Byblos, according to the country's Health Ministry. The coastal town is north of Beirut and far from Hezbollah's main strongholds. The Israeli military has said there are no immediate plans for a ground invasion, but it has declined to give a timetable for the air campaign. Tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group have steadily escalated over the last 11 months. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation. The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Lebanon for Wednesday at the request of France. Nearly a year of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel had already displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border before this week’s escalation. Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, something that appears increasingly remote. The rocket fire over the past week has disrupted life for more than 1 million people across northern Israel, with schools closed and restrictions on public gatherings. Many restaurants and other businesses are shut in the coastal city of Haifa, and there are fewer people on the streets. Some who fled south from communities near the border are coming under rocket fire again. Israel has moved thousands of troops who had been serving in Gaza to the northern border. It says Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including some capable of striking anywhere in Israel, and that the group has fired some 9,000 rockets and drones since last October. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said the missile fired Wednesday had a 'heavy warhead' but declined to elaborate or confirm it was the type described by Hezbollah. He dismissed Hezbollah's claim of targeting the Mossad headquarters, located just north of Tel Aviv, as 'psychological warfare.' The Iranian-made Qader is a medium-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile with multiple types and payloads. It can carry an explosive payload of up to 800 kilograms (1,760 pounds), according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Iranian officials have described the liquid-fueled missile as having a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles). Cross-border fire began ramping up Sunday in the wake of the pager and walkie-talkie bombings, which killed 39 people and wounded nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility. On Sunday, Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel. The next day, Israel said its warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones, including weapons concealed in private homes. The strikes racked up the highest one-day death toll in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006. An Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday killed Ibrahim Kobeisi, whom Israel described as a top Hezbollah commander with the group’s rocket and missile unit. Military officials said Kobeisi was responsible for launches toward Israel and planned a 2000 attack in which three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and killed. Hezbollah later confirmed his death. It was the latest in a string of assassinations and other setbacks for Hezbollah, which is Lebanon's strongest political and military actor and is widely considered the top paramilitary force in the Arab world. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said six people were killed and 15 were wounded in the strike in a southern Beirut suburb, an area where Hezbollah has a strong presence. The country’s National News Agency said the attack destroyed three floors of a six-story apartment building.

Secret Service failures before Trump rally shooting were 'prevent...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Multiple Secret Service failures ahead of the July rally for former President Donald Trump where a gunman opened fire were 'foreseeable, preventable, and directly related to the events resulting in the assassination attempt that day,' according to a bipartisan Senate investigation released Wednesday. Similar to the agency’s own internal investigation and an ongoing bipartisan House probe, the interim report from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee found multiple failures on almost every level ahead of the Butler, Pennsylvania shooting, including in planning, communications, security and allocation of resources. 'The consequences of those failures were dire,' said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the Democratic chairman of the Homeland panel. Investigators found that there was no clear chain of command among the Secret Service and other security agencies and no plan for coverage of the building where the shooter climbed up to fire the shots. Officials were operating on multiple, separate radio channels, leading to missed communications, and an inexperienced drone operator was stuck on a help line after his equipment wasn’t working correctly. Communications among security officials were a 'multi-step game of telephone,' Peters said. The report found the Secret Service was notified about an individual on the roof of the building approximately two minutes before shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire, firing eight rounds in Trump’s direction less than 150 yards from where the former president was speaking. Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper. Approximately 22 seconds before Crooks fired, the report found, a local officer sent a radio alert that there was an armed individual on the building. But that information was not relayed to key Secret Service personnel who were interviewed by Senate investigators. The panel also interviewed a Secret Service counter-sniper who said that they saw officers with their guns drawn running toward the building where the shooter was perched, but the person said they did not think to notify anyone to get Trump off the stage. The Senate report comes just days after the Secret Service released a five-page document summarizing the key conclusions of a yet-to-be finalized Secret Service report on what went wrong, and ahead of a Thursday hearing that will be held by a bipartisan House task force investigating the shooting. The House panel is also investigating a second assassination attempt on Trump earlier this month when Secret Service agents arrested a man with a rifle hiding on the golf course at Trump’s Florida club. Each investigation has found new details that reflect a massive breakdown in the former president’s security, and lawmakers say there is much more they want to find out as they try to prevent it from happening again. 'This was the result of multiple human failures of the Secret Service,' said Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the top Republican on the panel. The senators recommended that the Secret Service better define roles and responsibilities before any protective event, including by designating a single individual in charge of approving all the security plans. Investigators found that many of the people in charge denied that they had responsibility for planning or security failures, and deflected blame. Advance agents interviewed by the committee said 'that planning and security decisions were made jointly, with no specific individual responsible for approval,' the report said. Communication with local authorities was also poor. Local law enforcement had raised concern two days earlier about security coverage of the building where the shooter perched, telling Secret Service agents during a walk through that they did not have the manpower to lock it down. Secret Service agents then gave investigators conflicting accounts about who was responsible for that security coverage, the report said. The internal review released last week by the Secret Service also detailed multiple communications breakdowns, including an absence of clear guidance to local law enforcement and the failure to fix line-of-sight vulnerabilities at the rally grounds that left Trump open to sniper fire and 'complacency' among some agents. 'This was a failure on the part of the United States Secret Service. It’s important that we hold ourselves to account for the failures of July 13th and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again,' said Ronald Rowe Jr., the agency’s acting director, after the report was released. In addition to better defining responsibility for events, the senators recommended that the agency completely overhaul its communications operations at protective events and improve intelligence sharing. They also recommended that Congress evaluate whether more resources are needed. Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on whether to give the Secret Service more money in the wake of its failures. A spending bill on track to pass before the end of the month includes an additional $231 million for the agency, but many Republicans have said that an internal overhaul is needed first. 'This is a management problem plain and simple,' said Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the top Republican on the Homeland panel's investigations subcommittee.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-secret-service-failures-before-trump-rally-shooting-were-preventable-senate-panel-finds/	2024-09-25T02:03:13-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f3d2b6da2f17.47689031.jpeg?w=900
Live: NTSB engineer to testify before Coast Guard in Titan submer...	An engineer with the National Transportation Safety Board is scheduled to testify in front of the Coast Guard on Wednesday about the experimental submersible that imploded en route to the wreckage of the Titanic. Engineer Don Kramer is slated to testify as the investigation continues into the implosion of OceanGate's Titan submersible. OceanGate co-founder Stockton Rush was among the five people who died when the submersible imploded in June 2023. The Coast Guard opened a public hearing earlier this month that is part of a high level investigation into the cause of the implosion. Some of the testimony has focused on the troubled nature of the company. Earlier in the hearing, former OceanGate operations director David Lochridge said he frequently clashed with Rush and felt the company was committed only to making money. 'The whole idea behind the company was to make money,' Lochridge testified. 'There was very little in the way of science.' Lochridge and other previous witnesses painted a picture of a company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident set off a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration. The hearing is expected to run through Friday and include several more witnesses, some of whom were closely connected to the company. Other witnesses scheduled to testify Wednesday were William Kohnen of Hydrospace Group Inc. and Bart Kemper of Kemper Engineering. The co-founder of the company told the Coast Guard panel Monday that he hoped a silver lining of the disaster is that it will inspire a renewed interest in exploration, including the deepest waters of the world’s oceans. Businessman Guillermo Sohnlein, who helped found OceanGate with Rush, ultimately left the company before the Titan disaster. 'This can’t be the end of deep ocean exploration. This can’t be the end of deep-diving submersibles and I don’t believe that it will be,' Sohnlein said. Coast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice. That and Titan’s unusual design subjected it to scrutiny in the undersea exploration community. OceanGate, based in Washington state, suspended its operations after the implosion. The company has no full-time employees currently, but has been represented by an attorney during the hearing. During the submersible’s final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts about Titan’s depth and weight as it descended. The support ship Polar Prince then sent repeated messages asking if Titan could still see the ship on its onboard display. One of the last messages from Titan’s crew to Polar Prince before the submersible imploded stated, 'all good here,' according to a visual re-creation presented earlier in the hearing. When the submersible was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said. No one on board survived. OceanGate said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began. Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/missing-titanic-tourist-submarine/ap-ntsb-engineer-to-testify-before-coast-guard-in-titan-submersible-disaster-hearing/	2024-09-24T21:16:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f38feab86ae3.11546757.jpeg?w=900
Israel bombards Hezbollah, killing a top commander, while familie...	BEIRUT (AP) — Kg rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation. Israel said a strike in Beirut on Tuesday had killed Ibrahim Kobeisi, who it said was a top Hezbollah commander with the group's rocket and missile unit. Military officials said Kobeisi was responsible for launches towards Israel and planned a 2000 attack in which three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and killed. Hezbollah later confirmed Kobeisi’s death. It was the latest in a string of assassinations and setbacks for Hezbollah, the strongest political and military actor in Lebanon and widely considered the top paramilitary force in the Arab world. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said six people were killed and 15 were wounded in the strike in a southern Beirut suburb, an area where Hezbollah has a strong presence. The country’s National News Agency said the attack destroyed three floors of a six-story apartment building. The U.N.’s High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon said one of its staffers and her young son were among those killed Monday in the Bekaa region, while a cleaner under contract was killed in a strike in the south. Hezbollah said its missile attacks Tuesday targeted eight sites in Israel, including an explosives factory in Zichron Yaakov, 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the border. It fired 300 rockets, injuring six soldiers and civilians, most of them lightly, according to Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman. The renewed exchange came after Monday's barrages racked up the highest death toll in any single day in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006. On Tuesday, mourners carried 11 bodies through the streets of the Lebanese village of Saksakieh, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the Lebanon-Israel border, including those of four women, an infant and a 7-year-old girl. All were killed in Israel’s bombardment of the village Monday. Some of the bodies were draped in Hezbollah flags, others wrapped in black clothes. A wreath of flowers was placed on top of the smallest one. Mohammad Halal, father of 7-year-old Joury Halal, said his daughter was an 'innocent child martyr.' 'She is a martyr for the sake of the south and Palestine,' Halal said and defiantly stated his allegiance to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel said it targeted sites where Hezbollah had stored weapons. Data from American fire-tracking satellites analyzed Tuesday by The Associated Press showed the wide range of Israeli airstrikes aimed at southern Lebanon, covering an area of over 1,700 square kilometers (650 square miles). NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System typically is used to track U.S. wildfires, but can also be used to track the flashes and burning that follow airstrikes. Data from Monday showed significant fires across southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley. The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 564 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Monday, including 50 children and 94 women, and that more than 1,800 have been wounded — a staggering toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week. Nearly a year of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel had displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border before this week's escalation. Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly remote. The Israeli military says it has no immediate plans for a ground invasion but is prepared for one. It has moved thousands of troops who had been serving in Gaza to the northern border. It says Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including some capable of striking anywhere in Israel, and that the group has fired some 9,000 rockets and drones since last October. Israel said its warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets Monday, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones, including weapons concealed in private homes. Monday's escalation came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire Sunday, when Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel. Last week, thousands of communications devices used mainly by Hezbollah members exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility. ___ Melzer contributed from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Woman alleges Diddy filmed himself, bodyguard raping her: Lawsuit	(NewsNation) — Another woman has accused Sean 'Diddy' Combs of sexual assault. Thalia Graves said the music mogul, along with his bodyguard, Joseph 'Big Joe' Sherman, 'viciously raped her' at the Bad Boy Records studio in the summer of 2001, according to court documents obtained by NewsNation local affiliate KTLA. Attorney Gloria Allred and Graves allege that the assault was filmed and then shared without the victim's consent — including selling it as pornography. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits: timeline Allred announced the newest lawsuit at a Tuesday press conference, calling the accusations a 'violation of New York City’s victims of gender-motivated violence protection law by viciously and violently forcing sexual contact [including] oral sex and sexual intercourse on the plaintiff.' 'By raping the plaintiff and recording it,' Allred added, 'the defendants caused the plaintiff to be depicted in a video image unclothed and with intimate body parts exposed and engaged in sexual conduct with another person.' Diddy may have stopped eating in jail: Former inmate At the time of the alleged assault, Graves was in a relationship with one of Diddy's employees. At the Tuesday press conference, she shared that she was going through a divorce and family issues at the time of the assault. Court documents show that Graves didn't report it for decades out of fear they 'would use their power to ruin her life, as they had repeatedly, explicitly threatened to do.' The incident left her traumatized and contemplating suicide, according to the filing. Ben Affleck given tapes of Jennifer Lopez from Diddy raids by FBI: Suge Knight 'It goes beyond just physical harm caused by the assault,' she said at the press conference. 'It’s a pain that reaches into the very core of who you are and leaves emotional scars that may never fully heal. Some of the hardest parts of this pain are the shame and the guilt I have experienced that plays a negative part in my day-to-day ability to function properly.' Graves said that the assault left her with lasting physical ailments, including chronic pain and a fear of leaving her house. Who is Kristina Khorram, Diddy’s former chief of staff? 'The trauma of the assault has taken a toll on my mental health. I’ve had PTSD, depression and anxiety,' she continued. 'It has been hard for me to trust others, create relationships or even feel safe in my own skin. The combination of physical and emotional pain has created a cycle of suffering from which it is so hard to break free.' Allred said the charges filed by Graves — the 11th of their kind — will not overlap with the existing criminal charges against Diddy. Diddy’s allegations, arrest Diddy is accused of using his music empire to engage in sex trafficking and accused of having a pattern of abusing women. He was arrested Sept. 16 after months of allegations and a federal raid on two of his properties. He pleaded not guilty in New York court the next day.

Dangerous gas leak forces immediate evacuations in Cleves, Ohio	This is developing story. Check back for updates. (NewsNation) — A dangerous chemical leak rapidly spewing from a train tanker car has forced immediate emergency evacuations for residents in Cleves, Ohio, 16 miles west of Cincinnati. The Hamilton County Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency warned people in Cleves and Whitewater Township to 'leave the area immediately' due to a 'dangerous chemical leak' in an alert, adding that they have opened a public shelter for those fleeing. Video acquired by NewsNation shows white fumes pumping out of a stalled tanker car. Several fire trucks were seen in the area spraying water on a tanker car, according to WCPO. Aerial video showed firefighters spraying down a railcar sitting upright on tracks between the highway and an asphalt plant. Cleves sits on the Ohio border with Indiana and has a population of about 3,000 people. Tom Ciuba, a spokesman for the Central Railroad of Indiana, said it was notified around 1 p.m. about a railcar in the area of Cleves that was venting styrene, which is used to make plastic and rubber. 'Ohio EPA's Emergency Response team arrived on scene in Cleves around 4:00 p.m., Tuesday. Our on-scene coordinator is there to assist the local fire department that is in charge of Incident Command Operations,' an Ohio Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson said in a statement. 'The volume of styrene in the release is unknown at this time.' Three nearby school buildings also were being evacuated, according to Lisa Whiteley, a spokesperson for the Three Rivers Local School District. Styrene gas, a neurotoxin, can immobilize people within minutes of inhalation and can be fatal at high concentrations. Last year in the Indian city of Visakhapatnam, a leak of styrene gas from a chemical factory killed 12 people and sickened more than 1,000.

(NewsNation) — A group of private citizens is calling for the arrests of former President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in a municipal court in Ohio, over comments they made about Haitian migrants living in Springfield. Court documents demand arrest warrants for Trump and Vance, claiming comments made by the two Republicans about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio were criminal, according to a court filing. The charges were filed by Guerline Jozef of The Chandra Law Firm in Cleveland, on behalf of the Haitian Bridge Alliance.

Those listed charges include disrupting public services, making false alarms, complicity, telecommunications harassment and aggravating menacing, according to the complaint. The law firm representing the group claims in a blog post that Ohio statute allows private citizens to file criminal changes. The law firm said that because the Clark County prosecuting attorney has not acted 'to protect the community and hold Trump and Vance accountable for what they have instigated', Jozef is asking the court to find probable cause and issue arrest warrants for both Trump and Vance.

Americans adopt more critical view of US Secret Service	(NewsNation) — Americans’ rating of the U.S. Secret Service’s job performance has taken a nosedive in the past decade, according to Gallup polling that was mostly completed before the Sept. 15 alleged assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. About one in three U.S. adults rate the Secret Service’s performance as excellent or good, while 25% say the agency’s work is 'only fair.' Another 36% characterized the Secret Service’s job performance as 'poor.' The polling was conducted amid ongoing investigations into the July 13 shooting at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump suffered a graze wound to his ear. One rallygoer died and several others were injured. Florida dad turns in son after school shooting threat, police say Americans and lawmakers scrutinized the Secret Service after the shooting and an alleged assassination attempt two months later only drew more attention to the agency’s perceived security lapses. Although more than half of Americans, on average, have had a positive outlook on the Secret Service since 2014, it’s not the first time faith in the agency has dipped. The current approval rating is the lowest it's been in 10 years. Americans in 2014 were more skeptical of the Secret Service's efficacy, following several security lapses — including an intruder who jumped a fence and entered the White House. The public's outlook on the agency's performance has been mostly positive since 2014 — until now. Forty-three percent of Americans at the time said the Secret Service was doing an 'excellent' or 'good' job, while 16% rated the agency’s performance as 'poor.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/americans-adopt-critical-view-us-secret-service/	2024-09-24T08:36:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/AP24196239341747_6adf5e-e1722618930657.jpg?w=900

Afghanistan withdrawal hearing: Will Blinken show?	(NewsNation) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to miss a hearing Tuesday about the nation's withdrawal from Afghanistan, despite threats to hold him in contempt of Congress. Last week, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul subpoenaed Blinken to attend the hearing, threatening contempt if he didn’t. The meeting was originally scheduled for 10 a.m. EDT Tuesday. The committee made its livestream for the hearing private about an hour before it was set to begin and posted another stream titled, 'Markup to Find Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Contempt of Congress.' Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told NewsNation Tuesday morning he doesn’t expect Blinken to attend. 'He’s going to be a no-show,' Burchett said Tuesday on 'Morning in America.' 'I don’t think he wants to face us. He’s got no excuse. This thing was a disaster.' Brett Favre to testify in Mississippi welfare scandal civil case Why is Antony Blinken unlikely to attend House hearing? The State Department lashed at House Republicans over the subpoena earlier this month, accusing them of repeatedly calling for hearings on days they knew Blinken was unavailable. McCaul said he was trying to accommodate Blinken. He had first set a hearing for Thursday while Blinken was in Egypt and France. On Tuesday, Blinken is expected to attend the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders in New York and listen to President Joe Biden’s speech at the time of the hearing. It wouldn’t have been the secretary of state’s first time speaking publicly about the six-month withdrawal that began in February 2020. Blinken has testified about Afghanistan 14 times, including four times before McCaul’s committee. JD Vance, Tim Walz prep for debate that could influence tight race Why did lawmakers plan the Afghanistan withdrawal hearing? House Republicans issued a report on their investigation into the military withdrawal earlier this month. They alleged — in part — that the Biden-Harris administration 'was determined to withdraw from Afghanistan, with or without the Doha Agreement,' also known as the Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan. The deal was brokered between the Taliban and U.S. when former President Donald Trump was in office and signed in February 2020. It called for the drawdown of U.S. forces from the country and a full withdrawal by May 2021, a timeline Biden vowed to stick to when he took office. The report also said the Biden-Harris administration failed to prepare for civilian evacuation operations and created an unsafe environment. As a result, 13 U.S. service members were killed by a terrorist attack on Aug. 26, 2021 — the deadliest day for the U.S. military in Afghanistan since 2012. Previous investigations and analyses have pointed to a systemic failure spanning the last four presidential administrations and concluded that Biden and Trump share the heaviest blame.

Live: Biden addresses UN General Assembly for final time	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden will deliver remarks before the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday as the body gathers for its annual session in New York City. It will be the last time Biden addresses the U.N. as president, having withdrawn from the November presidential race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. His remarks come as Secretary-General António Guterres has called the world a 'powder keg' and said the current situation, including geopolitical divides, climate change, inequality, ongoing wars and threats from nuclear weapons, is unsustainable. JD Vance, Tim Walz prep for debate that could influence tight race But, he said, 'the challenges we face are solvable' if the international community confronts the uncertainty of unmanaged risks, the inequality that underlies injustices and grievances and the impunity that undermines international law and the U.N.‘s founding principles. 'Today, a growing number of governments and others feel entitled to a 'get out of jail free’ card,' he said in a reference to the classic board game Monopoly. The gathering is set to begin after hundreds were reported killed following Israeli strikes on Lebanon. Israel has ramped up attacks on Hezbollah in recent days, raising the risk that the war in Gaza, now nearly a year long, could spiral into a wider regional conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is one of the leaders set to address the U.N. this week, as is Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

JD Vance, Tim Walz prep for debate that could influence tight rac...	(NewsNation) — Vice presidential candidates Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will go head-to-head in one week. Without a second presidential debate on the books, the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate could be the last chance either campaign has to sway crucial undecided voters. CBS News will moderate the debate in New York City. The last time a vice presidential debate drew more viewers than a presidential debate was in 2008 when then-Sen. Joe Biden faced off with then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Where are Trump, Harris, JD Vance and Tim Walz campaigning today? How are JD Vance, Tim Walz preparing for the vice presidential debate? Both Vance and Walz are deep in debate preparation when they’re off the campaign trail. Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., will stand in for Walz as part of Vance’s debate prep, while Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will play Vance’s role during Walz’s preparations. Independent and more moderate voters may decide the November election, meaning both candidates may try to paint their opponent as extreme. What are JD Vance's, Tim Walz's strategies going into the debate? The latest polling from Decision Desk HQ and The Hill suggests a close race, with Harris having a 3.6-point lead over Trump as of Tuesday. Harris has about a 2-point lead in key battleground states. Amid a neck and neck race, anything the vice presidential candidates say at the debate stands to make an impact. Vance will likely try to tie Harris closely to the Biden administration and convince voters they’re no better off since Biden and Harris entered the White House. He’s also likely to talk about the number of migrants entering the U.S. under the current administration. As for Walz, the governor will likely mention Vance's comments about 'childless cat ladies' and paint him as a threat to reproductive rights. Melania Trump to sit for interview on ‘Fox &amp; Friends’ Why the debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz matters This will be the last time candidates from either party will face off on a debate stage unless Trump agrees to an Oct. 23 CNN debate. The Democratic National Committee launched new billboards showing Trump dressed as a chicken and accusing him of being too scared to debate Harris, who accepted the debate invitation this week. 'I've done two,' Trump said. 'Had Biden and, after that, he had to drop out. He shouldn't have dropped out, to be honest. He got 14 million votes. She got none.' On Saturday, Trump said it was too late for another debate since early voting has already started in some states. However, Trump previously debated in October both against Biden in 2020 and Hillary Clinton in 2016.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/walz-vance-vice-presidential-debate-prep/	2024-09-24T05:13:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Vance-Walz_Matt-Freed-and-Julia-Nikhinson-AP.png?w=900
Florida dad turns in son after school shooting threat, police say	(NewsNation) — A 10-year-old Florida boy is in custody after his father turned in him for threatening to open fire at a school, police said. The investigation began Wednesday when officials at Wakulla High School were alerted to a social media threat after the school day ended, the Wakulla County Sherriff's Office said in a post on Facebook. A student told a school resource officer of a Snapchat conversation they had with another person who said, 'Yes I’m finna Shoot up your school It’s yalls last day.' The sheriff's office located south of Tallahassee enlisted the help of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's cybercrimes unit to identify the person who allegedly made the threat, and deputies interviewed the boy Thursday at his home in neighboring Leon County. After police obtained an arrest warrant, the boy's father turned him in, according to the sheriff's office. The agency told school officials Thursday morning there was no threat to Wakulla High School or any other school in the district. The 10-year-old faces a charge of making a written or electronic threat to kill, do bodily injury, or conduct a mass shooting or an act of terrorism. Is parent of teen driver in fatal crash responsible for the crime? Florida school shooting threat is latest this year The arrest in Florida comes less than a month after two students and two teachers died in a shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia, where students are returning to class Tuesday. Police say 14-year-old student Colt Gray slipped out of math class on the morning of Sept. 4 with an AR-15-style rifle given to him by his father. Within minutes, sounds of gunshots rippled across the hall and students crouched behind desks as teachers barricaded classroom doors. Within two days of the shooting, Gray was charged with four counts of murder, and his father with related charges. Officials say Gray shot and killed Christian Angulo and Mason Schermerhorn, both 14, and teachers Richard Aspinwall, the 39-year-old football coach, and Cristina Irimie, 53. Another teacher and eight other students were injured. Elsewhere in Florida, a string of hoax threats has prompted a sheriff to begin shaming the alleged juvenile suspects on social media. Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood said he’s tired of the hoaxes targeting students, disrupting schools and sapping law enforcement resources. In social media posts, Chitwood has warned parents that if their kids are arrested for making threats, he’ll make sure the public knows. Chitwood recently posted the full name and mug shot of an 11-year-old boy who allegedly threatened to carry out a school shooting. While many praised Chitwood online, the sheriff's tactics sparked criticism from some who say the weight of the responsibility should fall on the boy's parents. Under Florida law, juvenile court records are generally exempt from public release — but not if the child is charged with a felony, as in this case. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs may have stopped eating in jail: Former inmate Parents charged over children's actions The charges against Colt Gray's father resemble a case in Michigan where the parents of Ethan Crumbley were convicted of manslaughter after their son shot and killed classmates at Oxford High School in 2021. Prosecutors said during the separate trials of Jennifer and James Crumbley that the parents were grossly negligent when they failed to tell Oxford High School officials that the family had guns, including a 9 mm handgun that was used by their son at a shooting range just a few days earlier. Besides knowledge of the gun, the Crumbleys are accused of ignoring their son’s mental health needs. In a journal found by police in his backpack, the son wrote his parents wouldn’t listen to his pleas for help. In another case in Virginia, Deja Taylor, the mother of a 6-year-old boy who shot his first grade teacher at school, was sentenced to two years in prison after she pleaded guilty to one felony count of child neglect. In states like California and Illinois, strict 'safe storage' laws require firearms to be securely locked away, especially in homes with minors. Failure to do so can result in criminal charges if the weapon is accessed and used in an act of violence. Trial attorney Mercedes Colwin says parents are contemplating their own freedom when they weigh the decision on whether to speak up. 'They're afraid,' Colwin told NewsNation. 'They're afraid of the penalties. They're afraid of the criminal charges. They're afraid of the process.' Critics of these arrests and charges, meanwhile, argue that while parental responsibility is important, the root cause of gun violence — easy access to firearms — must be addressed. They’re calling for stricter gun control measures and federal legislation on safe storage.

World leaders meet under shadow of global divisions, 3 wars and p...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — World leaders will open their annual meeting at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday under the shadow of increasing global divisions, major wars in Gaza, Ukraine and, Sudan and the threat of an even larger conflict in the wider Middle East. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres previewed his opening 'State of the World' speech to presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and ministers at Sunday’s 'Summit of the Future,' saying 'our world is heading off the rails — and we need tough decisions to get back on track.' He pointed to conflicts 'raging and multiplying, from the Middle East to Ukraine and Sudan, with no end in sight' and to the global security system, which he said is 'threatened by geopolitical divides, nuclear posturing, and the development of new weapons and theaters of war.' He also cited huge inequalities, the lack of an effective global system to respond to emerging and even existential threats, and the devastating impact of climate change. Biden will appear as president for the final time One notable moment at Tuesday’s opening assembly meeting: U.S. President Joe Biden’s likely final major appearance on the world stage, a platform he has tred upon for decades. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters last week that the U.S. focus in the assembly will be on ending 'the scourge of war,' lamenting that roughly 2 billion people live in conflict-affected areas. 'The most vulnerable around the world are counting on us to make progress, to make change, to bring about a sense of hope for them,' she said. Among other speakers on opening day are Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Iran’s new President Masoud Pezeshkian. The Iranian leader accused Israel on Monday of seeking a wider war in the Middle East and laying 'traps' to lead his country into a broader conflict. He pointed to the deadly explosions of pagers, walkie-talkies and other electronic devices in Lebanon last week, which he blamed on Israel, and the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, hours after Pezeshkian’s inauguration. 'We don’t want to fight,' the Iranian president said. 'It’s Israel that wants to drag everyone into war and destabilize the region. … They are dragging us to a point where we do not wish to go.' Iran supports both Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants. Pushing the principle that ‘right makes might’ International Rescue Committee President David Miliband recalled that at the San Francisco conference in 1945 where the U.N. was established, then-U.S. President Harry Truman pleaded with delegates to reject the premise that 'might makes right' and reverse it to 'right makes might,' which was enshrined in the U.N. Charter. 'Almost 80 years later, we have seen the terrible consequences of the failure to flip this equation,' Miliband said. 'In contexts like Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, might is making right.' Facing mounting global humanitarian needs, unchecked conflict, unmitigated climate change and growing extreme poverty, Miliband challenged world leaders asking: 'How will you strengthen, not weaken, the principles of the U.N. Charter for the next 80 years?' The assembly’s annual meeting, which ends on Sept. 30, followed the two-day Summit of the Future, which adopted a blueprint aimed at bringing the world’s increasing divided nations together to tackle the challenges of the 21st century from conflicts and climate change to artificial intelligence and women's rights. The 42-page 'Pact for the Future' challenges leaders of the 193 U.N. member nations to turn promises into real actions that make a difference to the lives of the world’s more than 8 billion people. 'We are here to bring multilateralism back from the brink,' Guterres said. By adopting the pact, leaders unlocked the door, he said. 'Now it is our common destiny to walk through it. That demands not just agreement, but action.' Leaders embroiled in conflicts will speak At last year’s U.N. global gathering, Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, took center stage. But as the first anniversary of Hamas’ deadly attack in southern Israel approaches on Oct. 7, the spotlight is certain to be on the war in Gaza and escalating violence across the Israeli-Lebanon border, which is now threatening to spread to the wider Middle East. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is scheduled to speak Thursday morning and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday afternoon. Zelenskyy will get the spotlight twice. He will speak Tuesday afternoon at a high-level meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by the United States, France, Japan, Malta, South Korea and Britain, whose foreign ministers are expected to attend. He will also address the General Assembly on Wednesday morning. ___ Edith M. Lederer, chief U.N. correspondent for The Associated Press, has been covering global affairs for more than 50 years.

Tren de Aragua gang member arrested in El Paso	EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — A confirmed member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was arrested last week in El Paso, U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) Chief Jason Owens announced on his X social media account. Owens says USBP agents in El Paso arrested a confirmed member of the Venezuelan gang last Wednesday, Sept. 18. No details were offered about the arrest. Texas Gov. Abbott announces $5k reward for arrest of Tren de Aragua gang members USBP agents have apprehended a total of 70 members of this gang nationwide, Owens said in his Tweet. No time frame was given on those arrests.

Watch live: One of Titan submersible owner's top officials to tes...	One of the top officials with the company that owned the experimental submersible that imploded en route to the wreckage of the Titanic is scheduled to testify in front of the Coast Guard on Tuesday. Amber Bay, OceanGate's former director of administration, is one of the key witnesses Tuesday. OceanGate co-founder Stockton Rush was among the five people who died when the submersible imploded in June 2023. The Coast Guard opened a public hearing earlier this month that is part of a high level investigation into the cause of the implosion. Some of the testimony has focused on the troubled nature of the company. The co-founder of the company told the Coast Guard panel Monday that he hoped a silver lining of the disaster is that it will inspire a renewed interest in exploration, including the deepest waters of the world’s oceans. Businessman Guillermo Sohnlein, who helped found OceanGate with Rush, ultimately left the company before the Titan disaster. 'This can’t be the end of deep ocean exploration. This can’t be the end of deep-diving submersibles and I don’t believe that it will be,' said Sohnlein. Earlier in the hearing, former OceanGate operations director David Lochridge said he frequently clashed with Rush and felt the company was committed only to making money. 'The whole idea behind the company was to make money,' Lochridge testified. 'There was very little in the way of science.' Sohnlein said Monday he had the opportunity to dive in Titan 'many times' and he declined. He said his reasons included not wanting to take space away from potential customers. He also said when Rush reached a point when it was 'time to put a human in there,' he wanted to do it himself. Rush felt it was his design and said 'if anything happens, I want it to impact me,' Sohnlein said. But Lochridge and other previous witnesses painted a picture of a troubled company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident set off a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration. The hearing is expected to run through Friday and include several more witnesses, some of whom were closely connected to the company. Coast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice. That and Titan’s unusual design subjected it to scrutiny in the undersea exploration community. OceanGate, based in Washington state, suspended its operations after the implosion. The company has no full-time employees currently, but has been represented by an attorney during the hearing. During the submersible’s final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts about Titan’s depth and weight as it descended. The support ship Polar Prince then sent repeated messages asking if Titan could still see the ship on its onboard display. One of the last messages from Titan’s crew to Polar Prince before the submersible imploded stated, 'all good here,' according to a visual re-creation presented earlier in the hearing. When the submersible was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said. No one on board survived. OceanGate said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began. Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/missing-titanic-tourist-submarine/ap-one-of-titan-submersible-owners-top-officials-to-testify-before-the-coast-guard/	2024-09-23T21:05:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f23bf9d4b941.13730100.jpeg?w=900

Diddy may have stopped eating in jail: Former inmate	(NewsNation) — Former inmate Larry Levine tells 'Banfield' that a source close to the Sean 'Diddy' Combs investigation believes the entertainment mogul may not be eating in jail because he is 'paranoid' and 'scared.' 'There's people out there that he has things on that do have a substantial amount of money. Imagine if someone paid someone off on the inside to actually poison his food, give him a heart attack and he dies, and no one would really think anything of it,' Levine said. 'So that may be one of the reasons he's not eating.' Other possibilities include a hunger strike or just bad food, according to Levine. He said the food at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center includes 'a lot of carbohydrates' and is incredibly bland. Who is Kristina Khorram, Diddy’s former chief of staff? 'There's mold in a lot of that food, the food coming to him is cold. It's not coming to him warm like it would be in a regular housing unit, because they feed the people in the shoe last,' Levine added. 'Maybe he got sick from the food. That's another possibility.' Levine said Diddy has been in touch with his kids, a dietitian, a lawyer and a minister during his first week of pretrial detention. Diddy's allegations, arrest Diddy is accused of using his music empire to engage in sex trafficking and accused of having a pattern of abusing women. He was arrested Sept. 16 after months of allegations and a federal raid on two of his properties. He pleaded not guilty in New York court the next day. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits: timeline Both his bids to bail out of jail have been rejected, leaving him in MDC Brooklyn for the foreseeable future. Diddy at MDC Brooklyn There are 1,218 people at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is located in the Eastern New York Judicial District, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Like the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the MDC is also 'plagued by chronic understaffing, constant lockdowns, outbreaks of violence, delayed access to medical care, and a rash of suicides and death,' The Daily Beast reported. 'Several courts in this District have recognized that the conditions at Metropolitan Detention Center are not fit for pre-trial detention,' Combs’ lawyers said in a motion they filed for bail Tuesday, per the news outlet. ‘People knew what goes on’ in Diddy’s after-after party: Friend Mentioned by Combs’ attorneys in their filing was a June 7 incident; Uriel Whyte, a man who had been at MDC for gun charges, was stabbed to death in the facility. Spectrum News New York reported that Whyte was awaiting trial on gun charges for two years. A second man named Edwin Cordero died after being injured in a jail fight in August. Cordero’s lawyer, The New York Times reported, wrote about the 'awful' conditions his client faced in a June letter to a federal judge. The detention center, Cordero’s lawyer said, is 'an overcrowded, understaffed and neglected federal jail that is hell on earth.' Along with the deaths this past summer, suicides and an electrical fire in 2019 that caused those in the facility to be without heat and power for days have been reported at MDC. Judges and advocates have called out the Bureau of Prisons for 'dangerous, barbaric conditions' in MDC, and pressed the agency to make improvements. What we know about the Diddy investigation In a statement to the Associated Press, the federal Bureau of Prisons said it is 'addressing the staffing and other challenges at MDC Brooklyn.'

Tren de Aragua is in cities like Chicago, but to what extent?	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — A notorious Venezuelan prison gang that has infiltrated the United States has been in Chicago for nearly a year, putting local law enforcement agencies on high alert. Tren de Aragua developed out of a Venezuelan prison and into a dangerous transnational criminal organization that focuses on sex trafficking, drugs and human smuggling. With more than 5,000 members, the gang is Venezuela's largest criminal organization that has been linked to several high-profile crimes in various parts of the U.S. The gang's presence in sanctuary cities like Chicago, Denver and New York raises concern; however, the level of their activity remains in question. What is the Tren de Aragua gang, linked to several crimes in US? Emails obtained by NewsNation from intelligence officials within the Cook County Sheriff’s Office show warnings to Chicago area law enforcement agencies about the gang’s presence as early as October of last year. The gang is described as a 'new threat developing amongst the newly arriving immigrant community,' describing Tren de Aragua as an organization that has strong human trafficking operations in Latin America and is likely engaged in sex and labor trafficking in the U.S. In one email, two officials from the sheriff’s office acknowledge discussions about the possibility that a criminal network would be operating within the migrant community and likely would 'victimize members of that population.' 'It appears we have confirmation of that now,' the email states. Tren de Aragua in sanctuary cities Along with Chicago, law enforcement in New York City and Denver have also confirmed the gang's presence. All three cities were the final destinations for buses sent by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott from the southern border filled with migrants. Robert Almonte, a former U.S. Marshal and deputy chief with the El Paso Police Department, told NewsNation that Tren de Aragua has had a U.S. presence for the past two years. Gang members have been tied to the shooting of two New York City police officers and other violent acts. Almonte said that the group's activity in sanctuary cities could be even more problematic. While many cross the border in search of a new life or to seek asylum., the Venezuelan gang travel to the cities because they already have associates to continue their criminal enterprise, Almonte said. Tren de Aragua poses ‘serious’ threat: VP of National Border Patrol Council 'If we don't get a handle on them, they're going to become a bigger problem than they are today,' Almonte said. Getting a handle on the issue, however, also presents its challenges. Gang members often have identifying tattoos such as the Nike 'Jumpman' logo and other designs specific to Tren de Aruagua, Chicago area law enforcement emails show. But at the border, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials often have difficulty separating gang members from others crossing into the U.S. because of trouble vetting those crossing the border coming from Venezuela, Almonte said Tren de Aragua's reported clash with Chicago gangs Tren de Aragua members have been linked to violent crimes, including murder, but the scope of the gang’s presence in places like Chicago has not been verified. The New York Post reported Sunday that members of the Tren de Aragua had not only moved into Chicago’s South Side but were clashing with local gang members. The report was based on interviews with former gang member Tyrone Muhammad, who spent 20 years in prison and who now runs a street patrol and violence protection program. Muhammad claims that Venezuelan gang members who arrived in the U.S. and flooded Chicago’s migrant shelters are now overtaking local apartment buildings. Chicago police investigate the scene of a shooting in Chicago. Five alleged gang members have been indicted on murder charges in last year's shooting death of Chicago rapper Carlton Weekly, also known as 'FBG Duck,' in the fashionable Gold Coast neighborhood, which prosecutors say was part of an ongoing violent effort to protect gang territories on the city's South Side. (Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune via AP, File) While Chicago law enforcement officials have confirmed that the Tren de Aragua is present in the city, it has not addressed claims made by Muhammad in the New York Post report. 'When the Black gangs here get fed up with the illegalities and criminal activities of these migrants or non-citizens, the city of Chicago is going to go up in flames and there will be nothing the National Guard or the government can do about it when the bloodshed hits the streets,' Muhammad told the newspaper. 'It’ll be blacks against migrants.' Muhammad did not respond to an interview request from NewsNation on Monday. Police investigate claims regarding Tren de Aragua In early September, a 911 call was placed claiming that 32 Venezuelan migrants had taken over an apartment complex in Chicago. The report made its way to social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and went viral after being shared by Elon Musk and others. Chicago Police Department officials investigated the claims and found no such incident took place. The alderperson for the area, Jeanette Taylor, also denied anything had happened, blaming the rumors on political motivations. 'It’s better for them to make it seem like Black and brown people fight amongst each other than for them to deal with the real issue and create real policies that make everybody safe,' Taylor said, according to the Chicago Tribune. In the suburban Denver community of Aurora, claims of Venezuelan migrants taking over an apartment building with semiautomatic long guns also went viral on social media. Police in Aurora could not confirm gang activity but said in a statement that 'they are aware that components of TdA are operating in Aurora.' The department said that it has increasingly been collecting evidence to show the gang is connected to crimes in the area. However, it said that it would be improper to make 'conclusory statements' about certain incidents. Chicago gang expert: Tren de Aragua takeover unlikely Lance Williams, a professor of educational inquiry and curriculum studies at Northeastern Illinois University and an expert on Chicago gangs, said that despite social media posts and claims to police of trouble caused by Venezuelans, his conversations with gang members in South Side neighborhoods suggest otherwise. 'I haven’t seen any substantial evidence that there was some Venezuelan gang presence in any of the hotspot neighborhoods in Chicago,' Williams told NewsNation. He added: 'I’m not saying there are no Venezuelan gangs here … but I see absolutely no gang activity and no presence of Venezuelans in the hood trying to take over anything or any conflict between African American neighborhoods and Venezuelan gangs.' 10 more dead amid reported Sinaloa Cartel infighting in Mexico Williams, whose father was a member of one of Chicago’s first Black street gangs, cites the clickbait nature of stories like what took place in Aurora, Colorado, as a driver of misinformation when it comes to Tren de Aragua’s activity in Chicago. Williams also said that individuals with political interests are often the source of information tied to the Venezuelan street gangs. Williams said that Chicago’s gang activity has shifted dramatically over the past 30 years. He said rather than large criminal organizations with hierarchal systems of leadership, the gangs that are present in neighborhoods are heavily fragmented. While conflicts may exist on a much smaller level, disputes between gangs are much different than in the past and typically don’t cross racial lines, Williams added. '(Gang) members don’t know the difference between a Venezuelan and a Mexican,' Williams said. 'So just the idea of them having conflict with Venezuelans doesn’t make sense because they don’t understand the difference between the two.' Risks of ignoring Tren de Aragua: Law enforcement expert Almonte said cities run a significant risk if they ignore the presence of Tren de Aragua. In working with local police departments, Almonte said that law enforcement should focus on neighborhoods where migrants from Venezuela are currently living. In many cases, the gang members are targeting their countrymen by extorting them and luring them into criminal activities. Almonte said if police officers are encountering members of the gang, city leaders should identify the scope of their presence and 'go after them.' 'To have a mayor or some other city official come out and deny that they're there, all they're doing is hurting their own people,' Almonte said. 'That doesn't serve any purpose. I think the reason they do that is they don't want to give their city a bad image, like 'Oh, my God, we're getting taken over by a gang.''	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/venezuelan-gang-tren-de-aragua-chicago/	2024-09-23T16:41:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/HSI-TURNS-OVER-TREN-DE-ARAGUA-MEMBER-TO-DENVER-SHERIFFS-DEPARTMENT-7-31-2024.jpg?w=900
Two more drugged children intercepted in smuggling attempt	(NewsNation) — U.S. Border Patrol agents intercepted two suspected drugged children being smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border, the second such incident in the El Centro Sector in California within days, sources within the agency exclusively confirmed to NewsNation. The incident occurred when a U.S. citizen with an extensive criminal history attempted to smuggle two Mexican children, ages 4 and 8, through the San Luis port of entry in Arizona on foot. The woman possessed Navajo birth certificates that did not belong to the children, sources said. Agents stopped the vehicle carrying the children at a Border Patrol checkpoint on Highway 86 in El Indio around 8:45 p.m. Wednesday. The children appeared drowsy, and a bottle of liquid melatonin was found next to them in the vehicle. One child is now acting as a material witness against the driver, while the other was turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. Police Cybertruck sparks excitement, scrutiny in Southern California The U.S. Attorney's Office has accepted the case for prosecution. Former Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Victor Avila told NewsNation that 'this is an SOP [standard operating procedure] of the child traffickers.' He explained that this method is used to maintain better control over the children. This incident follows a similar case in the El Centro sector just days earlier, where agents reported encountering a child who required a sternum rub to become coherent. However, no sleep aids were found in that instance. According to federal fact sheets, traffickers often target unaccompanied minors and vulnerable families, knowing that the children have no way to protect themselves. Authorities believe this tactic of sedating children is a way of making sure the children are seen but not heard by border authorities. Multiple reports of these druggings have come to light in recent weeks. Rare ‘liger’ rescued from abandoned home near US border In Arizona, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at the San Luis port of entry intercepted a woman attempting to smuggle two children across the border on Aug. 29. The children, aged 8 and 11, had also been sedated. The woman, an American citizen, presented birth certificates that didn’t belong to the children. The suspect was arrested and the children were turned over to authorities. And in Laredo, Texas, a 23-year-old woman has pleaded guilty to smuggling a toddler across the border, sedating her with melatonin gummies and using a fraudulent birth certificate just days ago. That suspect was part of a child smuggling operation that targeted young children under 5 years old. Members of the smuggling ring pretended to be related to the children when crossing the border, a common tactic. Weapons found on Mexico side of border: Border Patrol alert A recent House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs report said that as many as three in 10 children had no familial relationship whatsoever to the adults that claimed them. During the Trump administration, DNA testing was used to verify familial relationships at the border in an effort to crack down on smugglers posing as family members. While the DNA testing program ended during the Biden administration, some tests are still being conducted for specific age groups of migrants during their appointments with CBP One.

US troops deployed to Middle East after Israeli strike on Lebanon	(NewsNation) — More than 270 people were killed in Lebanon after Israeli airstrikes on Monday, making it the deadliest day for the country since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. A small number of U.S. troops have now been deployed to the Middle East in response to the violence, which has raised people's fears of a greater regional war. The United States already has an aircraft carrier in the region, but at this time, officials have no plan to send another one. Officials from the Biden administration as well as lawmakers have been worried for weeks now about the situation in the area escalating. Officials wanted Ohio train derailment to ‘go away,’ expert tells NewsNation Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad told a news conference in Beirut Monday that the Israeli military's attacks hit hospitals, medical centers and ambulances. Government officials ordered schools and universities to close across most of Lebanon and began preparing shelters for people displaced from the south. In a recorded message Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Lebanese civilians to heed calls to evacuate, saying that once the operation is finished, they could come back to their homes. 'I have a message for the people of Lebanon,' he said. 'Israel's war is not with you, it's with Hezbollah.' However, Lebanon's information minister, Ziad Makary, said in a statement his office had received one of these messages, telling people to leave the building. These warnings come 'in the framework of the psychological war implemented by the enemy,' Makary said, telling people 'not to give the matter more attention than it deserves.' Israeli military officials, claiming they are going after Hezbollah weapons sites, announced the strikes hit 800 targets. Some of these strikes, according to the Associated Press, struck residential areas of towns in the south and the eastern Bekaa Valley. One hit a wooded area as far away as Byblos in central Lebanon, more than 80 miles from the border north of Beirut. On Sunday, Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes last week that killed a top commander and fighters, as well as dozens of civilians including women and children. It is not clear whether there have been any deaths or injuries resulting from this attack. Last week, thousands of communications devices such as pagers exploded in different parts of Lebanon as part of an attack widely believed to be carried out by Israel. These device explosions killed 39 people and wounded nearly 3,000.

Trump to speak on China buying US farmland, food supply concerns	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump is visiting western Pennsylvania on Monday to speak at an event held by the Protecting America Initiative, a nonprofit spotlighting the potential risk posed by the Chinese Communist Party to the U.S. agriculture system. If he wins in November, Trump has vowed to ban Chinese nationals from buying U.S. farmland. China being part of a marijuana foreign black market in Oklahoma and amassing farmland have been concerns for Americans this year. The latest U.S. governmental data from 2021 showed that China owns less than 1% of foreign-owned land, while Canada owns the most at over 30%. Boy abducted from California in 1951 at age 6 found alive on East Coast more than 70 years later However, China has purchased more land within the last three years. Should the Chinese Communist Party gain control over essential parts of the food supply chain, it could lead to future disruptions or manipulation of the supply of critical food resources, critics argue. Last June, the Treasury Department announced proposed new rules that would give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, the ability to block Chinese corporations from owning land near U.S. military bases. Chinese billionaire Chen Tianqiao ranked 82nd in a list of U.S. top landowners in a report released in January after purchasing 200,000 acres of timberlands in Oregon in 2015.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-china-farmland-food-concerns/	2024-09-23T09:25:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2173588596.jpg?w=900
Officials wanted Ohio train derailment to 'go away,' expert tells...	(NewsNation) — A preeminent expert on chemical exposure hired to review the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio told NewsNation in an exclusive interview that the parties involved now want the situation to go away. Days after officials in East Palestine, Ohio, burned five tankers and sent 116,000 gallons of toxic vinyl chloride over the city, the law firm Simmons Conroy hired Stephen Petty to conduct testing. Petty says the parties involved now want the situation to go away. His affidavit filed Monday is one of several statements the Government Accountability Project is issuing to the EPA Office of the Inspector General. Trump assassination suspect admitted to plot in letter: Court filing Petty is currently bound by confidentiality but said he would speak publicly about his findings if a judge called on him to testify. Until then, Petty said he must be careful about what he says while a $600 million class-action settlement is pending. 'Enough information suggests that we really ought to try to figure this out and see if everything's OK or not, and I don't think we've done that yet,' Petty said. NewsNation has been covering the East Palestine train derailment and the aftermath extensively. Find more of our coverage here. Attorneys for East Palestine residents filed a motion in August asking a federal judge to reevaluate the $600 million train derailment settlement. Their complaint focused on allegations that settlement lawyers are hiding Petty’s findings about locals’ soil and water. They argue the ruling was rushed and lawyers are in collusion with Norfolk Southern, the company whose train derailed. East Palestine train derailment In February 2023, a Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. Some 1,500 residents were told to evacuate. Fearing an explosion, officials decided to vent and burn five tank cars, releasing the carcinogen vinyl chloride into the air. Minutes later, a toxic plume of smoke smothered the region. Three days later, the Environmental Protection Agency said it hadn't detected contaminants at 'levels of concern' and gave the all-clear for residents to return. Those who did reported developing rashes and feeling ill. In March 2023, an independent testing expert confirmed residents’ fears that carcinogens undetected by the Ohio EPA were in the water. More tests revealed dioxins — the most toxic compounds on the planet — in the soil, water and people’s air filters. Today, those who remain in East Palestine and the surrounding area say their problems are getting worse. Why is Stephen Petty speaking up about East Palestine now? 'My job initially was to figure out: Was there contamination of the environment, and if so, to what extent?' Petty said. Residents have complained of rashes, respiratory issues and other ailments since the February 2023 Norfolk Southern train derailment. Eighteen months later, none of Petty’s data or analysis has been publicly available to East Palestine’s residents. He’s bound to confidentiality, but is choosing to speak out now, Petty said. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. 'I suspect there'll be some people that are unhappy because it could have an impact on a settlement where the plaintiffs have spent a lot of money,' he said. In his affidavit, Petty spoke in support of Scott Smith — another scientist who has been testing in East Palestine. Smith has found elevated levels of dioxins and sounded the alarm for residents. The EPA has tried to label Smith as a fake scientist and so has the settlement attorneys' team. Scott Smith tested soil and water dioxins two weeks after tanker cars tipped over and chemicals in the damaged railcars were deliberately burned for safety reasons in East Palestine, Ohio. Photo courtesy: Scott Smith 'I wanted to support Mr. Smith because I think he's being smeared and I don't think it's appropriate,' Petty said, adding that he believes the data Smith has reported so far is accurate. A decade earlier, Mark Durno, the EPA coordinator in East Palestine, had only praise for Smith’s work in Flint, Michigan. 'He certainly understands environmental sampling,' Durno said at the time. 'He certainly understands how to use appropriate laboratories… from that perspective he seems qualified to collect samples and share data.' The scrutiny Smith faces now is unfair Petty said. 'It is one of the few times where I've been involved, where I don't think that the information that should get out there is getting out there,' he said. Invasive stink bugs are back: What to do about them A video of a local toxicologist that plaintiff attorneys brought in to make their case for settlement also compelled Petty to speak. 'There will not be any long-term health impact of chemical exposure from the derailment to community members of East Palestine,' the toxicologist, Dr. Arch Carson, said. Petty interpreted the comments as a 'PR sort of event' and said it’s too early to declare there won’t be long-term health impacts. 'What troubled me was that if he's going to make those statements, then bring the receipts on the exposure analysis and show me the exposure analysis that says we have no issues,' Petty said. He believes Carson was bought in to encourage a settlement. Petty also criticized the EPA for its handling of the derailment and the aftermath. That includes a decision to allow residents to return three days later. 'They're not being transparent in what they know because they're not providing the raw data from the lab to my knowledge,' Petty said. 'And they're taking that raw data and summarizing it in a way that's misleading.' What does Petty want to happen? Petty also said something major has been overlooked. The day of the burn, the wind shifted from the northwest, and the East Palestine evacuation zone to the southeast should have been redefined based on those winds, he said. It never was. Petty also accused the EPA of testing for dioxins in the wrong places. 'Of course, they impugned me for a while, saying that I didn't know what I was doing in February,' Petty said. 'And I said, ‘Well, we have to look.’' He declined to say why he believes the EPA would might knowingly conduct testing in the wrong area, citing a confidentiality order. 'I’ve had many conversations about this…that's why I produce some very specific data just for this thing,' Petty said. 'I will just say that it's either incompetence or it's intentional.' Sunken superyacht has sensitive intelligence info aboard: Reports Petty's work was — in part — based on materials under a protective order. That means attorneys disclose certain information without violating the order. However, Petty said he would break that agreement if the judge asked him to testify. His research would add to what the public already knows 'and people can make their own decisions,' Petty said. 'If you're asking at full transparency, should it be out there along with all the other information that's out there — all the railroad stuff, all the whistleblower stuff, etc.? Yeah,' Petty said. 'Then you put it all in the pot and let people figure out what they what they think.' Neither the EPA nor the plaintiff’s attorneys have responded to NewsNation’s requests for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/ohio-train-derailment/east-palestine-exposure-experts-concerns/	2024-09-23T09:00:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/01/65bad11cc2a844.21820508.jpeg?w=900
Inside a DEA drug vault that stores seized fentanyl pills	(NEXSTAR) -- The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) plays an essential role in the fight against fentanyl. When agents seize drugs, the evidence gets sent to a DEA lab for testing. The agency reports more than 70% of illicit drugs seized are laced with fentanyl. All drugs seized by federal agencies from five states are sent to a DEA lab in Dallas, Texas to be tested. 'Our vault processes it and stores it until it's time for our forensic chemist to analyze it. And our forensic chemists determine the content of the evidence, as well as sometimes the purity of it,' DEA Laboratory Assistant Director Jamie Vasquez said. Permanent truck ban at El Paso port of entry proposed Vasquez said the number one drug that they see is methamphetamine, followed by cocaine, fentanyl and heroin. 'It has changed drastically over the last five years. We've gone from submissions of 3% fentanyl to now close to 20% of what we see contains some sort of fentanyl,' Vasquez said. The DEA acts as the first line of defense against drugs coming across the border. 'The key number is 70%. You have to know that 70% of these pills right now could kill, it could be an overdose,' Special DEA Agent Daniel Comeaux said. 'It's all about money. It’s about the dollar bill. It’s about greed. And that's who we are going after.' Comeaux, who is with the DEA’s Houston Division, said drug cartels are mass producing synthetic fentanyl with deadly precision. 'So, you might have even someone as young as a middle schooler saying, well I heard about the Xanax. So let me take the Xanax one time just to get a high effect. And they take one of these fake pills, and they end up dead. 70% of these pills contain a lethal dose,' Comeaux said. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Ryan Routh, suspect in Trump assassination attempt, due in court	(NewsNation) — Prosecutors on Monday will argue to keep the man charged in an apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump behind bars while he awaits trial. Ryan Routh, 58, will appear in federal court on a pair of gun charges. Investigators say he pointed a rifle through a tree line Sept. 15 at Trump’s West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course while the former president and GOP presidential nominee was playing. It’s the second apparent assassination attempt against Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign season. Trump given handcuffs used on alleged would-be assassin: Sheriff What is Ryan Routh charged with? Routh is charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. A conviction of each charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He has not yet entered a plea. U.S. prosecutors may reveal new details about the investigation at Monday’s hearing, where they’re expected to argue that Routh poses a danger to public safety and must remain in jail. What is Ryan Routh accused of? Unlike the gunman behind the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, Routh isn’t accused of firing a weapon. He was about 400-500 yards away from the former president, crouched in bushes near the golf club perimeter and armed with a weapon that had a scope, according to investigators. Trump was not within his line of sight. Boy abducted from California in 1951 at age 6 found alive on East Coast more than 70 years later The situation began about 1:30 p.m. local time when authorities received a call reporting shots fired at the golf course where Trump was playing. Those shots came from a U.S. Secret Service agent who spotted a rifle sticking through the fence. A witness told police the suspect fled the scene in a black Nissan, which police located and stopped about 45 miles north of the golf course. Martin County Sheriff William D. Snyder told WPTV the man 'was not armed when we took him out of the car.'

Israel warns civilians to evacuate as it strikes wide swaths of s...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel on Monday urged residents of southern Lebanon to evacuate from homes and other buildings where it claimed Hezbollah has stored weapons, saying the military would conduct 'extensive strikes' against the militant group. It was the first warning of its kind in nearly a year of steadily escalating conflict and came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire on Sunday. Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters. There was no sign of an immediate exodus from the villages of southern Lebanon, and the warning left open the possibility that some residents could live in or near targeted structures without knowing that they are risk. The increasing strikes and counterstrikes have raised fears of an all-out war, even as Israel is still battling Hamas in Gaza and trying to return scores of hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Hezbollah has vowed to continue its strikes in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel says it is committed to returning calm to its northern border. Associated Press journalists in southern Lebanon reported heavy airstrikes targeting many areas Monday morning, including some far from the border. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said the strikes hit a forested area in the central province of Byblos, about 130 kilometers (81 miles) north of the Israeli-Lebanese border, for the first time since the exchanges began in October. No injuries were reported there. Israel also bombed targets in the northeastern Baalbek and Hermel regions, where a shepherd was killed and two family members were wounded, according to the news agency. It said a total of 30 people were wounded in strikes. The Lebanese Health Ministry asked hospitals in southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa valley to postpone surgeries that could be done later. The ministry said in a statement that its request aimed to keep hospitals ready to deal with people wounded by 'Israel’s expanding aggression on Lebanon.' An Israeli military official said Israel is focused on aerial operations and has no immediate plans for a ground operation. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with regulations, said the strikes are aimed at curbing Hezbollah's ability to launch more strikes into Israel. Lebanese media reported that residents received text messages urging them to move away from any building where Hezbollah stores arms until further notice. 'If you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice,' the Arabic message reads, according to Lebanese media. Lebanon's information minister, Ziad Makary, said in a statement that his office in Beirut had received a recorded message telling people to leave the building. 'This comes in the framework of the psychological war implemented by the enemy,' Makary said, and urged people 'not to give the matter more attention than it deserves.' It was not immediately clear how many people would be affected by the Israeli orders. Communities on both sides of the border have largely emptied out because of the near-daily exchanges of fire. Israel has accused Hezbollah of transforming entire communities in the south into militant bases, with hidden rocket launchers and other infrastructure. That could lead the Israeli military to wage an especially heavy bombing campaign, even if no ground forces move in. The military said it had targeted more than 150 militant sites early Monday. Residents of different villages in southern Lebanon posted photos on social media of airstrikes and large plumes of smoke. The state-run National News Agency also reported airstrikes on different areas. An Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday killed a top Hezbollah military commander and more than a dozen fighters, as well as dozens of civilians, including women and children. Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000. Lebanon blamed Israel for the attacks, but Israel did not confirm or deny any responsibility. Hezbollah began firing into Israel a day after the Oct. 7 attack in what it said was an attempt to pin down Israeli forces to help Palestinian fighters in Gaza. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict has steadily intensified over the past year. The fighting has killed hundreds of people in Lebanon, dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. It has also sparked brush fires that have destroyed agriculture and scarred the landscape. Israel has vowed to push Hezbollah back from the border so its citizens can return to their homes, saying it prefers to do so diplomatically but is willing to use force. Hezbollah has said it will keep up its attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but that appears increasingly elusive as the war nears its anniversary. Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after most of the rest were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. Israel's offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. It says women and children make up a little over half of those killed. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut.

People knew what goes on' in Diddy's after-after party: Friend	(NewsNation) — A radio personality and former associate of Sean 'Diddy' Combs said that people in the music industry were generally aware of what happened at the more exclusive 'after after' parties that the hip-hop mogul was known for hosting. DJ Steph Lova of Baltimore's Magic 95.9, who attended Howard University with Combs and worked at a New York radio station during his rise to prominence, said she was unaware of the alleged 'freakoffs' or illegal activities. 'The freakoffs ... that's all new to me,' Lova said Sunday on 'NewsNation Prime.' She added that while Combs was known for throwing parties, 'All the stuff that happened after the actual party, those were private invites.' 'You had to be kind of with the sugar, honey, iced tea ... people knew what goes on at the after-after party. It's just a matter if you know you want to get down like that. This is the music business ... it's not for the weak,' Lova said. Kathryn Crosby, actor and widow of Bing Crosby, dies at 90 Combs was arrested last week in Manhattan on federal charges including racketeering, sex trafficking and prostitution. These charges come amid several civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual abuse and other misconduct. And the charges follow raids on his properties where authorities reportedly found evidence of drug-fueled sex parties and weapons. Lova said she was shocked at the music mogul's arrest, calling the situation 'unbelievable' given his rise to fame and philanthropic efforts. Regarding the music industry's muted response to the allegations, Lova suggested that many might be concerned about potential evidence. 'A lot of them might be on them tapes,' she said, referring to reported recordings seized by authorities. Lova speculated that recent departures of music industry executives might be connected to fears of being implicated. 'People should be nervous. They should be very cautious,' she added. YouTube ads will now play even when your video is paused Dawn Richard has faced backlash after suing Diddy: Attorney The attorney for a woman suing Combs says recent federal charges against the music mogul have been 'validating' for his client. Arick Fudali, representing singer Dawn Richard in a civil lawsuit against Combs, told NewsNation that the similarities between his client's allegations and the federal indictment are 'striking.' 'Seeing that has been very encouraging and validating for our client,' Fudali said Sunday on 'NewsNation Prime.' Richard was a member of Diddy’s Danity Kane and Dirty Money groups. TV setting makes movies look bad: How to turn it off Richard's lawsuit, filed days before Combs' arrest, accuses the rapper of sexual battery, sexual harassment and false imprisonment. Fudali emphasized that his client's primary goal is 'accountability and justice,' not financial gain. 'We specifically and intentionally did not put a dollar amount in our civil complaint,' Fudali stated. 'For her, it's really about justice, it's really about accountability, and it's really about also inspiring and empowering others.' Fudali said Richard was inspired to come forward after Cassie Ventura, Combs' former girlfriend, filed her own lawsuit. That suit was settled one day after filing. Combs has denied all allegations against him. His defense attorney has characterized some of the alleged threats as a 'lover's spat,' a description Fudali strongly disputes. Fudali said that Richard 'has faced some online backlash' for coming forward with her lawsuit against Combs.

(NewsNation) — A U.S. Border Patrol chief is calling the discovery of a child dosed with sleep aids by a human trafficker in El Centro, California, 'criminal actions so horrendous they defy human decency.' The traffickers allegedly drugged the child to prevent them talking to agents at the border, just one instance of the dangerous tactics being used to exploit children at the U.S.-Mexico border. Sometimes we encounter criminal actions so horrendous they defy human decency.The #PremierSector rescued this child from a trafficker who heavily dosed him w/ sleep aids to prevent him from talking to agents. Scarier still is the trafficker had birth certificates for more kids. pic.twitter.com/coQHTYBEiB&mdash; USBP Chief Patrol Agent Gregory K. Bovino (@USBPChiefELC) September 20, 2024 According to federal fact sheets, traffickers often target unaccompanied minors and vulnerable families, knowing that the children have no way to protect themselves. And authorities believe this tactic of sedating children is a way of making sure the children are seen, but not heard, by border authorities. Rival Sinaloa cartel factions fighting after US arrests leaders Multiple reports of these druggings have come to light in recent weeks. In Arizona, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at the San Luis Port of Entry intercepted a woman attempting to smuggle two children across the border on Aug. 29. The children, aged 8 and 11, had also been sedated. The woman, an American citizen, presented birth certificates that didn’t belong to the children. The suspect was arrested and the children were turned over to authorities. And in Laredo, Texas, a 23-year-old woman has pleaded guilty to smuggling a toddler across the border, sedating her with melatonin gummies and using a fraudulent birth certificate just days ago. That suspect was part of a child smuggling operation that targeted young children under 5 years old. Members of the smuggling ring pretended to be related to the children when crossing the border, a common tactic. Denver, Chicago change migrant plans citing fewer border encounters A recent House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs report said that as many as three in 10 children had no familial relationship whatsoever to the adults that claimed them. During the Trump administration, DNA testing was used to verify familial relationships at the border, in an effort to crack down on smugglers posing as family members. While the DNA testing program ended during the Biden administration, some tests are still being conducted for specific age groups of migrants during their appointments with CBP One.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/human-traffickers-drug-kids-border/	2024-09-22T17:10:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/calexico-border-barrier.png?w=617
Key staffers exit Mark Robinson campaign for NC governor in wake ...	RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN/AP) -- Just days after a CNN report outlining evidence that North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson made disturbing posts on a pornography website's message board more than a decade ago, several key people in the Republican's campaign for governor stepped down, his campaign announced Sunday afternoon. Conrad Pogorzelski III, general consultant and senior advisor; Chris Rodriguez, campaign manager; Heather Whillier, finance director; and Jason Rizk, deputy campaign manager have stepped down from their roles with the campaign, a news release said just after 5 p.m. In his first public appearance since Thursday's CNN report, Robinson spent several minutes Saturday evening speaking and leading a prayer at the Fayetteville Motor Speedway. He didn’t mention the CNN report or answer questions from reporters on hand. NC Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson speaks to supporters in Fayetteville amid major controversy The Sunday campaign announcement did not elaborate on the departure of the senior staffers only saying they 'stepped down.' In Sunday's announcement, the campaign said new staffing would be released 'soon.' Robinson also included comments in the news release Sunday. 'I appreciate the efforts of these team members who have made the difficult choice to step away from the campaign, and I wish them well in their future endeavors. I look forward to announcing new staff roles in the coming days,' the news release said. On Saturday night, Robinson spoke to an apparently supportive crowd at the speedway just south of Fayetteville in Cumberland County. 'We’re going to focus on the issues that you are concerned with,' Robinson said. 'While everybody else wants to focus on the garbage, and the trash that tries to besmirch people, we’re out here telling people about what we want to do, how we want to partner with you to make this state better and help North Carolina be better.' Robinson earlier denied writing the posts, which include lewd and racist comments, saying Thursday that he wouldn’t be forced out of the race by 'salacious tabloid lies.' He directed his focus to other issues on Saturday. 'We’re going to work our butts off to make sure that we build an economy in this state that works for everybody,' Robinson said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/key-staffers-exit-mark-robinson-campaign-for-nc-governor-in-wake-of-report-about-online-posts/	2024-09-22T14:59:53-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/MARK-ROBINSON-IN-HUNTERSVILLE.jpg?w=900
Johnson rolls out plan B to avert government shutdown	House GOP leaders on Sunday unveiled a plan to keep the government funded for three months after Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-La.) opening gambit to avoid a shutdown failed due to opposition from Republicans. The continuing resolution (CR), which was the result of bipartisan negotiations in the House and Senate, would keep the government funded at current levels through Dec. 20 — setting up a holiday funding fight. The three-month time frame is shorter than Johnson's opening offer of a six-month stopgap, and the bill notably excludes a Trump-backed measure requiring proof of citizenship to vote. Republican leaders are aiming to bring the bill up under a regular rule process, with a floor vote on the legislation by Wednesday, according to GOP aides. It would then head to the Senate ahead of the Sept. 30 shutdown deadline. Johnson warned Republicans against a shutdown in a 'Dear Colleague' letter on Sunday. 'While this is not the solution any of us prefer, it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances. As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice,' Johnson said, citing a McLaughlin &amp; Associates survey that found two-thirds of likely voters oppose a government shutdown. The bill also includes $231 million for the Secret Service, which has again come under scrutiny in the wake of an apparent second assassination attempt against former President Trump. Johnson outlined the legislation to GOP lawmakers in his letter Sunday, saying: 'Since we fell a bit short of the goal line, an alternative plan is now required.' The Speaker added that the clean, three-month CR is intended 'to prevent the Senate from jamming us with a bill loaded with billions in new spending and unrelated provisions,' and that the legislation is 'a very narrow, bare-bones CR including only the extensions that are absolutely necessary.' House Republicans will almost certainly need help from Democrats to pass the legislation. Many GOP lawmakers are expected to oppose the bill because of the lack of spending cuts, shorter time frame and exclusion of the voting bill, which hard-line conservatives and Trump pushed to be part of the final product. Bringing the bill up under regular order, rather than fast-tracking it, could present a hurdle as it means the measure will need to clear a procedural vote. Such votes on rules, which govern the debate over a bill, are traditionally party-line affairs regardless of lawmakers' views on the underlying legislation. Throughout this Congress, however, hard-line conservatives have voted against rules to protest legislation they disagree with, opposition that, if large enough, could block the bill from being considered in the House. The roughly three-month timeline is the duration preferred by Democrats and GOP defense hawks. Conservatives, on the other hand, sought a longer stopgap through spring to lessen chances of a massive end-of-year omnibus spending package, and to potentially allow Trump more input regarding fiscal 2025 funding if he wins in November. In a press call ahead of the stopgap text’s release, House GOP leadership aides said that the three-month timeline 'does not necessarily mean we will be doing an omnibus in December' — hinting at another funding battle after the election. The short-term spending bill is Republican leadership’s latest attempt at avoiding an Oct. 1 government shutdown after Johnson’s opening salvo in the spending talks failed last week. Fourteen GOP lawmakers joined with the overwhelming majority of Democrats to torpedo a six-month CR coupled with the voting bill, dubbed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act — dealing a blow to Johnson. Johnson, nonetheless, has stressed that the six-month CR-plus-SAVE Act was the right 'play call.' It was intended to put the focus on Democrats’ stance on voting issues and be an initial offer for negotiations, even though Republicans knew the Democratic-controlled Senate and White House would never approve it. Democrats note that noncitizen voting is already illegal and exceedingly rare, and worry about burdening eligible voters. Trump also seemed to complicate matters when he called on Republicans in Congress to not pass any CR, forcing a shutdown, unless Democrats approve the SAVE Act. But Republicans overwhelmingly say a shutdown would hurt them in November. Johnson, who has talked to the former president about the funding issues, said Friday that Trump 'understands the situation' House Republicans are in. Democratic leaders in both chambers lauded the proposed CR, while slamming Johnson and Republicans for their attempt to pass the partisan stopgap last week. 'As a result of a bipartisan and bicameral process recently underway, the continuing resolution currently under consideration is now consistent with the spending levels agreed upon in the Bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act. It is also devoid of any partisan, right-wing policy changes that House Republicans inappropriately attempted to jam into the appropriations legislation,' House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.'Upon our return to Washington, House Democrats will collectively evaluate the spending legislation in its entirety in advance of its consideration on the Floor.' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) noted that he began the lengthy process of originating a funding bill in the Senate, saying 'Hopefully, this vehicle will be unnecessary.' 'While I am pleased bipartisan negotiations quickly led to a government funding agreement free of cuts and poison pills, this same agreement could have been done two weeks ago. Instead, Speaker Johnson chose to follow the MAGA way and wasted precious time. As I have said throughout this process, there is only one way to get things done, with bipartisan, bicameral support,' he said. The stopgap would keep funding in line with levels last hashed out by both chambers earlier this year. It excludes $10 billion in additional funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) disaster relief fund that was previously included in House Republican’s initial six-month plan. But it does include replenishment of FEMA’s disaster relief fund. A GOP leadership aide said negotiations with Democrats about the stopgap aimed to 'keep only things that are absolutely necessary on the table and leave everything off the table.' Funding for the Virginia Class Submarine program that was included in the earlier GOP-backed plan is also missing from the stopgap, as well as additional dollars to address what the Department of Veterans Affairs has warned is a potential $12 billion shortfall facing the agency for medical care for fiscal year 2025. However, the 46-page bill also features a number of health-care extensions for the VA, including measures appropriators say would extend its authority to provide nursing care to veterans with 'service-connected disabilities,' as well as the authority for the joint Department of Defense-Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Facility Demonstration Fund. The move comes after Congress passed legislation last week to address a more immediate $3 billion shortfall for the VA, as officials warned that benefit payments for veterans were at risk of being disrupted next month absent congressional action. While the bill does include Secret Service funding, House GOP leadership aides said the funding is 'confined to help their immediate needs for campaign purposes,' as Trump and Vice President Harris enter the final stretch to Election Day. GOP leadership aides did, however, say there will be 'a number of conditions' on the funding, including meeting congressional demands as its panels, like the House task force formed to investigate the July assassination attempt against Trump, conduct oversight of the agency. The inclusion of more funding for the Secret Service comes after Congress debated whether to provide the agency with more dollars after the pair of assassination attempts against Trump. Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe earlier this month said the agency had 'immediate' and 'future needs,' adding 'we also have the necessary need to make sure that we're getting the personnel that we have, and that requires us to be able to have the funding to be able to hire more people.' Republicans on Capitol Hill, however, have been skeptical of sending more money to the agency, with some arguing that it is grappling with a manpower allocation issue, not a funding issue.

Trump says he will not run in 2028 if he loses in November	Former President Trump said this would be his last presidential campaign and he would not run in 2028 if he loses the race this November. In an interview on the television show Full Measure, Trump told host Sharyl Attkisson Sunday he doesn’t have any plans to run again if he loses to Vice President Harris. Harris to release new economic proposals on wealth creation, sources say 'I think that that will be, that will be it. I don’t see that at all,' he said when asked if a fourth campaign would happen. Trump is currently in the fight for his political life with Harris. After successfully winning his first election in 2016, he lost to President Biden in 2020. He reentered the race and was polling well against Biden, despite his ongoing legal battles and guilty felony conviction. Trump would be 82 by the 2028 election. Age has surrounded this campaign season, as Biden faced criticism for his age and eventually passed the torch to a new generation and Harris. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Harris has a 55 percent chance of winning. Both candidates are vying for a set of critical battleground states. New polling shows Harris has increased her support in those states after the presidential debate against Trump.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-2028-election/	2024-09-22T12:40:21-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24262024467543-e1726657352431.jpg?w=900
Harris to release new economic proposals on wealth creation, sour...	WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris plans to roll out a new set of economic policies this week that aim to help Americans build wealth and set economic incentives for businesses to aid that goal, three sources with knowledge of the matter said. The new policies, which have not been previously reported and could be announced in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, come as undecided voters continue to ask for more information about how Harris would help them economically if she were elected president in November, including those in critical swing states, the sources said. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters The rollout would follow heated debate in Democratic circles over whether releasing more economic policies so close to election day is a smart strategy. 'It's not just about affordability, it's also about showing (voters) they have a path to building wealth,' said one of the sources with direct knowledge of Harris's economic plans, adding she wanted to show Americans how they can 'get a foot in the door.' None of the sources would provide specific details on the expected new policies, and the Harris campaign would not comment on any new proposals. However, Harris' 2020 presidential run and President Joe Biden's administration included plans with similar goals. In her 2020 campaign, Harris proposed significant pay hikes for the millions of public school teachers, forcing companies to disclose their pay gap between men and women and penalizing those who are not narrowing it. The Biden and Harris administration have pushed to eliminate bias in home appraisals and use the over $700 billion federal contracting budget to buoy minority businesses. Harris has released a basket of economic policies focused on the high cost of housing, taxes, small business expenses, childcare and goods. Her plans often build on Biden's policies, like increasing the child tax credit and lifting the corporate tax rate to 28%. Campaign spokesman James Singer told Reuters that Harris 'will continue to present her opportunity economy agenda to lower costs, make housing more affordable, and spur economic growth across America.' Releasing new economic policy with less than 50 days left in a tight presidential election race could mean the new measures never reach crucial voters, some advisers acknowledge. 'Typically you'd see a campaign wrap up persuading voters by September and move to mobilizing people but this is not a typical campaign,' said a source with knowledge of the new plans, referring to Harris' jump to the top of the ticket in late July. 'We have to continue persuading and mobilizing folks at the same time until the very end.' Republican Donald Trump's economic proposals aimed at working-class Americans include eliminating taxes on tips and Social Security benefits, opening up federal lands to housing construction and deporting millions of immigrants to the country who Republicans say are driving up costs. The former president has also proposed new across-the-board tariffs on goods not made in the U.S. that could raise costs for American consumers and inflation, but that is backed by a slim majority of voters. Trump has tried to pin on Democrats inflation that popped globally as the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns eased and has made the still-high cost of groceries, particularly bacon, a rally speech staple. From 2019 to 2023, the food Consumer Price Index rose by 25%, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported. HARRIS GAINS ON ECONOMY Republicans have traditionally polled better on the economy than Democrats, and Trump beat Biden and then Harris on the topic earlier this year. Some polls, however, are shifting in her direction. A Financial Times-Michigan Ross poll this month showed 44% of registered voters trusted Harris' economic stewardship compared with 42% who backed Trump, and Reuters/IPSOS polling in August showed her narrowing the gap on the economy. The Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by half a percentage point last week, reflecting the belief that inflation risks have fallen, could lower some costs for consumers. Some Harris supporters have urged the campaign to double down on the economic message that is already out there instead of rolling out new ideas. 'My recommendation is to do more show-and-tells. Rather than address this with endless white papers, go to grocery stores and apartment buildings and more,' said Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic strategist. 'Inflation may have gone down, but the cost of living hasn't changed. Some of this is post pandemic and that still must be addressed,' she said. Others believe more economic policy is not a priority. Adam Newar, a money manager and Harris donor said 'it's a character election' and not a policy election. 'I'm not sure what more policy information actually brings to the table. She really has to continue articulating a vision, communicate that vision to people who really feel like they've been left behind,' Newar said. Many of Harris' proposals would require congressional approval, and would be unlikely to pass unless Democrats win both the House and Senate. (Reporting by Nandita Bose.

Hezbollah hits back with rockets as it declares an 'open-ended ba...	NAHARIYA, Israel (AP) — Hezbollah fired over 100 rockets early Sunday across northern Israel, with some landing near the city of Haifa, as Israel launched hundreds of strikes on Lebanon. A Hezbollah leader declared an 'open-ended battle' was underway as both sides appeared to be spiraling closer toward all-out war. The overnight rocket barrage was in response to Israeli attacks in Lebanon that have killed dozens, including a veteran Hezbollah commander, and an unprecedented attack targeting the group’s communications devices. Air raid sirens across northern Israel sent hundreds of thousands of people scrambling into shelters. One struck near a residential building in Kiryat Bialik, a city near Haifa, wounding at least three people and setting buildings and cars ablaze. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said four people were wounded. Avi Vazana raced to a shelter with his wife and 9-month-old baby before he heard the rocket hitting. Then he went back outside to see if anyone was hurt. 'I ran without shoes, without a shirt, only with pants. I ran to this house when everything was still on fire to try to find if there are other people,' he said. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said three people were killed and four wounded in Israeli strikes near the border, without saying whether they were civilians or combatants. Hezbollah responds to unprecedented blows The rocket attacks followed an Israeli airstrike Friday in Beirut killed at least 45 people, including Akil, one of Hezbollah’s top leaders, several other fighters, and women and children. Hezbollah was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies to explode just days earlier. But it faces a difficult balance of stretching the rules of engagement by hitting deeper into Israel, while at the same time trying to avoid large-scale attacks on civilian areas and infrastructure that could trigger a full-scale war that it would rather not start and take the blame for. Hezbollah’s deputy leader Naim Kassem said Sunday's rocket attack was just the beginning of what’s now an ″open-ended battle' with Israel. 'We admit that we are pained. We are humans. But as we are pained — you will also be pained,' Kassem said at the funeral of top Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Akil. He vowed Hezbollah will continue military operations against Israel in support of Gaza but also warned of unexpected attacks 'from outside the box,' pointing to rockets fired deeper into Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would take whatever action was necessary to restore security in the north and allow people to return to their homes. 'No country can accept the wanton rocketing of its cities. We can’t accept it either,' he said. White House national security spokesman John Kirby remained hopeful for a peaceful resolution, telling 'Fox News Sunday' the U.S. has been 'involved in extensive and quite assertive diplomacy.' 'We are watching all these escalating tensions that have been occurring over the last week or so, with great concern, and we want to make sure that we can continue to do everything we can to try to prevent this from becoming an all-out war there with Hezbollah across that Lebanese border,' he said. Israel says it thwarted an even larger attack from Hezbollah The Israeli military said it struck about 400 militant sites, including rocket launchers, across southern Lebanon in the past 24 hours, thwarting an even larger attack. 'Hundreds of thousands of civilians have come under fire across a lot of northern Israel,' said Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani. 'Today we saw fire that was deeper into Israel than before.' The military also said it intercepted multiple aerial devices fired from the direction of Iraq, after Iran-backed militant groups there claimed to have launched a drone attack on Israel. School was canceled across northern Israel, and the Health Ministry said all hospitals in the north would begin moving operations to protected areas within the medical centers. Separately, Israeli forces raided the West Bank bureau of Al-Jazeera, which it had banned earlier this year, accusing it of serving as a mouthpiece for militant groups, allegations denied by the pan-Arab broadcaster. U.N. envoy says the region is on the brink of catastrophe Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire since the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly a year ago, when the militant group began firing rockets in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed ally Hamas. The low-level fighting has killed dozens of people in Israel, hundreds in Lebanon, and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the frontier. Until recently, neither side was believed to be seeking an all-out war, and Hezbollah has so far stopped short of targeting Tel Aviv or major civilian infrastructure. But in recent weeks, Israel has shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon. Hezbollah has said it would only halt its attacks if the war in Gaza ends, as a cease-fire there appears increasingly elusive. The war in Gaza began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. They are still holding about 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It doesn't say how many were fighters, but says women and children make up more than half of the dead. 'With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,' Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the U.N. envoy for Lebanon, said in an X post. Families of Israeli hostages and residents of Gaza expressed fears the fighting in Lebanon will direct international attention from their own plights. 'I’m incredibly concerned with the increased tensions with Hezbollah because, my biggest concern is that, all the public’s attention and the world’s attention' would be distracted, said Udi Goren, a relative of Tal Haimi, an Israeli man who was killed Oct. 7 and whose body was taken into Gaza. Enas Kollab, a Palestinian displaced from Gaza, voiced similar fears. 'We are afraid that the situation in Lebanon will affect us -- that all attention will turn to Lebanon and we will become forgotten,' she said. Hezbollah says it's using new weapons Hezbollah said it had launched dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles — a new weapon the group hadn't used before — at the Ramat David airbase, southeast of Haifa, 'in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.' In July, the group released what it said was video it had taken of the base with surveillance drones. Hezbollah also said it had targeted the facilities of the Rafael defense firm, headquartered in Haifa, calling it retaliation for the wireless devices attack. It didn't provide evidence, and the Israeli military declined to comment on the statement. Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate for a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people — including two children — and wounding about 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which hasn't confirmed or denied responsibility. An Israeli airstrike Friday took down an eight-story building in a densely populated neighborhood in Beirut’s southern suburbs as Hezbollah members met in the basement, according to Israel. Among those killed was Akil., who commanded the group's special forces unit. ___ Kareem Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

Over 700 high-ranking national security officials endorse Harris	Over 700 high-ranking national security officials have endorsed Democratic candidate Vice President Harris in her run for the White House, with some leaders expressing concerns about former President Trump's 'scary authoritarian streak.' 'Vice President Harris has all the leadership qualities needed to be a strong commander in chief. She’s prepared. She’s strategic. She’s understands all sides of an issue,' retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Michael Smith told The Hill. 'We saw as much during the debate.' 'As we’ve seen for nearly a decade, however, former President Trump has none of those qualities, and he has a scary authoritarian streak,' Smith, who is also the president of National Security Leaders for America, added. The letter endorsing Harris consists of 741 former high-ranking national security officials, including 233 general and flag officers. Among those 741 officials are 15 four-star generals, 10 former cabinet secretaries and 10 service secretaries as well as leaders who served in Republican administrations. 'We do not agree on everything, but we all adhere to two fundamental principles,' the letter reads. 'First, we believe America’s national security requires a serious and capable Commander-in-Chief. Second, we believe American democracy is invaluable.' 'Each generation has a responsibility to defend it,' the letter continues. 'That is why we, the undersigned, proudly endorse Kamala Harris to be the next President of the United States.' The signatories praise Harris as the more diplomatic and realistic candidate for office, distinguishing her from former President Trump, who they call 'impulsive and ill-informed.' It cites Trump’s relations with Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un and the terrorist leaders of Hezbollah. 'Our endorsement of Vice President Harris is an endorsement of freedom and an act of patriotism. It is an endorsement of democratic ideals, of competence, and of relentless optimism in America’s future,' the letter concludes. This endorsement comes after over 100 former GOP national security figures already endorsed Harris earlier this week. That letter cited Trump’s 'demonstrated chaotic and unethical behavior' as president as reason to support Harris, who they say 'posesses the essential qualities to serve as president.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/over-700-high-ranking-national-security-officials-endorse-harris/	2024-09-22T07:32:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/harriskamala_091824gn11_w.jpg?w=900
Bank warns of voice-based AI scams that could utilize your social...	(NEXSTAR) – Forget about the complexity of your online password, your own voice could be the tool criminals use to access your money, new research warns. Starling, a UK-based online bank, said Wednesday in a news release that 'millions' of people are at risk of falling victim to voice cloning scams. The data, based on a representative survey of roughly 3,000 UK adults, found that 28% of people said they had been targeted by an AI voice cloning scam at least once in the past year. Forty-six percent of UK adults were not aware such scams even existed, Starling's researchers found. Powerful artificial intelligence-based programs are able to replicate a person's voice using just seconds of original audio, which the study's authors noted is not difficult to find thanks to social media accounts, YouTube and other internet archives. In March, OpenAI unveiled its Voice Engine, which can accurately replicate someone's speech using just a 15-second clip. The FBI issued a similar warning in early May, saying that the AI tools are publicly available and allow crooks to increase the speed, scale and automation of their attacks. While incorrect grammar or misspellings might have been obvious clues in the past, the AI tools can polish convincing messages to victims. 'Malicious actors increasingly employ AI-powered voice and video cloning techniques to impersonate trusted individuals, such as family members, co-workers, or business partners,' the FBI said in a release. 'By manipulating and creating audio and visual content with unprecedented realism, these adversaries seek to deceive unsuspecting victims into divulging sensitive information or authorizing fraudulent transactions.' 'If a call sounds like your boss (asking for bank account numbers) or your family member (begging for help in an emergency), you’re more likely to act,' a Federal Trace Commission warning reads. 'That’s why scammers use voice cloning to make their requests for money or information more believable.' Major banks such as HSBC, Schwab and others have implemented a Voice ID security screening to speed up customer service interactions. Banks often reassure customers that their voices are as unique as their fingerprints, but what happens if one's voice can be accurately recreated by a bad actor? Nexstar reached out to both HSBC and Schwab to ask about the security of their Voice ID features, but did not receive a reply as of publishing time. In a piece for Vice, a journalist documented himself using an AI clone of his own voice to fool the automated system at Lloyds Bank in the UK, using only the recording and his birth date to gain access to the account. The article was one of several cited in a US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs letter to Brian Moynihan, the CEO of Bank of America, asking for information on how banks use – and protect – voice data. When it comes to the safety of voice authentication technology, Wells Fargo recently defended the tool, telling KQED that it relies on a 'layered approach' that doesn't grant access solely on the basis of a customer's voice. 'This service must be paired with other identity verification methods to allow access to customer accounts.' The FBI and Starling recommend people do the following to keep their information – and money – safe: Stay vigilant: Messages asking for money or credentials are red flags. Businesses should employee technical solutions to fight phishing tactics and make sure to train employees against them. Multi-factor authentication: This is a crucial tool against crooks trying to take control of an account or system. Consider a 'safe phrase': While AI tools can mimic your voice, it won't be able to guess what phrase you might have previously agreed upon with friends and relatives. If you do experience a scam attempt, the FTC asks you to send them an email.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/bank-warns-of-voice-based-ai-scams-that-could-utilize-your-social-media-posts/	2024-09-22T07:24:24-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-1400050206.jpg?w=872
Springfield students suffer collateral damage over anti-immigrant...	The students of Springfield, Ohio, are caught in a mess they had nothing to do with. Schools had to shut down for multiple days after 33 separate bomb threats, and two universities moved classes online after threats of a shooting, one specifically targeting 'members of the Haitian community,' after baseless accusations of immigrants eating people's pets. Experts worry not only about the students' ability to focus and learn amid the threats but the long-term takeaways they may have after seeing how false political allegations can upend their community. 'Exposure to threats of violence or safety concerns, even indirectly through overhearing conversations between adults or news coverage, can detrimentally impact kids. In response, kids might display obvious signs of fear and anxiety, for example, by verbally expressing their worries and seeking reassurance, having trouble separating from caregivers, or not wanting to go back to school,' said Sabrina Liu, assistant professor and licensed clinical psychologist at California State University-San Marcos. 'However, it’s also common for kids to display more difficulty concentrating, disruptive behavior, and/or changes to their sleep or appetite in response to events such as these,' Liu added. And those feelings can become even more difficult with the political context around Springfield, as migrants can feel singled out or ostracized due to the rumors spread about their communities. 'I would be concerned for students that hear this language or rhetoric towards aspects of their personal identities as very stressful. [...] Oftentimes we do try to promote a feeling of belongingness and connectedness to schools,' said Justin Heinze, director of the School Safety Section and co-director of the Research and Scholarship Core at the Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention and an associate professor at the University of Michigan. 'And so, if you're hearing language about your school or your school community that's also either derogatory or very negative, that could be impactful.' False allegations of Haitian migrants stealing and eating pets first emerged at a Springfield City Commission meeting late last month, which saw a speaker from a neo-Nazi group expelled for making threats 'for every Haitian you bring in.' A week later, a Facebook post — attributed to the poster's neighbor's daughter's friend — accused Haitians of killing a cat that has since been found alive. The conspiracy theory was amplified by GOP vice presidential nominee and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, and later by his running mate, former President Trump, during his high-profile debate with Vice President Harris. 'In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs,' Trump exclaimed. Two days later, the bomb threats began. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R), who has denounced the unfounded claims, deployed state troopers to every school in the city. He says none of the bomb threats have been found to be legitimate. 'As a supporter of former President Donald Trump and Senator JD Vance, I am saddened by how they and others continue to repeat claims that lack evidence and disparage the legal migrants living in Springfield,' DeWine said in a New York Times op-ed published Friday. 'This rhetoric hurts the city and its people, and it hurts those who have spent their lives there.' 'It is disappointing to me that Springfield has become the epicenter of vitriol over America’s immigration policy,' he wrote, 'because it has long been a community of great diversity.' Pressed on the conspiracy, Vance has said he's trying to bring attention to immigration more broadly and the strained infrastructure of Springfield in particular, which has seen an influx in recent years. But the false allegations, experts say, are doing considerable harm. 'There is kind of this broader political frenzy, or almost hysteria, surrounding this particular situation, and I think that those types of situations have a tendency to feed on themselves, right?' said Jessie Borelli, professor and associate director of clinical training at the University of California-Irvine. 'So, there's been one accusation that's been made and then other accusations that can create fear, right? So that can be especially frightening for children, where they can start to wonder, 'Well, what's the next thing that's going to be pulled out from underneath? What's the next scary thing that's going to happen?'' she added. It can be a balancing act for schools and parents to try to explain the situation going on, especially between different grade levels. 'I think many children at a younger age than many adults might be expecting are attentive to the political conversations occurring in the background,' said Winston Thompson, associate professor of philosophy and history of education at the Ohio State University. 'So I would say it's entirely appropriate to have conversations with children about these issues, because remaining silent about these issues doesn't mean that the children are going to be exposed. It just means that the children are going to be grappling with and trying to make sense of circumstances that about which they might have incomplete information or misinformation.' Some parents have called for the schools to go remote over the threats until the spotlight gets off their city. But parents and adults also need to be aware of the tension in the community given the racial and ethnic underpinning of the conflict. 'I think with an influx of immigrant populations, a school really has to be careful to make sure that it's not creating the context within which there's going to be alienation for those who are relatively newly arrived, nor will there be suspicion and xenophobia from those whose families have longer histories in the area and deeper roots over time,' Thompson said. 'Schools should be trying to educate people so that they can recognize their shared humanity and our shared faith as members of a political and civic context,' he added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/springfield-students-suffer-collateral-damage-over-anti-immigrant-conspiracy-theory/	2024-09-22T06:23:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/springfield-students_lonas_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
Israel-Hamas war latest: Israel claims death of Hezbollah command...	Israel claimed the death of a senior Hezbollah military official after a rare Israeli airstrike on Beirut as the death toll rose Saturday to at least 37 people, with dozens more wounded, shortly after Hezbollah pounded northern Israel with 140 rockets. The strikes are part of a new cycle of escalation between the enemies that has raised fears of a full-out war erupting in the Middle East, particularly after two separate attacks in Lebanon in which communication devices exploded simultaneously around the country, reportedly killing 37 people and injuring more than 3,400 others. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire regularly since Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel ignited the Israeli military’s devastating offensive in Gaza. Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory during the nearly 1-year-old Israel-Hamas war. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Here's the latest: Hezbollah announces strike on Israeli military base near Haifa using new missile type BEIRUT — The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah announced a strike early Sunday on an Israeli military base near Haifa using a new missile type for the first time. Israel’s emergency medical services reported that a man was lightly wounded by shrapnel from a missile shot from Lebanon that was intercepted in a village in the lower Galilee. Local media reported rockets shot from Lebanon were intercepted in the areas of Haifa and Nazareth. The Israeli military said only that it had monitored the launch of 'about ten rockets' from Lebanon, of which most were intercepted. 'A rocket was also monitored falling in the area and the incident is being investigated,' the statement said. Hezbollah said it had launched 'dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles, in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.' Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel for a wave of apparently remotely detonated explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people - including two children - and wounding around 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility. On Friday, an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs killed at least 37 people, including one of the militant group’s senior leaders as well as women and children, raising fears of a further escalation. Israeli military announces new safety guidelines after striking over 400 rocket launchers in Lebanon JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said that about 90 rockets had been fired at northern Israel from Lebanon on Saturday and that it struck more than 400 rocket launchers in Lebanon. It wasn’t immediately clear if anyone was killed or wounded in the back-and-forth attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, which follow an Israeli strike on Beirut that killed a top Hezbollah commander on Friday. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli defense spokesperson, announced updated safety guidelines for areas north of Haifa, including caps on gatherings of 30 people in open spaces and 300 in enclosed spaces. Work and school can continue if people can reach protected areas promptly. In practice, the new guidelines likely mean school will be canceled in parts of the north, since students and teachers wouldn’t be able to reach shelters in the required time. Within an hour of the announcement, Sunday classes were canceled in at least one border region in western Galilee. The cancellations include locations well outside the ordinary five-kilometer (three-mile) evacuation zone in northern Israel. Iran forces unveil new ballistic missile TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s armed forces unveiled a new ballistic missile during an annual military parade Saturday amid tensions in the region. State television reported that the missile, called Jahad, was a single-stage liquid-fuel ballistic missile with a high-explosive warhead, and it had a range of 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles), making it theoretically capable or reaching Israel. Iran routinely unveils the technological achievements of its armed forces. In April, it launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike that killed two Iranian generals in an Iranian consular building in Syria. Israel said most of the missiles were intercepted. Lebanon's prime minister says he will not attend the UN General Assembly BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati says he will not go to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly because of the ongoing acts of violence with Israel. Mikati’s office said the prime minister was scheduled to give Lebanon’s speech later this month at the United Nations but now he will discuss Lebanon’s diplomatic moves with Foreign Minster Abdallah Bouhabib who is currently in New York. 'There is no priority at the present time than stopping the massacres committed by the Israeli enemy,' Mikati was quoted as saying, a day after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut killed 37 people and wounded 68. Mikati said he calls for drafting international laws that prevent the use of civilian technological devices for military purposes. Mikati’s comments came days after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000 members of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group. Israel was blamed for the attack. White House national security adviser calls reported death of Hezbollah commander ‘a good outcome’ WILMINGTON, Del. — White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called the reported death of Ibrahim Akil 'a good outcome' and said that he planned to speak with Israeli officials later Saturday about the operation. Akil, the main target of the Friday strike, had been wanted by the U.S. for years for his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and in taking American and German hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s. He was under U.S. sanctions and in 2023, the U.S. State Department announced a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his 'identification, location, arrest, and/or conviction.' 'That individual has American blood on his hands and has a rewards for justice price on his head,' Sullivan told reporters on the sidelines of the Quad summit that U.S. President Joe Biden is hosting in Wilmington, Delaware. 'He is somebody who the United States promised long ago we would do everything we could to see brought to justice.' Sullivan added the moment was also meaningful for the American victims. 'You know 1983 seems like a long time ago,' Sullivan said. 'But for a lot of families and a lot of people, they’re still living with it every day.' — from AP White House correspondent Zeke Miller in Wilmington, Delaware. Israeli strike on a school kills 22 people, Gaza Health Ministry says DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli fire killed 22 people in a strike on a school in the north of the enclave, the Gaza Health Ministry said on Saturday. The strike on the school in the Zeitoun area of Gaza City injured another 30, the statement said. Earlier Saturday, the Israeli army said it struck a Hamas 'command and control center, which was embedded inside a compound that previously served' as a school. Death toll from Israeli strike on Beirut suburb rises to 31 BEIRUT, Lebanon — The death toll from an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb has risen to 31, including seven women and three children, Lebanon’s health minister said Saturday. Firass Abiad told reporters that 68 people were also wounded in Friday's airstrike, of whom 15 remain in hospital, in the deadliest Israeli strike on Beirut since the Israel-Hezbollah war in the summer of 2006. Among the dead was Ibrahim Akil, a Hezbollah commander who was in charge of the group’s elite Radwan Forces, and about a dozen members of the militant group who were meeting in the basement of the building that was destroyed. Israel launched the rare airstrike in the densely populated southern Beirut neighborhood on Friday afternoon during the rush hour when people were returning home from work and students were leaving schools. On Saturday morning, Hezbollah’s media office took journalists to the site of the airstrike where workers were still digging through the rubble. Lebanese troops cordoned off the area around the building that was destroyed as members of the Lebanese Red Cross stood nearby to take any recovered bodies from under the rubble. Weaponizing ordinary devices violates international law, United Nations rights chief says UNITED NATIONS — Weaponizing ordinary communication devices represents a new development in warfare, and targeting thousands of Lebanese people using pagers, two-way radios and electronic equipment without their knowledge is a violation of international human rights law, the United Nations human rights chief said Friday. Volker Türk told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council there must be an independent and transparent investigation of the two attacks in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday where these devices exploded, reportedly killing 37 people and injuring more than 3,400 others. 'Those who ordered and carried out these attacks must be held to account,' he said. Lebanon has blamed Israel for the attacks, which appeared to target Hezbollah militants but also saw many civilian casualties, including children. Hezbollah has fought many conflicts with Israel, including a war in 2006, and it has conducted near-daily strikes against Israel to support Hamas militants who attacked Israel on Oct. 7. When reporters asked Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon about speculation Israel was behind the two explosions, he said: 'We are not commenting.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israel-hamas-war-latest-israel-claims-death-of-hezbollah-commander-as-beirut-toll-rises/	2024-09-21T16:19:42-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66ef552b28f4b7.78354791.jpeg?w=900
Biden tells Quad leaders that Beijing is testing region at turbul...	CLAYMONT, Del. (AP) — President Joe Biden told Indo-Pacific allies on Saturday that he believes China’s increasing military assertiveness is an effort to test the region at a turbulent moment for Beijing. Biden's comments were caught by a hot mic after he and fellow leaders of the so-called Quad delivered opening remarks before the press at a summit he’s hosting near his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. He said his administration sees Beijing’s actions as a 'change in tactic, not a change in strategy.' China continues to struggle to pull up its economy that was pummeled by the coronavirus pandemic and has seen an extended slowdown in industrial activity and real estate prices as Beijing faces pressure to ramp up spending to stimulate demand. 'China continues to behave aggressively, testing us all across the region, and it’s true in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, South China, South Asia and the Taiwan Straits,' Biden told Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. He added, 'At least from our perspective, we believe (Chinese President) Xi Jinping is looking to focus on domestic economic challenges and minimize the turbulence in China's diplomatic relationships, and he’s also looking to buy himself some diplomatic space, in my view, to aggressively pursue China’s interest.' Starting with a trade war that dates back to 2018, China and the United States have grown at odds over a range of issues, from global security, such as China’s claims over the South China Sea, to industrial policy on electric vehicle and solar panel manufacturing. The administration has repeatedly spoken out about concerns about Chinese aggression toward Taiwan and more recently on the frequent clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China also has longtime territorial disputes involving other claimants including Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. U.S. officials worry about China’s long-stated goals of unifying Taiwan with China's mainland and the possibility of war over Taiwan. The self-ruled island democracy is claimed by Beijing as part of its territory. Biden recently dispatched his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Beijing for three days of talks with Chinese officials. Sullivan during that visit also met with Xi. Both governments are eager to keep relations on an even keel ahead of a change in the U.S. presidency in January. And both sides have said they remain committed to managing the relationship, following up on a meeting between Xi and Biden in San Francisco last November. Biden added that he continues to believe 'intense competition requires intense diplomacy.' The comments came as Biden showed off a slice of his Delaware hometown to the leaders of Australia, Japan and India as he hosted what is likely the last gathering of the Indo-Pacific partnership that has grown in prominence under his White House tenure. When Biden began his presidency he looked to elevate the Quad, which until then had only met at the foreign minister level, to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and opportunities in the Indo-Pacific. This weekend's summit is the fourth in-person and sixth overall gathering of the leaders since 2021. 'It will survive way beyond November,' Biden told the leaders. The president, who has admitted to an uneven track record as a scholar, also seemed tickled to get to host a gathering with three world leaders at the school he attended more than 60 years ago. He welcomed each of the leaders individually for one-on-one talks at his nearby home before they gathered at the school for talks and a formal dinner. 'I don’t think the headmaster of this school thought I’d be presiding over a meeting like this,' Biden joked to fellow leaders. Albanese, Modi and Kishida came for the summit before their appearances at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. 'This place could not be better suited for my final visit as prime minister,' said Kishida, who like Biden, is set to soon leave office. Earlier, the president warmly greeted Kishida when he arrived at the residence on Saturday morning and gave the prime minister a tour of the property before they settled into talks. White House officials said holding the talks at the president's house, which sits near a pond in a wooded area several miles west of downtown, was intended to give the meetings a more relaxed feel. Sullivan described the vibe of Biden's one-on-one meeting with Albanese, who stopped by the house on Friday, as 'two guys — one at the other guy’s home — talking in broad strokes about where they see the state of the world.' He said Biden and Albanese also swapped stories about their political careers. The Australian leader remarked that the visit had given him 'insight into what in my view makes you such an extraordinary world leader.' Modi also stopped by the house on Saturday to meet with Biden before the leaders gathered for their joint talks at Archmere. 'There cannot be a better place than President Biden's hometown of Wilmington to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Quad,' Modi said. As part of the summit, the leaders were set to announce new initiatives to bolster maritime security in the region — with enhanced coast guard collaboration through the Pacific and Indian oceans — and improve cooperation on humanitarian response missions. The measures are meant to serve as a counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. Biden and Modi discussed Modi's recent visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that maintains a neutral position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden and Kishida, who are both stepping away from office amid sliding public support, count the tightening of security and economic ties among the U.S., Japan and South Korea as one of their most significant accomplishments. The improved relations between Japan and South Korea, two nations with a deep and complicated history that have struggled to stay on speaking terms, have come amid worrying developments in the Pacific, including strides made by North Korea in its nuclear program and concerns about China. Biden during their face-to-face meeting commended Kishida for demonstrating 'courage and conviction in strengthening ties' with South Korea, according to the White House. They also discussed China, Russia's war against Ukraine and emerging technology issues. The U.S. and Japan are dealing with a rare moment of tension in the relationship. Biden, as well as presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, have opposed a $15 billion bid by Japan’s Nippon Steel to take over American-owned U.S. Steel. Biden administration officials indicated this week that a U.S. government committee's formal assessment of the proposed deal has yet to be submitted to the White House and may not come until after the Nov. 5 election. The Biden administration promised that the leaders would issue a joint statement containing the strongest-ever language on China and North Korea to be agreed upon by the four countries. The White House said the leaders later Saturday will rollout a new collaboration aimed at reducing cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific. The announcement is related to Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative, a long-running passion project of the president and his wife, Jill Biden, aimed at reducing cancer deaths. The Bidens’ son Beau died in 2015 at age 46 of brain cancer. ___ Madhani reported from Washington.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-biden-is-putting-personal-touch-on-asia-pacific-diplomacy-in-his-final-months-in-office/	2024-09-21T15:40:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66ef4bc9e26b90.70857788.jpeg?w=900
Rival Sinaloa cartel factions fighting after US arrests leaders	(NewsNation) — Rival factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel are waging a deadly war in northwestern Mexico, leaving dozens dead and missing in the wake of U.S. arrests of key cartel leaders. The violence between groups known as the 'Mayos' and the 'Chapos' erupted after U.S. authorities apprehended Joaquín Guzmán López and Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada in late July. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador claims these arrests, which he says were made without Mexico's knowledge, triggered the current bloodshed. Mexican president blames US for cartel violence in Sinaloa 'They made a deal and did not inform us,' López Obrador said, citing Mexico's attorney general. 'The Department of Justice was in talks with one of the criminal groups in Sinaloa and they made deals.' More than 50 people have been killed and another 50 are missing in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa state. Gruesome displays of violence include severed heads left on pizza boxes and bodies wearing baseball caps similar to those in 'El Mayo' wanted posters. The conflict has disrupted daily life in Sinaloa. While schools have reopened, many businesses close early and residents remain indoors despite heavy military patrols. Cartels infiltrating native reservations with fentanyl: Tribal leader U.S. intelligence analysts suggest the conflict could last for years. The Drug Enforcement Administration reports the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels have a presence in all 50 U.S. states, controlling global networks that dominate the fentanyl and methamphetamine trade. López Obrador questioned why the U.S. hasn't focused on arresting its own drug lords and blamed America's demand for driving the surge in fentanyl trafficking. U.S. officials have not yet responded to these accusations. The Mexican president's claims have sparked debate about U.S.-Mexico cooperation in combating drug cartels.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/sinaloa-cartel-factions-fighting-arrests-leaders/	2024-09-21T14:46:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/cartel.jpg?w=370
Harris debate performance falls short of moving the needle in swi...	Vice President Harris was widely seen by voters as the clear winner of her debate against former President Trump, but that sentiment has failed to move the needle in key battleground states where the presidential nominees are still neck-and-neck heading into November. Harris’s debate performance has been hailed in the nearly two weeks since it occurred, with voters in several surveys, including those conducted that evening, believing she is better at staying calm under pressure, more intelligent and has higher moral integrity than Trump. But in the nearly two dozen polls conducted since the match-up, Harris’s slight lead over Trump nationally and in swing states grew by less than one percentage point and, in some states, Trump’s lead grew, albeit by razor-thin margins. Harris currently holds a 3.6 percentage point lead over Trump nationally, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ aggregate polling, which has grown just slightly since the day before the debate, when she had a 3.2 percentage point lead. Surveys in battleground states tell a similar story. Harris saw slight spikes in her lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin in the weeks since the debate but her lead remained the same in Michigan, which makes up part of the blue wall. Trump has a 0.1 lead over Harris in Arizona and Georgia, two other key states a candidate needs to proclaim victory. 'While it's true that the battleground states remain on a knife's edge, that was always going to be the case in a country as split along partisan lines as we are right now, and no debate performance was going to shift those state numbers significantly,' said John LaBombard, former communications director to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.). Harris is up 1.2 percentage points in Michigan, the aggregate polling shows, which is the same lead she had the day before the debate. Harris is up 1.1 percentage point in Pennsylvania, which is a minor increase from the 0.7 percentage point lead she had pre-debate. And, in Nevada, Harris has a 1.2 percentage point lead, which is an uptick from the 0.5 percentage point lead she had pre-debate. Her biggest lead is in Wisconsin, by 2 percentage points, but that’s a decline from the 3 percentage point lead she had on Sept. 9. Meanwhile, in Arizona, the aggregation shows Trump with a 0.1 percentage point lead over Harris, which is a flip from the 0.1 percentage point lead Harris had over him before the debate. Trump has a 0.1 percentage point lead in Georgia, which is a decease from his 0.3 percentage point lead he had before the debate. Strategists don’t see much in the way of either candidate coming out that far ahead in key battleground states where the margins are so thin. 'Anyone who is expecting the polling to break open one way or the other will be sorely disappointed,' said Clayton Cox, former Democratic National Committee (DNC) national finance director, noting what he called a 'calcified electorate.' 'What matters now is ground game, enthusiasm and ability to motivate a volunteer army. On that basis, I would rather be Harris over Trump any day of the week,' Clayton said. Democrats since the debate have been cautious to claim victory just yet and are painting Harris, as she herself often does on the campaign trail, as the underdog in the race. 'We are still in a margin of error race. It’s a tie,' Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said at a fundraising event with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday. 'We’ve got to go persuade those people who don’t know enough about the vice president and her vision for the future…have those hard conversations in big and small ways, we’re going to inch our way over the finish line.' Republicans, too, see the race as too close to call. Stewart Verdery, who served in former President George W. Bush’s administration, expects there won’t be a big, game-changer moment before November. 'When Trump has a bad debate or there’s a new oddball poll, it’s treated as a game-changer. But the simple truth is that two parties are within 2 to 3 points of each other nationally so there will never be a definitive moment in the campaign,' he said. 'But within those slim margins, Harris has improved her odds considerably since the debate and now appears to be going into the old basketball ‘four corners’ to run out the clock.' To that point, individual polls also paint varying pictures of the state of the race. An Emerson College and The Hill poll on Thursday found Trump edging out Harris in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all by just one point, and edging out Harris in Georgia by 3 points. Harris edged out Trump in Michigan by 2 points, North Carolina by 1 point and the two candidates were tied in Nevada. Harris and Trump were tied in Pennsylvania in a Marist poll released on Thursday. That poll found that Harris edged out Trump by five points in Michigan and by 1 point in Wisconsin. A Quinnipiac University poll on Wednesday found Harris leading Trump by 6 points in Pennsylvania, 5 points in Michigan, and by 1 point in Wisconsin. Democrats still, however, are optimistic that the groundwork Harris has put into the swing states will pay off by election day, despite the lack of movement in the polls after the debate. 'It's still a close, competitive election, but we are in a stronger position than they are… we have more money, more volunteers, we have more enthusiasm. There's a lot of optimism on our side that we're in a stronger position today, and we have a much stronger capacity to close,' said Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg. 'There is no good news for Trump in the battlegrounds.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-debate-performance-falls-short-of-moving-the-needle-in-swing-states/	2024-09-21T14:20:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/harriskamala_trumpdonald_092024gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Top Hezbollah leader was among the 37 people killed in an Israeli...	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Israel and Hezbollah exchanged fire on Saturday as rescue crews in Beirut searched the rubble of an apartment building that was leveled by an Israeli airstrike that killed at least 37 people, including one of the militant group's senior leaders as well as women and children. The Israeli government braced for an expected surge in Hezbollah rocket attacks by setting new caps on the size of gatherings and other restrictions in the north of the country, near Israel's border with Lebanon, that led to schools in some communities canceling classes on Sunday. The airstrike Friday took down an eight-story building in a densely populated neighborhood in southern Beirut as Hezbollah members were meeting in the basement, according to Israel. Among those killed was Ibrahim Akil, a top Hezbollah official who commanded the group’s special forces unit the Radwan Force. Also killed was Ahmed Wahbi, a top commander in the group’s military wing, the Israeli military said. Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said the attack, which came days after devastating coordinated attacks on Hezbollah that used exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, thwarted the group's chain of command while taking out Akil, who he said was responsible for Israeli deaths and who was on the U.S. wanted list for years. 'This is our commitment to the fallen and their loved ones. This is our commitment to the residents of the north. And this is a clear message to all those who seek to harm us,' he posted on X. Lebanon’s health minister, Firass Abiad, told reporters that at least seven women and three children were killed in Friday's airstrike on the building. He said another 68 people were injured, including 15 who were hospitalized. It was the deadliest strike on Beirut since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, and the casualty count could grow, with 23 people still missing, a government official said. Hezbollah confirms more than a dozen operatives were killed Akil, the main target, had been wanted by the U.S. for years for his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s. The U.S. State Department last year announced a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his 'identification, location, arrest, and/or conviction.' White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called Akil’s death 'a good outcome' and said he had 'American blood on his hands' for the embassy attack. 'You know, 1983 seems like a long time ago,' Sullivan said. 'But for a lot of families and a lot of people, they’re still living with it every day.' Wahbi was described as a commander who played major roles within Hezbollah for decades and was imprisoned in an Israeli jail in southern Lebanon in 1984. Hezbollah said he was one of the 'field commanders' during a 1997 ambush in southern Lebanon that left 12 Israeli troops dead. Hezbollah announced overnight that 15 of its operatives had been killed by Israeli forces, but it didn’t how or where they died. Meanwhile, the Israeli army spokesperson, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, said Saturday 16 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Friday’s strike. Israel airstrikes and Hezbollah rocket attacks continue It wasn’t immediately clear if anyone was killed or wounded in the back-and-forth attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on Saturday. The Israeli military confirmed that about 90 rockets had been fired at northern Israel and that Israel had struck more than 400 rocket launchers in Lebanon during the day. Expecting a surge in rocket attacks, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli defense spokesman, announced updated safety guidelines for areas north of Haifa, including caps on gatherings of 30 people in open spaces and 300 in enclosed spaces. Work and school can continue if people can reach protected areas in a timely manner. But since students and teachers in some places wouldn’t be able reach shelters in the required time, Sunday classes were canceled in at least two border regions within an hour of the announcement. Earlier this week, Israel’s security cabinet said stopping Hezbollah’s attacks on the country’s north, which would allow displaced residents to return to their homes, is now an official war goal, as Israel considers a wider military operation in Lebanon that could spark an all-out conflict. Israel has since sent a powerful fighting force to its northern border. Hezbollah has maintained that it will halt its strikes only when a cease-fire is reached between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire regularly since Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel ignited the Israeli military’s devastating offensive in Gaza. But previous cross-border attacks have largely struck areas in northern Israel that had been evacuated and less-populated parts of southern Lebanon. Hezbollah bombardments preceded the Israeli strike Friday's strike came hours after Hezbollah launched one of its most intense bombardments of northern Israel in nearly a year of fighting, largely targeting Israeli military sites. Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of the Katyusha rockets. The militant group said its latest wave of rocket salvos was a response to Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon. However, it came days after mass explosions of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies killed at least 37 people, including two children, and wounded roughly 3,000 others. Abiad, the Lebanese health minister, said Saturday that hospitals across the country were filled with the wounded. The pager and walkie-talkie attacks have been widely attributed to Israel, which hasn't confirmed or denied involvement. They marked a major escalation in the past 11 months of simmering conflict along the Israel-Lebanon border. ___ Associated Press writers Jack Jeffery and Natalie Melzer in Jerusalem, White House correspondent Zeke Miller in Wilmington, Delaware, and Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-the-death-toll-from-israeli-airstrike-on-a-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31/	2024-09-21T13:30:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24265302346271.jpg?w=900
Harris accepts invitation to second debate, urges Trump to join	WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Vice President Kamala Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN to participate in a debate on Oct. 23, her campaign said on Saturday. 'Donald Trump should have no problem agreeing to this debate. It is the same format and setup as the CNN debate he attended and said he won in June, when he praised CNN’s moderators, rules, and ratings,' campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/harris-accepts-invitation-to-second-debate-urges-trump-to-join/	2024-09-21T09:51:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24255043023737_fc8275.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr., Gabbard eye top roles in possible Trump administration	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard are angling for positions in a possible Trump administration, hoping to help spark an anti-establishment surge in Washington post-November. The two former Democrats, who have enthusiastically endorsed Trump’s Republican nomination for the White House, want to influence American policy issues ranging from health care and the environment to national security. They jumped on board with the former president after moving rightward following their own quixotic runs — Gabbard’s in 2020 and Kennedy’s in 2024. Gabbard, a military veteran who served as a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii before retiring, said this week that she would 'be honored to serve' under a second Trump term. She told Fox News that she’s hoping for a role working on foreign policy while stumping for him in Georgia. Kennedy, meanwhile, wants to help Trump dismantle and rebuild the public health care system and said his former rival has asked him to 'be involved in the administration at a high level.' The two are now headed for Nevada this weekend, hitting a third battleground after Arizona and Georgia, in the hopes that they will elevate Trump’s chances of success with voters in Las Vegas. The positive expectation-setting from Trump himself has excited Kennedy and Gabbard allies, who see them already helping to form a non-traditional coalition they hope can win less than two months from Election Day. 'I truly believe [Trump] will keep his word and not hose Kennedy,' said Eric Jackman, a senior adviser for the newly formed Kennedy-aligned Make America Healthy Again PAC, modeled after Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan. 'He understands he will need much better people around him, should he win. Having experienced hands like Bobby and Tulsi in Trump’s corner is an immense advantage and asset to his campaign and future administration,' he said. Jackman, a friend of Gabbard’s who has worked on issues supporting Kennedy this cycle, sees the former independent candidate’s strength now as guiding Trump to reach new audiences, including skeptical voters and independents. 'It’s been very exciting and encouraging to see how MAGA crowds are responding to Kennedy’s call for cleaning up our food, environment and government,' he said. Trump has famously attracted non-conformist characters into his orbit, many of whom have right-leaning sympathies. Kennedy and Gabbard’s swift emergence on the Republican scene is the latest extension of that. The two have bonded over anti-interventionism that also extends to what they perceive as other kinds of excessive government reach. For Gabbard, the military industrial complex is a particular focus, while Kennedy has channeled his advocacy against vaccines and modern science into a war on the nation’s disease crisis. Kennedy hasn’t explicitly said which position, if any, he would want the most if Trump wins, but those close to him, including his former vice-presidential nominee Nicole Shanahan, have suggested Health and Human Services as a possibility. 'They are helping to create a bridge for Independents and unhappy Democrats to the Trump campaign,' said Larry Sharpe, a political consultant with knowledge of Kennedy’s campaign. 'Many voters who are unhappy with the establishment have hope that both RFK and Gabbard will be able to make changes,' Sharpe said. Like others in Kennedy’s orbit, he suggested there’s a suitable place for them ahead of a possible government change-over, when Trump would theoretically usher in his own bench. 'Many hope that they both are on the transition team so they can make many changes to permanent Washington,' he said. The Hill reported earlier this month that nominating Kennedy for any Cabinet position would likely come with inherent challenges, especially tough battles for confirmation in the Senate if Democrats hold onto the upper chamber. Some Democratic strategists see the chances that either politician would make it to Washington as increasingly unlikely, given the fickle nature of Trump’s promises and personal alliances. There’s a growing disbelief among liberals that he would stay true to his word and offer top positions to the two ex-candidates. 'I don’t think it takes an advanced degree in psychology to observe that when it comes to Donald Trump loyalty is a one-way street. And his word is about as valuable as one of his bankrupt casinos,' said Doug Gordon, a Democratic strategist. 'The most likely outcome here is that Tulsi and RFK are simply the latest examples of people becoming useful idiots for Trump with nothing to show for it,' Gordon said. Kennedy and Gabbard have also faced scrutiny since taking on roles on the campaign. Ahead of the debate between Trump and Vice President Harris, the former president’s campaign commissioned Gabbard to prepare him with a mock performance, something that drew negative attention after the former president’s rocky debate. Gabbard delivered what supporters considered to be a blow to Harris in 2019, early into the last presidential campaign cycle, when both candidates competed in a debate in Michigan. Gabbard challenged Harris on her criminal justice record and was seen as putting Harris, a former prosecutor and California’s top cop as attorney general, on her toes at the time. She’s since taken an even more adversarial posture towards Harris while promoting Trump’s candidacy. 'President Trump did in his last administration what President Obama refused to do, what President Biden refused to do, what Kamala Harris has made clear she refuses to do — which is to go out and do that tough work that a president and commander in chief has to do in diplomacy,' Gabbard told Fox News, where she is a frequent guest. Trump’s debate performance, while widely perceived as poor, has seemingly done little to move the needle ahead of November. New polls released over the past few days show a close, if not statistically tied, race in almost all of the important swing states. Kennedy’s Democratic name also doesn’t appear to be hurting Trump. Post-endorsement, he has stayed within the margin of error against Harris. One Trump ally argued Kennedy is especially valuable because he has a built-in following and is the type of add-on who can single-handedly draw a crowd and media attention. He also follows the same adage as Trump that all press is good press. 'This is another interesting thing that the Trump team has going for them that I don’t think Team Kamala has going for them: Multiple people who can draw earned media,' the ally to the former president said. 'RFK is going to be on the trail. It wasn’t just an endorsement,' the source said.

Ex-Bad Boy Records rapper says Diddy 'destroyed' his life	(NewsNation) — A former Bad Boy Records rapper turned Belizean politician responds to the arrest of his former mentor and associate, Sean 'Diddy' Combs, with a harsh reality: 'This is someone that destroyed my life.' Moses 'Shyne' Barrow was 21 years old when he went to a New York City nightclub with Combs, who signed the up-and-coming rapper to his record label upon meeting in 1998. About a year later, Barrow was with Combs when his new boss and another man were arguing. Shots rang out, injuring three bystanders. Barrow was convicted in 2001 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Upon his release, he was deported to his native country of Belize. Barrow spoke to the media at a press conference on Sept. 18 in Belize when he made the comments in response to Diddy’s arrest two days prior. 'He pretty much sent me to prison,' he said at the conference. Ray J says industry still trying to ‘digest’ Diddy news The now-45-year-old is the Leader of the Opposition for the Belize House of Representatives, first becoming a member of the House in 2020. Born Jamal Michael Barrow, the rapper’s stage name was Shyne. A native of Belize, he moved to New York City with his mother as a child, and that’s where he met Diddy when his rap career took off in the late 1990s. 'Shyne' wrote and performed on several popular albums including Usher’s 'Confessions,' Lil Wayne’s 'Carter IV,' Notorious B.I.G’s 'Born Again' and Diddy’s (at the time Puff Daddy’s) 'Forever' (released three months before the 1999 shooting). In previous interviews, Barrow has said he was the 'fall guy' for the shooting but clarified that he doesn’t blame Combs. At the September press conference, he says he’s forgiven his former mentor, who he says he was never close enough to consider a 'brotherhood' with him.

(Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage via Getty Images) 'This is someone who, in a sense, testified against me when I was on trial, when I was an 18-year-old kid, just wanting to do nothing other than make my mom proud …' said Barrow, who has maintained his innocence from the start. 'This is someone who destroyed my life and who I forgave.' Combs’ then-girlfriend singer and actress Jennifer Lopez was with him the night of the shooting, and both were soon arrested after fleeing the scene. Neither were charged in connection to the shooting. Weighing in on Comb’s recent arrest, Barrow said, 'One of the things I would never wish on my worst enemy is to be incarcerated … so I take no joy in anyone’s challenges whether with the criminal justice system or otherwise.' J-Lo’s mom didn’t like Diddy: Video resurfaces 'Do I take satisfaction in what he is going through? Absolutely not,' he continued. Natania Reuben, one of the shooting victims, told NewsNation in March that she has spent the past 25 years trying to clear Barrow’s name.

Harris sees reasons for cautious optimism in Pennsylvania	Vice President Harris is seeing encouraging signs in Pennsylvania, a state that many see as the key battleground in the fight for the White House in November. Many recent polls have shown Harris holding a slim lead over former President Trump in the Keystone State, and she has a 53 percent chance to win the state in Decision Desk HQ and The Hill’s election forecast. But some polls also underscore just how close the race in Pennsylvania will be, with multiple surveys in recent days showing Harris and Trump tied there — underscoring how fierce the battle for the state’s 19 electoral votes will be. 'I would rather be where we are than where they are,' said Joe Corrigan, a Pennsylvania-based Democratic strategist. 'But nothing is over. It’s just all gas and no breaks until Nov. 5.' On Thursday, a Washington Post poll showed Harris ahead of Trump by 1 point, with a margin of error of 3.6 percentage points. A Franklin &amp; Marshall College poll released the same day found Harris leading Trump 49 percent to 46 percent, with a 4.1 point margin of error. Meanwhile, a Quinnipiac University poll out Thursday showed Harris up by 6 points in Pennsylvania with a margin of error of 2.7 points. The poll marks the first time either candidate has surpassed the 50 percent mark in the state this cycle. But a Marist survey out the same day showed the candidates deadlocked in the state with a margin of error of 3.1 points. Both campaigns are crisscrossing the state this weekend, with Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) attending events in Leesburg and Hershey on Saturday. On Sunday, second gentleman Doug Emhoff will travel to Bucks County, one of the state’s swing areas. David Urban, who was a senior adviser to Trump’s campaign in 2016, sounded an optimistic note about the former president’s chances in the Keystone State, but he acknowledged the closeness of the race. 'It is neck and neck,' Urban said. 'I like our chances still better than her chances in the state. I think if the election were held today, Trump would win, but again, I’m talking about win by 75,000 votes, win by 100,000 votes.' Urban noted that on the ground, the race feels more like it did in 2016 than in 2020, noting President Biden’s close ties to the state. And he pointed to questions about Harris’s policy stances as a weakness for her. 'You can say I am not going to ban fracking once, but you need to say it 300 times to kind of counter the 300 times you said it before,' Urban continued, referring to Harris’s reversal on the issue from when she ran for president in 2020. Fracking in Pennsylvania has been a particular focal point for Republicans in their attacks against Harris, particularly in the southwestern region, where it is a major industry. Harris told CNN last month her values 'have not changed' and that a thriving, clean energy economy can be achieved without banning fracking. 'People, when they come into new information, can come to conclusions that are different from the conclusions that they’ve held in the past,' Corrigan said, regarding Harris’s reversal. Democrats say they are cautiously optimistic about Harris’s standing in the polls and point to her favorability ratings over Trump. A Suffolk University poll found that 49 percent of likely Pennsylvania voters had a favorable view of Harris, while 47 percent said they had an unfavorable view. Trump, on the other hand, had a 43 percent favorability rating and a 54 percent unfavorable rating. 'If you look at the vice president’s favorability numbers in Pennsylvania, I think the fact she’s still above water speaks to the fact that people trust her more on any number of issues,' Corrigan said. Harris’s allies also tout what they say is a strong campaign infrastructure and presence in the state. The vice president made headlines last week when she made a campaign stop in Johnstown in the western portion of the state. The town is not considered as deeply red as the region it’s in, but it still underscores Harris’s strategy of seeking to chip away at Trump’s margins in Republican strongholds. The move is reminiscent of the 2022 midterms, when Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) and Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) waded into more rural, conservative parts of the state. 'Vice President Harris and Governor Walz would do well spending a few days in the interior of the Commonwealth,' said former Rep. Chris Carney (D-Pa), a senior policy adviser at Nossaman. 'There are gettable independent and blue dog votes there, but those voters need to see Harris and Walz, assess them up close, and develop some comfort with them. The voters there need to hear directly that a Harris administration will not end fracking, will not take away guns and will keep the nation secure.' Republicans argue the strategy employed by Shapiro and Fetterman in the state’s rural counties won’t play the same way two years later, noting Shapiro’s weak Republican opponent in state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R) and Fetterman’s connections with rural voters in the western part of the state. 'She can go to every rural community in the state and, bluntly, it’s not going to make much of a difference. She doesn’t connect with them. They don’t trust her,' a Pennsylvania-based GOP strategist and former gubernatorial candidate. Trump will seek to run up the margins in the state’s conservative and rural strongholds, while Harris will seek to maximize turnout in the state's most populated regions in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh areas. The race could come down to a handful of counties that voted for former President Obama in 2012 but flipped for Trump. Those counties include Erie, Luzerne, and Northampton. Trump retained Luzerne County in 2020, but lost Northampton and Erie in 2020. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll released earlier this week showed Harris leading Trump 50 percent to 45 percent in Northampton and 48 percent to 44 percent in Erie. While the poll numbers looks good for her, many Republicans are still expressing skepticism that she will resonate with voters in the Keystone State. 'With Kamala Harris, there’s lots of question marks,' said Urban, the GOP strategist. 'What people know of her is what they saw in the 2020 campaign.'

Trump's shutdown push falls flat with Republicans	House Republicans are overwhelmingly dismissing former President Trump’s calls for a government shutdown in the absence of a proof-of-citizenship voting bill being signed into law, a public break from the GOP presidential nominee in the lead-up to the November election. A group of Republicans this week rejected a bill that combined a six-month continuing resolution (CR) with the Trump-backed voting bill, tanking the legislation in a move that thwarted Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) funding strategy. Now, as the Speaker prepares to defy Trump’s wishes and stage a vote on a 'clean' three-month stopgap, rank-and-file Republicans are expected to back it — balking at the former president’s request. Republicans almost universally support the voting bill, but they say pushing the issue so intensely that it results in a shutdown would backfire on the party. 'Everybody wants to go home and campaign, and there are some, particularly that want to go home and campaign, because they're in really tough races,' Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) said. The Alabama Republican, who currently serves as policy chair of the House GOP conference, also pointed to national security concerns. 'A government shutdown would embolden our enemies, further undermine our reliability and respect among our allies,' Palmer said. 'So, I don't think a shutdown is good for anybody.' Trump for weeks has urged House Republicans to pair government funding with a conservative voting bill. Johnson fulfilled that request with his opening salvo in the government funding talks. The former president, however, amped up his request last week, urging Republicans to shut down the government if they did not secure 'absolute assurances on Election Security.' And he reiterated that position Wednesday, hours before the House rejected the six-month stopgap-plus-SAVE Act. 'If Republicans don’t get the SAVE Act, and every ounce of it, they should not agree to a Continuing Resolution in any way, shape, or form,' Trump posted on Truth Social, adding: 'BE SMART, REPUBLICANS, YOU’VE BEEN PUSHED AROUND LONG ENOUGH BY THE DEMOCRATS. DON’T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN. Remember, this is Biden/Harris’ fault, not yours!' Trump’s pleas contrasted with the strategy among GOP lawmakers, who saw the CR-plus-SAVE Act as an opening offer — and a way to play into Trump’s past false stolen election claims and repeated skepticism of the voting system — but knew it would not be the measure that prevented a shutdown. Even if the lower chamber passed it, the Democratic-controlled Senate and White House — which point out that it is already illegal for noncitizens to vote and expressed concern about burdening eligible voters — never would have accepted it. Republicans believe the blame for any shutdown would be placed on their own shoulders, not the Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), for example, called a government shutdown at this juncture 'politically beyond stupid' and predicted the GOP would bear responsibility for allowing the lights to turn off in Washington. House Republicans are echoing that sentiment. 'I don't know that a shutdown really helps us right now, and what we're trying to accomplish — keep the majority, win the White House,' said Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), chair of the Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative caucus in the House. Rep. Dave Joyce (R-Ohio), a subcommittee chair on the House Appropriations Committee, sounded a similar note while zeroing in on the looming election. 'Closing down the government during this process is not a good idea for anyone involved, certainly for our government, certainly for momentum going into an election,' Joyce said. 'I think it's important that we stay open and get through this election and then make decisions in November and December.' The insistence from Trump, nonetheless, is complicating the GOP’s path to averting a shutdown at the end of the month as House GOP leaders move on to their plan B: A clean, short-term stopgap until December. Johnson is now in the delicate position of managing the expectations of the former president, with whom he has kept a good relationship — and whose support he will likely need to remain Speaker next year if Republicans win the House. The Speaker has spoken to Trump about the current government funding fight, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to The Hill. Punchbowl News first reported the conversations. Johnson met with Trump in Washington on Thursday night — the second gathering of the two leaders in a week. The Speaker would not detail their discussion, but he did say the former president 'understands the situation' House Republicans are currently in. 'I’ve had a lot of conversations with President Trump, and I won’t divulge all of them, but he understands the situation that we’re in, and he is doggedly determined to ensure that election security remains a top priority,' Johnson told reporters Friday. 'And I am as well, which is why I put the SAVE Act with CR.' 'We want to make sure that everybody understands, it is illegal to vote if you’re a noncitizen,' he continued. 'And we’re gonna press that at every opportunity, we’ll use every vehicle coming out of this chamber and every platform that we have to make this message loud and clear.' Johnson’s office, meanwhile, has continued to put out messaging on the SAVE Act vote, noting that 206 House Democrats voted against the bill requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. Friday morning, he posted a photo of Trump’s Truth Social message that read: 'IF YOU VOTE ILLEGALLY, YOU’RE GOING TO JAIL.' Asked about Trump’s shutdown calls or the prospects of a funding lapse, the Speaker has sought to tamp down concern. In a CNBC interview Wednesday before the failed six-month CR vote, Johnson said 'no one needs to worry' about a shutdown. Later in the day on Fox News after the vote failed, Johnson said: 'I don't think it's going to come to a shutdown. I believe we can get this job done.' Not every Republican, however, is resistant to a shutdown, with some fiscal hawks wishing the Speaker would have used the threat of a shutdown as a real leverage point to pressure Democrats to swallow the SAVE Act. 'He still has an aversion to any kind of shutdown,' Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) said of Johnson. 'Trump is saying, have a shutdown. And just hadn't happened. We got to fight at some point.' Norman added that he did not 'buy' the idea that vulnerable House Republicans could be threatened by a government shutdown. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), lead sponsor of the SAVE Act and major proponent of pairing it with a stopgap, also said Republicans should not shy away from a shutdown. 'Everybody knows that I’m certainly comfortable with fighting and having a shutdown to force the question on whether or not we’re gonna fund government at the right levels, which means cutting spending, and make sure that we ensure that only citizens vote,' said Roy, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. 'I’d be happy to do that. But you got to have the votes to go do it.' But those most involved with the intricacies of government funding strongly disagree. 'We can't have a shutdown,' said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), another appropriator. 'A shutdown would be catastrophic for our national defense, for our economy.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-shutdown-push-falls-flat-with-republicans/	2024-09-21T04:40:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/trump-shutdown_brooks_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
Trump says 'Jewish people would have a lot to do' with his loss '...	Former President Trump, speaking at two events raising awareness for combating antisemitism, is telegraphing that a loss in the 2024 presidential election largely would be blamed on the American Jewish vote. The Republican presidential nominee lashed out at what he said is 40 percent support among the Jewish American community in the U.S., saying the 60 percent polled who favor Kamala Harris are voting for the 'enemy.' 'In my opinion, the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss, if I’m at 40 percent,' Trump said during a campaign event at an event called 'Fighting Antisemitism' and hosted by Israeli American Republican mega-donor Miriam Adelson, at the Hyatt Regency Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. After the event, Trump was the keynote speaker at the Israeli American Conference, also a beneficiary of Adelson, where he repeated similar comments. 'If I don’t win this election — and Jewish people would have a lot to do with that, 60 percent are voting for the enemy — Israel will cease to exist in two years,' Trump said to a favorable and receptive crowd. 'I believe I’m 100 percent right. … If I do win, Israel will be safe and secure, and we’ll stop the toxic poison of antisemitism.' The comments drew quick criticism from supporters of Vice President Harris and raised warnings among leaders in the Jewish community. 'Treating Jews and Israel as political footballs makes Jews, Israel, and all of us less safe,' Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said in a statement to The Forward. 'Dividing Jews into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ camps and engaging in dual loyalty tropes further normalizes antisemitism. Anyone who cares about Jewish safety should call it out,' she added. 'This is not partisan politics — it’s about the fundamental safety of the Jewish community.' 'If any other national politician said: 'the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss' - to preemptively blame Jews for a potential loss- their career &amp; candidacy would be over. How people continue to ignore this is scary,' Alyssa Farah Griffin, a onetime Trump administration official who has become an outspoken critic of the former president, posted on the social platform X. 'Donald Trump is now saying that the ‘Jewish people’ will be to blame if he loses this election. This is vile and dangerous and should be condemned by all Americans. Antisemitic rhetoric like this makes Jews less safe,' Andrew Weinstein, a Jewish Democrat from South Florida who served as a delegate to the United Nations for the Biden administration, posted on X. Likewise, Common Defense, a grassroots organization of U.S. military veterans, described Trump’s remarks as 'antisemitic rhetoric' that 'puts Jewish lives at risk.' 'Donald Trump is now saying the 'Jewish people' will be to blame if he loses the election. This is disgusting and, more importantly, dangerous. Antisemitic rhetoric like this puts Jewish lives at risk, and all Americans should be outraged,' the group said in a statement on X.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-says-jewish-people-would-have-a-lot-to-do-with-his-loss-if-that-happens/	2024-09-20T17:23:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24256801720496-e1726180709936.jpg?w=900
Kentucky sheriff who shot judge 'angry' in deposition: Lawyer	(NewsNation) — Sheriff Shawn M. Stines allegedly shot and killed District Judge Kevin Mullins in Letcher County, Kentucky, on Thursday. As the rural community processes the incident, more details are emerging about Stines' ongoing legal battles and his disposition in the days leading up to the shooting. Stines faces a civil lawsuit, filed by lawyer Ned Pillersdorf, alleging he ignored one of his subordinate's sexual abuse toward women on house arrest. The suit accuses Stines of 'deliberate indifference in failing to adequately train and supervise' the deputy, Ben Fields, CBS reports. Body found off Kentucky interstate identified as Joseph Couch 'In return for not reporting them for violating the terms of their probation, they would give sexual favors. Fields did that to approximately three women,' Pillersdorf said. Some of the abuses happened in Mullins' chambers, according to the attorney's client. 'The tie-in to Judge Mullins is, according to the plaintiff ... the sexual encounters occurred in the judge's chambers,' he said, later clarifying that at least one sexual encounter happened in the chambers itself and another in its bathroom. Earlier this year, Fields left the department, pleaded guilty to rape among other counts and was sentenced to six months in jail followed by 6 1/2 years on probation. The judge in that case was not Mullins but rather a judge from nearby Pike County. 84-year-old Mississippi minister robbed, beaten with rifle When asked if the civil suit has anything to do with Thursday's incident — or whether Judge Mullins knew about the abuse in his chambers — Pillsersdorf said there is no way to know right now. 'Pure speculation. I don't know ... whether the lawsuit we filed had anything to do with the bizarre encounter and shocking killing, no telling,' he told NewsNation. 'There's certainly been a lot of social media chatter, but no telling.' Pillersdorf confirmed that during Stines' eight-hour deposition Monday, just days before the shooting, the sheriff appeared to be angry, agitated and defensive. How was Kevin Mullins killed? This undated photo provided by Kentucky Court of Justice shows slain District Judge Kevin Mullins. (Kentucky Court of Justice via AP) Stines allegedly walked into the judge’s outer office, then told court employees and others gathered there that he needed to speak with Mullins alone, according to The Mountain Eagle. Shortly after the two walked into the judge’s chambers, shots were heard. Then, Stines walked out with his hands up and surrendered to police. State police say measures were made to attempt to save Mullins’ life, but none were successful. No other injuries were reported, according to NewsNation local affiliate WJHL.

Robinson won't be at Trump's North Carolina rally Saturday	North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson (R) will not be in attendance when former President Trump rallies supporters in the state Saturday, a source told The Hill. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Wilmington, two days after a bombshell CNN report about posts Robinson made on an online pornography forum between 2008 and 2012, including that he supported slavery and called himself a 'Black Nazi.' The former president has endorsed Robinson, who has vowed to stay in the race despite widespread criticism over his past remarks. Trump himself has not yet weighed in on Robinson since the latest report on his incendiary past remarks. The former president previously compared Robinson to Martin Luther King Jr., and Robinson was given a prominent speaking slot at July's GOP convention. Robinson attended a Trump rally in North Carolina in August. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign issued a statement that did not mention Robinson but called North Carolina a 'vital part' of the plan for winning the White House. 'We are confident that as voters compare the Trump record of a strong economy, low inflation, a secure border, and safe streets, with the failures of Biden-Harris, then President Trump will win the Tar Heel State once again. We will not take our eye off the ball,' national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. Republicans had already expressed concerns about Robinson’s viability as a candidate given the many controversial and derogatory statements he has made about various groups, including women and Jewish people. But the newest allegations further mire Robinson in controversy, with polls already showing him down by double digits to Democratic candidate Josh Stein, the state's attorney general. North Carolina will also be a pivotal state in determining the outcome of November's presidential election. Trump narrowly carried the state in 2020, but a Decision Desk HQ/The Hill average of polls from the state show Vice President Harris leading by 3.6 percentage points.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/robinson-wont-be-at-trumps-north-carolina-rally-saturday/	2024-09-20T12:46:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Robinson-Trump-09.20.png?w=900
RFK Jr., Olivia Nuzzi's reported relationship reviewed by NY Mag	(NewsNation) — New York Magazine has confirmed Washington correspondent Olivia Nuzzi is on leave after admitting to a 'personal relationship' with a previous subject she covered. In a statement to its readers Thursday night, New York Magazine said the relationship was with an individual 'relevant to the 2024 campaign.' 'Recently our Washington Correspondent Olivia Nuzzi acknowledged to the magazine’s editors that she had engaged in a personal relationship with a former subject relevant to the 2024 campaign while she was reporting on the campaign, a violation of the magazine’s standards around conflicts of interest and disclosures,' the statement read. 'Had the magazine been aware of this relationship, she would not have continued to cover the presidential campaign. An internal review of her published work has found no inaccuracies nor evidence of bias. She is currently on leave from the magazine, and the magazine is conducting a more thorough third-party review. We regret this violation of our readers’ trust.' Secret Service details failures preceding July Trump shooting Reporter Olivia Nuzzi arrives for the White House Correspondents' Association dinner at the Washington Hilton in Washington, DC, April 29, 2023. Nuzzi provided a statement of her own to Status, who first broke the news. It reported former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the subject with whom Nuzzi allegedly had a personal relationship. She told The New York Times on Thursday that 'some communication between myself and a former reporting subject turned personal' earlier in 2024. 'During that time, I did not directly report on the subject nor use them as a source,' Nuzzi told the outlet. 'The relationship was never physical but should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict. 'I deeply regret not doing so immediately and apologize to those I’ve disappointed, especially my colleagues at New York.' A Kennedy representative has told multiple outlets, including the Times, 'Mr. Kennedy only met Olivia Nuzzi once in his life for an interview she requested, which yielded a hit piece.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ny-mag-relationship-reporter-rfk-jr/	2024-09-20T10:50:09-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/RFK-HHS_090624_AP_Evan-Vucci_2a0d9a-e1725643840297.jpg?w=900
Live: Secret Service update on July Trump assassination attempt	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Communication breakdowns with local law enforcement hampered the U.S. Secret Service's performance ahead of the July attempt on former President Donald Trump’s life, according to a new report that lays out a series of missed opportunities to stop the gunman who opened fire from an unsecured roof. A five-page document summarizing the Secret Service report's key conclusions finds fault with both local and federal law enforcement, underscoring the cascading and wide-ranging failings that preceded the July 13 shooting at a Butler, Pennsylvania, campaign rally where Trump was wounded in the ear by gunfire. What went wrong? The report details a series of 'communications deficiencies' before the shooting by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot by a Secret Service counter-sniper after firing eight rounds in Trump's direction from the roof of a building less than 150 yards from where Trump was speaking. It makes clear that the Secret Service knew even before the shooting that the rally site posed a security challenge. Among the problems: Some local police at the site were unaware of the existence of two communications centers on the grounds, meaning officers did not know that the Secret Service was not receiving their radio transmission. Law enforcement also communicated vital information outside the Secret Service's radio frequencies. As officers searched for Crooks before the shooting, details were being transmitted 'via mobile/cellular devices in staggered or fragmented fashion' instead of through the Secret Service's own network. What is the Secret Service doing about it? The report's executive summary does not identify specific individuals who may be to blame nor does it indicate whether any staff members have been disciplined, though The Secret Service's investigation is one of numerous inquiries, including by Congress and a watchdog probe by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general office.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/secret-service-update-on-july-trump-assassination-attempt/	2024-09-20T09:52:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/66953219a7aff4.02450292.jpeg?w=900
$100 million judgment against Sean 'Diddy' Combs set aside	(NewsNation) — A $100 million judgment against hip-hop mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs was set aside by a Michigan judge this week after it was determined that a lawsuit claiming Combs sexually assaulted a man in 1997 was not properly served. The judge set aside the judgment against Combs — who remains behind bars on sex trafficking and racketeering charges in New York — after also ruling the man who brought it would likely not prevail due to the statute of limitations on sexual assault. The Michigan case stems from a 1997 incident that led Derrick Lee Cardello-Smith to file a civil lawsuit against Combs in June. Cardello-Smith is currently serving up to 75 years in prison after he was sentenced in 2008 on first-degree criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping charges, the Detroit Free Press reported. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs is ‘on suicide watch’: Former inmate The lawsuit claims Combs drugged and then sexually assaulted Cardello-Smith as other consensual sex involving women was taking place, according to media reports. Cardello-Smith claims Combs sexually assaulted him during a party at a hotel in 1997 before the two men, along with high-ranking Michigan law enforcement officials and other police officers, conspired not to prosecute Combs for the assault. The newspaper reported that Cardello-Smith would go to prison for 14 sexual assaults allegedly committed by Combs to protect his family from harm by Combs’ representatives or law enforcement. Earlier this month, a judge awarded Cardello-Smith the $100 million judgment against Combs after the rap mogul didn't show up in court to contend the case. The judge also issued a temporary restraining order that prevented Combs from selling any personal assets that he could use to pay for the judgment. However, this week, the judge ruled the lawsuit was not properly served. The lawsuit was mailed to a home that Combs owns in Los Angeles, but the judge ruled it was not mailed in compliance with court rules, the Free Press reported. Who else could be charged in the Diddy investigation? The law does not require lawsuits to be delivered to a potential defendant’s primary address but does require the sender to mail the lawsuit for restricted delivery. In court this week, Cardello-Smith, who is representing himself in the case, told Combs’ lawyer to tell his client that the matter was not resolved. According to Metro Times in Detroit, Cardello-Smith told the court he would file a motion to reconsider this week’s ruling. The judge has set a Nov. 4 hearing in the case.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/100-million-judgment-diddy-aside/	2024-09-20T08:57:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/GettyImages-1780945546_5cf865.jpg?w=900
House unanimously passes bill to bolster Trump’s security after a...	The House unanimously passed a bill on Friday that seeks to bolster former President Trump’s security, the first legislative move the chamber has made in response to the second apparent assassination attempt against the Republican presidential nominee. The House cleared the legislation — titled the Enhanced Presidential Security Act — in a bipartisan 405-0 vote, sending it to the Senate for consideration. It's unclear if the upper chamber plans to consider the measure, though similar legislation has been proposed by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.). House Republican leadership staged a vote on the legislation less than one week after a Secret Service spotted a gunman — later identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58 — hiding among trees and sticking a rifle through the fence at the Trump International Golf Club, where the former president was playing. A security team conducting a screening of the holes Trump was approaching spotted the gunman and fired shots at Routh, who fled the scene and was later arrested by local authorities. It was the second attempt on Trump’s life within 60 days. In July, a gunman opened fire at the former president’s rally in Butler, Pa., piercing Trump’s ear and leaving him bloodied on stage. The bill — introduced by Reps. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) and Ritchie Torres (R-N.Y.) after the first assassination attempt — requires the Secret Service to 'apply the same standards' for determining how many agents should be used to protect the president, vice president, and those running for those offices. The Secret Service has not commented on the pending legislation, but the purpose of the bill seems to clash with their own contention that Trump and Harris now have the highest levels of security. 'President Biden made it clear that he wanted the highest levels of protection for former President Trump and for Vice President Harris. Secret Service moved to sustain increases in assets and the level of protection … and those things were in place yesterday,' acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told reporters Monday. 'The President is aware that he has the highest levels of protection that Secret Service is providing him. …There’s a lot of tactical assets in place, things that have been put in place as a result of what happened 60 days ago. Those elements are working,' he added. The sitting president has the support of a vast infrastructure that includes the military to support the Secret Service posture. Candidates, meanwhile, have their Secret Service protection supplemented by local law enforcement. Trump has the same counter surveillance and counter sniper teams afforded to sitting presidents, along with protective intelligence and drone teams. Still, the president travels with other non-Secret Service assets, including those related to the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. The House voted on the legislation Friday as Congress continues to debate to provide the Secret Service with additional funding following the pair of assassination attempts. While some leaders have floated a funding increase, other lawmakers — including Johnson — have suggested that the issue is one of manpower allocation and not funding. The Speaker did, however, say he would be prepared to provide the agency with more money if deemed necessary. 'We have got to get down to the bottom of this. We got to ensure that this doesn't happen again,' Johnson said this week. 'If they need additional funding, Congress will supply that. But we're told it's a manpower problem.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/house-unanimously-passes-bill-to-bolster-trumps-security-after-apparent-assassination-attempt/	2024-09-20T08:30:09-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/trumpdonald_091924gn07_w.jpg?w=900
Three governors races to watch this November	(NewsNation) — As the 2024 general election comes into view, there are three gubernatorial races Americans should keep their eyes on: New Hampshire, North Carolina and Washington State. The incumbent governors in all three states have decided not to seek reelection this fall, leaving their seats wide open for a new name and potential party upset. In each of the three states, the close governor races could determine which way the state leans politically. When does early voting begin in my state?

(DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images) New Hampshire's Republican Gov. Chris Sununu has chosen not to seek a fifth term as governor, with the state being one of two where a governor is elected every two years. As a result, the seat is now up for grabs and has morphed into one of the few competitive governor races this year. The state has historically voted blue, with Democrats making up all four members of its Congressional delegation. But Republican Sununu also scored four terms as governor and Republicans hold the edge in the state legislature. The outgoing governor backed former Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who lost her Senate seat in 2016 to Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. Ayotte will face Democrat Joyce Craig, who served as mayor of Manchester and was backed by Hassan and Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey.

(Photo by Grant Baldwin/Getty Images) A potentially historic governor’s race pits North Carolina’s centrist tendencies against the rise of populist conservatism in the era of former President Donald Trump's Republican party. The Republican nominee is Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a 55-year-old who, if he wins, would be the state’s first Black governor. Democrats have chosen Attorney General Josh Stein, a 57-year-old who is trying to keep the office in his party’s control after two terms under outgoing Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Most polls in recent months have shown Stein leading Robinson, an ally of Trump who has drawn criticism for his past rhetoric on everything from abortion to the civil rights movement. Some Republicans fear Robinson’s controversial persona could cost them the governor’s mansion — and the challenge will be even tougher for him as Vice President Harris has seemingly made inroads in the state as well. Meanwhile, the state is also a must-win for Trump if he is to make it back to the White House in January. On Thursday, Robinson continued to come under fire after CNN published an article claiming he made disturbing racial and sexual comments on a pornography forum. Amid calls for him to step out of the race, Robinson defiantly announced in a video on X that he planned on staying in the race and denied the claims made in the article.

(Photo by Scott J. Ferrell/Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images) Washington has voted Democrats into the governor’s mansion since the mid-1980s, but this year, the race for Washington state's governor has emerged as unexpectedly competitive. Gov. Jay Inslee’s decision to retire attracted a crowded field of candidates for the state’s nonpartisan primary, from which Washington's Democratic Attorney General Bob Ferguson and former Republican Rep. Dave Reichert advanced to the November ballot. Ferguson, who’s been the state’s top attorney for more than a decade, has Inslee’s endorsement to succeed him. Reichert, a former sheriff, snagged recognition among constituents for helping catch Washington State’s 'Green River Killer.' Cook Political Report shifted the seat from 'solid' to 'likely' Democrat in February, and then again to 'lean' Democrat in June. After the primary, and after Harris launched her campaign, the race shifted back to 'likely' blue. But the election handicapper noted Reichert 'still has a path' to flipping the state. One Cygnal poll from late August found Ferguson up just three points.

Live: Titan hearing resumes with mission specialist testimony	(NewsNation) — The Titan submersible hearing is scheduled to resume Friday with testimony from another mission specialist who went on a dive aboard the OceanGate vessel that imploded last year while on its way to the wreckage of the Titanic. Mission specialist Fred Hagen is scheduled to be the first to testify Friday. Other witnesses have characterized mission specialists as people who paid a fee to play a role in OceanGate’s underwater explorations. The Coast Guard's investigatory panel has listened to three days of testimony that raised questions about the company’s operations before the doomed mission. The public hearing is part of a high-level investigation into the cause of the implosion. OceanGate co-founder and CEO Stockton Rush was among five people who died when the submersible imploded en route to the site of the Titanic wreck in June 2023. Earth will soon have a 'second moon' — sort of What has been learned so far? Mission specialist Renata Rojas was the latest person to testify before the investigatory panel Thursday. Rojas refuted testimony from previous witness David Lochridge regarding the OceanGate mission to the wreck of the Andrea Doria. She said that while the submersible did crash into the side of the wreck, there was no panicking or crying from passengers as Lochridge described. Lochridge labeled the experimental submersible unsafe before its last, fatal voyage. During questioning about her role in various dives, Rojas described the role she and other passengers played. She also likened the project to NASA's Apollo program of the 1960s, saying it was 'testing by doing.' In an emotional closing statement, Rojas said the loss of her friends was still very raw but 'exploration takes risks' and she hopes the implosion does not dampen innovation or other projects involving citizen scientists. On Monday, witnesses painted a picture of a troubled company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident sparked a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration. OceanGate said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began. The Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021. OceanGate Scientific Director Steven Ross also testified before the hearing wrapped Thursday. More witnesses are expected to testify with the hearing set to continue into next week.

The loss of communication launched a four-day search for the vessel, which ended when evidence of an implosion was found on the ocean floor. Officials concluded that the craft had been destroyed and all five people on board were killed. Few vessels dive that deep into the ocean, and engineers and experts in the field noted previous problems with the Titan as well as warnings that the submersible was unsafe. The search-and-recovery mission is estimated to have cost up to $1.6 million. The Coast Guard quickly convened a high-level investigation into what happened. Concerns leading up to the investigation included the Titan’s unconventional design and its creator’s decision to forgo standard independent checks. The investigation into the Titan implosion originally had a 12-month timeline but has been extended multiple times. In addition to Rush, the implosion killed two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.

Who is Judge Kevin Mullins?	(NewsNation) — A longtime judge in a rural county courtroom that deals with mostly minor crimes, Kevin Mullins was killed by the sheriff of the county they both served, according to the Kentucky State Police. Here is what we know. What was Mullins' background? Kevin R. Mullins, 54, had been a District Judge in Letcher County, Kentucky for 15 years. Before that, he was a prosecutor in Letcher County, starting in 2001. The official title is assistant commonwealth’s attorney. He was a graduate of the University of Kentucky and the Louis D. Brandeis School of Law at the University of Louisville. As a district judge of the 47th Judicial District, Mullins handled juvenile cases, misdemeanors, issues involving city and county ordinances, traffic offenses, probate of wills, arraignments, small claims, civil cases involved $5,000 or less, mental commitments and cases involving domestic violence. Diddy’s ‘life’ potentially at risk at Brooklyn jail: Former warden How was Mullins killed? Stines allegedly walked into the judge’s outer office, then told court employees and others gathered there that he needed to speak with Mullins alone, according to The Mountain Eagle. Shortly after the two walked into the judge’s chambers, shots were heard. Then Stines walked out with his hands up and surrendered to police officers. State police say measures were made to attempt to save Mullins' life but none were successful. No other injuries were reported, according to NewsNation affiliate WJHL. Who is Mickey Stines? Shawn M. 'Mickey' Stines, 43, the sheriff in Letcher County, was first elected in 2018, then reelected in 2022. His department was hit with a scandal in 2022 when a former deputy, Ben Fields, pleaded guilty to raping two women who were on home arrest, according to The Mountain Eagle. In a pending civil suit against the former deputy, the home monitoring service that employed him and Sheriff Stines, the women say that Stines did not sufficiently train and supervise Fields. In August, Fields was sentenced to serve six months in the same jail where he used to work. The judge in that case was not Mullins, but rather a judge from nearby Pike County. Florida sheriff fed up with school shooting hoaxes posts boy’s mugshot to social media When did Mullins become a judge? Mullins was appointed in 2009 by Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, and was elected in his own right a year later, according to The Mountain Eagle. He has been reelected ever since. Mullins’ death was confirmed by the current governor, Andy Beshear, son of Steve Beshear. Beshear posted on X that there is 'far too much violence in this world, and I pray there is a path to a better tomorrow.' Where did Kevin Mullins die?

North Carolina lt. gov. vows to stay in governor’s race	(NewsNation) — North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, who is also the Republican nominee in the governor’s race, is strongly denying allegations about his character, but he did not specify which allegations he disputes. 'Well, guys, the news media is at it again. My opponent is at it again,' Robinson said in a post on his X page. 'Our opponents are desperate to shift the focus from the substantive issues … to salacious tabloid trash.' CNN first reported Thursday that Robinson made a series of inflammatory comments on a porn site’s message board more than 10 years ago, referring to himself as a 'black NAZI!' He also, according to CNN, 'expressed support for reinstating slavery.' Trump vows to travel to Springfield following false pet-eating claims Later Thursday, Politico reported that an email address belonging to Robinson was registered on Ashley Madison, the dating website for married people. Politico said that an adviser to Robinson confirmed that the address belonged to the lieutenant governor, who is married. 'The things that you will see in that story, those are not the words of Mark Robinson,' he continued in his X post. 'You know my words. You know my character. And you know that I have been completely transparent in this race and before.' In response to questions from NewsNation local affiliate WNCN posed before the CNN report, Robinson spokesperson Mike Lonergan wrote in an email, 'Where on earth did you hear this absurd nonsense?

Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson staying in North Carolina race amid bombsh...	RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) – Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (R) is facing pressure from within the Republican Party to suspend his campaign for governor. The pressure began in anticipation of a story that would expose a series of controversial comments made by Robinson on a pornographic website. The comments, which were reported first by CNN, were posted prior to Robinson's time in politics to a website called 'Nude Africa.' As the report shows, the comments were lewd and sexual in nature and included a reference to himself as a 'black NAZI!' Trump vows to travel to Springfield following false pet-eating claims Comments from the account that's been linked to Robinson in several ways also said 'slavery is not bad' and 'I would certainly buy a few.' Further comments such as 'I like watching tranny on girl porn!' and 'I'm a ‘perv’ too!' were also found in the CNN investigation linking the comments to the gubernatorial candidate. Robinson had campaign events scheduled on Thursday but they were cancelled. He also did not attend Wednesday’s rally with Sen. JD Vance in Raleigh. Ballots are scheduled to begin being mailed out to military and overseas voters on Friday. In response to questions from CBS 17 about the status of Robinson’s campaign—and before the CNN report—spokesman Mike Lonergan wrote in an email, 'Where on earth did you hear this absurd nonsense? Is the press just making stuff up out of whole cloth now?' Teamsters skip presidential endorsement for first time since 1996 Sources who’ve spoken to CBS 17 say it’s unclear what Robinson will do, but Republicans are discussing what will happen in the event he does indeed exit the race. In response to mounting pressure, the following video was put out by Mark Robinson on X. In it, he vows to stay in the race. He also calls the news media his 'opponent,' and refers to the expected story coming out about him as 'salacious tabloid trash.' 'The things that you will see in that story—those are not the words of Mark Robinson. You know my words, you know my character, and you know that I have been completely transparent in this race and before,' Robinson added. Under state law, if Robinson were to drop out and his name remained on the ballot, any votes cast for him would go to the person chosen by the state’s executive committee. CBS 17 also learned Thursday that the lieutenant governor’s office at the state legislative building had been cleared out. A spokesperson for Republican Senate leader Phil Berger’s office said the lieutenant governor’s staff had been notified of that 'weeks ago.' Harris, Trump neck and neck in 7 swing states: Poll 'As part of the preparations for the next biennium, Senate leadership is evaluating the space allocations in both the Legislative Building and the Legislative Office Building. Since the Lt. Governor has a formal office within walking distance of the legislature, it was determined that his designated space in the Legislative Building could be converted to a meeting space for legislators. The Lt. Governor’s staff was notified weeks ago and did not raise any concerns about the space being repurposed,' wrote Lauren Horsch in an email. NC Republican reaction In an interview with NewsNation, Sen. Ted Budd (R-NC) was asked if he was concerned about Robinson. 'The allegations are concerning but we don't have any facts,' Budd said. 'We're going to wait through the weekend and get everything together.' A statement has also been released by NC Senate nominee Scott Lassiter, formally calling for Robinson to suspend his campaign. Voters weigh switch to open primaries amid concerns over political polarization 'As a proud Republican, I stand for hard work, fiscal responsibility, and liberty. But no one should feel obligated to support a candidate solely due to party affiliation,' Lassiter stated, 'Wrong is still wrong, and if the recent allegations against Robinson are true, combined with his previous public rhetoric, I believe it’s time for him to step aside. North Carolinians deserve a viable choice in this election.' Robinson's endorsement from Trump Earlier this year, on March 3, Former President Donald Trump endorsed Robinson in his hometown, Greensboro. In that speech, he compared him to Martin Luther King, Jr. In response, a statement from the Robinson campaign said, 'I look forward to partnering with him take on the failed Biden-Stein agenda, lead our united Republican ticket to victory in November, and get our state and country back on track.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/north-carolina-lt-gov-mark-robinson/	2024-09-19T13:41:09-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/801F721F5EF52BDA1790C0940FF7196B_3.jpg?w=900
Teamsters skip presidential endorsement for first time since 1996	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The International Brotherhood of Teamsters will not issue an endorsement in the presidential election for the first time since 1996 and for only the third time since 1960. Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien said, 'Neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before Big Business. 'We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries — and to honor our members’ right to strike — but were unable to secure those pledges,' O’Brien said. Voters weigh switch to open primaries amid concerns over political polarization The Teamsters endorsed President Biden during the 2020 election and has consistently supported Democratic presidential nominees in recent election cycles. Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt noted in an emailed statement that more than three dozen retired Teamsters spoke last month in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention, having endorsed Harris. Their pensions were saved through the 2021 passage of the Butch Lewis Act that President Joe Biden and Harris championed. 'While Donald Trump says striking workers should be fired, Vice President Harris has literally walked the picket line and stood strong with organized labor for her entire career,' Hitt said. 'The Vice President’s strong union record is why Teamsters locals across the country have already endorsed her — alongside the overwhelming majority of organized labor.' Democrats bullish on flipping New Hampshire governor’s mansion The Teamsters said Wednesday that internal polling of members showed Trump with an advantage over Harris, a fact that the Republican's campaign immediately seized upon by sending out an email that said the 'rank-and-file of the Teamsters Union supports Donald Trump for President.' Trump called the Teamsters’ decision not to endorse 'a great honor.' 'It’s a great honor,' he said. 'They’re not going to endorse the Democrats. That’s a big thing.'

Texas pipeline explosion investigators find human remains	(NewsNation) — Texas authorities investigating a pipeline explosion near Houston this week have found human remains inside a white vehicle that traveled through a white fence and struck an above-ground valve and are treating the matter as a criminal investigation, officials said Thursday. The Deer Park Fire Department said investigators were able to access the site of the explosion and remove the vehicle that was involved. Investigators found human remains inside the vehicle and have started the identification process. Officials said that the process will take time. Would-be Florida car burglar gets trapped in Corvette, video shows Deer Park officials said Wednesday that police and local FBI agents initiated investigations and found no preliminary reports that would suggest a coordinated or 'terrorist' attack and that 'this appears to be an isolated incident,' The Associated Press reported. The probe included efforts to learn more about the driver of a vehicle that was incinerated by the explosion as flames scorched the ground across a wide radius, severed adjacent power transmission lines and ignited homes at a distance. Before Thursday's announcement, officials said they did not know the condition of the driver. An evacuation area included nearly 1,000 homes, and initial shelter orders included schools. Utility workers and others shut off the flow of natural gas liquids in the pipeline, but so much remained in the miles of tubing that firefighters could do nothing but watch and hose down adjacent homes, according to the AP. Investigators said they would release more information about the matter as more information became available. The investigation into the explosion remains active.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/texas-pipeline-explosion-human-remains/	2024-09-19T11:08:54-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24260652632793.jpg?w=900
Diddy again denied bail as lawyers decry conditions at NYC jail	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — After another unsuccessful attempt to keep Sean 'Diddy' Combs out of jail after his sex trafficking arrest, the music mogul’s lawyers say the federal detention center he’s being housed in has a track record of horrific conditions and rampant violence. Combs, 54, was sent to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on Tuesday — a place that’s been described as 'hell on earth' — after pleading not guilty in a case that accuses him of physically and sexually abusing women for more than a decade. 'The food is inedible, from what I've been told,' Combs attorney Marc Agnifilo told reporters. 'It's way too hot in summer; sometimes there's no heat at all. In the winter, the toilet water has been known to freeze. It's violent. Someone like Mr. Combs might be a target for certain things. We can't let that happen.' What we know about the Diddy investigation The facility, the only federal jail in New York City, has been plagued by problems since it opened in the 1990s. In recent years, its conditions have been so stark that some judges have refused to send people there. It has also been home to a number of high-profile inmates, including R. Kelly, Ghislaine Maxwell and cryptocurrency fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)FILE - The Metropolitan Detention Center in the Brooklyn borough of New York is shown Tuesday, July 14, 2020. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) In a statement, the Federal Bureau of Prisons said: 'We also take seriously addressing the staffing and other challenges at MDC Brooklyn.' An agency team is working to fix problems, including by adding permanent correctional and medical staff, remedying more than 700 backlogged maintenance requests and answering judges' concerns. A judge on Wednesday denied a request by Combs' lawyers to let him await trial under house arrest at his $48 million mansion on an island in Miami Beach, Florida. Past violence at MDC Brooklyn Detainees have long complained about rampant violence, dreadful conditions, severe staffing shortages and the widespread smuggling of drugs and other contraband, some of it facilitated by employees. At the same time, they say they’ve been subject to frequent lockdowns and have been barred from leaving their cells for visits, calls, showers or exercise. In June, Uriel Whyte, 37, was stabbed to death at the jail. A month later, Edwin Cordero, 36, died after he was hurt in a brawl. At least four people detained at the jail have died by suicide in the last three years. Who else could be charged in the Diddy investigation? At least six MDC Brooklyn staff members have been charged with crimes in the last five years. Some were accused of accepting bribes or providing contraband such as drugs, cigarettes, and cellphones, according to an Associated Press analysis of agency-related arrests. As of last November, according to court filings, MDC Brooklyn was operating at about 55% of full staffing, which was taxing to employees and added to its security woes.

Vince McMahon lawsuit remains paused ahead of Netflix documentary	(NewsNation) — Lawyers representing a former employee who sued World Wrestling Entertainment founder and former CEO Vince McMahon for alleged sex trafficking and abuse will be providing an update Thursday on the legal case, which had been paused for a federal investigation. The legal update is coming ahead of the release of a new Netflix docuseries on the rise and fall of McMahon called 'Mr. McMahon.' Janel Grant filed suit against McMahon in January but agreed to temporarily 'stay her case' in May at the request of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York 'pending a non-public investigation,' Ann Callis, a lawyer for Grant, said in a statement at the time. Grant said McMahon allegedly sexually exploited her and attempted to traffic her to other WWE employees, according to her suit. She said McMahon allegedly abused her and that she was allegedly forced to have sex with WWE’s former head of talent relations, John Laurinaitis — all while working for the company. WWE star’s widow: ‘Not surprised’ by McMahon lawsuit At the time of the filing, McMahon resigned as executive chairman of WWE parent TKO Group. The lawsuit names the company, McMahon and Laurinaitis as defendants. McMahon has denied the allegations. 'We remain confident the evidence will prove Ms. Grant’s allegations are false and her complaint is nothing more than a fabricated, vindictive narrative from a disgruntled former girlfriend,' McMahon’s attorney has said. Federal authorities are currently investigating sexual assault and sexual trafficking allegations against McMahon. The investigation stems from sexual misconduct accusations against McMahon by a number of women. The Netflix series is set to premiere next Wednesday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/vince-mcmahon-lawsuit-pause-netflix-doc/	2024-09-19T10:24:34-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/07/VinceMcMahonGettyImages-90070808.jpg?w=900
Would-be Florida car burglar gets trapped in Corvette, video show...	(NewsNation) — Julio Solano received a surprise recently when he returned to his car after breakfast to find a would-be thief trapped inside the vehicle, unable to get out. Solano’s Corvette was parked in a Miami Beach, Florida, parking garage when its owner returned from breakfast to find the man inside. When Solano told the man to leave the car, the stranger informed him he was locked inside. Solano captured the exchange on video from his cellphone, including the moment when the alleged burglar asked Solano for assistance in exiting the vehicle. Texas dogfighting ring case: Hearing for suspects delayed 'My brother,' Solano told the man. 'This is not your car. This is my car.' The stranger popped up into view in a way that Solano described as being like a move executed by World Wrestling Entertainment’s Undertaker. 'He was helpless, he looked embarrassed,' Solano told NewsNation. Police arrived shortly and ordered the man out of the car. Again, he claimed he was stuck inside and pleaded for Solano to free him. 'No, you can’t get out, ‘cause we’re calling the cops,' Solano is heard telling the man on the video. Solano said that if the car is unlocked, it is possible to get in from the outside. However, if an occupant is inside and doesn’t have the keys, the lock won't work unless the person picks at the master lock, which is located underneath the seat. The man eventually found himself out of the car and was taken into custody by local police. The suspect faces burglary charges. 'I’m still in shock,' Solano said. 'We laugh about it — my family and friends — my dad, my wife, my son. We just can’t believe it,' Solano said. 'Thank God we’re safe and (that) no one got harmed.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/would-be-florida-car-burglar-trapped-corvette/	2024-09-19T09:02:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/GettyImages-2062171492.jpg?w=900
Iranian hackers tried to give stolen Trump info to Biden campaign...	(NewsNation) — Iranian hackers obtained and sent stolen information from former President Donald Trump’s campaign and sent it to people affiliated with President Joe Biden’s campaign in an effort to disrupt the 2024 election, U.S. intelligence officials confirmed, substantiating claims made by Trump's campaign last month. Federal agencies, including the FBI, have disclosed that Iran gained possession of sensitive campaign information tied to Trump’s reelection campaign and sent it to people with ties to Biden’s campaign, as well as to several American news agencies. On August 10, the Trump campaign announced it had been hacked, claiming Iranian actors had stolen sensitive campaign materials. On Wednesday, U.S. intelligence officials announced their findings, which seem to confirm the Trump campaign’s allegations it had been hacked. Where are Trump, Harris, Vance and Walz campaigning today? Officials said the Iranian hackers are continuing to share the sensitive information with American media outlets, raising concerns among the intelligence community regarding foreign influences on U.S. elections. 'Iranian malicious cyber actors in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden’s campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former President Trump’s campaign as text in the emails,' officials from the FBI, U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement issued Wednesday. The campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris has publicly condemned the data breach, saying the campaign was never directly sent any hacked materials and that emails were ignored as spam by campaign staffers. The hacking activity took place before Biden ended his campaign for a second term in the White House, officials said. According to several reports, at least three U.S. news organizations received hacked materials, including Politico, The New York Times and Washington Post. However, intelligence officials said none of the media outlets published what they were sent. The Associated Press reported that none of the organizations were willing to reveal what materials they received. However, Trump has continued to claim the White House is colluding with Iran to interfere with the November election, which remains a neck and neck race between Trump and Harris. RFK Jr. says he’s helping Trump pick leaders of FDA, NIH, CDC 'Biden is working with Iran, and Iran doesn’t exactly like me,' Trump said. 'They were ready to make a deal, except we had an election that was rigged and stolen. And look at what’s happening to our world now. But no, Iran hacked into my campaign.' 'But they gave it to the Biden campaign. I can't believe it,' Trump continued. 'Oh yes, I can. But this is really foreign election interference, this is real election interference. Not the phony crap they’ve been trying to pin on me.' On Wednesday, U.S. intelligence officials said the attacks are Iran’s 'multi-pronged approach' to undermine democracy and said it is in retaliation for the death of Gen.

Live: Titan submersible hearing resumes Thursday	(NewsNation) — The Coast Guard's investigative hearing into the 2023 Titan submersible implosion continues Thursday with anticipated testimony from an OceanGate mission specialist. Renata Rojas is the latest person to testify who is connected to Titan owner OceanGate after an investigatory panel has listened to two days of testimony that raised questions about the company’s operations before the doomed mission. OceanGate co-founder Stockton Rush was among five people who died when the submersible imploded en route to the site of the Titanic wreck in June 2023. Earlier this month, the Coast Guard opened a public hearing that is part of a high-level investigation into the cause of the implosion. The public hearing began Tuesday, and some of the testimony has focused on the troubled nature of the company. Also expected to testify Thursday is former OceanGate scientific director Steven Ross. The hearing is expected to run through Friday with more witnesses still to come. Physicist: Space objects appeared, disappeared years before first satellites What has been learned so far? A key employee who labeled the experimental submersible unsafe before its last, fatal voyage testified Tuesday. David Lochridge was one of the most anticipated witnesses to appear before the commission. Lochridge is the former operations director for OceanGate, the company that owned the Titan and brought it on several dives to the Titanic going back to 2021. Per his testimony, Rush — who piloted the Titan — previously crashed another sub off the coast of Massachusetts in 2016. Rush refused to hand over the control panel before eventually doing so after shipwrecking the vessel, according to Lochridge. On Monday, witnesses painted a picture of a troubled company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident sparked a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration.

(AP Photo/Anjum Naveed) The Titan, owned by OceanGate, made its last dive June 18, 2023. The craft lost contact with its support vessel an hour and 45 minutes into the dive. Five people were on board, diving 12,000 feet below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. The loss of communication launched a four-day search for the vessel, which ended when evidence of an implosion was found on the ocean floor. Officials concluded that the craft had been destroyed and all five people on board were killed. Few vessels dive that deep into the ocean, and engineers and experts in the field noted previous problems with the Titan as well as warnings that the submersible was unsafe. The search-and-recovery mission is estimated to have cost up to $1.6 million. The Coast Guard quickly convened a high-level investigation into what happened. Concerns leading up to the investigation included the Titan’s unconventional design and its creator’s decision to forgo standard independent checks. The investigation into the Titan implosion originally had a 12-month timeline but has been extended multiple times. In addition to Rush, the implosion killed two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.

UN spokesman: 'We need diplomacy' after Lebanon explosions	(NewsNation) — Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, is urging diplomacy amid reports of more device detonations in Lebanon. Dujarric released a statement on behalf of Guterres requesting 'all concerned actors to exercise maximum restraint to avert any further escalation.' The statement concluded saying the U.N. 'supports all diplomatic and political efforts to end the violence that threatens to engulf the region.' Federal Reserve cuts interest rate for first time in 4 years Walkie-talkies and solar equipment exploded in Beirut and other parts of Lebanon on Wednesday, in an apparent second wave of attacks targeting devices a day after pagers used by Hezbollah blew up, state media and officials for the militant group said. At least 20 people were killed and more than 450 wounded in the second wave, the Health Ministry said. The attacks — which were widely believed to be carried out by Israel and targeted Hezbollah but also killed civilians — have increased fears that the simmering conflict could escalate into all-out war. Speaking to Israeli troops Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said, 'We are at the start of a new phase in the war — it requires courage, determination and perseverance.' He made no mention of the exploding devices but praised the work of Israel’s army and security agencies, saying 'the results are very impressive.' Ozempic not only affects muscle mass but also bone density The new blasts hit a country still roiling with confusion and anger after Tuesday’s pager bombings, which killed at least 12 people, including two children, and wounded some 2,800 others. The second wave also deepens concern over the potentially indiscriminate casualties caused in the attacks, in which hundreds of blasts went off wherever the holder of the pager happened to be — in homes, cars, at grocery stores and in cafes, often with family or bystanders nearby.

Iranian hackers tried but failed to interest Biden's campaign in ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Iranian hackers sought to interest President Joe Biden's campaign in information stolen from rival Donald Trump's campaign, sending unsolicited emails to people associated with the then-Democratic candidate in an effort to interfere in the 2024 election, the FBI and other federal agencies said Wednesday. There’s no indication that any of the recipients responded, officials said, and several media organizations who have said they also were approached with stolen material did not publish it. Kamala Harris' presidential campaign called the emails from Iran 'unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity' that were received by only a few people who regarded them as spam or phishing attempts. The emails were received before the hack of the Trump campaign was publicly acknowledged, and there’s no evidence the recipients of the emails knew their origin. The announcement is the latest U.S. government effort to call out what officials say is Iran’s brazen, ongoing work to interfere in the election, including a hack-and-leak campaign that the FBI and other federal agencies linked last month to Tehran. U.S. officials in recent months have used criminal charges, sanctions and public advisories to detail actions taken by foreign adversaries to influence the election, including an indictment targeting a covert Russian effort to spread pro-Russia content to U.S. audiences. It's a stark turnabout from the government's response in 2016, when Obama administration officials were criticized for not being forthcoming about the Russian interference they were seeing on Trump's behalf as he ran against Democrat Hillary Clinton. In this case, the hackers sent emails in late June and early July to people who were associated with Biden's campaign before he dropped out. The emails 'contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former President Trump’s campaign as text in the emails,' according to a statement released by the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The agencies have said the Trump campaign hack and an attempted breach of the Biden-Harris campaign are part of an effort to undermine voters’ faith in the election and to stoke discord. The FBI informed Trump aides within the last 48 hours that information hacked by Iran had been sent to the Biden campaign, according to a senior campaign official granted anonymity to speak because of the sensitive nature of the investigation. The Trump campaign disclosed on Aug. 10 that it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. At least three news outlets — Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post — were leaked confidential material from inside the Trump campaign. So far, each has refused to reveal any details about what it received. Politico reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account. The source — an AOL email account identified only as 'Robert' — passed along what appeared to be a research dossier that the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The document was dated Feb. 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate. In a statement, Harris campaign spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein said the campaign has cooperated with law enforcement since learning that people associated with Biden’s team were among the recipients of the emails. 'We’re not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign; a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt,' Finkelstein said. 'We condemn in the strongest terms any effort by foreign actors to interfere in U.S. elections including this unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity. Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the effort to dangle stolen information to the Biden campaign 'further proof the Iranians are actively interfering in the election' to help Harris. Intelligence officials have said Iran opposes Trump’s reelection, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Trump’s administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge. Iran’s intrusion on the Trump campaign was cited as just one of the cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns identified by tech companies and national security officials at a hearing Wednesday of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Executives from Meta, Google and Microsoft briefed lawmakers on their plans for safeguarding the election, and the attacks they’d seen so far. 'The most perilous time I think will come 48 hours before the election,' Microsoft President Brad Smith told lawmakers during the hearing, which focused on American tech companies’ efforts to safeguard the election from foreign disinformation and cyberattacks. ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in New York contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-fbi-says-iranian-hackers-sent-unsolicited-stolen-trump-info-to-people-associated-with-biden-campaign/	2024-09-18T19:02:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66eb874de28ec4.11009877.jpeg?w=900
Body found near site of Kentucky highway shooting believed to be ...	LONDON, Ky. (WDKY) — Authorities believe the body of a man suspected of shooting and wounding five people on a Kentucky interstate highway has been found. Kentucky State Police Commissioner Phillip Burnett Jr. said during a press conference that the body found Wednesday is believed to be Joseph Couch, of Woodbine, Kentucky. Burnett said accessories found with the body have led them to conclude it is him. A weapon was also found at the site. He said the cause of death will be determined in an autopsy. Authorities hoped the discovery would end an intense, nearly two-week search that had area residents on edge. 'People have been in fear,' Laurel County Sheriff John Root said during the press conference. 'That’s not the normal here in Laurel County. So now that this has been discovered, I hope that our county can get back to what’s normal.' Who is Joseph Couch? Alleged I-75 shooter warned he was going to ‘kill a lot of people’ Kentucky State Police said on X that troopers located the body near Exit 49 on Interstate 75, just outside of the small town of London. Burnett said troopers had been in contact with a couple, Fred and Sheila McCoy, who were also searching the area with a group at the time. A live stream video posted to the couple's YouTube channel, Hatfield McCoy Museum Adventures, showed them tracking vultures Wednesday afternoon near the interstate. At one point during their search, they started to pick up on the smell of decaying flesh, which led them to the body. The livestream, which lasted around 30 minutes, ended about one minute after they found the body and called out to the rest of their search group. 'You know, I want to recognize the McCoys because they've been very cooperative with our troopers and provided troopers with relevant information,' Burnett said. Video below: Previous coverage on search for suspect following shooting along I-75 in Kentucky The discovery comes 12 days after five people were injured in a highway shooting in the area. On Sept. 7, five people were injured and 12 vehicles were damaged in a shooting near Exit 49 on I-75 near London. Authorities quickly identified a person of interest, 32-year-old Joseph Couch, after finding a vehicle registered in his name nearby. The next day, Couch was named a suspect. As WDKY previously reported, authorities had been alerted hours before the shooting that Couch had texted a woman saying he was going to 'kill a lot of people.' An emergency cell site tracker was placed on his cellphone, which pinged near Exit 49 just over an hour after shots were fired. Couch had purchased a rifle and 1,000 rounds of ammunition the same day of the shooting, investigators determined. A rifle case was found in his abandoned vehicle, as well as a semi-automatic weapon. While Couch was named a suspect, authorities warned they had not determined who had fired the weapon. Laurel County, located in southeastern Kentucky, remained on edge for days as authorities searched the heavily wooded area near Exit 49 for Couch. On Tuesday, searchers were pulled from the woods to bolster patrols in nearby communities as schools reopened. 'We feel like we’ll be better off to protect our communities by moving those personnel,' Kentucky State Police Commissioner Phillip Burnett, Jr. said. 'This is the best plan that we have going forward. We have looked at every possible scenario. We’ve looked at every piece of equipment, technology that we can utilize, and this, from what we have discovered so far in this search, this is the best plan moving forward.' Authorities said Monday they had searched and cleared over 28,000 acres of land in the Daniel Boone National Forest while searching for Couch. Cameras were placed in the woods to continue monitoring for activity. Kentucky State Police Trooper Scottie Pennington previously told reporters that he hoped Couch would run out of resources and 'walk out of the woods.' Pennington also noted that if Couch had died, buzzards could gather overhead, which could be a sign for searchers. 'And some people say, ‘Well, what if he’s not alive anymore?’ Well, we’re going to stay in the woods till we find him,' Pennington said last week. 'And, you know, that’s our job. If he’s dead or alive. It’s our job to try to find him.'

Trump to New York: 'I'm asking for your vote'	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump returned to his home state to hold a rally in Long Island, New York, with 48 days left until Election Day. Trump, for his part, leaned heavily on his alarmist message about immigration at the rally in Uniondale, focusing the bulk of his remarks on the subject. 'We’re just destroying the fabric of life in our country. And we’re not going to take it any longer. And you got to get rid of these people. Give me a shot,' Trump said. In his nearly 90-minute address, Trump confirmed plans to visit Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado, following unsubstantiated claims about Haitian migrants. He also campaigned for New York Republicans in crucial congressional races. Where Trump and Harris stand on issues that matter to voters Trump addressed the recent decision by the Teamsters union not to endorse him, stating he was 'honored to receive the endorsement of rank and file Teamsters' despite the lack of official union backing. The former president accused Iran of hacking his campaign and providing materials to the Biden campaign, calling it 'foreign election interference.' Focusing on crime, Trump promised to 'stop the Kamala crime wave,' referring to Vice President Kamala Harris. He criticized the current administration's border policies, stating, 'I want to be known as your border president. Kamala will be known as your invasion president.' The former president also announced plans to officially designate the ground zero site at the World Trade Center as a national monument 'so the heroes there will be preserved for all time.' He ripped into Democratic leadership in New York City and state, blaming them for homeless people living in what he called 'horrible, disgusting, dangerous, filthy encampments,' and even the conditions on the New York City subway, which he called 'squalid and unsafe' and promised to renovate. 'What the hell do you have to lose?' he said in asking for their votes. Before heading out to the suburbs, Trump stopped at a Bitcoin cafe in New York City. Trump has recently embraced cryptocurrency and helped launch his family’s new cryptocurrency venture Monday night. While New York is generally considered to be a reliably blue state, the former president has said a few times over the last few months that he believes New York and neighboring New Jersey could be in play this year. There's not a lot of polling data coming out from the state, but a recent poll from Siena College taken in late July and early August gave Vice President Kamala Harris a 14-point advantage. In hopes of swaying voters, he's planning on focusing on key issues, including the cost of living in New York and how it's soared in recent years. Should you refinance your mortgage? Here’s what to consider On the border issue, Trump said of the Biden-Harris administration, 'When they got in, they let everybody pour into our country. When I got elected, I believe it was the border that was the biggest thing and I fixed it and I did a great job,' Trump said. 'I wanted to mention it in 2020 and my people would say, 'Sir, nobody cares about the border.' They don't care because I had it fixed. Now I got to fix it again.' There hasn't been a lot of attention paid to New York, with pollsters focusing on major battleground states, but Trump is still doing his best to pitch his message to voters. That's especially true after 2022, when Republicans made some gains during the midterm election. However, one of those districts flipped back to Democrats after the resignation of GOP Rep. George Santos. But Republicans are still emphasizing the area, including Long Island, in hopes of retaining control of the House of Representatives and potentially picking up some new seats for the party. By holding a rally in Uniondale, Trump was focusing on an area that could be key to Republicans maintaining control of the House. His party is trying to protect 18 Republicans in Democratic-heavy congressional districts that Joe Biden carried in 2020, particularly in coastal New York and California, and going on offense to challenge Democrats elsewhere. Long Island in particular features one of the most closely watched races, between first-term Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito and Democrat Laura Gillen. D’Esposito is a former New York police detective who won in 2022 in a district that Biden won by about 15 percentage points in 2020. Trump posted Tuesday on his Truth Social platform that the GOP has 'a real chance of winning' New York 'for the first time in many decades.' In that same post, Trump also pledged that he would 'get SALT back,' suggesting he would eliminate a cap on state and local tax deductions that were part of tax cut legislation he signed into law in 2017. The so-called SALT cap has led to bigger tax bills for many residents of New York, New Jersey, California and other high-cost, high-tax states, and is an important campaign issue in those states, particularly among those New York Republicans serving in districts Biden won.

Live: Fed cuts interest rate for first time in 4 years	(NewsNation) — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, something it hasn't done in more than four years. Federal Reserve officials were able to do this as the post-pandemic spike in U.S. inflation eased further last month. Year-over-year price increases reached a three-year low. The White House has been feeling hopeful about the state of the current economy, with officials maintaining that America can pull off a 'soft landing' from inflation. The Fed's impact on the economy Whether this will affect Americans’ perception of the economy remains to be seen. With the election now less than 50 days away, the rhetoric on the campaign trail continues to ramp up around what voters are saying is their No. 1 issue. The economy has been one of the first topics to come up at both Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s rallies as they campaign for the presidency. Should you refinance your mortgage? Here’s what to consider Asked about it Tuesday during an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Harris said she wants to deal with the economy 'head-on.' To do this, Harris said, she wants to employ and engage the private sector with tax credits, particularly homebuilders, to give them incentives to create new housing. Current President Joe Biden’s economic advisers wrote in a blog post published Tuesday night that the economic and job growth under his administration has 'surpassed projections.' Trump, meanwhile, has blamed Biden for what he calls a 'failed' economy. He's said that he wants to get people's energy bills down by 50% within 12 months if he wins the 2024 election. In addition, Trump wants to work with farmers, who he says are being 'decimated' right now. However, Trump has previously said that he disagrees with the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates and that it is 'something that they know they shouldn't be doing' ahead of the election in November. Inflation show signs of easing Last week's report from the Labor Department showed that consumer prices rose 2.5% in August from a year earlier. That's down from 2.9% in July and marked the fifth straight annual drop since February 2021. Between July and August, prices only rose by 0.2%. Cooling inflation has given American consumers some relief after price surges in food, gas and rent over the last three years. In mid-2022, inflation peaked at 9.1%, which marked the highest rate in four decades. A big factor in this was a third drop in gas prices in just four months. Average gas prices for August fell 0.6% from where they were in July and are 10.6% less than they were a year ago. Although they are still higher than they were three years ago, grocery prices remained unchanged from July to August. Grocery prices in the last year have only gone up by 0.9%, which is a pace they were at before the COVID-19 pandemic. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits People's paychecks have also risen steadily, though they are still growing at a solid pace that reduces inflationary levels. For the past 18 months, their overall incomes have outpaced inflation. According to the Census Bureau, the median inflation-adjusted household income rose 4% last year to above $80,000. Trends suggest inflation will keep slowing down, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell saying in a speech last month that it was coming under control.

Where is Diddy currently being held after arrest?	(NewsNation) — After being arrested Monday on federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges, music producer Sean 'Diddy' Combs will likely be held in Manhattan's Metropolitan Detention Center, according to multiple media reports. A law enforcement official told CNN that Combs will likely be held by himself in a special housing unit inside the Brooklyn jail until his court appearance Wednesday afternoon. The Metropolitan Detention Center has been the primary federal detention center since 2021, when the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan closed after a number of issues that were exposed after Jeffrey Epstein's death. Problems plaguing the facility included lax security and crumbling infrastructure, the Associated Press reported. Timeline: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits Federal prosecutors Tuesday indicted Combs, alleging he abused, threatened and coerced women to fulfill his sexual desires. A federal judge ruled Combs will remain in custody while he awaits trial. Combs pleaded not guilty, and his attorney Marc Agnifilo said the defense team would appeal the bail decision during court Wednesday. Diddy at MDC Brooklyn There are 1,218 people at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is located in the Eastern New York Judicial District, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Like the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the MDC is also 'plagued by chronic understaffing, constant lockdowns, outbreaks of violence, delayed access to medical care, and a rash of suicides and death,' The Daily Beast reported. 'Several courts in this District have recognized that the conditions at Metropolitan Detention Center are not fit for pre-trial detention,' Combs' lawyers said in a motion they filed for bail Tuesday, per the news outlet. Who else could be charged in the Diddy investigation? Mentioned by Combs' attorneys in their filing was a June 7 incident where Uriel Whyte, a man who had been at MDC for gun charges, was stabbed to death in the facility. Spectrum News New York reported that Whyte was awaiting trial on gun charges for two years. A second man named Edwin Cordero died after being injured in a jail fight in August. Cordero's lawyer, The New York Times reported, wrote about the 'awful' conditions his client faced in a June letter to a federal judge. The prison, Cordero's lawyer said, is 'an overcrowded, understaffed and neglected federal jail that is hell on earth.' Along with the deaths this past summer, suicides and an electrical fire in 2019 that caused those in the prison to be without heat and power for days have been reported at MDC. Despite objections from Combs lawyers, Magistrate Judge Robyn F. Tarnofsky ordered Combs to be held in custody. 'I don’t know that I think you can trust yourself,' Tarnofsky was quoted by the NYT as saying in court Tuesday, mentioning his history of alleged violence and citing his flight risk.

Euthanasia, pronouns, sports betting: Intriguing 2024 ballot meas...	(NewsNation) — While voters may expect to see former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on their ballots along with other prominent names, voters in several states should expect to see ballot measures that will decide important issues. In 10 states, voters will decide whether to preserve or restrict abortion access, an issue that motivates voters to show up on Election Day, as evidenced in 2022. Meanwhile, eight states will choose whether or not to ban noncitizen voting in state-level elections, and an additional 10 states will decide on adopting or banning electoral systems like ranked-choice voting. But some ballot measures in 2024 will deal with somewhat lighter issues. Voters in Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, South Dakota and West Virginia will have some interesting decisions to make come Election Day, from legalizing sports betting to changing the design of the state flag. Breaking down the policies and issues that matter in 2024 Here's a look at five intriguing ballot measures that will be decided in November: Maine: New state flag design Voters in the Pine Tree State will decide whether they support replacing the existing state flag with a flag consisting of a pine tree and the North Star on a buff (light tan) background, often called the Pine Tree Flag, according to Ballotpedia. You can view the proposed design here. The current flag was established in 1909 and features the Maine coat of arms on a blue background. The coat of arms includes a moose and pine tree with a farmer and sailor on either side, with the North Star and a ribbon with the Latin phrase Dirigo, which means 'I direct.' The current Maine State Flag. (Photo By Encyclopaedia Britannica/UIG Via Getty Images) Ahead of the ballot measure coming to voters, the state held a design contest that received more than 400 submissions. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced the winning design by Adam Lemire, of Gardiner, in an August news release. She described it as a 'beautiful, faithful representation of an Eastern White Pine tree proper.' The measure has sparked debates about state identity, with supporters claiming the new design better represents Maine's heritage and natural beauty, while those opposed say changing the flag is unnecessary. Read more about Maine's State Flag Referendum here. Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris: How policies compare Massachusetts: Regulating access to psychedelic substances Massachusetts voters will consider whether to regulate access to five psychedelic substances for mental health treatment. The measure would allow a licensed 'facilitator' to prescribe the natural psychedelics as part of a mental health treatment. The natural psychedelic substances in question include plants and fungi that contain the following substances: dimethyltryptamine, mescaline, ibogaine, psilocybin and psilocin. The Drug Enforcement Administration classifies these psychedelics as Schedule I drugs, with 'high abuse potential with no accepted medical use.' Cannabis, which has been legalized for medical and recreational use in more than a dozen states, is still also classified as a Schedule 1 drug. In 2020, Oregon decriminalized the use of psychedelics and the first psychedelic treatment centers opened in 2023, according to Axios. In 2022, Colorado voters decriminalized the same five psychedelic chemicals as those on the ballot this year in Massachusetts. When does early voting begin in my state? Proponents argue that naturally occurring psychedelics have shown promise in treating depression, PTSD and anxiety. They claim regulation would ensure safe access for those who could benefit medically while maintaining controls to prevent misuse. Adam Zaffuto, a veteran from Pittsburgh, told 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that psychedelics dramatically improved his recovery. 'The side effects for me were immense amounts of self-love, immense amounts of self-transformation, an ability to be a better husband and a much more engaged father and to provide my daughter with the father that she deserves,' Zaffuto told NewsNation last year. 'My wife got her husband back and got the man that she married back.' Critics are concerned about the potential public health and safety risks, arguing more research is needed before such substances are made more widely available. 'We need larger studies. We need to see more long-term effects,' Virginia state Del. Wren Williams said last year. Missouri: Legalize and regulate sports betting NewsNation affiliate WDAF reported that a Missouri judge ruled a sports betting ballot initiative up for a vote in November would remain on state ballots. The constitutional amendment would permit the Missouri Gambling Commission to allow in-person and online sports wagering. Under the proposed initiative, at least $5 million annually in licensing fees and taxes would go toward problem gambling programs, with remaining tax revenues going toward elementary, secondary and higher education. 38 states and D.C. have legalized sports betting, according to Ballotpedia. Several neighboring states, including Illinois, Arkansas and Kansas, have already legalized sports betting. Without legalization, Missouri risks losing potential revenue from those who cross state borders to place bets. How Americans can register to vote ahead of Election Day With strong support among Missouri’s professional sports teams, some are confident the measure could pass and pave the way to legal sports wagering in the state. One reporter told WDAF that Missourians regularly drive to neighboring states to place bets. 'Going to parking lots in kind of random industrial areas in Kansas City, Kansas and you look and you see the parking lots are just in and out with people with Missouri plates stopping on their phones maybe there for 5-10 minutes,' Ryan Butler, a Covers.com senior editor told WDAF. 'Every Sunday its lined up here,' said Austin Lewis, a Liberty, Missouri, man who drives to Kansas to place sports bets. 'Thirty-minute drive everyday, it's pretty much ready for it to be legal in Missouri.' Opponents are concerned about the potential for increased gambling addiction. Other opponents say the amendment provides greater financial benefit for out-of-state funders. One committee, called Missourians Against Deceptive Online Gambling, has earned support from nearby Missouri casinos and Caesars Entertainment. A new Emerson College/The Hill poll found that 52% of the respondents said they would support a sports betting measure in Missouri, 25% plan to oppose it and 23% were unsure. South Dakota: Amend constitution to remove male pronouns South Dakotans will decide whether to remove male-specific pronouns from the state constitution and replace them with gender-neutral language. This would involve changing words like 'he' and 'his' to terms like 'the person' or 'the governor's.' Nine state constitutions — California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Utah and Vermont — use gender-neutral language, according to Ballotpedia. Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues Proponents argue that this change is long overdue and would make the constitution more inclusive, reflecting the reality that women can and do hold all offices in state government. They say the amendment is about accuracy and equal representation, not political correctness. Critics argue the change is unnecessary. Some also express concerns about preserving the historical integrity of the document. West Virginia: Ban people from participating in euthanasia A controversial amendment to prevent physician-assisted suicide will be up for voters in November to decide. If this is approved, West Virginia would be the first state in the nation to formally do so. NewsNation affiliate WOWK reported that House Joint Resolution 28 proposes amending West Virginia’s constitution to prevent any medical professional from committing euthanasia, or from helping a patient commit suicide. Critics say current law already makes it illegal, but supporters argue it adds additional safeguards. 'It’s to help protect some of the most vulnerable people in our state. Those are individuals who have illnesses, that are going through a lot. And this will protect them from being encouraged to commit suicide,' said bill co-sponsor Del. Chris Pritt (R) Kanawha. 'Restoring Reproductive freedom, we should be voting on that. But the Republicans won’t let us vote on it because they know what the outcome will be, just like in every other state. So, instead, they put this meaningless Constitutional Amendment on that’s banning something that’s already banned,' said Del. Mike Pushkin, chair of the state Democratic Party.

It also passed the Senate by a similar margin. Even if physician-assisted suicide is outlawed, it will not prevent patients from choosing to stop taking lifesaving medications or stop them from enforcing DNR orders. At least 12 states currently have bills that would legalize physician-assisted death. Eight states and Washington, D.C., already allow it, but only for their own residents. Vermont and Oregon permit any qualifying American to travel to their state for the practice. Patients must be at least 18 years old, within six months of death and be assessed to ensure they are capable of making an informed decision. Two states including West Virginia have gone in the opposite direction. Kansas has a bill to criminalize further those who help someone with their physician-assisted death.

Explosions witnessed at Beirut funeral for Hezbollah members and ...	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s health ministry says one person was killed and over 100 were wounded on Wednesday by exploding electronic devices in multiple regions of country. The explosions came a day after an apparent Israeli attack targeting pagers used by Hezbollah killed at least 12 and wounded nearly 3,000. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. BEIRUT (AP) — Multiple explosions went off Wednesday at the site of a funeral for three Hezbollah members and a child killed by exploding pagers the day before, according to Associated Press journalists at the scene. Hezbollah’s Al Manar TV reported explosions in multiple areas of Lebanon, and a Hezbollah official told The Associated Press that walkie-talkies used by the group exploded as part of blasts heard in Beirut. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. There was no immediate detail on casualties. The new blasts come with Lebanon still thrown into confusion and anger after the Tuesday's pager bombings, which appeared to be a complex Israeli attack targeting Hezbollah members. At least 12 people were killed, including two children, and some 2,800 people wounded as hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah members began detonating in several parts of Lebanon and in Syria. New details on the operation began to emerge. The pagers were made by a company based in Hungary, another firm said Wednesday. An American official said Israel briefed the United States after the attack, in which small amounts of explosive had been hidden in the pagers. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the information publicly. The attack, which Israel has not commented on, renewed fears that the simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate into all-out war. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday the U.S. is still assessing how the attack could affect efforts to negotiate a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Israel began moving more troops to its border with Lebanon on Wednesday as a precautionary measure, according to an official with knowledge of the movements who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Hezbollah and Israeli forces have exchanged fire almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after a deadly Hamas-led assault in southern Israel triggered the war. Since then, hundreds have been killed in the strikes in Lebanon and dozens in Israel, while tens of thousands on each side of the border have been displaced. Hamas and Hezbollah are allies and both are supported by Iran. Israeli leaders have issued a series of warnings in recent weeks that they might increase operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon, saying they must put a stop to the exchanges to allow people to return to homes near the border. The AR-924 pagers used in Tuesday's attack were manufactured by BAC Consulting KFT, which is based in the Hungarian capital of Budapest, according to a statement released by Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese firm that authorized the use of its brand on the pagers. Gold Apollo's chair, Hsu Ching-kuang, told journalists Wednesday the firm has had a licensing agreement with BAC for the past three years. 'According to the cooperation agreement, we authorize BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in designated regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are solely the responsibility of BAC,' Gold Apollo said in a statement. BAC Consulting Kft. was registered as a limited liability company in May 2022, according to its records. It has 7,840 euros in standing capital, the records showed, and had revenue of $725,768 in 2022 and $593,972 in 2023. At the headquarters of a building in a residential neighborhood of Budapest, the names of multiple companies, including BAC Consulting, are posted on pieces of paper on a window. A woman who emerged from the building and declined to give her name said the site provides headquarter addresses to various companies. BAC's parent company is registered to Cristiana Rosaria Bársony-Arcidiacono, whose describes herself on her LinkedIn page as a strategic advisor and business developer. Among other positions, Bársony-Arcidiacono says on the page that she has served on the board of directors of the Earth Child Institute, a sustainability group. The group does not list Bársony-Arcidiacono as among its board members on its website. The Associated Press has attempted to reach Bársony-Arcidiacono via the LinkedIn page and has been unable to establish a connection between her or BAC and the exploding pagers. The attack in Lebanon started Tuesday afternoon, when pagers in their owners' hands or pockets started heating up and then exploding — leaving blood-splattered scenes and panicking bystanders. It appeared that most of those hit were members or linked to members of Hezbollah — whether fighters or civilians — but it was not immediately clear if people with no ties to Hezbollah were also hit. The Health Ministry said health care workers and two children were among those killed. In the village of Nadi Sheet in the Bekaa Valley, dozens gathered to mourn the death of one of the children, 9-year-old Fatima Abdullah. Her mother, wearing black and donning a yellow Hezbollah scarf, wept alongside other women and children as they gathered around the little girl’s coffin before her burial. Hezbollah said in a statement Wednesday morning that it would continue its normal strikes against Israel as part of what it describes as a support front for its ally, Hamas, and Palestinians in Gaza. 'This path is continuous and separate from the difficult reckoning that the criminal enemy must await for its massacre on Tuesday,' it said. 'This is another reckoning that will come, God willing.' At hospitals in Beirut on Wednesday, the chaos of the night before had largely subsided, but relatives of the wounded continued to wait. Lebanon Health Minister Firas Abiad told journalists during a tour of hospitals Wednesday morning that many of the wounded had severe injuries to the eyes, and others had limbs amputated. Journalists were not allowed to enter hospital rooms or film patients. Abiad said the wounded had been sent to various area hospitals to avoid any single facility being overloaded and added that Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Egypt offered to help treat the patients. Earlier Wednesday, an Iraqi military plane landed in Beirut carrying 15 tons of medicine and medical equipment, he said. Experts believe explosive material was put into the pagers prior to their delivery. The AR-924 pager, advertised as being 'rugged,' contains a rechargeable lithium battery, according to specifications advertised on Gold Apollo’s website before they were removed after the attack. It claimed to have up to 85 days of battery life. That would be crucial in Lebanon, where electricity outages have been common after years of economic collapse. Pagers also run on a different wireless network than mobile phones, making them more resilient in emergencies — one of the reasons why many hospitals worldwide still rely on them. For Hezbollah, the pagers also provided a means to sidestep what’s believed to be intensive Israeli electronic surveillance on mobile phone networks in Lebanon. 'The phone that we have in our hands — I do not have a phone in my hand — is a listening device,' warned Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in a February speech. Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said from the beginning of 2022 until August 2024, Gold Apollo has exported 260,000 sets of pagers, including more than 40,000 sets between January and August of this year. The ministry said that it had no records of direct exports of Gold Apollo pagers to Lebanon. ___ This story has been updated to correct the age of one of the children killed.

Senator demands debate communication between Harris, ABC	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Claiming ABC News was blatantly partisan in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris going into the presidential debate, a Republican senator is demanding the network turn over any communications it exchanged with Harris’ campaign before she took the stage with former President Donald Trump. 'On debate night, it became abundantly clear that ABC News and its respective moderators had a biased agenda,' Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, wrote in a letter to ABC News President ​​Almin Karamehmedovic and Harris’ campaign manager, Julie Chávez Rodriguez. 'Over 67 million Americans watched as a policy exchange between two presidential candidates quickly turned into a three-on-one debate against the Republican nominee,' Marshall added in the letter first reported by NewsNation. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters Trump and allies have roundly complained that ABC News fact-checked the former president several times during the live broadcast while letting Harris go unchallenged. Some Trump supporters have gone further, alleging ABC News tipped Harris off to questions and treated her with kid gloves in the matchup. ABC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Marshall’s request for documents carries no force of law and so far does not have the support of fellow Republicans. Marshall’s letter seeks the ABC News turn over and publicly release any texts and emails with the Harris team to clear up any concern about coordination. 'The American people deserve transparency and accountability from the mainstream media and a full accounting of whether ABC News coordinated with the Harris campaign to skew the debate’s questions and fact-checking in favor of the Vice President,' Marshall says in the letter.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/senator-demands-debate-communication-between-harris-abc/	2024-09-18T07:59:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2170581764_ce0738.jpg?w=900
Should you refinance your mortgage? Here's what to consider	(NewsNation) — The recent decline in mortgage rates has more Americans looking to refinance, and the Federal Reserve's expected rate cuts could make refinancing even more attractive heading into 2025. In early August, refinance applications were up nearly 60% versus the same period a year earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The chance to refinance at a lower rate may be especially appealing for those who bought homes in 2023 when mortgage rates surged above 7%. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits 'If you've purchased a home in the past couple of years, you may want to take a look at where rates are today. That door to refinancing may well have opened up for you,' said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. However, the Fed's interest rate decision isn't the only factor that will influence your decision to refinance. Here's what else to consider. What is a refinance? Refinancing is when you replace your current mortgage with a new one, often with the goal of lowering your interest rate and monthly payments. Others may refinance to shorten the length of their mortgage or tap into their equity to raise money for a major purchase. There are two primary options for refinancing your mortgage. No-cash-out refinance: This is the most common option. It's for borrowers who want to refinance their existing mortgage at a lower interest rate and potentially get a better monthly payment. Those looking to move from an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to a fixed-rate mortgage might also consider a no-cash-out refinance. Cash-out refinance: If you've built up considerable equity in your home, this option allows you to get part of your equity back in cash. With a cash-out refinance, you're refinancing your mortgage for more than you currently owe. Generally, that means a higher mortgage rate, but cash-out refinances could make sense for those looking to make home improvements. Home loans: What are the differences and which one is right for me? Is it a good time to refinance? Whether or not it's a good idea to refinance will depend on your current loan and your reason for doing so. Generally, you'll want to wait until market rates have fallen below your existing mortgage rate to make sure you can get a better deal. While the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has dropped to 6.2% — the lowest level in 19 months — it's still more than double what it was three years ago. A recent Redfin analysis found that 86% of homeowners paying a mortgage had an interest rate below 6%, which means most homeowners may have a hard time getting a better rate if they refinanced today. For others, like those who bought homes last year when rates were above 7%, refinancing may be worth considering. What is mortgage insurance and why would you need it? As a general rule, refinancing could be worthwhile if you're able to reduce your mortgage rate by at least 1 percentage point, said Ralph McLaughlin, senior economist at Realtor.com. At that point, the monthly savings start to look more attractive than the closing costs, which, according to Freddie Mac, average $5,000 on a refinance. McBride said homeowners with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) that's scheduled to reset in the next year may also want to consider refinancing sooner rather than later. 'You take advantage of the fact that fixed rates have come down, but you also lock in that certainty in terms of rate and monthly payment for years to come,' he said. Should I wait for interest rates to drop further to refinance? The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates multiple times before the end of the year, which could send mortgage rates lower into 2025. 'If you're just trying to refinance for rate and term, to get a lower rate, it might pay to wait here another six to nine months,' said McLaughlin. With that said, McLaughlin pointed out that timing the market is difficult because the Fed's benchmark interest rate isn't the only variable that affects home loans. Close Thank you for signing up!

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } In fact, since the Fed's rate cuts are widely expected, the market has already started pricing them in, which means further mortgage rate drops will likely have much more to do with the overall health of the economy. 'The risk in sitting back and waiting for rates to fall further before refinancing is that there are no guarantees,' McBride said. 'We'd expected mortgage rates to come down in the first half of this year and it didn't happen.' According to Fannie Mae's August housing forecast, the average mortgage rate is projected to be 6.2% in the first quarter of 2025 before gradually declining to 5.9% by the last quarter of the year. Even if mortgage rates continue to fall, both experts expect them to settle closer to 5% rather than the 2% to 3% rates seen during the pandemic. Remember, you can refinance as often as you want, but you'll usually have to pay closing costs each time. What should I consider before refinancing? There are several factors you should consider before refinancing. How much equity you have If your house is worth less than what you paid for it, then you might struggle to refinance your mortgage. Lenders often want applicants to have at least 20% equity before they consider refinancing a loan, according to Bankrate. Calculate your break-even point The break-even point is how long it will take to recoup your refinance closing costs. The bigger the rate drop, the shorter the break-even period. For example, if your refinance costs $5,000 and you are saving $100 per month compared to your previous loan, it will take 50 months to cover your costs. How long you'll be in the home If you plan to stay in the home long enough to recover the closing costs, then refinancing could make sense, but think twice if you intend to sell soon. Your debt situation If your personal credit history has become worse since you took out your initial mortgage, your refinanced rate could be higher than you expect. Improving your credit score from Bad (under 600 FICO) to Very Good (750–800) can lower your mortgage rate by 39 basis points, according to a recent Realtor.com report. Finding the best rate Shopping around can have a major impact on your mortgage rate with an average difference of 86 basis points between the least expensive and most expensive lenders, Realtor.com found.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/should-refinance-your-mortgage/	2024-09-18T07:30:18-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-2155785262.jpg?w=900
Galaxy Gas: What is it and what are the dangers of misuse?	(NewsNation) — It started with a video of a man in a fast-food restaurant taking a hit from a flavored whipped cream canister called Galaxy Gas. He showed off how deep the can made his voice, racking up millions of views and shares as others followed. Now, when you search 'Galaxy Gas' on TikTok you’re met with a warning that some substances can be dangerous when misused. The app has scrubbed many of the viral clips, but that was after hundreds of thousands of similar videos were posted of people 'whiffing' Galaxy Gas to get high. The cans are easily available online or at big brand-name stores. When you visit Galaxy Gas’ website, you now must agree to a disclosure statement before scrolling. The company sent NewsNation a statement saying its products are for culinary use only, and misuse of any kind is prohibited. Indiana police seize nearly 124 kilos of cocaine in traffic stop What is Galaxy Gas? Nitrous oxide is so-called laughing gas. Dentists and doctors use it for procedures but say it’s not safe for teens to use without medical assistance because it could be deadly. 'These children have underdeveloped brains,' Dr. Sulagna Misra, founding physician at Misra Wellness, told NewsNation. 'They're getting instant gratification high, and there's no oversight. … You can die from one use of this. One prolonged, abnormal, wrong misuse, no supervision — you can die.' Titan submersible CEO was ‘a murderer’: Titanic expedition leader What are the long-term effects? A U.S. substance abuse study suggests that about 13 million Americans ages 12 and older had misused nitrous oxide in their lifetime. Misra said it’s all about reminding teens the short-term high isn’t worth the potential long-term brain damage. In the United States, the misuse of nitrous oxide is rising rapidly. 'People have this sort of super hero syndrome where they think nothing's going to affect them until they wind up in a hospital sick,' psychotherapist Dr. Lisa Palmer said. Misuse of nitrous oxide can impair the body’s metabolism of vitamin B12, which is essential for maintaining the insulation and protection of nerves in the brain and spinal cord. Long-term misuse can lead to range of neurological, blood-related and psychiatric complications, including nerve damage and psychosis, according to a January study from the Yale School of Medicine.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/galaxy-gas-what-is-it-dangers/	2024-09-18T05:16:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-1815420415.jpg?w=900
Pregnant migrants balance journey to childbirth, asylum	(NewsNation) — Leticia Alvarez didn’t realize she was pregnant when she left Venezuela, determined like millions of other asylum-seekers to trade the political persecution and hardships for new opportunities elsewhere. Alvarez learned she was 13 weeks pregnant in Panama after she developed intense belly pain early in her family’s trek to the Mexico-U.S. border. The news pushed the 25-year-old into a population of migrant women who navigate the already stressful process of giving birth while also seeking asylum in a new country. Abbott announces Texas crackdown on Venezuelan gang In 2021, President Joe Biden reversed a Trump-era policy that allowed pregnant women or nursing mothers to be detained by border officials. Despite the change, the American Civil Liberties Union submitted a petition with more than 900 signatures that called for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to change its policy to minimize harm to women who are pregnant, postpartum, or nursing, saying that mothers-to-be continue to be mistreated. Yet for Alvarez, pregnancy and migrant-related challenges pale to what she would have faced had she remained home. 'If I would have been pregnant in my country, I would be dead with my baby,' Alvarez told NewsNation in Spanish. Searching for a new life across the border Alvarez and her family needed 15 days to reach the U.S., traveling mainly by bus thanks to money she and her husband, Lisandro Escola, saved. But the couple, along with Alvarez’s sister, niece and niece’s father, also walked for two days, including through the treacherous jungles of the Darien Gap, a 60-mile stretch of rainforest that sits on the border of Colombia and Panama and connects Central and South America. The area is known to be dangerous, considering its tough terrain and steep mountains, but it has become a main thoroughfare for migrants making the journey to the southern border. 'It was exhausting because you fight to get out of the jungle, and (it was) traumatic because you see infinite amounts of things that are not told but are carried in the mind,' said Alvarez, who fell several times in the jungle. 'Once you start the trip, you don’t stop walking.' Anxiety filled Alvarez once she learned she was expecting, including fears she could lose her baby. Leticia Alvarez gave birth to her first child, Sophie, at Cook County Hospital in Chicago after making the journey from Venezuela. (Photo courtesy of Leticia Alvarez) She and Escola were separated from her relatives, who remained in Mexico City after they ran out of money. Alvarez and Escola crossed near McAllen, Texas, and surrendered to border officials. Alvarez was immediately released but said Escola was held at the Joe Corley Detention Center for seven months. She says she doesn’t know why. In late January, the Venezuelan government announced that it would halt repatriation flights from the U.S. as of Feb. 13 in response to the economic sanctions that the United States reimposed on Venezuela after previously lifting them in 2023, according to information provided by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico. With her husband in federal custody, Alvarez flew to Chicago and then traveled by car to Indianapolis, where she worked a construction job. She says she worked from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, cleaning and helping lay ceramic tiles and flooring in a newly constructed building along with other duties. She saw a doctor only once in three months, fearing the cost. Alvarez saw her first Chicago doctor in early January. Two months later, she gave birth to a baby girl, Sophia, who entered the world at 8 pounds, 9 ounces. Leticia Alvarez and her husband Lisandro Escola have been married since 2021 but were separated nearly all of Alvarez's pregnancy (Photo courtesy of Leticia Alvarez) Two weeks after that, Escola was freed from detention, but by then, Alvarez was carrying the emotional toll. 'Going through the pregnancy alone is very hard and very sad,' Alvarez told NewsNation. 'All you want is to be accompanied at that moment, and I was alone.' The costs of migrant pregnancy Over the past two years, the health system for Illinois’ largest county has treated more than 35,000 patients, including 670 pregnant women. The health system connects women to prenatal care and since 2022 has spent more than $30 million on migrant medical care, a spokeswoman for Cook County Health told NewsNation. Like Chicago-area locals facing economic hardship, migrants are eligible for financial assistance. Of those who apply, 99.5% receive a 100% discount, with the health system’s operating budget absorbing the costs, the spokeswoman said.

(Sandra Sanchez/Border Report Photo) In New York, which has processed more than 225,000 migrants, NYC Health + Hospitals assisted 300 babies born to asylum-seekers in 2023 while also contributing 2.1 million baby wipes, 400,000 diapers and 100,000 bottles of baby food and formula, National Public Radio reported last year. Border arrests rose slightly in August; Encounters at ports of entry hold steady In Denver, city officials have spent $90 million on migrants this year, some new arrivals who have given birth find difficulty adjusting. Denver Health, the city's safety net hospital, lost about $2 million in 2023, according to The Denver Post, which reported that the facility provided about $136 million in care it didn't receive compensation for. In the past year, the hospital provided medical care for 8,000 migrants from Central America, which made 20,000 visits to the hospital for care, including childbirth, the report said. The hospital's CEO told the newspaper that the facility isn't reimbursed by the state or federal government to cover the cost of migrant health care, which runs into the millions. Hospital officials did not immediately return an email from NewsNation seeking details on migrant childbirth costs absorbed by the health system. Ivanni Herrera was eight months pregnant when her family’s shelter assignment in Denver ended. She was told she could seek care at a local hospital, where the costs of her appointments and the baby’s delivery would be covered by Medicaid, according to The Associated Press. She declined the help. 'How could I sleep in a warm place when my son is cold on the street?' she told the AP. Denver city officials have committed to keeping families off the streets and, in turn, have helped thousands of migrants gain work authorization. As she waits, Herrera has no means of regular income. She told the AP she owes $18,000 in medical bills because she forgot to sign up for Medicaid. 'I’m afraid they’re going to deport me,' she said. What Chicago migrant care looks like Doctors working within Illinois’ Cook County Health System say they strive to provide the same care to migrants and asylum-seekers as anyone else. The biggest challenge, however, is higher levels of fractured care experienced by migrants because of the countries from where they came from and the amount of time that may have passed since their last appointment. 'A pregnancy really can’t wait for you to be in the best possible place to get your care,' Dr. Mary Arlandson, an attending physician and OBGYN at Chicago’s Stroger Hospital, told NewsNation. Mexican drug cartels are operating in Southern Colorado, DEA says Doctors are not able to make up for lost time. But they can assess what care a woman needs at the time and help them navigate a pregnancy that is stressful even without challenges like learning a new city, a lack of work and finding transportation to appointments. 'The type of person who would take that journey is probably categorically different than the person who decides they’re not up for that,' Arlandson said. Since Sophia’s birth, Alvarez has struggled at times with postpartum depression. The family resides in a rented room as they await permanent living conditions. While Alvarez remains home with the couple's daughter, Escola said that her husband works construction from time to time and handles all of the young family's expenses. Alvarez says Sophia is adjusting as her parents wait for necessities like work authorizations and immigration court appearances. She says that ever since she learned she was pregnant, she has only thought about the opportunities that await her daughter if she and her husband can do their part. For now, things are as good as they can be. 'The baby is fine, thank God,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/pregnant-migrants-childbirth-asylum/	2024-09-18T03:00:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/LeticiaAlvarez.jpg?w=715
Hezbollah is hit by a wave of exploding pagers that killed at lea...	BEIRUT (AP) — Pagers used by hundreds of members of the militant group Hezbollah exploded near-simultaneously Tuesday in Lebanon and Syria, killing at least nine people, including an 8-year-old girl, and wounding several thousand, officials said. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for what appeared to be a sophisticated remote attack. An American official said Israel briefed the United States on Tuesday after the conclusion of the operation, in which small amounts of explosive secreted in the pagers were detonated. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the information publicly. The Israeli military declined to comment. Among those wounded was Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon. The mysterious explosions came amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which have exchanged fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the war in Gaza. The pagers that blew up were apparently acquired by Hezbollah after the group’s leader ordered members in February to stop using cellphones, warning they could be tracked by Israeli intelligence. A Hezbollah official told The Associated Press the pagers were a new brand, but declined to say how long they had been in use. Taiwanese company Gold Apollo said Wednesday that it authorized its brand on the AR-924 pagers used by the Hezbollah militant group, but the devices were produced and sold by a company called BAC. At about 3:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, as people shopped for groceries, sat in cafes or drove cars and motorcycles in the afternoon traffic, the pagers in their hands or pockets started heating up and then exploding — leaving blood-splattered scenes and panicking bystanders. It appeared that many of those hit were members of Hezbollah, but it was not immediately clear if non-Hezbollah members also carried any of the exploding pagers. The blasts were mainly in areas where the group has a strong presence, particularly a southern Beirut suburb and in the Beqaa region of eastern Lebanon, as well as in Damascus, according to Lebanese security officials and a Hezbollah official. The Hezbollah official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. The explosions came hours after Israel’s internal security agency said it had foiled an attempt by Hezbollah to kill a former senior Israeli security official using a planted explosive device that could be remotely detonated. The United States 'was not aware of this incident in advance' and was not involved, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. 'At this point, we’re gathering information.' Experts said the pager explosions pointed to a long-planned operation, possibly carried out by infiltrating the supply chain and rigging the devices with explosives before they were delivered to Lebanon. Whatever the means, it targeted an extraordinary breadth of people with hundreds of small explosions — wherever the pager carrier happened to be — that left some maimed. One online video showed a man picking through produce at a grocery store when the bag he was carrying at his hip explodes, sending him sprawling to the ground and bystanders running. At overwhelmed hospitals, wounded were rushed in on stretchers, some with missing hands, faces partly blown away or gaping holes at their hips and legs, according to AP photographers. On a main road in central Beirut, a car door was splattered with blood and the windshield cracked. Lebanon Health Minister Firas Abiad told Qatar's Al Jazeera network at least nine people were killed, including an 8-year-old girl, and some 2,750 were wounded — 200 of them critically — by the explosions. Most had injuries in the face, hand, or around the abdomen. It appeared eight of the dead belonged to Hezbollah. The group issued a statement confirming at least two members were killed in the pager bombings. One of them was the son of a Hezbollah member in Parliament, according to the Hezbollah official who spoke anonymously. The group later issued announcements that six other members were killed Tuesday, though it did not specify how. 'We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression that also targeted civilians,' Hezbollah said, adding that Israel will 'for sure get its just punishment.' Iranian state-run IRNA news agency said that the country’s ambassador, Mojtaba Amani, was superficially wounded by an exploding pager and was being treated at a hospital. Previously, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had warned the group’s members not to carry cellphones, saying they could be used by Israel to track and target them. Sean Moorhouse, a former British Army officer and explosive ordnance disposal expert, said videos of the blasts suggested a small explosive charge — as small as a pencil eraser — had been placed into the devices. They would have had to have been rigged prior to delivery, very likely by Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, he said. Elijah J. Magnier, a Brussels-based senior political risk analyst, said he spoke with Hezbollah members who had examined pagers that failed to explode. What triggered the blasts, he said, appeared to be an error message sent to all the devices that caused them to vibrate, forcing the user to click on the buttons to stop the vibration. The combination detonated a small amount of explosives hidden inside and ensured that the user was present when the blast went off, he said. Israel has a long history of carrying out deadly operations well beyond its borders. This year, separate Israeli airstrikes in Beirut killed senior Hamas official Saleh Arouri and a top Hezbollah commander. A mysterious explosion in Iran, also blamed on Israel, killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ supreme leader. Israel has killed Hamas militants in the past with booby-trapped cellphones and it’s widely believed to have been behind the Stuxnet computer virus attack on Iran’s nuclear program in 2010. The pager bombings are likely to stoke Hezbollah's worries about vulnerabilities in security and communications as Israeli officials are threaten to escalate their monthslong conflict. The near-daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah have killed hundreds in Lebanon and several dozen in Israel, and have displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, deplored the attack and warned that it marks 'an extremely concerning escalation in what is an already unacceptably volatile context.' On Tuesday, Israel said that halting Hezbollah’s attacks in the north to allow residents to return to their homes is now an official war goal. Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said the focus of the conflict is shifting from Gaza to Israel’s north and that time is running out for a diplomatic solution with Hezbollah. ___ This story has been updated to correct the name of the Hezbollah lawmaker’s son killed by a pager blast. ___ Associated Press writers Hussein Malla, Hassan Ammar, Fadi Tawil and Sarah El Deeb in Beirut; Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran; Michael Biesecker in Washington; Josef Federman in Jerusalem; Zeke Miller in Washington; and Edith M.

Titan submersible CEO was 'a murderer': Titanic expedition leader	(NewsNation) — The founder of OceanGate, who died in the Titan submersible implosion, was called a 'murderer' by a Titanic expedition leader after testimony revealed new details about the implosion. G. Michael Harris, founder of RMS Titanic, said Tuesday on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush was 'a complete, unequivocal narcissist, and in the end, a murderer.' 'He killed those people. He knew better,' Harris said, referring to the five individuals who died when the Titan imploded during a dive to the Titanic wreckage in June 2023. Titan implosion hearing: Key witness testifies on Day 2 The comments came as the U.S. Coast Guard conducted hearings into the disaster. Former OceanGate employees have testified about alleged mismanagement and safety lapses in the Titan's construction. One employee described Rush as more focused on making money than science, saying they had 'no confidence whatsoever' in the way the submersible was being built. Harris claimed that industry professionals had long harbored concerns about the Titan. 'We all knew about this. We all tried to reach out to him,' he said. The expedition leader also questioned why regulatory agencies hadn't intervened, calling it 'the biggest clown show in history.' Diddy indictment: Music mogul denied bail following indictment The hearings, which began this week, are expected to continue for 10 days. They include testimony from former employees and examinations of OceanGate's practices. Coast Guard investigators have released new evidence, including a photo of the Titan's wreckage on the ocean floor and an animation of its final journey. The submersible's last communication, sent moments before losing contact, indicated it was 'dropping two weights.' Harris speculated that this action was likely to slow the Titan's descent rather than attempt an emergency ascent as previously thought. He added that the victims likely died instantly.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/missing-titanic-tourist-submarine/titan-submersible-ceo-murderer-titanic/	2024-09-17T16:11:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/snapshot-2-2.jpg?w=900
Samantha Tapp left a strange trail years after she vanished	Go behind the headlines as NewsNation’s 'Missing' investigates missing person cases from across the country, from cold cases to the latest developing stories. Tune into our latest case’s digital show each Friday where we speak to loved ones and examine the case. Subscribe to our newsletter here. (NewsNation) — The family of a missing teenager has searched for 20 excruciating years as a trail of secrets and sightings has failed to result in finding their daughter. The beauty of small-town Burleson, Texas, is that it's the ideal place to grow up and build a foundation ... at least for most. Samantha Tapp's sister said life in their home was rough. Samantha Tapp had difficult time at home Kendale Wyatt said life in the suburbs of Fort Worth, Texas, wasn't easy due to their adoptive mother. Mother-to-be Mischa Johnson vanished in Hawaiian paradise 'There obviously was abuse. She definitely believed in corporal punishment,' Wyatt said. 'It did tend to spiral out of control. Where she used to just use the paddle, she then would just lash out and smack us [with] whatever she had: phone cord, hanger, shoe.' Unmoored, the sisters were split up to live with relatives. It took an especially hard toll on 16-year-old Tapp. '[She was] hanging out with boys all the time. I know that she stole the car,' Wyatt said. Tapp, known to her friends and family by her nickname Sam, was eventually brought to live with Wyatt and their grandparents. Samantha Tapp was 16 when she disappeared.

(Kendale Wyatt)There were possible sightings of Samantha Tapp years after she disappeared. (Kendale Wyatt)Samantha Tapp's sister wants her to know any trouble she was in is long past. (Kendale Wyatt) She began working hard to keep getting good grades at Burleson High School. Still, she had struggles, in part because of challenges with her mental health. 'She was not on her medication anymore. She was on medication for bipolar disorder, but when she came to live with us, she wasn't on it anymore,' Wyatt said. 'But I also wasn't having to get her dressed in the morning and drag her to school. She seemed like she was thriving for a while.' As things were improving, Wyatt moved across town to live with her boyfriend and his family. That's where she was when she was surprised by a knock on the door. It was Tapp. 'She wanted to stay there. She said that she had gotten in an argument with my grandfather, and she didn't want to stay there anymore,' Wyatt said. 'I told her that she was going to have to go back, at least for now, until I could figure out a way for her to legally stay with me.' Asha Degree case: Police now believe missing NC girl was killed But what Wyatt didn't know at the time was that she'd never see her little sister again. 'I figured she would come back, but she didn't. I wish that I could have ran after her right away and just for her to stay because she didn't feel like she had to run away from me,' Wyatt said. Samantha Tapp disappears Private investigator Jason Watts says Tapp didn't vanish without a trace. A few days after she went missing in October of 2004, some of her clothing was taken from her grandparents' home. Cigarette butts were left behind. 'When I first began looking into the case, there was nothing,' Watts said. 'I mean, all you had was a flyer on the internet. That's it. No podcast, no news article online, nothing.' Tapp was classified as a runaway. Weeks passed, then months, and still, there was no word from the teenager. Watts wants to know why. 'What has become of her? Why has she not made contact with any family in almost 20 years?' Watts asked. Have a question about the case? Join the conversation by submitting it on this page, and we may answer it on the show.

He was brought on the case years later and says Burleson police did not get information on crucial sightings in real-time over the years. Clues left behind in search for Samantha Tapp NewsNation was told that Tarrant County deputies, who cover the area around Fort Worth, ran Tapp's name through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database. So did the police in Copperas Cove, Texas. One intriguing hit came in June of 2014 at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, where customs ran Tapp's name and birthdate. It happened nearly a decade after she disappeared. 'We ran these possible sightings down as far as we reasonably could. But unfortunately, just like with the Burleson PD, by the time we got to them, any records as to why these hits occurred has been lost,' Watts said. Remains identified as missing 3-year-old Elijah Vue In 2007, an uncle said Tapp called, asking if she could come live with him in San Antonio, Texas. 'Then, at some point, she called back and said never mind, she wasn't coming there, that she had met some man and was moving to Melbourne, Florida,' Wyatt said. 'Which is weird.' That story changed in 2015 when it was relayed to authorities again. In the later version, Tapp had actually shown up at her uncle's home with an infant in tow. But the uncle's wife didn't recognize her and reportedly turned her away. Those bits of information add up to a trail that's been difficult to follow. 'You could treat these things sort of like breadcrumbs, perhaps,' Watts said. 'The problem is, we are unable to verify them or confirm them, so we don't know that they are, in fact, breadcrumbs of Samantha Tapp.' Asking Samantha Tapp to come home Age-progressed photos show what Tapp might look like today as a woman in her 30s. Investigators and Wyatt are also working to let Tapp know that any trouble she might have been in as a minor has long passed. 'She is not wanted or being sought after for any reason,' Watts said. 'If that is the reason she is scared to come forward, she does not need to worry about that anymore.' YouTuber in court after allegedly violating order filed by mother of Sebastian Rogers What is waiting for Tapp is a loving sister. 'I missed having her present. Having been adopted and her being the only family that I had as a constant, it's hard not to have that now,' Wyatt said. NewsNation reached out to the Burleson Police Department but did not receive a response. Tapp would be 36 today and is described as a white woman with brown hair, likely between 5 feet, 4 inches and 5 feet, 6 inches in height.

Kamala Harris criticizes Trump rhetoric in NABJ interview	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris took questions Tuesday from the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia and addressed the controversial things her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has said on various issues. Among other topics, she talked about the threats of violence residents of the city of Springfield, Ohio, have faced after Trump made false claims about immigrants there kidnapping and eating people's pets. 5 takeaways from Harris’s interview with NABJ Saying 'there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe,' Harris also referenced Project 2025, which conservative organizations created as a blueprint for the next Republican presidential administration, as well as GOP-led efforts to restrict abortion access. Addressing the second assassination attempt against Trump, Harris said in the NABJ interview she feels safe under Secret Service protection. While she spoke with Trump on Tuesday and said he was glad he's safe, she added that his rhetoric on certain topics should be disqualifying. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs arrested in New York after indictment 'When you have that kind of microphone in front of you, you really ought to understand at a deep level that your words have meaning,' Harris said. 'Let’s turn the page and chart a new way forward and say you can’t have that microphone again.' Ashley Davis, a former official in the George W. Bush White House, and NewsNation political contributors A. Scott Bolden, Kurt Bardella and Denise Gitsham joined 'The Hill on NewsNation' to discuss harmful rhetoric. Bardella, a Democratic strategist, called out JD Vance for his misinformation about Haitian immigrants, pointing the finger at Republicans. 'This is not a both-sides issue,' he said. 'You don't get to lecture Democrats about rhetoric when you are the one advancing dangerous and disproven claims in Springfield that is resulting in people not being able to go to school because of bomb threats,' Bardella added. Davis countered that both sides have a responsibility to tone down their talking points, adding, 'I refuse to go on TV shows that argue, and we don't usually do this. I don't think it's right. ... I will never criticize Joe Biden, Barack Obama as a sitting president.' The economy and the Israel-Hamas war were also mentioned during the discussion. While Harris didn't say specifically how she would end it, she said the hostages need to come home, and there needs to be a path toward peace for Palestinians and Israel. This interview comes as the Harris campaign is spending time reaching out to both Black and young voters. Polls indicate that they feel energized about the Harris nomination. When surveyed by the NAACP, 78% of Black people said they felt as excited as they did when former President Barack Obama first ran for office. About 56% said they felt even more excited, NewsNation partner The Hill reports. Still, that same poll showed that over a quarter of younger Black men said they would support Harris' opponent, Republican Donald Trump, in this year's U.S. presidential election. How Americans can register to vote ahead of Election Day When it comes to reaching out to younger voters, the Harris-Walz campaign and Democratic National Convention are launching a weeklong effort to engage them. This includes going to college campuses. Obama even took to TikTok to talk with social media influencers about the importance of getting out there to register and vote. Pennsylvania, where the NABJ conference is being held, is also important to candidates running in the presidential election. Decision Desk HQ polling shows that Harris holds a small lead of 48.1% to Trump's 47.4%, making it a tight race.

Who else could be charged in the Diddy investigation?	(NewsNation) — A federal prosecutor said more people may be charged in connection to a federal indictment against Sean 'Diddy' Combs, saying that 'nothing is off the table.' 'We are not done,' U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said during a news conference Tuesday where he shared more details on Combs’ indictment. 'I can't take anything off the table. Anything is possible,' he said in response to a question about the possibility of more charges and defendants. 'Our investigation is very active and ongoing … developments are certainly foreseeable.' Combs was arrested in New York Monday and faces federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and transportation to engage in prostitution. 'We are disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution of Mr. Combs by the U.S. Attorney’s Office,' Combs attorney Marc Agnifilo said in a statement Monday. Timeline: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits Prosecutors allege Combs used the resources of his music empire to create 'a criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.' They also accuse him of having used his employees to help him engage in these activities. 'I definitely think more is coming,' Richard Schoenstein, a trial attorney and legal analyst, told NewsNation. 'The indictment said he did all these things in conjunction with other people, but it doesn’t name them, it does not name the co-conspirators … so there has to be more down the road.' 'It will be interesting to see who will become a defendant, who becomes a witness and who comes forward as a witness cooperating,' he said. Schoenstein added that Combs’ associates should be very concerned right now. 'The indictment alleges his associates helped him commit heinous crimes,' he said. 'If you're one of those associates, you have a lot to think about' on how you will go about participating in this investigation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/who-else-charged-diddy-investigation/	2024-09-17T10:27:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/664e237f8bd428.09397242.jpeg?w=900
What we know about the Diddy investigation	(NewsNation) — Months after two homes belonging to hip-hop mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs were raided, he has been charged with federal racketeering and sex trafficking. Department of Homeland Security agents conducted the raids March 25 at Combs’ multimillion-dollar mansion in Los Angeles and his Miami waterfront home. The raids came as the producer faces a mounting list of civil lawsuits that allege abuse and sexual assault by multiple victims spanning over 30 years. Combs was arrested Monday and the grand jury indictment unsealed Tuesday. Combs has denied all the allegations. Combs is being held in custody after being denied bail twice. Diddy indicted on sex trafficking, racketeering charges Diddy faces multiple charges Prosecutors laid out the case against Combs in a grand jury indictment. He is accused of using his music empire to engage in sex trafficking and accused of having a pattern of abusing women. The indictment says Combs often lured victims by promising a romantic relationship before using threats, intimidation and abuse to get them to engage in various sexual activities. Those included so-called 'Freak Offs' where victims were directed to engage in extended sex acts with male sex workers on film. Prosecutors allege Combs drugged victims during those sessions and sometimes kept the footage without the victim being aware he was doing so. They also say the physical exertion was such that Combs and victims often required IV fluids afterward. Diddy arrested Following his arrest, Combs' attorney, Marc Agnifilo, issued a statement asking the public to reserve judgment until all the facts are in and noting that Combs has cooperated with the investigation. 'Sean 'Diddy' Combs is a music icon, self-made entrepreneur, loving family man, and proven philanthropist who has spent the last 30 years building an empire, adoring his children, and working to uplift the Black community. He is an imperfect person but he is not a criminal,' Agnifilo said. Suge Knight: FBI gave Affleck tapes of J-Lo from Diddy raids . Why were Diddy's homes raided? While federal authorities had given sparse public comment as to what prompted the raids, NewsNation affiliate WPIX reported at the time they were part of an ongoing sex trafficking investigation. Authorities had also reportedly widened their probe to include potential witness intimidation, sexual assault and firearms violations, according to a New York Post report.

Combs’ sons, Justin and Christian 'King' Combs, were handcuffed during the raid at their father’s Los Angeles home. Justin's mother, Misa Hylton, said she has retained high-profile attorney Jeffrey Lichtman to look into the 'excessive use of force' used on Justin and Christian during the raid, which she called 'unnecessary and certainly not required by this search warrant,' in an Instagram post April 2. '(The force) used against my sons Justin and Christian is deplorable. If these were the sons of a non-Black celebrity, they would not have been handled with the same aggression,' she wrote. 'The attempt to humiliate and terrorize these innocent young BLACK MEN is despicable!' Hylton also posted security footage from the raid showing heavily armed federal agents entering Combs’ home and pushing Christian, who had his hands above his head, against a wall while handcuffing him.

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File) Law enforcement arrested Combs’ alleged drug 'mule,' Brendan Paul, 25, who was traveling with the producer at the Miami-Opa locka Executive Airport the same day the raids took place. Paul, a former Syracuse University basketball player, was arrested on felony charges of possession of suspected cocaine and possession of suspected marijuana candy, per an arrest affidavit. The affidavit adds that officers found cocaine and edibles in Paul's travel bags. What accusations is Diddy facing? In addition to the indictment, the music producer has been slapped with multiple civil suits in the last year, each containing a multitude of disturbing accusations. Much of the content in the lawsuits matches with the case prosecutors have laid out against Combs. Singer Casandra 'Cassie' Ventura, who had been in a decadelong relationship with Combs in the early 2000s, filed a lawsuit in New York federal court last November alleging sex trafficking, human trafficking, sexual battery, sexual assault and gender-motivated violence, among other causes of action. ’19 Kids and Counting’ star accused of fraud, posing as licensed contractor Ventura alleged that she became lured into and eventually trapped in a pattern of abuse involving forced drug use, rape, battery and forced sex acts with male sex workers. She settled the lawsuit with her former partner one day later, but her suit spawned several more alleged victims to come forward. Hotel surveillance video from 2016 obtained by CNN appeared to show Combs violently attacking, kicking and shoving Ventura at the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in the Century City neighborhood of Los Angeles. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. In the video, Combs is seen running in a towel after Ventura who is seen standing in front of an elevator bank. He aggressively grabs and drags her down and then kicks her before picking up her luggage. He is then seen dragging her on the floor back to a hotel room as she braces her head. Two days later, Combs released an apology video admitting he beat Ventura in the hotel hallway. Combs said in the video, which he posted to Instagram and Facebook, that he was 'truly sorry' and that his actions were 'inexcusable.' 'I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I’m disgusted now,' the music mogul said. 'It’s so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,' Combs said, adding, 'I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I’m so sorry.' Ventura broke her silence almost a week after the release of the video saying she 'will always be recovering from my past,' in an Instagram post. 'It takes a lot of heart to tell the truth out of a situation that you were powerless in,' she said. 'I offer my hand to those that are still living in fear. Reach out to your people, don’t cut them off. No one should carry this weight alone.' She also asked that everyone 'open your heart to believing victims the first time' and that 'Domestic Violence is THE issue.' TMZ reported Ventura worked with federal investigators for weeks, potentially even before the raids. The outlet reported that she may have helped investigators establish probable cause to obtain search warrants. In February, music producer Rodney Jones filed a lawsuit alleging Combs coerced him to solicit prostitutes and pressured him to have sex with them. In other lawsuits, a woman said the rap producer trafficked and raped her two decades ago when she was 17. Another woman said Combs filmed his sexual assault on her and later used it as 'revenge porn' when she was a student at Syracuse University. Combs was also sued by Dawn Richard, a member of his former band Danity Kane, for sexual assault and years of 'inhumane working conditions.' In her suit, Richard says that Combs withheld her earnings and subjected her to 'years of inhumane working conditions which included groping, assault, and false imprisonment, among other violations.' Combs' lawyers filed a motion to dismiss some claims filed by the former Syracuse students April 26, stating that he cannot be sued because certain laws didn't exist when the 1991 allegations were made against him. He also filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit accusing him of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old in 2003. Combs and his attorneys have denied all of the lawsuits’ allegations. Kate Middleton and King Charles ‘not doing very well’: Sources In September, Combs was hit with a massive $100 million default judgment after failing to dispute sexual assault allegations made in lawsuit by a Michigan inmate, Derrick Lee Cardello-Smith, 51. Cardello-Smith filed a lawsuit accusing Combs of drugging and sexually assaulting him at a party in Detroit in 1997. Combs was due to appear in Lenawee County Circuit Court for a virtual hearing on but when he failed to show up, a judge awarded Cardello-Smith a multi-million default judgment. Roger Bands, who worked as Combs' head of security from 2003 to 2012, said during an appearance on NewsNation’s 'CUOMO' that his ex-boss flew women across state lines for parties and invited men he’d 'never seen before' into the hotel rooms. In a documentary on the allegations surrounding the music producer that was released by TMZ, former Danity Kane singer Aubrey O’Day said Combs' 'mistreatment was enough to have changed the course and direction of my entire life.' Despite the disturbing allegations, BET News host Marc Lamont Hill noted in the documentary that the entertainment industry has been 'eerily and noticeably quiet' during the investigation into Combs. Music producer Suge Knight, who co-founded rival label Death Row Records and is serving a 28-year prison sentence, offered support to the embattled music mogul, saying he felt bad for Combs' family. Upon first hearing the allegations, Knights said he felt that it was 'a bad day for hip-hop, a bad day for the culture,' and that 'it makes us all look bad.' Diddy has been implicated by Tupac's alleged killer The man charged in rapper Tupac Shakur's 1996 killing, Duane 'Keefe D' Davis, claimed Combs allegedly offered $1 million for Shakur's murder. Davis has made allegations against Combs for over 15 years, but he has not been named in any investigation connected to Shakur's killing Court papers filed in the case against Davis include several interviews of Davis conducted by law enforcement in the last two decades. Prosecutors included a transcript of a 'Surreptitiously Recorded Interview' with Davis by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police in 2009 where he repeated his claims about Combs' alleged connection to the murder. Davis claims Combs allegedly disliked Shakur because the rapper called him out on his songs.

The outlet initially reported the aircraft was on the ground in Antigua. It’s unknown if Combs was on the plane. 'Antigua, as we know, is an extradition country, so probably not the best place to flee to if Diddy was indeed on that plane if that’s where he is,' former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani said during an interview on 'Banfield.' Weeks after, Combs was reportedly spotted at Topgolf in Miami with his 17-year-old daughters. One day later, fitness coach Wes Watson posted a picture of himself and Combs at the Pura Vida restaurant in Miami. 'Came to just GRAB a SHOT of ESPRESSO and I Ran into DIDDY‼️,' Watson wrote. On Easter Sunday, Combs posted a picture of his daughter, writing, 'HAPPY EASTER from Baby Love' as the caption. Combs shared a cryptic video on his social media in early May, which shows him standing on an overcast beach with heavy winds over a narration saying, 'Steady in the storm. Looks bad, looks tough, but remains steady in the storm.' The video also showed the camera moving down a white hallway, with scenes of him hugging someone and praying in a group circle. 'Not hysterical. Not frantic. Not anxious. Not fretful,' a voice states over the scenes. He lost the honorary 'Sean Diddy Combs Day' once proclaimed by the Miami Beach Commission in light of a turbulent few months. A resolution stated that the city commission and mayor were rescinding the proclamation as it was 'no longer in harmony with the City’s values of safety, community well-being, and respect.' On Sept. 16, Combs was taken into custody in New York. Diddy denied bail Combs will stay in jail as he awaits trial. After having it denied on Tuesday, Sept. 17, lawyers for Combs offered a new judge a $50 million bail package that included GPS monitoring and strict limitations on visitors. That was rejected Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Andrew L. Carter, who ruled Combs’ plan was 'insufficient' to ensure the safety of the community and the integrity of his case. Carter concurred with prosecutors who found that 'no condition or set of conditions' governing his release could guard against the risk of Combs threatening or harming witnesses — one of the other central charges in his case.
