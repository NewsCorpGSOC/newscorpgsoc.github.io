Israeli airstrikes rock southern suburbs of Beirut and cut off a ...	BEIRUT (AP) — Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates. Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah. The blasts overnight rocked Beirut’s southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers (miles) away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday. The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details. The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon’s Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces. Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous. It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between Sept. 23 — when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon — and Sept. 30. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon’s minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there. Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence. Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their Oct. 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/top-headlines/ap-top-headlines/ap-israeli-airstrikes-rock-southern-suburbs-of-beirut-and-cut-off-a-key-crossing-into-syria/	2024-10-03T23:51:41-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66ff91b707c188.16024944.jpeg?w=900
Mixed verdict for 3 Memphis officers convicted in Tyre Nichols' f...	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Three former Memphis police officers were convicted Thursday in the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols, but were acquitted of the harshest charges they faced for a death that sparked national protests and calls for broad changes in policing. Jurors deliberated for about six hours before coming back with the mixed verdict for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith. All were convicted of witness tampering related to the cover-up of the beating, but Bean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges. Haley was acquitted of violating Nichols’ civil rights causing death, but convicted of the lesser charge of violating his civil rights causing bodily injury. He was also convicted of a conspiracy to witness tamper charge that the others were acquitted of. The court remained silent as the verdicts were read. The judge ordered all three officers to be taken into custody. He planned to hold a hearing Monday to hear from the defense lawyers about releasing them pending sentencing. The witness tampering charges carry possible sentences of up to 20 years in prison. The civil rights charge against Haley carries up to 10 years in prison. They had faced up to life in prison if convicted on the harshest charges. The verdict marked a partial setback for prosecutors who were unable to land a conviction for civil rights violations for two officers who played an active role in the encounter. Jurors repeatedly watched graphic clips from police video that showed the officers punch and kick Nichols and hit him with a police baton just steps from his home, as the 29-year-old called out for his mother. In a statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who oversees the Justice Department’s civil rights division, said 'Tyre Nichols should be alive today.' 'We hope this prosecution provides some measure of comfort as the law enforcement officers tied to his death have been held accountable,' Clarke said. Bean and Smith were seen on video wrestling with Nichols and holding his arms, while also hitting him, but the jury was not convinced those actions amounted to civil rights violations. An FBI agent said Smith told him he punched Nichols, but defense lawyers argued Bean and Smith were merely slapping Nichols’ hands away as they tried to put handcuffs on him. Rodney Wells, Nichols’ stepfather, told The Associated Press outside the courtroom: 'A win is a win. They’re all going to jail.' Five officers were charged in Nichols’ death, but two pleaded guilty and testified against members of their old crime suppression unit. Prosecutors argued that Nichols was beaten for running from a traffic stop, saying it was part of a common police practice referred to in officer slang as a 'street tax' or 'run tax. ' They said the officers lied — to a supervisor, to medical professionals attending to Nichols and in required written reports — about the extent of the force they used. 'This has been a long journey for our family,' RowVaughn Wells, Nichols' mother, told reporters. 'I’m actually in shock right now because I still can’t believe all the stuff that’s going on. But we’re happy that they all have been convicted and they have been arrested.' Smith's lawyer declined to comment. Attorneys for Bean and Haley did not respond to requests for comment. Nichols, who was Black, ran from the traffic stop despite being hit with pepper spray and a Taser. The five officers, who were fired after the beating, also are Black. Some of the most emotional testimony at trial came from one of the officers, Desmond Mills, who took a plea deal in which prosecutors call for up to 15 years in prison. He testified in tears that he was sorry, that he left Nichols’ young son fatherless and that he wishes he stopped the punches. Later, he testified that he went along with a cover-up in hopes that Nichols would survive and the whole thing would 'blow over.' Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating. His son is now 7 years old. The other officer who reached a deal with prosecutors, Emmitt Martin, testified that Nichols was 'helpless' while officers pummeled him, and that afterward the officers understood 'they weren’t going to tell on me, and I wasn’t going to tell on them.' Under his plea agreement, prosecutors will suggest a prison sentence of up to 40 years. Defense attorneys sought to portray Martin as a principal aggressor. Martin testified Nichols was not a threat, yet he acknowledged punching and kicking Nichols in the head. Mills' lawyer declined to comment. Martin's attorney did not immediately respond to a phone message. The police video shows the officers milling about and talking as Nichols struggles with his injuries. An autopsy report shows he died from blows to the head. The report describes brain injuries, and cuts and bruises on his head and other areas. With the federal criminal trial complete, other investigations and court action still aren't settled. The five officers also have been charged with second-degree murder in state court, where they pleaded not guilty, although Mills and Martin are expected to change their pleas. A trial date in state court has not been set. The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a 'patterns and practices' investigation into how Memphis officers use force and conduct arrests, and whether the department in the majority-Black city engages in racially discriminatory policing. The Justice Department also has a separate review concerning use of force, de-escalation strategies and specialized units within Memphis police. Pastor Earle Fisher, a Memphis activist who has long called for investigations of the city's police, said he hopes the probes 'provide for us the remedies we so rightly deserve.' Additionally, Nichols’ mother filed a $550 million lawsuit against the city and its police chief. Ben Crump and Anthony Romanucci, lawyers for Nichols' family, said the verdicts 'bring a measure of accountability for his senseless and tragic death.' 'Our fight for justice for Tyre is far from over,' the lawyers said in a joint statement. _____ Mattise reported from Nashville, Tennessee.

North Carolina election officials grapple with storm's impact	(NewsNation) — Western North Carolina is one of the areas hardest hit by the remnants of Hurricane Helene; Asheville and surrounding towns in the Blue Ridge Mountains experienced record-breaking floods. As a result of the storm, people in the area lost power, water and cellphone service, and damage to hundreds of roads left Asheville virtually cut off from the rest of the world. Reporter Bob Buckley from NewsNation affiliate WGHP says the impact of Helene in North Carolina could have a 'massive' impact on the election. 'Early voting is supposed to start in two weeks. I don't see any way that happens in most of these counties up in the mountains,' Buckley said on NewsNation's Swing State Spotlight segment on 'The Hill.' 'Trump won those (most impacted) 14 counties by more than 90,000 votes in 2020. But he only won the state overall by 75,000 votes. So getting all those voters that are now displaced is gonna be massive to the Republicans for this November,' Buckley added. Helene first responders resume search and rescue for the missing North Carolina election officials say they will do everything in their power to ensure that voters in the crucial presidential swing state will be able to cast their ballots despite the devastation of Hurricane Helene and the destruction of basic infrastructure only about a month before the November election. Helene, which battered large areas across the Southeast late last week with torrential rain and strong winds and massive storm surges along the Gulf Coast, caused devastation 'beyond belief' in western North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said during a media briefing Tuesday. 'This disaster is unlike anything our state has ever experienced,' he said. The level of destruction could have far-reaching implications beyond the immediate damage to the flooded communities, especially if it has any impact on voting.

RSV, COVID, flu shots: Who should get vaccinated, according to th...	SHREVEPORT, La. (KTAL/KMSS)— Fall is here, and so is the season for respiratory infections. The CDC is urging everyone to get up to date on vaccines to minimize the side effects and potential hospitalizations. Dr. Nirav D. Shah, Principal Deputy Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there were about 800,000 hospitalizations for COVID, RSV, and influenza in 2023, and they would like to see that number lowered this year. US school-entry vaccination rates fall as exemptions keep rising 'The vaccines have arrived. And so if you if you do one thing this week or this weekend, try to take a minute to schedule time to go get you and your family, your vaccines,' Shah said. Shah said that a common thread in the number of those hospitalized last year was that 95 percent were unvaccinated. In addition to vaccinations, Shah emphasizes the importance of avoiding gatherings when you do not feel well and shares an anecdote about his family's plan to stay healthy. 'One of the things that we're trying to do in our family is to establish that so that if there's a Sunday dinner at somebody's house, but you're not feeling well, don't feel the need to come. There's always going to be another dinner. There's always going to be another church picnic. There's always going to be another school meeting. But if you go and spread a disease that can hurt a lot of people, particularly folks who are older, well, that's not going to be in the spirit of this time of the year.' 200 chemicals linked to breast cancer found in food packaging: Study While flu and COVID vaccines are recommended for anyone six months of age and up, Shah says the CDC has a different set of guidelines for RSV vaccinations. The RSV shot is a little bit different for anyone 75 and over. They should get that shot. Now, for folks who are between the ages of 60 and 74. It really depends on whether you've got some health conditions that might make it harder for your body to deal with RSV if you got it,' Shah said. 'So maybe you've got asthma, maybe you've got something like heart disease or hypertension. If you've got one of those conditions, it's also worth it to get the RSV shot.' When is the best time for flu or COVID vaccines to have a healthy holiday? Shah recommends getting vaccinated when it suits your schedule; however, your immune system needs time to acclimate, so a little lead time before holiday gatherings is recommended. 'Like any medicine or measure, vaccines take a little while to reach maximum effectiveness. With these vaccines, it's about two weeks or so before they are maximally effective. Now, don't worry, because even while they're building up, your body is still enjoying the benefits of protection. But I recommend folks take the month of October.' Ozempic, Wegovy shortages create anxiety, hunt for alternatives Shah said in Louisiana, only about 14 percent of residents were vaccinated against COVID, while about 36 percent received flu shots last year and says they would like to see those numbers climb in 2024. What's the difference between vaccines this year versus previous versions? Shah explained the differences in vaccine formulas by analogizing software updates to phones or other digital devices. 'The core of those vaccines, the blueprint that they work off of, hasn't changed. All that has changed is that they've gotten a little bit of a software update. And that software update means that they are that much more effective against the versions or the strains of the viruses that are circulating right now. Again, they're still fundamentally the same, but they've just gotten that little software update to keep them timely.' Ultimately, Shah says the vaccines are intended to minimize the effects we feel when contracting one of these viral infections; and the overall goal is keeping one another safe, especially elders, those with pre-existing illnesses, and young children. 'When one of us is that much more safe, all of us are that much more safe,' Shah concluded. For more information, visit vaccines.gov .

Blue Ridge Parkway to be closed indefinitely, National Park Servi...	NORTH CAROLINA (WJZY) -- The country's most-visited national park site, Blue Ridge Parkway, will remain closed indefinitely, the National Park Service said Wednesday. The closure affects the entire length of the Blue Ridge Parkway, though some parts were hit harder than others by storm damage. It comes right as the region and scenic road typically see a boom in tourism, as weather cools and the leaves change colors. Helene first responders resume search and rescue for the missing National park officials said the closure will be in place as crews continue their initial assessment of the damage from Tropical Storm Helene. The 469-mile scenic road starts at the Shenandoah National Park and ends at Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The Parkway winds through the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia and North Carolina, two states that suffered serious flooding and storm damage. A photo shared by the National Park Service shows tree clearing efforts on the Blue Ridge Parkway. (Photo: NPS) Rescue operations were ongoing nearly a week after the storm barreled through the region. The efforts were especially challenging in the mountains of North Carolina, where remote communities were hard to reach with all the washed out roads. The death toll across the Southeast topped 200 on Thursday, and hundreds were still reported missing. The search for the missing hits snags at every corner as Helene’s death toll tops 200 Initially, two sections of the Parkway were closed ahead of the storm, but the full length was shut down on Saturday. The National Park Service said it has activated an incident management team, which is assessing damage and stabilizing park resources. There is no scheduled date for reopening any parts of the road.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/blue-ridge-parkway-closed-indefinitely/	2024-10-03T15:37:29-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP21323701619270-e1727981615655.jpg?w=800
Twin babies who died alongside their mother in Georgia are younge...	Obie Williams could hear babies crying and branches battering the windows when he answered his daughter’s daily phone call last week as Hurricane Helene tore through her rural Georgia town. Kobe Williams, 27, and her newborn twin boys were hunkering down at their trailer home in Thomson, Georgia, and starting to fear for their safety. She promised her father she would heed his advice to shelter in the bathroom with her month-old babies until the storm passed. Minutes later, she was no longer answering her family’s calls. One of her brothers dodged fallen trees and downed power lines to check on her later that day, and he could barely bear to tell his father what he saw. A large tree had crashed through the roof, crushing Kobe and causing her to fall on top of infant sons Khyzier and Khazmir. All three were found dead. 'I'd seen pictures when they were born and pictures every day since, but I hadn't made it out there yet to meet them,' Obie Williams told The Associated Press days after the storm ravaged eastern Georgia. 'Now I'll never get to meet my grandsons. It's devastating.' The babies, born Aug. 20, are the youngest known victims of a storm that had claimed 200 lives across Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia and the Carolinas as of Thursday. Among the other young victims are a 7-year-old girl and a 4-year-old boy from about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south in Washington County, Georgia. In the elder Williams' home city of Augusta, 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of his daughter's home in Thomson, power lines stretched along the sidewalks, tree branches blocked the roads and utility poles lay cracked and broken. The debris left him trapped in his neighborhood near the South Carolina border for a little over a day after the storm barreled through. Kobe, a single mother nursing newborns, had told her family it wasn't possible for her to evacuate with such young babies, her father said. Many of his 14 other children are still without power in their homes across Georgia. Some have sought refuge in Atlanta, and others have traveled to Augusta to see their father and mourn together. They are waiting for the bodies to be released by the county coroner and for roads to be cleared before arranging a funeral. Williams described his daughter as a lovable, social and strong young woman. She always had a smile on her face and loved to make people laugh, he said. She was studying to be a nursing assistant but had taken time off from school to give birth to her sons. 'That was my baby,' her father said. 'And everybody loved her.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/ap-twin-babies-who-died-alongside-their-mother-in-georgia-are-youngest-known-hurricane-helene-victims/	2024-10-03T14:04:32-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66ff075e146112.92067385.jpeg?w=900
Starlink internet service being sent to places hit by Helene	(NewsNation) — As part of its response to Hurricane Helene, the federal government is using the Starlink satellite systems created by SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Around 200 people have died because of the storm, and that number is expected to rise. Hundreds are still missing and without power or cell service. After it made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane last week, Helene weakened to a tropical storm, but wind and rain still caused significant damage to several Southeast states, including Georgia and the Carolinas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said so far, 60 Starlink units have been sent to multiple places devastated by the hurricane. Of these, 40 are going to North Carolina, which has been hit particularly badly, and more are on the way, according to FEMA. SC pilot flying volunteer supply and rescue missions ordered out of Lake Lure under arrest threat Starlink, a portable satellite internet service, has previously been deployed in areas such as Guam, Hawaii and Alaska that have also seen damage from natural disasters. 'Since the Hurricane Helene disaster, SpaceX has sent as many Starlink terminals as possible to help areas in need,' Musk said on X. 'Earlier today, @realDonaldTrump alerted me to additional people who need Starlink Internet in North Carolina. We are sending them terminals right away.' On Truth Social, former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump thanked Musk. 'Great news. So badly needed in North Carolina, where there is virtually no communication. Starlink was the perfect answer, and Elon Musk, as usual, came through,' he wrote Wednesday. Musk has endorsed Trump in the 2024 election. Trump visited Georgia on Monday, where he was critical of the federal government as well as Democratic nominee for president Kamala Harris' response to Hurricane Helene. David Brown disappeared while walking in Florida President Joe Biden and Harris, meanwhile, visited North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia on Wednesday. Biden praised the Democratic governor of North Carolina and Republican governor of South Carolina for putting politics aside in the wake of disasters. 'Our job is to help as many people as we can as quickly as we can and as thoroughly as we can,' Biden said. The Biden-Harris administration, FEMA said, has given Hurricane Helene survivors more than $20 million in funds. In a press release, FEMA said more than 5,000 employees from the federal workforce are deployed to areas struck by disaster, including 1,500 from their agency. 'To date, FEMA has shipped over 9.3 million meals, more than 11.2 million liters of water, 150 generators and more than 260,000 tarps to the region,' the press release said. The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/starlink-internet-service-hurricane-helene/	2024-10-03T12:50:08-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/09/64ff988992fa67.53963547.jpeg?w=900
Hurricane Helene renews calls for Congress to pass disaster fundi...	The widespread devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene is upping the pressure on lawmakers for a looming end-of-year fight over disaster funding. While funding negotiators on both sides acknowledge the need for additional resources for disaster recovery, it has already been a point of contention in spending talks and the dynamic could continue when a divided Congress returns from recess. President Biden on Monday said he may request Congress reconvene during the October break to pass emergency supplemental funding for storm recovery, and lawmakers from hard-hit states signaled a desire to do so. But it appears unlikely Congress will return early, with lawmakers spread across the country campaigning ahead of November and GOP leaders saying the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding included in last week’s stopgap spending bill is sufficient to address Helene. 'Congress has previously provided the funds it needs to respond, so we will make sure that those resources are appropriately allocated,' Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Tuesday. And House Appropriations Committee Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said this week the funding legislation Congress passed has ensured FEMA 'has sufficient resources in the near term.' Congress passed a three-month stopgap last week to prevent government funding from lapsing ahead of a Sept. 30 deadline to avert a shutdown. Notably missing from the bipartisan agreement, which was passed a day before Helene made landfall in Florida, was billions of dollars in additional funding for FEMA’s disaster relief fund (DRF). Appropriators said the deal instead allows for the agency to use the fund’s resources faster for disaster response for the duration of the stopgap, allowing FEMA access to draw from roughly $20 billion starting Oct. 1. But funding negotiators on both sides have acknowledged the need for more resources in the months ahead. Sen. Katie Britt (Ala.), top Republican on the subcommittee that oversees funding for FEMA, said in a statement this week that resources made available in the fund will be 'pushed out the door through existing processes,' but she added the DRF will 'need additional funding in the coming months for the remainder of fiscal year 2025.' 'We will undoubtedly learn more about short- and long-term recovery needs in the coming days and weeks, and I look forward to hearing from the administration on what additional resources are needed to aid our fellow Americans who have lost loved ones, livelihoods, property, and possessions due to Hurricane Helene.' However, disaster aid was a thorny subject for a few in the latest round of spending talks, with some Democrats fuming last month as congressional leaders jammed through a stopgap they said misses the mark on dollars for disaster relief. 'This bill risks another depletion of FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund,' Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said at the time. 'Spending down next year’s funds early, especially as we deal with more catastrophic weather, threatens to create a perfect storm by our next funding deadline.' House Republicans had previously included $10 billion in additional funding for FEMA as part of their initial six-month stopgap offer. But the funding fell out amid calls from hardline conservatives pushing for more to be done to curb government spending. Other Republicans also expressed confidence that the funding in the shorter stopgap plan that was eventually adopted was sufficient. 'It provides for up to $20 billion and we're not going to run out of money to respond to natural disasters. They didn't add money, but we can use it faster, and it resolves any concerns I have,' Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told The Hill last week. 'We'll talk about it in December, particularly if we keep having natural disasters,' Kennedy said. But since the hurricane hit, killing at least 150 people, lawmakers have piled up calls for Congress to come back immediately and pass a supplemental funding bill. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) on Tuesday told reporters 'My view is we should come back and get the job done.' Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) on Monday said that the Senate should 'immediately reconvene' to pass a disaster supplemental aid package. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a post on X that it is 'imperative that Congress reconvene to pass a supplemental aid package for the damage done to the Southeast by Hurricane Helene and also to provide missile defense assistance to Israel.' While FEMA has said it has the funds to cover its response to Hurricane Helene, officials have warned the agency could have to again cut back on funding in the coming months, potentially at the expense of reimbursing communities for public assistance and hazard mitigation projects. The agency had similarly cut back earlier this year as funds ran down. 'We went into Immediate Needs Funding as our Disaster Relief Fund was running low,' FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters last week, adding that by doing so, $9 billion worth of projects had to be put on hold. Criswell said at the time that once the stopgap funding measure that passed last week to avoid a government shutdown takes effect, the agency will be able to pay for those projects for the time being. But, she added that without supplemental funding from Congress, FEMA will likely need to dip back into the Immediate Need Funding (INF) – and put more projects on hold — by January. Yucel Ors, the legislative director for public safety and crime prevention at the National League of Cities, said that without supplemental funding, putting those projects on hold could hamper recovery efforts in the months after a disaster takes place. 'They're still clearing up debris. They're still building the infrastructure, the roads, the communication systems, the power lines and everything else. Those take a long time in that recovery process,' Ors told The Hill. 'When FEMA puts in the INF limitations, that funding could be frozen until FEMA gets the additional tranche of money from Congress,' he added. 'That would mean all those recovery processes, either local governments or the states, have to put up that money and hopefully get reimbursed by FEMA down the road or it could mean that these recovery processes could take a much longer time.' Ors noted that a longer recovery process could have negative impacts to cities, not only because it takes longer to build up the infrastructure itself, but also because governments often take out loans for recovery and delays in reimbursements could mean they’re paying higher interest rates. This could also have knock-on effects, limiting the other services a local government has to offer. 'The more of this money that goes towards disaster recovery, the harder it is going to [be] for cities to actually fund those other projects that they might be working on to make their communities safer, to make their communities stronger and be economically competitive,' Ors said. Also at risk without supplemental appropriations is funding for projects that help localities proactively prepare for extreme weather events — things like storm drain management, levee fortification and wildfire barriers. 'If these programs are cut back, we do know that the cost of disaster recovery goes up,' Ors said. He called for FEMA to be 'fully funded' through a supplemental package. Other advocacy groups made similar calls. 'With payments from key FEMA programs on hold, communities still reeling from previous disasters may opt to hold off on permanent recovery work such as repairing damaged facilities, restoring roads and bridges, or rebuilding infrastructure to be more resilient against future disasters,' Julie Seger, government relations and policy director of the American Flood Coalition, told The Hill in a written statement. 'Congress must provide consistent, long-term [Disaster Relief Fund] resources to ensure FEMA can continue lifesaving emergency operations without delaying hard-fought recoveries for communities across the country,' Seger added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/hurricane-helene-renews-calls-for-congress-to-pass-disaster-funding/	2024-10-03T11:23:58-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/helene_aid_093024ap01_w.jpg?w=900
Mortgage calculator: Calculate your monthly payment	(NewsNation) — Mortgage rates are at their lowest level in two years — and could fall further — but interest payments are just one of the costs that come with a mortgage. Buyers also have to take into account property taxes and insurance — both of which contribute to the overall monthly payment. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits The length of your mortgage, also known as the loan term, will also impact the size of your payment. Typically, a longer loan term means smaller monthly payments but higher interest costs, while a shorter loan term requires higher monthly payments but less interest over time.

The basic components of a monthly mortgage payment are PITI: Principal, Interest, Taxes and Insurance. Principal or Loan Amount: The amount you borrow from a lender to buy a home. Each month, a portion of your payment goes toward repaying that loan. Over time, those payments lower your mortgage balance until the loan is fully repaid. Annual Interest Rate: This is what the lender charges you for lending you money. When people refer to 'mortgage rates,' they're talking about the interest rate on a home loan. Part of your monthly payment goes toward paying interest, especially at the beginning of your mortgage because your loan balance is higher. Home mortgages: Here’s the difference between prequalified and preapproved Taxes or Annual Property Tax: Typically, your monthly mortgage payment will include property taxes, which are calculated by the government and based on your home's value. These payments are generally put in an escrow account and then your lender pays them on your behalf when they're due. Homeowner's insurance: This protects you and your lender if there's damage to your home, like a fire or burglary. Your mortgage payment usually includes one-twelfth of the annual cost, which goes into an escrow account. When your insurance is due, the lender pays from that account. Additionally, prospective homeowners may want to consider factoring private mortgage insurance into their monthly total. This is not included in NewsNation's calculator but can also be considered part of your overall mortgage costs. Private mortgage insurance: If your down payment is less than 20%, there's a good chance you'll have to pay for mortgage insurance, which protects the lender if you can't keep up with your monthly payments. As with property taxes and homeowners insurance, you'll pay one-twelfth of your annual premium each month into an escrow account. What are the different types of mortgages? Fixed-rate mortgages are the most common type of home loan. With fixed-rate mortgages, your interest rate doesn't change over time. That means your principal and interest payments will remain the same throughout the loan. 30-year fixed term: A home loan with a 30-year repayment period and by far the most common. According to Freddie Mac, 90% of homebuyers choose a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Due to the length of the loan, you'll pay more interest over time compared to shorter options. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.09% for the week ending Sept. 19. 15-year fixed term: A home loan that borrowers repay over 15 years. This will have higher monthly payments but you'll pay less interest over the life of the loan. You'll also get a better rate compared to a longer mortgage term. The average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage was 5.15% for the week ending Sept. 19. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are another option for homebuyers. An ARM is a loan where the interest rate changes over the course of the loan. That means homeowners could see their monthly payments go up over time. Here’s what’s needed to buy a house How to get the best mortgage rate? There are several ways to set yourself up to get the best possible mortgage rate. Credit score: Generally, consumers with high credit scores receive lower interest rates than those with low credit scores. According to a recent Realtor.com report, improving your credit score from Bad (under 600 FICO) to Very Good (750–800) can lower your mortgage rate by 39 basis points. Down payment: Typically, the more money you put down, the better interest rate you can get. Putting at least 20% down can also help you avoid paying for mortgage insurance. Loan term: Longer loan terms usually come with higher interest rates, whereas a shorter-term loan, will come with higher monthly payments but less interest. Debt-to-income ratio: How much money you make can impact your mortgage rate. Borrowers with a low debt-to-income ratio, meaning their debt payment is a small portion of their monthly income, are generally considered lower risk. Shop around: Weighing your options can lead to big savings. Realtor.com found an average difference of 86 basis points between the least expensive and most expensive lenders.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/mortgage-calculator-payment/	2024-10-03T10:18:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66e4669d7c8a87.88527414.jpeg?w=900

If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-4673. (NewsNation) — This week the nation was stunned when Tony Buzbee, a Houston lawyer, announced he is representing 120 people — 60 men and 60 women — who say they have experienced sexual misconduct by Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who is currently awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. And the allegations were explosive. What we know about the Diddy investigation More Diddy allegations from lawyer Tony Buzbee Among the most explosive claims Buzbee made: One victim was just 9 years old. The child had been introduced to Combs in hopes of getting the minor a recording contract. '(The child) was taken to an audition in NYC at Bad Boy records ... this individual was sexually abused by Sean Combs and other people at the studio in the promise to both his parents and the boy of getting a record deal.' (Question from me: Why aren’t these parents being charged as well? Why didn’t they call the cops immediately? Why isn’t Child Protective Services involved?) Another minor was allegedly told Combs would make him a star, but needed to visit Combs privately without his parents. Combs allegedly made the victim perform oral sex. Another minor, 15, was allegedly flown to New York City to attend a party with drugs, and then taken to a private room in the presence of Combs where this female minor was (gang) raped. One woman, 26, was allegedly given one drink in Combs’ SUV, then woke up the next day not knowing what happened, but with pain and damage to both her vagina and anus. A pregnant woman refused alcoholic beverages at a dinner in Miami — but did have a nonalcoholic beverage, which according to her was laced with drugs. The woman 'blacked out, and woke up in the same bed allegedly with Combs in his mansion in Miami. Her vagina and anus were torn and sore.'

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File) More rumors swirl around alleged Diddy tapes These are just the allegations out there. I have heard from several sources that there is a video floating around with Combs having sex with a 'major' music star who was underage — as well as another Hollywood staple allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with multiple people. It’s seedy. It’s horrific. And even worse: The tapes are out. The lawyers are seeing them, and copies were made of Combs' vast porn library and they are being offered up at high prices. Diddy hires convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyer And the alleged perpetrators — the men who had sex with unconscious or drugged up victims — as well as the bodyguards who threatened the victims afterward, will also be named. As Buzbee said: 'I imagine there's a myriad of people who are nervous. You can't hide skeletons in the closet forever.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/diddy-accusations-alleged-video-abuse-major-star/	2024-10-03T08:57:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/09/6503437e82e024.50315127.jpeg?w=900
Human connections bring hope in North Carolina after devastation ...	BLACK MOUNTAIN, N.C. (AP) — Sarah Vekasi is a potter who runs a store in Black Mountain, North Carolina, called Sarah Sunshine Pottery, named after her normally bubbly personality. But these days she’s struggling with the trauma of Hurricane Helene and uncertainty about the future of her business. 'All I can say is that I’m alive. I’m not doing great. I’m not doing good. But I’m extremely grateful to be alive, especially when so many are not,' Vekasi said. One thing that makes her feel a little better is the fellowship of the daily town meeting at the square. 'It’s incredible being able to meet in person,' said Vekasi, who was cut off by impassible roads for days. At Wednesday’s session more than 150 people gathered as local leaders stood atop a picnic table shouting updates. In the midst of the devastating destruction left by the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina, human connections are giving the survivors hope in western North Carolina. While government cargo planes brought food and water into the hardest-hit areas and rescue crews waded through creeks searching for survivors, those who made it through the storm, whose death toll has topped 180, were leaning on one another. Martha Sullivan, also at the town meeting, was taking careful notes so she could share the information — roads reopened, progress in getting power restored, work on trying to get water flowing again — with others. Sullivan, who has lived in Black Mountain for 43 years, said her children invited her to come to Charlotte after the storm, but she wants to stay in her community and look after her neighbors. 'I’m going to stay as long as I feel like I’m being useful,' Sullivan said. Helping one another in the hardest-hit areas In remote mountain areas, helicopters hoisted the stranded to safety while search crews moved toppled trees so they could look door to door for survivors. In some places, homes teetered on hillsides and washed-out riverbanks. Electricity is being slowly restored, as the number of homes and businesses without power dipped below 1 million for the first time since last weekend, according to poweroutage.us. Most of the outages are in the Carolinas and Georgia, where Helene struck after barreling over Florida’s Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane. Deaths have been reported in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, in addition to the Carolinas. Robin Wynn lost power at her Asheville home early Friday and was able to grab a bag of canned goods and water before getting to a shelter despite water up to her knees. 'I didn’t know where I was going, didn’t know what was going to happen next. But I got out and I’m alive,' Wynn said on Wednesday. Now that she’s back home, her neighbors have been watching out for one another. Plenty of people have come around to make sure everyone has a hot meal and water, she said. Eric Williamson, who works at First Baptist Church in Hendersonville, normally makes home visits to members who can’t physically get to church. This week, he’s their lifeline, delivering food that meets dietary restrictions and tossing out food that had spoiled. Beyond checking in on the essentials, he says it’s important to just socialize with folks in a moment like this to help them know they aren’t alone. He has a handwritten list of everyone he needs to visit. 'They don’t have telephone service, even if they have a landline, a lot of that isn’t working,' Williamson said. 'So we're bringing them food and water, but also just bringing them a smile and a prayer with them just to give them comfort.' Volunteers in Asheville gathered on Wednesday before going out to help find people who have been unreachable because of phone and internet outages. They took along boxes of drinking water and instructions to return in person with their results. Even notifying relatives of people who died in the storm has been difficult. 'That has been our challenge, quite honestly, is no cell service, no way to reach out to next of kin,' said Avril Pinder, an official in Buncombe County where at least 61 people have died. 'We have a confirmed body count, but we don’t have identifications on everyone or next-of-kin notifications.' Thursday marks the seventh day of search and rescue operations, Pinder said, adding the county doesn’t have an official tally of people who are unaccounted for or missing. 'We’re continuing to find people. We know we have pockets of people who are isolated due to landslides and bridges out,' she said. 'So they are disconnected but not missing.' Biden and Harris get a firsthand look President Joe Biden flew over the devastation in North and South Carolina, getting a firsthand look at the mess left by a storm that now has killed at least 189 people. Speaking afterwards in Raleigh, North Carolina, Biden praised the Democratic governor of North Carolina and the Republican governor of South Carolina for their responses to the storm, saying that in the wake of disasters, 'we put politics aside.' 'Our job is to help as many people as we can as quickly as we can and as thoroughly as we can,' he said. That includes a commitment from the federal government to foot the bill for debris removal and emergency protective measures for six months. The money will address the impacts of landslides and flooding and will cover costs of first responders, search and rescue teams, shelters, and mass feeding. 'We’re not leaving until you’re back on your feet completely,' Biden said. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to neighboring Georgia, where she said the president had approved a request to pick up the tab for similar emergency aid there for three months. Biden plans on traveling to disaster areas in Florida and Georgia on Thursday. Devastation from Florida to Tennessee Employees at a plastics factory in rural Tennessee who kept working last week until water flooded their parking lot and power went out at the plant were among those killed. The floodwaters swept 11 workers away, and only five were rescued. Two are confirmed dead. Tennessee state authorities said they are investigating the company that owns the factory after some employees said they weren’t allowed to leave in time to avoid the storm’s impact. Hospitals and health care organizations in the Southeast mostly stayed open despite dealing with blackouts, wind damage, supply issues and flooding. Many hospitals halted elective procedures, while only a few closed completely. In Florida, officials were turning to 'low-risk' state prisoners to help clear the mountains of debris left behind. 'Department of Corrections, they do prison labor anyways. So they’re bringing them to do debris removal,' Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters on Wednesday. ___ Verduzco reported from Swannanoa, North Carolina, and Peterson from Hendersonville, North Carolina.

Daniel Penny, charged in death of Jordan Neely, due in court	(NewsNation) — Daniel Penny, who faces charges in connection to the chokehold death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway train, will be in court Thursday. The Marine veteran has pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges. If convicted, Penny faces up to 20 years in prison. On May 1, the New York Police Department reported that Neely, a street performer who had been experiencing homelessness, boarded the F train in Manhattan and began acting erratically. Penny claims Neely was angry and talking to himself, which prompted him to intervene. Cellphone footage from those on the train shows Penny putting Neely in a chokehold and holding him down until he stopped moving and breathing. Officers arriving to the scene reported Neely was unconscious and he was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. David Brown disappeared while walking in Florida A medical examiner ruled Neely’s death a homicide due to 'compression of neck.' Attorney Donte Mills, who is representing Neely's family, previously told 'Dan Abrams Live' that Penny had 'no authority' to place someone in a chokehold. Mills said Penny was not attacked by his Neely. '(Penny) knew or should have known that choking him (Neely) for 15 minutes would kill him,' Mills said. 'I can’t tell you what was in his mind when he approached him.' Penny’s attorneys said their client 'never intended to harm' Neely and that he was just trying to protect others. Jury selection in the trial is set to begin Oct. 21.

Diddy hires convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried's lawyer	(NewsNation) — Sean 'Diddy' Combs is adding a new name to his legal representation as he fights the federal sex trafficking case he’s facing. The music mogul hired the same lawyer as his cellmate, former FTX CEO turned convict Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced this year to 25 years in prison for fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. Combs’ new lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro, will help him appeal a judge’s decision to keep him detained in a Brooklyn jail while he awaits trial on sex trafficking and racketeering charges, among others. A Sept. 18 notice of appeal lists Shapiro as his counsel. What we know about the Diddy investigation Shapiro has represented Bankman-Fried since the fraudster’s conviction, filing a 102-page appeal for a new trial. Shapiro’s experience also includes clerking for former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Two judges rejected Combs’ $50 million bond offer citing the possibility of violence or witness tampering. He remains in the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center where he shares a cell with Bankman-Fried. It’s unclear whether the two discussed legal representation. The rapper was arrested Sept. 16. Since then, he has faced 120 new sexual misconduct allegations, which a lawyer saying he expects his clients to file civil lawsuits soon.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/diddy-hires-sam-bankman-fried-lawyer/	2024-10-03T06:14:24-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Diddy-Bankman-Fried-collage.jpg?w=900
Helene first responders resume search for missing, rescue survivo...	(NewsNation) — First responders have worked tirelessly in the wake of Helene and are running out of steam, many of them in action since the hurricane made landfall in the Southeast one week ago. While police and fire agencies in affected counties continue to receive help from organizations across the U.S., first responders have been working upward of 12-hour shifts or more per day. Woman recounts her rescue from river, husband’s death Helene's devastation After making landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, Helene rapidly weakened to a tropical storm as it traveled north. However, wind and rain still caused significant damage to several states, including Georgia and the Carolinas. One of the hardest-hit areas is western North Carolina, where Asheville and surrounding towns in the Blue Ridge Mountains experienced record-breaking floods. Following the storm, loss of power, water and cellphone service as well as damage to hundreds of roads left Asheville virtually cut off from the rest of the world. The town of Black Mountain, North Carolina, says its fire and police departments have been able to account for more than 90% of the town's residents, but they are still continuing to look for more. So far, the North Carolina National Guard said as of Thursday afternoon, its rescued over 450 people in 13 different countries. North Carolina's Department of Adult Corrections, meanwhile, had to evacuate and relocate more than 800 prisoners today due to Hurricane Helene damage. Death toll reportedly at 200 According to the Associated Press, 200 people have died from the storm so far, with 61 of those deaths in Buncombe County alone. The number is expected to rise as officials and volunteers continue searching for the missing. Helene’s health risks include contaminated water and mold: Doctors Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp provided an update on Helene's recovery Thursday, saying the storm did massive damage to the agriculture industry in the state. He said that the state declined federal assistance from the National Guard as they have had what they needed on a state level. However, the Biden administration has agreed to cover 100% of the state's cleanup cost for the first three months of recovery. So far, the federal government has provided more than $20 million to Hurricane Helene survivors. At least 33 people died in Georgia from the storm and about 200 people were severely impacted by the devastation, Kemp said. Road to recovery after Helene The Ohio Calcutta Fire Department, which traveled to assist affected areas, said its search and water team has teamed up with the Black Mountain Fire Department, National Guard and other law enforcement agencies in the area to conduct search-and-rescue missions. NASCAR driver Greg Biffle posted a video to social media Wednesday, showing a person stranded on the mountains who was able to use a mirror and the sun to get his attention. While search, rescue and recovery operations continue, several residents on the top of the mountains or in the valleys still don't have access to power, cutting them off from the rest of the world. Supplies have been airlifted in and delivered by mule train in some areas due to the difficult terrain and storm damage. Officials in Asheville have said it could be several weeks for critical services, including water, to be restored. In Asheville Thursday, groups of volunteers, many of whom who didn’t have power themselves, conducted welfare checks for people not able to get in touch with loved ones. 'We’re looking to make sure they’re OK, or are they ill? Do they need medicines? Do they need food? Or maybe even worse,' Mike Vernon, one volunteer, told NewsNation. One group said they had fielded 15,000 inquiries from people not able to get in touch with their loved ones. Nonprofits, charity groups and volunteers in other areas have also stepped up to make sure people cut off from society can get the supplies they need. 'We are so grateful,' Black Mountain, North Carolina resident Nancy McDaniel said. 'I think everyone, especially on our street, was in a panic because we didn’t know about the water and that was the worst.' McDaniel continued, 'It’s been devastating and inspiring at the same time. We are a mountain town that thrives on tourism and visitation. We are proud of our beautiful mountains here and its been so hard to see the devastation; but at the same time, I have never met so many of my neighbors and just seen how everybody comes to check on each other.' Altogether, people in Black Mountain and other areas affected by Helene are exhausted. Every day, the mountain community has a town meeting in the park to update people of the efforts being conducted in the wake of Helene. Emotions remain high as many have lost everything, the death toll hits close to home and many witness their community nearly destroyed.

Israeli strike in Beirut kills 7 as troops fight in southern Leba...	(NewsNation) — Tensions in the Middle East show no signs of simmering with Israel’s latest airstrike in the Lebanese capital of Beirut that killed seven health and rescue workers overnight into early Thursday morning. This is the latest development in Israel’s ground operations in efforts to weaken Hezbollah, a Lebanese Islamist militant group. The target was a multistory apartment building that houses an office for civilian first responders affiliated with Hezbollah, the Associated Press reported. The airstrike was the closest strike to the central downtown district of Beirut, where the United Nations and government offices are located. Last week, Israel conducted an airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, which added fuel to an already growing fire of cross-border tension. Iran, which heavily backs Hezbollah, launched nearly 200 missiles Tuesday in retaliation for the killing of Nasrallah, as well as Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July.

(AP Photo/Hussein Malla) The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting Wednesday to address the events of what could lead to a possible regional war. Iran’s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani told the council the missile strike targeting Israel was 'a necessary and proportionate response to Israel’s continued terrorist aggressive acts over the past two months.' Israel and Hezbollah have a long history of hostility and violence. Hezbollah was formed in 1982 in response to the 15-year Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Western states and Israel consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization, but the group has major political power in Lebanon’s national elections and operates schools, hospitals, charities and other entities. The current regional conflict broke out after Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist militant group, attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 — the deadliest attack in Israeli history. Israel declared war and invaded Gaza the next day. At the same time, Hezbollah started firing at Israel in support of Gaza, forcing a cross-border conflict. The first anniversary of the attack that killed 1,200 people is four days away. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran’s latest missile attack on Israel failed.

(Photo by Kawnat HAJU / AFP) (Photo by KAWNAT HAJU/AFP via Getty Images) 'Iran made a big mistake tonight — and it will pay for it,' Netanyahu said Tuesday night after the Iranian missile attack. 'The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies.' Southern Turkey welcomed Lebanese evacuees on a ferry Thursday following the Beirut airstrike. Israel's military forces have been actively operating in southern Lebanon as they attempt to damage Hezbollah's infrastructure. People are leaving Lebanon out of fear for their safety, and almost two dozen countries are working together for a possible evacuation of citizens, Reuters reported. Japan has readied its military jets for evacuations of Japanese citizens from Lebanon, while Australia has planned evacuation flights for its Australian citizens, the AP reported. In Israel, schools are closed as the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah began Wednesday and runs through Friday, but people are on edge as the area braces for a response from Iran. Emergency sirens are going off about every hour in northern Israel, according to NewsNation’s Robert Sherman, who is on the ground reporting. On Monday, President Joe Biden said the U.S. is prepared to help Israel defend against the Iranian missile attack, but by Wednesday, he told reporters 'no,' he does not support an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites should Israel retaliate.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/israeli-strike-beirut-troops-southern-lebanon/	2024-10-03T03:34:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24277269610508.jpg?w=900
Advocates demand policy changes as migrant deaths hit record numb...	EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – Immigration advocates are calling for asylum restrictions between ports of entry to be relaxed, as migrants placing their lives in the hands of smugglers are dying in record numbers here. A total of 176 migrants died in canals, mountains and the desert in El Paso and southern New Mexico in the recently concluded fiscal year 2024. That’s 27 more than the previous record of 149 deceased migrants border agents encountered in FY 2023. Volunteers want sheriff to pick up human remains found in desert 'It’s heartbreaking,' said Alan Lizarraga, a spokesman for the Border Network for Human Rights. 'There is a lot of frustration to know that person was a father, a mother, somebody’s son or uncle. People arriving here are people who have families, people who work hard and have dreams. Sadly, when they arrive at the border they become just another number.' BNHR and the Hope Border Institute say they noticed a steep increase in migrant fatalities after the White House on June 4 issued an executive order banning most foreign nationals from applying for asylum if they came into the country between ports of entry. Biden administration expands asylum restrictions at southern border The federal government is now requiring asylum-seekers to make an online appointment at a port of entry through the CBP One app. But activists say the app has issues and that many vulnerable populations stuck in Mexico don't have the means to survive for long periods of time and are exposed to extortion, kidnapping and assault by criminals. That’s why they get desperate and seek to enter the U.S. by any means available as soon as possible. Lizarraga said the high number of fatalities 'represents the horrors and cruelty of our immigration system and of the operations that are happening in our southern border. People migrating are being met with harsh words, force (and) concertina wire.' Texas doubles down on razor wire, fencing facing New Mexico He was referring not only to the asylum ban between ports of entry but also the State of Texas' Operation Lone Star, which has deployed thousands of soldiers, Department of Public Safety troopers and miles of razor wire to the border. This summer, most migrant deaths occurred in the mountains and desert of southern New Mexico. Many took place in the busy migrant smuggling corridor west of Mount Cristo Rey in Sunland Park, New Mexico, and the Columbus Highway (NM State Road 9). Border Patrol agent bitten in face during assault on Mount Cristo Rey 'It was very unfortunate to see that number go up in the summer, especially after the new asylum proclamation was announced in June,' said Aimee Santillan, policy analyst for Hope Border Institute. 'And we saw a huge increase in the number of people that are coming through the desert, trying not to be detected by Border Patrol.' The fatalities reflect that vulnerable populations are putting themselves in harm’s way because they see little alternatives, she said. A group of volunteers who have located multiple remains in the desert of New Mexico say half the victims were women. Students, volunteers help fingerprint migrant remains with hopes of identifying them Others may have been part of a larger group that got left behind by smugglers for not being able to keep up or perhaps after suffering an injury or a fall. Border agents have told Border Report in the past many of the migrants they apprehend are malnourished and haven’t been given sufficient water at stash houses where they are kept across the border prior to being helped over the U.S. border wall. Santillan called for expanded legal pathways so that migrants can approach the U.S. border without resorting to smugglers, and improvements to the CBP One app. Trump warns he’ll expel migrants under key Biden immigration programs 'There are a number of issues with CBP One: Giving appointments at random times, making people wait for long periods of time, language barriers and other factors the app does not account for. It’s just a recipe for this kind of death crisis that we are seeing,' Santillan said. The Hope Border Institute say the death toll this year would have been higher if not for the efforts of first responders like the El Paso Fire Department, the Sunland Park Fire Department, and federal agencies monitoring the border. Smugglers on TikTok: ‘We cross you into the US, 100% guaranteed’ The Border Patrol, for instance, has rescued 981 migrants in harm’s way in the El Paso Sector since Oct. 1, 2023. U.S. Customs and Border Protection last month deployed a tethered aerostat with long-range cameras in Santa Teresa to detect groups that come over the border wall and anyone who may be wondering the desert.

'Through conversations with them and conversations with Border Patrol we know they are understaffed and underfunded when it comes to search and rescue operations. They just don’t have enough trained staff to assist people dying of heat exposure at 107 degrees.

Trump on Springfield Haitian migrants: 'They have to be removed'	Download our NewsNation app for 24/7 fact-based, unbiased coverage. HOUSTON (NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump exclusively told NewsNation in an interview Wednesday he would revoke the temporary protected status for Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio, and ensure their return to Haiti. The Republican nominee was at a private fundraiser in Texas when he addressed the situation in Springfield, telling NewsNation border reporter Ali Bradley that 32,000 Haitian migrants had been relocated to a community of 52,000 residents. Trump told NewsNation he believes Haiti would accept the migrants back under his leadership. 'It has nothing to do with Haiti or anything else. You have to remove the people, and you have to bring them back to their own country,' he said. 'Springfield is such a beautiful place. Have you seen what's happened to it? It's been overrun. You can't do that to people. I'd revoke (the protected status), and I'd bring (the migrants) back to their country.' Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues The comments come after Trump's running mate, Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance, revisited false claims he made about immigrants in Springfield, Ohio eating pets, saying now he is 'concerned for the American citizens' in the city. 'In Springfield, and communities across this country, you have schools that are overwhelmed, housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes,' Vance said while debating Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, his Democratic opponent, in the election's only vice presidential debate. Former President Donald Trump spoke with Ali Bradley, who leads NewsNation’s daily coverage of the border.

Trump calls Jack Smith filing ‘pure election interference’ Enabling and protecting border law enforcement The former president told NewsNation he would enable local law enforcement to execute what he calls the largest deportation in American history and potentially deploy military forces to combat drug cartels. Trump said border agents 'know everything about [migrants] ... they know the good ones, the bad ones, and they're going to get them out.' Addressing cartel violence along the southern border, Trump proposed a 'military operation' to counter increasingly sophisticated tactics by Mexican drug organizations, which reportedly now employ drone jammers and have been found with rocket-propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices near the border. 'They're very rich, and they're very evil,' Trump said of the cartels. 'We're going to have to get in some military action. … They're killing 300,000 people a year.' Two Mexican drug cartels have helped flood the United States with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 80 times stronger than morphine that’s killing over 200 Americans daily, authorities say. Exclusive: Mexican cartels using devices to disrupt U.S. drones The Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels have established a sophisticated supply chain, sourcing precursor chemicals from China and manufacturing fentanyl in clandestine Mexican labs before smuggling it across the U.S. border, according to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reports. Mexican drug cartels operating along the U.S.-Mexico border are using electronic devices to disrupt drones being used by U.S. border officials to track immigrants who crossed into the United States illegally, NewsNation learned. In September 2023, Border Patrol agents in Texas discovered a backpack with what appeared to be cannonball-sized IEDs. It wasn't the first time the U.S. government had found potential explosive devices at the border. In May 2023, NewsNation reported border officials recovered a rudimentary device created using an M&amp;M container that was bound with electrical tape. The former president also praised GOP Texas Governor Greg Abbott's border initiatives but maintained that border security ultimately requires federal action, stating, 'All you have to do if you're the president is say to the Border Patrol and to the states, 'Nobody come in, it's closed.'' Trump predicted he would win New Mexico because of the southern border. Trump lost the state in 2020 by about 11 points and in 2016 by about 8 points. Houston teens carjack driver to smuggle migrants How many people are crossing the border? U.S. Border Patrol arrests along the Southwest border rose slightly from July to August but remained among the Biden administration’s lowest monthly numbers. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data, agents had 58,038 encounters between ports of entry in August, up from 56,399 in July. The actual number of encounters at America’s borders is expected to reach about 10 million by the end of the fiscal year, including repeat crossings and deportations. These encounters include repeat crossings and deportations, which means the actual number of unique individuals entering the country is much lower. Walz, Vance spar on immigration ‘The largest deportation effort in American history’ One of Trump’s key promises if reelected is to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history. He made similar promises when he first ran for office, but during his administration, deportations never topped 350,000. For comparison, then-President Barack Obama carried out 432,000 deportations in 2013, the highest annual total since records were kept. This time, Trump has given some more specifics on his promises. He said he’ll use the National Guard to round up migrants. And he said he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that allows the president to deport any noncitizen from a country that the U.S. is at war with. He’s also vowed to kick out hundreds of thousands of immigrants who have entered the country under two key Biden administration programs if he’s reelected. Any mass deportation plans would certainly be challenged in court and be enormously expensive to carry out. And it would depend on countries' willingness to take back their citizens. Trump also said he would bring back policies he had put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42. Remain in Mexico made migrants wait in Mexico while their asylum cases were heard, while Title 42 curbed immigration on public health grounds. He has said he’ll revive and expand a travel ban from his term that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries and pledged new 'ideological screening' for immigrants to bar 'dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots and maniacs.' Trump also seeks to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally. DHS increases time for new asylum regulations Why is the border a top voter issue? Making the border safer and other immigration-related issues remain among the biggest concerns for voters heading into the 2024 election. Trump has used the border as a backdrop for a series of campaign stops in recent months. Trump has repeatedly criticized President Joe Biden and Harris, claiming that the president and his 'border czar' are to blame for the steady amounts of migrants and for the trouble that Trump has alleged has come specifically from the illegal border crossings. The president has countered with the effectiveness of his executive order, which led to a drop in the number of border encounters after a record 250,000 encounters were reported in December 2023 alone. There has been a significant drop in encounters between federal agents assigned to the U.S.-Mexico border and immigrants who have entered the country illegally. Political gridlock on border policy In June 2024, Biden released a series of executive actions capping migrant crossing until border encounters remain consistently low — under 2,500 per day for an entire week — to give Border Patrol more time to handle each migrant’s situation. The president also clarified his use of executive powers, saying he was doing what Congress would not about a bipartisan immigration deal that failed in the Senate after Trump urged GOP lawmakers to vote against it.

Trump calls Jack Smith filing 'pure election interference'	This is a developing story. Refresh for updates. Download our NewsNation app for 24/7 fact-based unbiased coverage. HOUSTON (NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump called the unsealing of documents in his election interference case a 'weaponization of the government' during an exclusive interview with NewsNation on Wednesday in Houston, Texas. The Republican nominee was at a private fundraiser when he told NewsNation's Ali Bradley that special counsel Jack Smith is a 'deranged person' following the dismissal of his classified documents case. 'This was a weaponization of the government ... and released 30 days before the election,' Trump said. 'My poll numbers have gone up instead of down. It is pure election interference.' The interview came after prosecutors in a court filing unsealed Wednesday said Trump 'resorted to crimes' after losing the 2020 election by disregarding the advice of his vice president and other aides. Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues The filing was submitted by Smith’s team following a Supreme Court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents for official acts they take in office, narrowing the scope of the prosecution charging Trump with conspiring to overturn the results of the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. 'So what?' the filing quotes Trump as telling an aide after being alerted that his vice president, Mike Pence, was in potential danger after a crowd of violent supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Earlier on Truth Social, Trump alleged the documents were unsealed a day after the vice presidential debate so that the news coverage would not focus on 'Tim Walz’s disastrous debate performance.' The first and only vice presidential debate between Republican nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democratic nominee Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota was largely civil, with each vice presidential candidate sharing their thoughts on how their running mate may govern. 'The people know it, I know it, everybody knows it,' Trump told NewsNation in alleging Democrats are trying to rig the 2024 election. The release of the documents 'is another obvious attempt by the Harris-Biden regime to undermine and Weaponize American Democracy, and INTERFERE IN THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,' he said on Truth Social. The filing from Smith’s team offers the most comprehensive view to date of what prosecutors intend to prove if the case charging Trump with conspiring to overturn the election reaches trial. Though a monthslong congressional investigation and the indictment itself have chronicled in stark detail Trump’s efforts to undo the election, the new filing cites previously unknown accounts offered by Trump’s closest aides to paint a portrait of an 'increasingly desperate' president who while losing his grip on the White House 'used deceit to target every stage of the electoral process.' The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-jack-smith-pure-election-interference/	2024-10-02T17:47:10-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/trump-3-exclusive.jpg?w=900
Exclusive: Mexican cartels using devices to disrupt U.S. drones	(NewsNation) — Mexican drug cartels operating along the U.S.-Mexico border are using electronic devices to disrupt drones being used by U.S. border officials to track immigrants who crossed into the United States illegally, NewsNation has learned. Members of Cartel del Noreste are using the disruptors to interfere with efforts to secure the southern border. An alert, sent out borderwide by U.S. Border Patrol officials and obtained by NewsNation, indicates that the transnational criminal organization is using the devices to counter American drones being used along the border. Houston teens carjack driver to smuggle migrants Border officials say that the devices being used by the cartel can detect nearby unmanned aircraft systems. The devices can intercept the signal between the drone and its operator. According to the alert, the loss of signal will result in aircraft failure and will cause the drone to crash. The drone jammers being used by the cartel send strong signals to the same frequencies as those being used by drone operators. That, in turn, drowns out the communications between the drone operator and the aircraft they are controlling. The loss in communication causes the drone to either run out of control or lose all functionality. The jammers can be stationary devices or can be mounted or be built into gunlike devices, border officials warn. They can also radiate their signal in a cone shape or 360 degrees. Border officials say that the most effective devices being used by the cartels can be used effectively from about a mile away and become more effective the farther away the drone operator’s remote becomes from the aircraft. DHS increases amount of time asylum regulations at Southwest border in effect Brandon Judd, the president of the Border Patrol Union, called the alert a 'knee-jerk reaction' to something that the agency should have already been monitoring. 'Here we have a bulletin that goes out that says, be careful,' Judd told NewsNation. 'Well, they should be careful anyway.' Drones are used by various U.S. law enforcement agencies, including the Border Patrol, Texas Department of Public Safety and others. However, those devices are being used strictly for surveillance purposes. Once in the air, the drones can detect where immigrants who have crossed the border illegally along with smugglers are located. The cartels can use drone jammers to disrupt those aircraft, which demonstrates to Judd that the cartels are using better technology than U.S. officials because they do not have to adhere to budget restrictions.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/mexican-cartels-drones/	2024-10-02T15:05:45-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/66aaf5b704e464.03166595.jpeg?w=900
Prosecutors: Trump 'resorted to crimes' after losing 2020 electio...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump 'resorted to crimes' after losing the 2020 election, federal prosecutors said in a court filing unsealed Wednesday that argues that the former president disregarded the advice of his vice president and other aides and is not entitled to immunity from prosecution over his failed bid to remain in power. The filing was submitted by special counsel Jack Smith's team following a Supreme Court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents for official acts they take in office, narrowing the scope of the prosecution charging Trump with conspiring to overturn the results of the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. The purpose of the brief is to convince U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan that the offenses charged in the indictment are private, rather than official, acts and can therefore remain part of the indictment as the case moves forward. 'Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,' Smith’s team said, adding, 'When the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office.' Those include efforts to persuade former Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify the counting of the electoral votes on the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021. The filing includes details of conversations between Trump and Pence, including a private lunch the two had on Nov. 12, 2020, in which Pence 'reiterated a face-saving option' for Trump, telling him, 'don’t concede but recognize the process is over,' according to prosecutors. In another private lunch days later, Pence urged Trump to accept the results of the election and run again in 2024. 'I don’t know, 2024 is so far off,' Trump told him, according to the filing. But Trump 'disregarded' Pence 'in the same way he disregarded dozens of court decisions that unanimously rejected his and his allies’ legal claims, and that he disregarded officials in the targeted states — including those in his own party — who stated publicly that he had lost and that his specific fraud allegations were false,' prosecutors wrote. Trump’s 'steady stream of disinformation' in the weeks after the election culminated in his speech at the Ellipse on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, in which Trump 'used these lies to inflame and motivate the large and angry crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol and disrupt the certification proceeding,' prosecutors wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/trump-investigation/ap-prosecutors-trump-resorted-to-crimes-after-losing-2020-election-in-failed-bid-to-cling-to-power/	2024-10-02T13:22:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66fda571dc5004.51096749.jpeg?w=900
How much do longshoremen make?	(NewsNation) — Major ports are at a near standstill from Maine to Texas as tens of thousands of dockworkers strike over wages and the use of automation. Members of the International Longshoremen's Association, or ILA, which represents roughly 45,000 workers, walked off the job Tuesday after they were unable to reach a new labor contract with port employers. It’s the first time the union has been on strike since 1977 — a standoff that could cost the U.S. economy $540 million per day. The president could invoke a 1947 law to try to suspend the dockworkers’ strike. Here’s how The ILA is asking for significant wage hikes and a total ban on automated cranes, gates and container-moving trucks. 'We are prepared to fight as long as necessary, to stay out on strike for whatever period of time it takes, to get the wages and protections against automation our ILA members deserve,' ILA President Harold Daggett said in a social media post. Here's how much longshoremen currently make and what they're asking for going forward. Some panic buying reported amid dockworkers strike How much do longshoremen make? Under the contract that expired Monday, top-scale portworkers earned a base pay of $39 an hour, or just over $81,000 a year. That rate applied to workers with at least six years of service. The starting pay for dockworkers was $20 an hour, which rose to $24.75 after two years and $31.90 after four years. However, many longshoremen make much more with overtime and other benefits. A 2019-2020 report by the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor said about a third of longshoremen based there made at least $200,000 a year, and more than half earned over $150,000. Though not the norm, 59 dockworkers brought in more than $400,000 that year, according to the report. The ILA points out that many workers operate multimillion-dollar container-handling equipment for 'a mere $20 an hour' and says most members are constantly on call. 'They work extraordinary hours, sacrificing time with their families,' the union said in a statement. Daggett made over $900,000 last year — $728,000 from the ILA and an additional $173,000 for being the president emeritus of ILA Local 1804-1, according to union filings with the Department of Labor. West Coast dockworkers have a separate union from East Coast workers. They agreed to a new six-year contract last year, which included a 32% raise, Reuters reported. According to The New York Times, West Coast longshore workers make nearly $55 an hour, earning an average of nearly $220,000 last year. What is the union asking for? The union is demanding a 77% raise over six years — a $5 increase per hour for each year of the contract. That means the top-scale hourly rate could reach $69 by 2030 — over $140,000 a year. 'Our members feel underappreciated, especially given the sacrifices they made during the pandemic, keeping ports open and the economy moving,' the union said in a statement Monday. 'The wage increases in the previous contract were rendered meaningless by rising inflation.' The ILA is also asking for better benefits and a ban on automation over concerns that new technology will threaten jobs. The union said foreign-owned ocean carriers 'continue to make record profits' and are imposing 'outrageous surcharges on consumers.' The U.S. Maritime Alliance, the group negotiating for the ports, said it's offered a nearly 50% wage increase and called the strike 'completely avoidable' in a statement. The ILA has rejected that offer and said it doesn't address worker demands. The union reiterated that it's against any form of automation that replaces jobs or historical work functions. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/longshoremen-salary/	2024-10-02T11:28:43-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24275197522182.jpg?w=900
Kamala Harris backs striking port workers, knocks Trump	(The Hill) -- Vice President Kamala Harris voiced her support Wednesday for striking port workers while bashing her rival former President Donald Trump after tens of thousands of longshoremen at ports along the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico walked off the job. 'This strike is about fairness. Foreign-owned shipping companies have made record profits and executive compensation has grown. The Longshoremen, who play a vital role transporting essential goods across America, deserve a fair share of these record profits,' Harris said in a statement. The president could invoke a 1947 law to try to suspend the dockworkers’ strike. Here’s how She quickly turned to Trump, saying he 'wants to pull us back to a time before workers had the freedom to organize,' arguing that he makes 'empty promises' to workers but 'never delivers.' The United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) and the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) failed to reach a new labor agreement by the deadline on Tuesday, leading to the first strike by the port workers’ union in nearly 50 years. The union has demanded wage increases and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and container-moving trucks. The USMX said Monday evening that it had 'traded counteroffers related to wages' with the ILA. Bill O’Reilly: JD Vance succeeded by making ‘himself human’ at debate Harris, in her statement, repeated a line from her rallies, saying Trump cares more about skyscraper owners than the workers who built the buildings. And, she touted the PRO Act, which is the pro-labor legislation that President Joe Biden has also called for Congress to pass. 'He thinks our economy should only work for those who own the big skyscrapers, not those who actually build them,' Harris said, referring to Trump. 'As President, I will have workers’ backs and finally pass the PRO Act. And I will fight for an opportunity economy — where every person has the chance not just to get by but to get ahead.' Some panic buying reported amid dockworkers strike Biden on Tuesday called for the striking workers to get an increase in wages, urging USMX to come to the table and present an offer to the workers that ensures they are paid fairly. The strike raises political obstacles for Biden and Harris and has real consequences for the U.S. and international economy, costing as much as $5 billion per day and impacting both exports and imports.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/kamala-harris-longshoremen-strike/	2024-10-02T10:54:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/harriskamala_091224ap01_w-e1727888796687.jpg?w=900
Eric Adams to appear in court on bribery, fraud charges	(NewsNation) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams is set to appear in court Wednesday after being indicted on bribery and fraud charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Adams is alleged to have accepted around $100,000 worth of flights, hotel stays, meals and entertainment that were given to him for free or at a steep discount. Those are said to have occurred on international trips, most of which Adams took before he was elected mayor. Prosecutors say a senior Turkish diplomatic official and Turkish businesspeople arranged the bribes, hoping to gain influence with Adams. Some panic buying reported amid dockworkers strike The indictment also accused Adams of receiving illegal campaign donations from foreign sources who aren't allowed to contribute to U.S. political candidates. In exchange, prosecutors say Adams helped Turkey open a new diplomatic facility in the city, overriding concerns from the fire department about the building's ability to pass safety inspections. Adams has denied the allegations and said the trips and his work on the building were both routine actions and were not improper. He has also suggested prosecutors improperly leaked information to the media and is asking the judge to investigate. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs also denied any efforts to meddle in U.S. politics.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/eric-adams-appear-court/	2024-10-02T07:12:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24270549143810.jpg?w=900
Frontlines with Robert Sherman: Riding out Iran's Attack	NewsNation National Correspondent Robert Sherman has found himself on the frontlines of some of the world’s biggest stories: from Ukraine to Israel and across the United States. He shares what he’s seeing on the ground. Subscribe to his newsletter: Frontlines with Robert Sherman here. I knew right from the get-go this attack from Iran was going to be different than anything we had seen. Over the past year, I’ve personally witnessed countless rocket attacks on cities like Tel Aviv, Ashkelon and Sderot coming from Gaza. They were so common in the early aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks that you inevitably developed a routine. Sirens blare, you run into a bomb shelter, sit there for five to 10 minutes, then resume your day. The moment the announcement was made Iran was preparing a ballistic missile strike on Israel, a thick cloud of anxiety formed over all of Israel. The leadership here was telling people to avoid gathering in public and to not stray too far from a bomb shelter. Millions knew right away this would be no ordinary strike. Then came the alerts on our phone that the attack was launched. My phone has never pinged in such an incessant manner as I watched every community in Israel — North, South, large and small — put on notice. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Decision Desk '24 Campaign View Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } I was stationed in Haifa, where I waited the 10-15 minutes for those Iranian missiles to travel into our line of sight and watched as they crossed over Syria. Some were intercepted quickly, emitting large orbs of explosions in the sky — similar to the way fireworks ignite the Fourth of July night. But of course, these were weapons of war and not some kind of celebratory display. We had one of the first views of the attack from northern Israel, though it was cities like Tel Aviv that received the brunt of the targets. Many of the missiles were intercepted by Israel’s air defense systems, but there were plenty of impacts — far more than Israelis are accustomed to seeing. With help from many of Israel’s partners including the United States, the attack was largely repelled. National security adviser Jake Sullivan even called it 'defeated and ineffective.' At this hour, only one death has been reported: a Palestinian man in the West Bank. How to register to vote But make no mistake about it: We are not talking about a past-tense episode in the Middle East. We are very much living in a present-tense world rife with uncertainty. This morning, the area just north of us was targeted by one of Iran’s proxies, Hezbollah, with a large rocket barrage. In the early afternoon here, alerts sounded multiple times in communities spread out across northern Israel, also due to Iran’s proxy in Lebanon. And of course, the elephant in the room. There are highly consequential conversations taking place across Israel, including in the Israeli War Cabinet, largely revolving around one question: How will Israel respond to Iran’s attack? The Israel Defense Forces says it is operating at its highest level of alertness. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to not let this action go unpunished. 'This evening, Iran made a big mistake – and it will pay for it,' Netanyahu said Tuesday night after the missile attack. 'The regime in Tehran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to exact a price from our enemies.' Iran, in turn, has said it will retaliate should Israel make a move against it. 'Should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue,' the country’s mission to the U.N. posted on X. And in the interim, the IDF’s operations in Southern Lebanon are continuing. Millions around the globe will be watching these next few hours in the Middle East hoping a regional war can be avoided. But to many in Israel, after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, a year of strikes from Hezbollah and the ramping up of the Houthis’ efforts out of Yemen — all of which are Iranian proxies — this attack by Iran further solidified in their minds what they’ve already believed: War with Iran is not around the corner — it’s already been here.

Bill O’Reilly: JD Vance succeeded by making 'himself human' at de...	(NewsNation) — Ohio Sen. JD Vance 'made himself human' during the vice presidential debate, doing a great service to the Republican ticket, Bill O’Reilly told NewsNation on Tuesday. O’Reilly praised Vance's performance, saying the senator 'did his ticket more good than Walz did his.' 'What JD Vance accomplished is that he made himself human, unlike Donald Trump, who never does that,' he said. 'And he made himself accessible.' Vance squared off with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in the first and likely only vice presidential debate, which was hosted by CBS News. Who won Vance-Walz debate? The Republican freshman senator from Ohio, and the two-term Democratic governor of Minnesota got the chance to introduce themselves, make the case for their running mates, and go on the attack against the opposing ticket. The two faced each other on a number of issues, including the economy, border control and reproductive rights. Though he thinks Vance won, O'Reilly said, 'Walz wasn’t bad.' 'I’d invite him to Thanksgiving dinner, but he wouldn't get dessert' because he would be 'tedious,' O’Reilly said. O’Reilly agreed that the pair had a 'much better' time than the September presidential debate, but he lamented that both Vance and Walz 'still dodged' questions.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/oreilly-vance-succeeded-by-making-himself-human-at-vp-debate/	2024-10-01T21:21:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24276040453208.jpg?w=900
Who won Vance-Walz debate?	(NewsNation) — The first and only vice presidential debate of the 2024 election has come to a close, and political experts joined NewsNation to discuss the format, content and how the candidates stacked up against each other. The debate between Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota was very civil, with each vice presidential candidate sharing their thoughts on how their running mate may govern. Trump rips Walz, CBS moderators in debate’s opening 15 minutes The pair had traded barbs in the past, with former President Donald Trump‘s running mate questioning Walz’s military record and liberal leanings. Meanwhile, Walz — who Kamala Harris selected as her running mate just weeks after taking up the mantle from President Joe Biden — has jabbed Vance for his statements about childless cat ladies and school shootings. Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues Vance vs. Walz debate overview The 90-minute debate featured unmuted microphones and no fact-checking by CBS moderators, Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan, according to the network. There will be two four-minute breaks. Policy took center stage: The debate unfolded in a campaign defined by harsh, personal attacks and historic convulsions, including a candidate dropping out and two attempted assassinations. The heated tone was mostly replaced by deep policy discussions, with the candidates sometimes saying they agreed with each other Both men acknowledged past missteps: Vance was asked to address his past biting criticisms of the former president, including once suggesting Trump would be 'America’s Hitler.' Walz, meanwhile, was pressed on his misleading claim that he was in Hong Kong during the turbulence surrounding the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Will there be another debate? There are no upcoming debates on the calendar for Vance and Walz or Trump and Harris. JD Vance vs. Tim Walz: Vice presidential candidates’ political views O'Reilly: Vance won, 'made himself human' Bill O'Reilly said he thought the vice president candidates did 'OK' but that they 'still dodged' important questions. 'There's not enough thinking about the audience in these debates. The candidates are thinking about themselves, and the moderators are thinking about themselves,' O'Reilly said. Ultimately, O'Reilly said he thinks the GOP vice presidential candidate did more for his ticket than Walz did. 'What JD Vance accomplished was he made himself human,' O’Reilly added. 'Unlike Donald Trump, who never does that. And he made himself accessible.' Though he thinks Vance won, he said, 'Walz wasn’t bad.' Walz started off nervous, later 'flipped it' on Vance: Stirewalt Stirewalt pointed out how nervous Walz appeared to be but said he later 'flipped it on Vance.' 'That poor guy (Walz) was so nervous, but he eventually settled in. For the first hour, Vance had him. He walked him like a dog,' Sitrewalt said. 'At the very end, Walz did flip it on Vance.' Stirewalt referenced when Vance dodged the question about certifying the 2024 election. When asked if he would challenge the 2024 election results, even if every governor certified their state’s results, Vance did not clarify what he would do. 'My own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues, peacefully in the public square,' Vance said. He emphasized that Trump 'peacefully' transferred power on Jan. 20, 2021, despite what happened Jan. 6. Overall, the pace of the event was 'very incremental,' but that may be for the better, Stirelwat said. '(It’s) quite pleasant to have a normal conversation between two human beings who seem to have done some homework … Can you imagine, policy actually coming into the discussion? Good for them,' Stirewalt said. Abrams said that, despite unfavorable polling numbers toward the Ohio senator, Vance was empathetic and measured. The candidates’ consistently kind approach to each other, Cuomo added, was refreshing to see. 'Boy, was it clear that both men there weren’t looking to make you hate somebody else,' he said. 'And we did not see that in the presidential debate.' Cuomo: Walz would be more likeable than Harris NewsNation's Chris Cuomo said he didn't think Walz had a great night but thought that 'if they had a real primary, Walz would be more likable to a lot of Democrats than Kamala Harris.'

JD Vance and Tim Walz spar over Trump and Harris economic policie...	(NewsNation) —The vice presidential candidates both defended their running mates in a back and forth during their first and likely only debate Tuesday. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who has been tapped by Vice President Kamala Harris to run on Democratic ticket, touted her economic plan saying it would redistribute money back to the middle class. 'Kamala and I believe in the middle class,' Walz said, adding that her plan includes more housing assistance, drug price fairness, tax cuts for middle class and getting businesses off the ground. 'We will ask the wealthy to pay their fair share.' Walz also slammed Trump saying he created the largest trade deficit with China during his presidency. 'Trump's plan would lead to a recession.' Republican nominee Donald Trump’s pick, JD Vance shot back at Walz saying Harris 'had the chance to make things better, but didn't,' when it came to the economy. Harris policies 'make life unaffordable for Americans,' he said. He defended Trump's economic plans saying they will 'deliver highest take-home pay' and make 'groceries affordable again' for all Americans. Vance pushed that the U.S. needs to get back to 'common sense' economic policies. The debate in New York hosted by CBS News gave Vance, a Republican freshman senator from Ohio, and Walz, a two-term Democratic governor of Minnesota, the chance to introduce themselves, make the case for their running mates, and go on the attack against the opposing ticket. Walz’s economic record includes passing tax cuts for Minnesotans while maintaining a balanced budget in the state. He also has a record that includes investments in infrastructure and community college programs as well as supporting a transition to green energy. He has also advocated for paid family and medical leave. Among his other accomplishments as governor, Walz also signed a $2.3 billion education budget into law, which provided 'students free breakfast and lunch at school, created thousands of new pre-K seats, expanded access to mental health resources for students, and made significant investments to improve child literacy.' Vance, Trump’s campaign partner, has built a brand on economic populism, diverting from the GOP’s traditional pro-business platform. Vance partnered with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to crack down on big banks. Abroad, Vance has made his stance on the war in Ukraine clear, opting to reject any U.S. aid for the country. He was also a key figure in the unsuccessful attempt to block a $60 billion supplemental aid package to Ukraine.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/jd-vance-tim-walz-spar-trump-harris-economy/	2024-10-01T19:46:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24276066615746.jpg?w=900
Vance returns to Springfield, Ohio, 'illegal immigrant' fear rhet...	(NewsNation) —Republican Ohio senator JD Vance doubled down on controversial comments he’s made about immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying he is 'concerned for the American citizens' in the city during the vice presidential debate Tuesday. 'In Springfield, and communities across this country, you have schools that are overwhelmed, housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes,' Vance said while debating Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. 'The people I'm worried about in Springfield are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris' open border.' When corrected by the moderators that the Haitian immigrants in the city are legal under the Temporary Protected Status program, Vance went on a tangent discussing immigration laws. Vance faced a slew of criticism for repeating false allegations that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating neighbor’s pets. Last month, Vance made a series of posts and statements about the Haitian immigrant population in Springfield, Ohio. He posted on X, without evidence, that Springfield has experienced 'a massive rise in communicable diseases, rent prices, car insurance rates, and crime.' Later he said his office 'has received many inquiries from actual residents of Springfield who’ve said their neighbors’ pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants,' adding, 'It’s possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false.' Following Vance’s initial post, the internet subsequently exploded with AI-generated imagery of Trump appearing to rescue dogs, cats and birds from harm, with Trump posting several of the memes to his own Truth Social account. Trump repeated the claim during the presidential debate against Kamala Harris. More than 30 bomb threats have been made against schools, government buildings and city officials’ homes since Trump’s comments, forcing evacuations and closures. Springfield also canceled its annual celebration of diversity, arts and culture in response to the threats, and on Tuesday, state police were deployed to city schools. He has also gotten heat over several resurfaced comments on childless women and violent marriages. In a 2021 interview with former Fox News talk show host Tucker Carlson, Vance said that the U.S. was being run by Democrats, corporate oligarchs and 'a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.' The then-Senate candidate specifically mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York as examples. Vance drew widespread criticism over his words, but stood behind them calling it a 'sarcastic comment.' Trump defended his running mate saying he believed Vance’s comments meant that he’s 'strongly family-oriented.' In another set of resurfaced comments from a 2021 event, Vance criticized people leaving marriages, even when they are violent. Who is JD Vance, Trump’s pick for vice president 'This is one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace, which is the idea that like, well, OK, these marriages were fundamentally, you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they were unhappy, and so getting rid of them and making it easier for people to shift spouses like they change their underwear, that’s going to make people happier in the long term,'' Vance said, according to Vice. The founder of the organization Moms Demand criticized his comments on X. 'JD Vance said women are obligated to stay in ‘violent’ marriages,' Watts wrote. 'Each month, 70 women are fatally shot by intimate partners in the US, and 1 million women alive today have been shot or shot at by intimate partners.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/vance-springfield-ohio-illegal-immigrant-fear-rhetoric/	2024-10-01T19:36:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24276046306213.jpg?w=900
Vance on carbon emissions and climate change: 'Let's just say tha...	Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance (Ohio) expressed skepticism about the scientific consensus behind climate change in response to a question during Tuesday's debate. 'One of the things that I've noticed some of our Democratic friends talking a lot about is a concern about carbon emissions — this idea that carbon emissions drive all the climate change,' Vance said. Trump rips Walz, CBS moderators in debate’s opening 15 minutes 'Let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument, so we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,' Vance continued. There is a scientific consensus that climate change is occurring and is primarily being driven by human activity — largely carbon emissions stemming from the burning of fossil fuels. Vance, in his answer, said the Trump administration’s climate policy would be to bring more energy production and manufacturing to the U.S. 'because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.' The U.S. is currently the second-largest emitter of planet-warming gases, behind only China, and is the largest historic emitter. Moderator Norah O'Donnell fact-checked Vance’s response, saying, 'The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that the Earth's climate is warming at an unprecedented rate.' When asked by a moderator, Vance also did not say whether he agrees with former President Trump’s infamous false assertion that climate change is a 'hoax.' JD Vance vs. Tim Walz: Vice presidential candidates’ political views In his own remarks, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz criticized former President Trump’s oil industry fundraisers and denial of climate science. 'To call it a hoax and to take the oil company executives to Mar-a-Lago, say, 'Give me money for my campaign, and I'll let you do whatever you want.' We can be smarter about that,' Walz said. Walz appeared to be referring to reports that Trump asked the oil industry for $1 billion in campaign cash during a fundraiser earlier this year. What is the QR code on screen during the vice presidential debate? The Washington Post reported that Trump said the donations would be a 'deal' for oil executives because of the tax cuts and relaxed regulations he would implement, but someone with knowledge of the meeting who spoke with The Hill said the discussion was not framed as any sort of quid pro quo. Walz also described his running mate Vice President Harris as having an 'all-of-the-above' energy policy and touted oil and gas production in the U.S. — Updated at 10:00 p.m.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/jd-vance-carbon-emissions-climate/	2024-10-01T19:16:42-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24276040453208-e1727833924160.jpg?w=900
Walz: I 'misspoke' about being in Hong Kong during 1989 protests	(NewsNation) —Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz addressed criticism about his previous statement saying he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 saying he 'misspoke' about his exact time there during the vice presidential debate against Ohio Senator JD Vance Tuesday. 'I got there that summer and misspoke on this,' Walz said during the debate in New York hosted by CBS News. 'I was in Hong Kong in China during democracy protests and from that I learned a lot.' Walz touted his time in the military saying that he became a teacher through the GI bill and then created a program to take students there as well. Here’s a look at questions about Tim Walz’s military record 'My commitment has been there from the beginning,' he said. Multiple news reports indicated that Walz misleadingly claimed he was in Hong Kong during the turbulence surrounding the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Walz suggested that he was in the then-British colony of Hong Kong in May 1989, but he appears to have been in Nebraska. Public records suggest he left for Hong Kong and China in August of that year. Walz has faced criticism on several discrepancies. Several Republicans, including Vance, had questioned Walz’ military service and retirement suggesting he abandoned his team to pursue a campaign for Congress. 'When the US Marine Corps asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,' Vance posted on X in August. 'When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that’s shameful.' Walz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard. The two-term Democratic governor retired from the National Guard in 2005 to run for Congress just before his unit received an order to mobilize for the war in Iraq. There is no evidence that Walz timed his departure with the intent of avoiding deployment. But the fact remains that he left ahead of his unit’s departure. That departure became a major point of attack on Walz by his opponents. The Harris campaign statement said Walz 'would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country' and thanked 'Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It’s the American way.' 'After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform — and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,' the Harris campaign said in August. Walz was chosen by Vice President Kamala Harris to be her running mate in August after an exhaustive search of several high-profile candidates. Walz has since been out on the campaign trail for Harris, promoting the vice president and saying he will do whatever it takes to get her elected in November.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/walz-misspoke-hong-kong-1989-protests/	2024-10-01T19:06:10-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24233042000701-e1724271899331.jpg?w=800
Walz: Trump leadership brought Iran 'closer to a nuclear weapon'	(NewsNation) — In the first debate between the vice presidential candidates, Sen. JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz contrasted how former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris would lead the country through foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East. Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel on Tuesday, the latest in a series of escalating attacks in a yearslong conflict between Israel and Iran and its Arab allies that threatens to push the Middle East closer toward a region-wide war. When asked about supporting a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran, Walz stressed the importance of steady leadership in handling the situation in the Middle East. Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues He criticized Trump's approach to foreign policy, citing concerns raised by Trump's former staff members about his fitness for office. Walz praised Harris for her 'steady leadership' and 'calmness' in building and maintaining international coalitions. Vance, on the other hand, defended Trump's foreign policy record. He argued that Trump 'delivered stability in the world' through 'effective deterrence.' Vance criticized the Biden-Harris administration's policies towards Iran, claiming that unfrozen assets provided to Iran have been used to fund weapons potentially threatening the US and its allies. Where are Trump, Harris, JD Vance and Tim Walz campaigning today? Regarding a preemptive strike, Vance said, 'It is up to Israel … we should support allies wherever they are.' The candidates also clashed over the Iran nuclear deal. Walz accused Trump of making Iran 'closer to a nuclear weapon' by withdrawing from the agreement without an alternative plan. Vance countered by pointing out that Iran is currently closer to developing a nuclear weapon than ever before, despite the current administration's policies. Walz highlighted coalition-building and diplomatic steadiness, while Vance stressed the importance of projecting strength and deterrence on the world stage. JD Vance, Tim Walz face off in VP debate What to know about the Israel-Iran attacks and Biden's response The Biden administration is closely monitoring missile attacks launched by Iran into Israel, but while the White House says it fully supports Israel’s right to defense, it may not be on the same page when it comes to offensive use of force. Both President Joe Biden and Harris have been in the situation room watching the attack and said the military has been ordered to assist in shooting down missiles. Biden said that the attack 'appears to have been defeated and ineffective' and that the U.S. is 'fully fully fully supportive of Israel.' Before Iran’s attack, Israel had landed a series of devastating blows in recent weeks against the leadership of Hezbollah in Lebanon. It then ratcheted up the pressure on the Iran-backed militant group — which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began — by launching what it said is a limited ground incursion in southern Lebanon. JD Vance, Tim Walz trade barbs before vice presidential debate Israel has said it will continue to strike Hezbollah until it is safe for citizens displaced from homes near the Lebanon border to return. Hezbollah has vowed to keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza with Hamas, which is also supported by Iran. Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are calling on Biden to get tougher on Iran in the wake of Tuesday’s attack, urging the administration to adopt a series of specific measures designed to cripple the military powers of Tehran and its proxies. The Biden administration has given Israel weapons, billions of dollars and 2,000-pound bombs used to take out some of Hezbollah’s leaders, but the Trump-Vance ticket has consistently criticized Kamala Harris’ handling of the situation, claiming she 'hates Israel.' Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war for years, but rarely have they come into direct conflict.

Education a potential flashpoint in Vance-Walz vice presidential ...	Education hardly came up in last month's Trump-Harris presidential debate, but it could be a central focus at Tuesday's undercard event. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) is the first former educator in decades to make a major party ticket, and he has foregrounded that experience on the campaign trail. Live updates: Vance, Walz set for high-stakes VP debate But Walz's record on schools, both as a teacher and as a governor, has also been a leading point of attack for Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), who won't be pulling punches at the first and only vice presidential debate. 'It's more likely to come up in the VP debate then it would be in even another presidential debate, with one of the reasons for that being that it's so central — education is so central to Walz's identity as a former teacher,' said Jon Valant, director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institute. 'And then the other part of it being that a lot of what we've heard from JD Vance is so related to parents, and parents of school-aged children, that I think there are kind of more invitations to focus on education in this debate than there are for the presidential debate,' Valant added. 'I would be a little surprised if we don't get any questions about either education or at least parenting.' Walz has a very personal relationship with education, teaching in China for a year before coming back to the U.S. to teach social studies in Minnesota. He was also a football coach at Alliance High School, where he met his wife, who is also a teacher. He has not shied away from bringing up that background on the campaign trail and has received the enthusiastic endorsements of major teachers' unions. During the debate, 'it's important for him to tell his story,' said Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic political strategist. 'And then telling his story, the teacher aspect of who he is will come out and how he has fought for accessible and affordable education for everyone,' Seawright said. But Walz’s record has also been an area where Republicans have gone on the attack, nicknaming him 'Tampon Tim' after he signed a bill expanding access to menstrual products, including in boys' bathrooms. 'I suspect education policy won’t be a focal point of the debate beyond examples used as part of larger critiques of the candidates. For example, conservatives have criticized Walz’s education record while governor by attacking him for a law he passed requiring menstrual products in public schools. This attack is part of the GOP’s larger culture war against the left,' said Ryan Dawkins, assistant professor in the political science department at Carleton College. 'Similarly, Walz might try to connect Vance to Project 2025 and its policy goal of dissolving the entire Department of Education,' Dawkins added. Republicans have rallied around 'parents rights' as the central tenet of their education platform, and Vance has leaned into the issue, though he has drawn heat in the past for his aggressive rhetoric. In 2021, he decried what he called an 'antifamily' agenda promoted by Democrats and said the movement was led by 'a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.' Vance has also directly criticized Randi Weingarten, head of the American Federation of Teachers, in 2022 saying she 'doesn’t have a single child.' Weingarten is a mother by marriage. 'If she wants to brainwash and destroy the mind of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone,' Vance said. Observers are interested to see how Vance tries to go after Walz without alienating other educators in the process. 'I think the teacher side of this is very interesting ... It's so central to who Walz is. He was a teacher. He presents as a teacher in a lot of ways. And I'm curious to see how Vance handles that,' Valant said. 'If Vance comes out and his rhetoric feels very anti-teacher, I think that could end up being part of the story coming out of the debate. Or if he's going to focus on teachers’ unions. I'm just very curious.' he added. Conservatives are looking for Vance to focus on Walz's record as governor of Minnesota without getting bogged down in personal broadsides. 'Minnesota is home to what scholars have said are the most radical state standards in the country. As governor, Walz signed into law standards that teach students they are part of ‘racialized hierarchies’ and to ‘be aware of [their] own bias, power, and privilege.’ The standards instruct students on intersectionality and ‘settler-colonialism,’ among other concepts and buzzwords rooted in toxic identity politics,' said Ryan Walker, the executive vice president for Heritage Action for America. 'Walz should be pressed on these radical standards and asked whether this is the vision of America that should be taught to children in public schools,' Walker added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/education-a-potential-flashpoint-in-vance-walz-vice-presidential-debate/	2024-10-01T15:12:15-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Debate-Education_100124_AP_Jose-Luis-Magana-and-Steve-Helber.png?w=900
Diddy facing 120 new sex misconduct allegations: Lawyer	(NewsNation) — A Houston lawyer says he is representing 120 people who say they have experienced sexual misconduct by Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who is currently awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Attorney Tony Buzbee says he expects his clients to file lawsuits within the next 30 days. Buzbee said the alleged victims are 60 men and 60 women, of whom 25 were minors at the time of the alleged misconduct. The youngest, Buzbee said, was 9. 'I imagine there's a myriad of people who are nervous,' Buzbee said. 'You can't hide skeletons in the closet forever.' Diddy receiving privileges including more showers: Former inmate Erica Wolff, Combs' lawyer, said in a statement to NewsNation that the rap mogul 'cannot address every meritless allegation in what has become a reckless media circus.' 'That said, Mr. Combs emphatically and categorically denies as false and defamatory any claim that he sexually abused anyone, including minors,' Wolff said in a statement. Combs is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. He has pleaded not guilty and is due back in court for a status conference on Oct. 9.

Jimmy Carter turns 100: How has America changed?	(NewsNation) — Former President Jimmy Carter celebrates his 100th birthday Tuesday — making him the first American president to live a full century. Celebrations include a benefit concert and the construction of 30 new Habitat for Humanity homes, marking the occasion in Carter's philanthropic fashion. What was the US like when Jimmy Carter was born? Carter was born Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Much has changed since then. Calvin Coolidge was the president at the time. The summer and winter Olympics both happened that year. 'The Thief of Bagdad,' starring Douglas Fairbanks, was topping the box office and the Washington Senators beat the New York Giants in the World Series. The average cost of a home was just around $23,000. Gas cost about 19 cents per gallon and a pound of steak was about 37 cents. You could even buy a brand-new car for just over $100.

JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Trump spoke Monday in Valdosta, Georgia, a city damaged by Hurricane Helene. Vice President Kamala Harris cut her campaign visit to Las Vegas short to return to Washington for briefings on the hurricane, while President Joe Biden said he would travel to affected areas later this week. On Tuesday, Trump will campaign in Wisconsin, one of several battleground states expected to play a major role in the 2024 presidential election.

JD Vance vs. Tim Walz: Vice presidential candidates' political vi...	(NewsNation) — The Republican and Democratic presidential tickets are stacked after presumptive nominee Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Ohio Sen. JD Vance's nomination as former President Donald Trump's vice president pits him against Walz, a former teacher and longtime politician. At 39, Vance will represent a younger generation of Republicans alongside 78-year-old Trump. Meanwhile, Walz and Harris stand united on major Democratic voting issues, including abortion and immigration. What happens now that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is running for VP? Here is how Vance and Walz stack up against one another on the big issues. Who is Tim Walz? Walz’s liberal policy record and decorated background as a congressman and soldier made him stand out as a vice presidential contender. Walz, a Nebraska native, enlisted in the National Guard out of high school at 17 years old and served 24 years. He also worked in agriculture and manufacturing before graduating from Chadron State College with a degree in education.

Walz won his congressional bid in 2006 and served for 12 years before pivoting his career in 2019 to assume the governorship. In that time, he gained recognition as a top Democrat on the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee and the highest-ranking enlisted soldier in congressional history. During his time in Congress, he served on three House committees: Agriculture, Armed Services and Veterans’ Affairs. He was also the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in Congress. Who is JD Vance? A Yale School graduate, Vance went on to become a best-selling author and Ohio senator. Vance was gaining recognition for the publication of his 2016 memoir 'Hillbilly Elegy' as Trump was entering the White House. Vance was openly critical of the former reality TV star at the time, referencing himself in a 2016 interview as a 'never-Trump guy.' That changed in 2021 as Vance eyed an Ohio Senate seat that he won and still holds. Vance deleted tweets from 2016 calling Trump 'reprehensible' and an 'idiot,' Politifact reported.

Puskar, File) The public didn’t forget about Vance’s former stance, however, and the then-budding politician acknowledged his criticism of Trump during a 2021 Fox News interview. 'Like a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016, and I ask folks not to judge me based on what I said back in 2016 because I’ve been very open about the fact that I did say those very critical things, and I regret them,' Vance said. 'I was wrong about the guy. I think he made a good president.' Vance, Walz on crime Although statistics show a decline, crime remains one of the top issues for voters. NewsNation and Decision Desk HQ polling shows crime as one of the top three issues for the 2024 election. In February 2023, Walz signed into law legislation providing funding for the attorney general to hire as many as seven additional criminal prosecutors. The law, he said, would triple the capacity of the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office to 'prosecute violent crime and bring justice to victims of crime.' Walz has said investing in public safety will lower crime rates, local outlet KTTC reported in June 2022. 'The sheer capacity to process evidence and work crime scenes is critical,' KTTC quoted Walz saying at the time. 'We have heard it time and time again at dozens of stops. Invest money in us. Invest money in the BCA and the researchers and investigators, and we will bring down these numbers.' Later that year, Walz signed a bill to legalize recreational marijuana for people over the age of 21 starting in August, making Minnesota the 23rd state to legalize the substance for adults. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters Vance's record on criminal justice intertwines GOP talking points, including crime, abortion and immigration. In 2023, Vance introduced the Protect Children’s Innocence Act as a companion bill to a measure by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. Vance’s bill, if passed, would make it illegal for doctors to provide gender-affirming care to minors, making the act punishable by as many as 12 years in prison. The nonprofit LGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD criticized Vance, saying the bill contains 'an array of far-right, anti-transgender buzzwords' and bans on medical procedures, 'none of which are a part of transgender healthcare for minors.' Several of the procedures Vance sought to ban include those commonly performed on cisgender people, including plastic surgery and hormone therapies, GLAAD noted. Vance also supported Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn’s PRINTS Act, which called for fingerprinting and federal reporting of minors who cross the border in suspected acts of human trafficking, The Marshall Project reported. Anyone who 'use(s) unrelated minors to gain entry into the United States' would be eligible for a sentence of as many as 10 years in prison. Vance additionally co-sponsored Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn’s Back the Blue Act of 2023. The act would raise the minimum and maximum sentences, including death or life in prison, for people convicted of killing or assaulting police officers, according to The Marshall Project. Vance, Walz on abortion During his time in political office, Vance has opposed abortion access and some LGBTQ+ rights. He also supports policies he argues would increase birth rates in the United States, such as making childbirth free and financially incentivizing couples to have children. While Vance ran for Senate on a staunchly anti-abortion platform, he has somewhat shifted his public stance on the issue. In a July 7 interview on NBC’s 'Meet The Press,' Vance said he agreed with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling dismissing a case challenging the availability of mifepristone, an abortion drug. How will the economy affect Harris, Trump campaigns? 'I think it’s important to say that we need to have a conversation in our country about what our abortion policy should be,' he said. 'Donald Trump is the pragmatic leader here.' In January 2023, Walz signed a bill codifying abortion rights following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. Walz signed an executive order shielding people seeking or providing abortions in his state from facing legal consequences in other states. He also vowed to reject requests to extradite anyone accused of committing acts related to reproductive health care that are not criminal offenses in Minnesota. Walz, Vance on border and immigration In a 2021 letter, Walz asked Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to 'prioritize a clean pathway to citizenship for essential workers, dreamers, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holder, and their families.' 'Dreamers and TPS holders have enriched and strengthened Minnesota’s cities, schools, businesses, congregations and families,' Walz wrote. 'We believe that it is a moral imperative that Republicans and Democrats in Congress work together to enact bipartisan legislation that replaces fear and uncertainty with permanent protection for these individuals.' Vance's views on immigration largely echo Trump, saying he opposes 'every attempt to grant amnesty' to immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally. During his 2022 campaign for Senate, Vance ran a political ad saying, 'Joe Biden’s open border is killing Ohioans,' looking straight into the camera, adding, 'With more illegal drugs and more Democrat voters pouring into this country.' Vance argues illegal immigration has devastated parts of the country, including places like Wisconsin that are far from the U.S. border with Mexico. He blames Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden for problems such as the flow of illegal drugs, and says he and Trump will secure the border and 'put Americans first.' The Ohio senator faced backlash in September after promoting false claims that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are abducting and eating pets as he tried to draw attention to Democratic presidential nominee Harris’ immigration policies. Officials have said there have been no credible or detailed reports about the claims. Walz, Vance past controversies Walz came under fire in 2022 when the Justice Department announced federal criminal charges against dozens of people accused of exploiting a federally-funded child nutrition program during the COVID-19 pandemic. The theft of $250 million marked one of the country’s largest pandemic aid fraud cases, resulting in charges against 70 people. Five of the first seven defendants to stand trial were convicted. The trial gained widespread attention after someone tried to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash the night before the case went to the jury. Republican legislative leaders said the report shows that the failure to stop the fraud lies with Walz’s administration, which said the state’s hands were tied by a 2021 court order to resume payments despite its concerns — a charge the judge disputed — and that the FBI asked the state to continue making payments while the investigation continued. Tim Walz’s evolution on guns: From NRA darling to reform champion The Democratic governor also came under fire from GOP critics for his response to the civil unrest after a white former Minneapolis police officer killed 46-year-old Black man George Floyd. Walz’s detractors said he waited too long to deploy the Minnesota National Guard. Critics have said Vance’s 'Hillbilly Elegy,' which tells a first-person account of his extended Appalachian family’s efforts to escape poverty, perpetuates stereotypes many Appalachian people try to outrun. Vance's 2021 comments about 'violent' marriages also caused a stir. Vice reported on his remarks, which Vance made at an event that took place at Pacifica Christian High School in Southern California. Vance faced backlash after the report came out but previously said his comments had been misconstrued. Recently, he addressed resurfaced remarks that the country was being run by 'childless cat ladies,' calling it a 'sarcastic comment' and pivoting to attack Democrats as 'antifamily.' Comments Sen. JD Vance made in 2021 about 'violent' marriages also circulated online and sparked controversy. Vance made the remarks at an event at Pacifica Christian High School in Southern California. He previously said his comments had been misconstrued.

Iran preparing ballistic missile attack against Israel: Official	(NewsNation) — Iran is preparing to 'imminently' attack Israel with a ballistic missile following Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon, a senior U.S. official confirmed to NewsNation. 'We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack,' the official said. 'A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran.' Following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks last year, Israel launched a military campaign in the Gaza Strip. As the conflict dragged on, fears of a wider regional war increased. Recent conflicts between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel have ramped up. Following the death of a top Hezbollah commander, Israel launched what it described as a 'limited military campaign' in Lebanon. Israel has accused Hezbollah of attempting to invade the country from the north and engaged in a number of attacks against the group. Prior to the ground assault, Israel told people in 27 villages near the Lebanese border to evacuate.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/iran-missile-attack-israel-official/	2024-10-01T06:58:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2174986726.jpg?w=900
Helene has killed at least 130; crews search for missing	(NewsNation) — Helene's devastation came into focus Tuesday morning as rescue crews continued to search for Americans unaccounted for and trying to reach areas that were isolated by the storm. The death toll topped 130. From Florida to Virginia, tens of thousands remained without power Tuesday morning — days after Helene made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane, reaching up to 140 mph wind speeds. The system weakened as it quickly moved island, but not before causing catastrophic flooding across multiple states in the Southeast. A crisis was unfolding in western North Carolina, where residents stranded by washed-out roads and by a lack of power and cellular service lined up for fresh water and a chance to message loved ones days after the storm that they were alive. Debris of damaged houses are seen after Hurricane Helene made landfall in Horseshoe Beach, Florida, on September 28, 2024.

During a briefing Monday, White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall suggested as many as 600 people hadn’t been accounted for as of Monday afternoon, saying some might be dead. President Joe Biden said he will travel to North Carolina on Wednesday to meet with officials and take an aerial tour of Asheville. He said he hoped not to interrupt 'access to help there.' Then, the president will travel to Georgia and Florida. He said earlier that the federal government would be with affected residents in the nation’s Southeast 'as long as it takes.' When will hurricane season end? Asheville's road to recovery What was once a thriving mountainous city in North Carolina, glistening with art and historic architecture, is now a wasteland of splintered houses, crushed cargo containers and mud-covered highways. Helene has virtually cut off Asheville from the rest of the country. 'I think now people are feeling afraid. They need resources. They need help and we definitely are at a point of desperation,' Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer said. Monday's recovery efforts revealed that mudslides had washed away or blocked several main routes. Crews worked around the clock to repair cell towers and electricity, but several homes and businesses were completely gone. Government officials and aid groups worked to deliver supplies by air, truck and even mule to the hard-hit tourism hub of Asheville and its surrounding mountain towns. At least 40 people died in the county that includes Asheville. As a result, families were uprooted and lives were shattered.

They said they were originally planning on staying put to ride out Helene. However, a family member called them to tell them to evacuate because the water levels were rising. The rain, coupled with mudslides, left their Asheville house unrecognizable and uninhabitable. Inside the structure, furniture was tossed in different directions and the ground was caked in dirt. The family's four kids are unable to return to school due to damage and no internet service for online learning. 'I cried. I burst into tears. I couldn't handle it,' Jesse Kern said. 'Everything that we accomplished and built up over the last six years since we lived down here, everything is gone.' He said they now have to start from ground zero. 'I know we'll end up being OK,' His wife Dana Wunsch said. 'We have each other, we'll be alright and pull through. But it's going to suck, you know? But, we are staying positive.' The family of six has been staying at a shelter nearby, which is receiving food and water through airlifted services. For now, the family's goal is to send Wunsch and her four kids to live with her family in Ohio while Kern stays behind to tend to their dogs. South Carolina woman named after 1958 Hurricane Helene Analyzing Helene Helene was recorded as the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Florida's Big Bend region, and it was the third hurricane to hit the area in 13 months, according to the Weather Channel. The Category 4 hurricane is estimated to have brought historic storm surge, peaking at an estimated 10.33 feet in Cedar Key, Florida. Parts of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina saw upward of a foot of rain, and nearly 30 inches were recorded near Busick, North Carolina, the Weather Channel reported. Virginia also experienced heavy rainfall and severe flooding Each governor declared a state of emergency to receive federal assistance. Multiple deaths across those states have been attributed to drowning, while some were the result of downed trees or other hurricane-related incidents, like carbon monoxide poisoning from generators. Some of the worst destruction occurred in the storm’s center in Florida’s Big Bend region and South Georgia. Inland cities like Atlanta and Asheville were not shielded from the storm’s impact, with flooding trapping residents and leaving them isolated from contact. AccuWeather has increased its estimate of the total damage and economic loss from Hurricane Helene from $145 billion to $160 billion. North Carolina man hikes 11 miles to parents after Hurricane Helene Tropical Storm Kirk forms and could become a powerful hurricane Tropical Storm Kirk formed Monday in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to become a 'large and powerful hurricane' by Tuesday night or Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm was located about 800 miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect, and the storm system was not a threat to land.

Longshoremen strike could cost US economy billions daily	(NewsNation) — A strike shutting down ports from Maine to Texas could put holiday shopping — and the United States economy — at risk. The International Longshoremen Association’s strike — affecting ports along the East and Gulf coasts between Maine and Texas — comes after stalled negotiations with the U.S. Maritime Alliance. The union wants higher hourly wages and bans on automated cranes, gates and trucks. It’s the first time the union has been on strike since 1977. Rescuers search for missing after Helene rips Southeast 'ILA Longshore workers deserve to be compensated for the important work they do keeping American commerce moving and growing,' the union said in a statement. 'It's disgraceful that most of these foreign-owned shipping companies are engaged in a 'make and take' operation: they want to make their billion-dollar profits at United States ports, and off the backs of American ILA longshore workers, and take those earnings out of this country and into the pockets of foreign conglomerates.' The strike could pack a punch. The Baltimore port alone leads the country in car shipments. President Joe Biden told reporters Sunday he would not intervene in negotiations. The strike could cost the U.S. economy $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion per day, with some of that recovered over time after normal operations resume, according to the Associated Press.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/longshoremen-strike-economy-cost/	2024-10-01T04:23:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24275197522182.jpg?w=900
Israeli military begins ground operation in Lebanon	This is a developing story. Refresh for updates. Download our NewsNation app for 24/7 fact-based unbiased coverage. (NewsNation) — The Israeli military on Tuesday warned people to evacuate nearly two dozen Lebanese border communities hours after announcing the start of ground operations against Hezbollah. The militant group denied Israeli troops had entered Lebanon. It was not immediately clear whether Israeli troops had crossed the border. No photos or video footage has yet emerged showing Israeli ground forces inside Lebanon. Israel began a ground operation in Lebanon on Monday, days after its military killed the head of Hezbollah. Israel Defense Forces have begun 'limited, localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah terrorist targets and infrastructure in southern Lebanon,' the IDF said in a statement. This comes after the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and two weeks of intensive air strikes in Lebanon. Hezbollah's acting leader vows to fight on after Nasrallah's death Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told local council heads in northern Israel earlier Monday that the next phase of the war along Lebanon's southern border would begin soon. 'We will use all the means that may be required — your forces, other forces, from the air, from the sea, and on land,' Gallant said. Israeli military officials declared the areas around the communities of Metula, Misgav Am and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon as a closed military zone. Entry to the areas was prohibited. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Israel informed the U.S. about the raids, which he said were described as 'limited operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure near the border.' In accordance with the decision of the political echelon, a few hours ago, the IDF began limited, localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah terrorist targets and infrastructure in southern Lebanon. These targets are located in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel. The IDF is operating according to a methodical plan set out by the General Staff and the Northern Command which IDF soldiers have trained and prepared for in recent months. The Israeli Air Force and IDF Artillery are supporting the ground forces with precise strikes on military targets in the area. These operations were approved and carried out in accordance with the decision of the political echelon. Operation 'Northern Arrows' will continue according to the situational assessment and in parallel to combat in Gaza and in other arenas. The IDF is continuing to operate to achieve the goals of the war and is doing everything necessary to defend the citizens of Israel and return the citizens of northern Israel to their homes. IDF STATEMENT Netanyahu adds rival to Cabinet, strengthening hold on office In a statement to NewsNation, a National Security Council spokesperson said, 'This is in line with Israel's right to defend its citizens and safely return civilians to their homes. We support Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah and all Iranian backed terror groups.' 'Ultimately, a diplomatic resolution is the only way to achieve lasting stability and security across the Israel-Lebanon border.' Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire almost every day since the war in Gaza began, displacing tens of thousands of people in Israel and Lebanon. Israel says it will continue to strike Hezbollah until it is safe for families to return to their homes near the Lebanon border. Hezbollah has promised to keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza. The group’s acting leader, Naim Kassem, said in a televised statement that if Israel decides to launch a ground offensive, Hezbollah is ready. He said commanders killed in recent weeks have already been replaced.

Sean 'Diddy' Combs appeals for release while he awaits sex traffi...	Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now The Scoop Entertainment Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } NEW YORK (AP) — Sean 'Diddy' Combs is appealing a federal judge's decision to keep him in jail while he awaits trial on sex trafficking charges. The hip-hop mogul's lawyers filed a notice of appeal Monday in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after previously saying they would ask the appeals court to overturn Judge Andrew L. Carter's ruling and release him. Diddy receiving privileges including more showers: Former inmate Combs, 54, has been locked up at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since pleaded not guilty Sept. 17 to charges that he used his 'power and prestige' to induce female victims into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances with male sex workers in events dubbed 'Freak Offs.' Carter rejected a defense proposal that would've allowed the 'I’ll Be Missing You' singer to be placed under house arrest at his Florida mansion with GPS monitoring and strict limits on visitors. The judge said the plan, which included a $50 million bail offer, was 'insufficient' to ensure the safety of the community and the integrity of Combs' case. Carter said that 'no condition or set of conditions' for Combs’ release could guard against the risk of him threatening or harming witnesses. What we know about the Diddy investigation Combs' lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, had suggested moving him from the Brooklyn jail, which has been plagued by rampant violence and horrific conditions, to one in Essex County, New Jersey. He later abandoned that idea. Combs is due back in court for a status conference on Oct. 9.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/entertainment-headlines/ap-sean-diddy-combs-appeals-for-release-while-he-awaits-sex-trafficking-trial/	2024-09-30T14:25:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/66cce049c5aa44.78118796.jpeg?w=900
Why was Asheville hit so hard by Helene?	(NewsNation) — After Helene swept through western North Carolina, the storm left behind a trail of devastation, leaving those in the city of Asheville cut off from the rest of the world and wiping smaller towns off the map almost entirely After making landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Florida, Helene rapidly weakened to a tropical storm as it moved through the Southeast. The western North Carolina mountains were hit especially hard, with Buncombe County alone accounting for a third of the total storm-related deaths and hundreds more people still missing as of Monday morning. Geography and circumstance played a role in how the city was struck so hard, with the storm leaving thousands without power and water and hundreds of roads closed, making it difficult for supplies to get into the area. Helene flooding: Volunteers reopen bridge to help stranded neighbors The flooding in Asheville, home to around 94,000 people, was predicted to break records, with forecasters comparing it to a 1916 flood from a tropical storm, which also cut the city off from the rest of the world. The Great Smoky Mountains are one of the things that has drawn people to Asheville since it was first established. But the scenery comes with a price when it comes to storms: Asheville essentially sits in the bottom of a bowl of mountains, with floodwaters from higher elevations headed downhill toward the area. The mountains essentially act as a funnel, directing water down toward the valley and wiping out entire towns in the mountains along the way. Asheville is also settled between two rivers that broke 230-year-old records for flooding during Helene. The French Broad River, which usually crests around 1 1/2 feet, reached 24.6 feet during the storm. The Swannanoa River went from a crest of around 1 1/2 feet to 26.1, a height not reached since 1791. Dad makes 30-mile trek through Helene debris to walk daughter down the aisle Helene also came at a particularly bad time for the region. The area saw several days of heavy rain prior to the storm, leaving the ground saturated and rivers already rising higher than normal. Over three days, the city saw 17.31 inches of rain, breaking a previous record of 13.71 for the entire month of September. The mountains that surround Asheville are also hindering supply delivery. In addition to widespread power and cell service outages, there has been extensive damage to the city's water system that officials say will take weeks to be fully restored. In the meantime, Buncombe County authorities have said there are plans to set up distribution sites for food and water as supplies arrive. However, road closures are making it difficult to get supplies to the city, with only one major route into the area fully open.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/why-asheville-hit-hard-helene/	2024-09-30T09:41:34-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2174585773.jpg?w=900
JD Vance, Tim Walz trade barbs before vice presidential debate	(NewsNation) — Vice presidential candidates Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are ramping up their personal and political attacks ahead of what could be the last debate of the 2024 election Vance, Republican nominee Donald Trump's running mate, has questioned Walz's military record, saying he exaggerated aspects of his service. Walz, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' running mate, meanwhile, sharply criticized his opponent for his comments after a school shooting in Georgia. Speaking at a rally in Phoenix, Vance said that school shootings are a 'fact of life.' Both candidates have been facing scrutiny for flip-flopping on important issues and catering to their party lines. Politicians on both sides of the aisle say their candidate will be focusing on policy at Tuesday night's debate hosted by CBS News. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said on NewsNation's 'The Hill Sunday' that Walz has to put a 'human face' on his and Harris' emphasis on small businesses, startups and innovation, 'as opposed to the big business orientation on the other side.' Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., on the other hand, said Vance has the issues, such as the economy and border, on his side during an interview on ABC News. Vice presidential debate rules CBS anchor Norah O’Donnell and 'Face the Nation' host Margaret Brennan will moderate the debate, which begins at 9 p.m. ET. The debate will last 90 minutes, with candidates having two minutes to answer questions. Microphones will not be muted, and moderators will not be fact-checking either side's statements, so it'll be up to the candidates to do that to each other. After winning a coin toss Thursday, Vance chose to give the second closing statement, giving him the final word, CBS said.

Hezbollah's acting leader vows to fight on after Nasrallah's deat...	BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah's acting leader vowed Monday to continue battling Israel and said the militant group was prepared for a long fight even after much of its top command was wiped out, including its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Israeli strikes have killed Nasrallah and six of his top commanders and officials in the last 10 days, and have hit what the military says are thousands of militant targets across large parts of Lebanon. Over 1,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Early Monday, an airstrike hit a residential building, wiping out one apartment, damaging others, and killing three Palestinian militants in central Beirut, as Israel appeared to send a clear message that no part of Lebanon is out of bounds. Despite the heavy blow Hezbollah has suffered in recent weeks, acting leader Naim Kassem said in a televised statement that if Israel decides to launch a ground offensive, the group's fighters are ready — noting that the commanders killed have already been replaced. 'Israel was not able to affect our (military) capabilities,' Kassem said in his first speech since Nasrallah was killed. 'There are deputy commanders and there are replacements in case a commander is wounded in any post.' He added that Hezbollah anticipated 'the battle could be long.' A founding member of Hezbollah who had been Nasrallah’s longtime deputy, Kassem will remain in his acting position until the group’s leadership elects a replacement. The man widely expected to take over the top post is Hashem Safieddine, a cousin of Nasrallah who oversees the group’s political affairs. Hezbollah has significantly increased its rocket attacks in the past week to several hundred daily, but most have been intercepted or fallen in open areas. Several people have been wounded in Israel. There have been no fatalities since two soldiers were killed near the border on Sept. 19. But Hezbollah’s capabilities remain unclear. As recently as two weeks ago, a strike like Monday's in central Beirut — outside of the main areas where Hezbollah operates and next to a busy transportation hub normally crowded with buses, taxis and vans — would have been seen as a major escalation and likely followed by a long-range Hezbollah strike into Israel. But the unspoken rules of the long-running conflict are no longer clear. It's possible that Hezbollah is holding back to save resources for a bigger battle, including a threatened Israeli ground invasion. But the militant group might also be in disarray after Israeli intelligence apparently penetrated its highest levels. In the past week, Israel has frequently targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence — including the massive strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah — but had not hit locations closer to the city center. The strike early Monday killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a small, leftist faction that has not been meaningfully involved in months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has not claimed the strike but is widely assumed to have carried it out. Also Monday, Hamas announced that its top commander in Lebanon, Fatah Sharif, was killed with his family in an airstrike on the Al-Buss refugee camp in the southern port city of Tyre. The Israeli military confirmed that it had targeted him. Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack from Gaza into Israel sparked the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies and both supported by Iran, and Hezbollah said it would continue the attacks in solidarity with the Palestinians until there was a cease-fire in Gaza. Israel has responded to the rockets with airstrikes in Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based, and the fighting has steadily escalated over the past year. The Lebanese government says the fighting may have displaced up to a million people, although the U.N. estimate is around 200,000. Tens of thousands of Israelis have also been displaced. Israel has vowed to keep fighting until the attacks stop and its citizens can return to their homes. The United States and its allies have called for a cease-fire, hoping to avoid further escalation that could draw in Iran and set off a wider war. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has shown little interest, as his country racks up military achievements against a longtime foe. Some Israelis broke into spontaneous celebrations after Nasrallah’s death was announced. Videos circulated of crowds at bars singing a song in Hebrew mocking him. A news anchor on a pro-Netanyahu station sang and danced as the studio audience joined in with him while a commentator on Israel’s largest TV station offered co-panelists celebratory shots. Hezbollah, which boasts tens of thousands of battle-hardened fighters and long-range missiles capable of hitting anywhere inside Israel, has long been seen as the most powerful militant group in the region and a key partner to Iran in both threatening and deterring Israel. Hezbollah fought Israel to a monthlong stalemate in their 2006 war, But Hezbollah has never faced an onslaught quite like this one, which began with a sophisticated attack on its pagers and walkie-talkies in mid-September that killed dozens of people and wounded around 3,000 — including many fighters but also many civilians. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon had 'wiped out' Hezbollah’s command structure but warned that the group will work quickly to rebuild it. 'We’re watching to see what they do to try to fill this leadership vacuum. It’s going to be tough,' he told CNN’s 'State of the Union' on Sunday. ___ Melzer reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

An Israeli airstrike hits central Beirut for the first time in ne...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The first apparent Israeli airstrike on central Beirut in nearly a year of conflict leveled an apartment building early Monday. It came after Israel hit targets across Lebanon and killed dozens of people, as Hezbollah sustained heavy blows to its command structure, including the killing of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The airstrike hit a multistory residential building, according to an Associated Press journalist at the scene. Videos showed ambulances and a crowd gathered near the building in a mainly Sunni district with a busy thoroughfare lined with shops. A Palestinian leftist faction in Lebanon said three of its members were killed in the airstrike. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said in a statement early Monday that its military and security commanders in Lebanon, and a third member, were killed in the attack. The group has not played a significant role in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Shiite militant group Hezbollah. An official with Lebanon's Civil Defense had earlier said that a member of the al-Jamaa al-Islamiya was killed in the strike and that 16 other people were wounded, but the Sunni militant group, which fights alongside Hezbollah, has not confirmed the death of any of its members. Also early Monday, another strike killed a commander with the militant group Hamas, which has a presence in Lebanon's Palestinian refugee camps. Hamas said Fatah Sharif and his family were killed in an airstrike on the Al-Buss refugee camp in the southern port city of Tyre. In the past week, Israel has frequently targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence — including a major strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah — but had not hit locations near the city center. Israeli officials had no immediate comment. Earlier, Hezbollah confirmed that Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of its Central Council, was killed Saturday, making him the seventh senior Hezbollah leader killed in Israeli strikes in a little over a week. They include the group's founding members who had evaded death or detention for decades. Hezbollah also confirmed that Ali Karaki, another senior commander, died in the strike that killed Nasrallah. Israel says at least 20 other Hezbollah militants were killed, including one in charge of Nasrallah's security detail. The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 105 people were killed around the country in airstrikes Sunday. Two strikes near the southern city of Sidon, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) south of Beirut, killed at least 32 people, the ministry said. Separately, Israeli strikes in the northern province of Baalbek Hermel killed 21 people and wounded at least 47. Lebanese media reported dozens of strikes in the central, eastern and western Bekaa and in the south, besides strikes on Beirut. Israel says it targets militants, but the strikes have hit buildings where civilians were living and the death toll was expected to rise. In a video of a strike in Sidon, verified by the AP, a building swayed before collapsing as neighbors filmed. One TV station called on viewers to pray for a family caught under the rubble, posting their pictures, as rescuers failed to reach them. The Lebanese Health Ministry reported at least 14 medics were killed over two days in the south. President Joe Biden said Sunday that he would speak soon with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and believes that an all-out war in the Middle East must be avoided. 'It has to be,' Biden told reporters at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware as he boarded Air Force One for Washington. Meanwhile, wreckage from Friday's strike that killed Nasrallah was still smoldering. Smoke rose over the rubble as people flocked to the site, some to check on what was left of their homes and others to pay respects, pray or simply to see the destruction. In response to the dramatic escalation in Israeli strikes on Lebanon, Hezbollah significantly increased its rocket attacks in the past week, from several dozen to several hundred daily, the Israeli military said. The attacks injured several people and caused damage, but most of the rockets and drones were intercepted by Israel’s air defense systems or fell in open areas. The army says its strikes have degraded Hezbollah’s capabilities and the number of launches would be much higher if Hezbollah had not been hit. Israel strikes Houthi targets in Yemen Also on Sunday, the Israeli military said dozens of its aircraft struck Houthi targets in Yemen in response to a recent attack. The military said it targeted power plants and sea port facilities in the city of Hodeida. The Houthis launched a ballistic missile attack toward Israel's Ben Gurion airport on Saturday when Netanyahu was arriving. The Houthi media office said the Israeli strikes hit the Hodeida and Rass Issa ports, along with two power plants in Hodeida city, a stronghold for the Iranian-backed rebels. The Houthi-run Health Ministry said the strikes killed four people and wounded 40 others. The Houthis claimed they took precautionary measures ahead of the strikes, emptying oil stored in the ports, according to Nasruddin Ammer, deputy director of the Houthi media office. He said in a post on X that the strikes won’t stop the rebels’ attacks on shipping routes and on Israel. U.S. warns Hezbollah will work quickly to rebuild Meanwhile, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon had 'wiped out' Hezbollah’s command structure, but he warned the group will work quickly to rebuild it. 'I think people are safer without him walking around,' Kirby said of Nasrallah. 'But they will try to recover. We’re watching to see what they do to try to fill this leadership vacuum. It’s going to be tough. … Much of their command structure has now been wiped out.' Speaking on CNN’s 'State of the Union,' Kirby sidestepped questions about whether the Biden administration agrees with how the Israelis are targeting Hezbollah leaders. The White House continues to call on Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a 21-day temporary cease-fire floated by the U.S., France and other countries during the U.N. General Assembly last week. Airstrikes drive thousands from homes in Lebanon A wave of Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon have killed more than 1,030 people — including 156 women and 87 children — in less than two weeks, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven from their homes. The government estimates around 250,000 are in shelters, with three to four times as many staying with friends or relatives, or camping out on the streets. Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and political party backed by Iran, Israel’s chief regional rival, rose to regional prominence after fighting a devastating monthlong war with Israel in 2006 that ended in a draw. Kaouk was a veteran member of Hezbollah going back to the 1980s and served as Hezbollah's military commander in southern Lebanon during the 2006 war with Israel. The United States announced sanctions against him in 2020. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies that consider themselves part of an Iran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' against Israel. The conflict has steadily ratcheted up to the brink of all-out war, raising fears of a region-wide conflagration. Israel says it is determined to return some 60,000 of its citizens to communities in the north that were evacuated nearly a year ago. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its rocket fire if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which has proven elusive despite months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas led by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

Trump and Harris on food prices: Promises vs. reality	(NewsNation) — A long-held political truism has been that when the U.S. economy is going well, the president generally gets too much credit, and when things aren’t going well, the president gets too much blame. But that hasn’t stopped presidents and presidential candidates from claiming that their policies will quickly and effectively turn around bad times. And the 2024 presidential election is no exception. Both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have made promises and released proposals to improve the U.S. economy, especially when it comes to food prices. Here’s a look at some of their most prominent positions, and how experts view the chances of those stands becoming reality. Harris: Ban price gouging Harris has called on Congress to pass a bill to ban price gouging on food, a proposal very close to the bill that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., introduced earlier this year. It would give the Federal Trade Commission and the states the power to penalize companies that use their power to sell goods 'at and excessive price.' Warren’s bill would also give the FTC the power to define 'excessive,' a move that is bound to create partisan controversy. And, with a divided Congress, the Warren bill has little chance of passing this year. Even if Harris wins, political experts believe that Republicans could control both houses of Congress next year. What causes rising egg prices? Trump: Impose tariffs on food imports 'Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,'' Trump said this earlier this month. As president, he imposed tariffs with a flourish, targeting imported solar panels, steel, aluminum and pretty much everything from China. Trump insists that tariffs are paid for by foreign countries. In fact, it is importers – American companies – that pay tariffs, and the money goes to the U.S. Treasury. Those companies, in turn, typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. That's why economists say consumers usually end up footing the bill for tariffs. As president, Trump put a 9% tariff on imported washing machines, which hiked the consumer price of washing machines by 9%, according to Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan. Vance faces biggest moment of political career with debate Harris: Antitrust enforcement The Biden administration has taken action against what it calls 'anticompetitive behavior' in the food industry, which it says has helped drive up food costs. The FTC is trying to stop the $25 billion merger of the two of the country’s biggest grocery store chains, Albertsons and Kroger. The Harris campaign has hired advisers who are tied to Biden’s moves, a signal that Harris will also take an aggressive antitrust stance. It's been a long time since the federal government tried to break up monopolies. The 1936 Robinson-Patman Act, which bans suppliers from offering better prices to its bigger customers at the expense of smaller competitors, is still on the books but hasn’t been enforced for many years. But economists say that, even when antitrust action is successful, it would take a long time to have an impact on retail food prices. Trump: Expand the domestic energy supply Trump has argued that lower energy costs would be one of several steps, along with lowering taxes and interest rates, that would 'quickly bring down prices' for everything, including food. He’s promised to approve more domestic oil drilling, and to bring the price of gasoline down to below $2 a gallon. He has said those moves would 'bring down the price of everything from electricity rates to groceries, airfares, and housing costs.' The U.S. is already producing record amounts of oil and gas, and the Biden administration has approved many new permits to drill on federal land. Economists say that, while energy costs figured in every step of the food supply chain, it’s just one of many factors. Also, the U.S. government can only do so much to influence gas prices, which are mostly shaped by global politics and market factors. ChatGPT can help you save money on your bills Reality vs. perception The experts, and many years of history, suggest that U.S. presidents have very little power to immediately influence consumer prices for food and other goods and services. But it looks like most of us believe otherwise. An August survey conducted by the agriculture departments of Purdue University and the University of Illinois asked this question: Who do you think can help lower retail food prices? 'We find that most respondents thought that political parties could help lower food prices and grocery bills,' the survey authors wrote. 'Perhaps not surprisingly in a polarized political environment, most respondents who identified with one of the major parties thought that only their party could lower prices,' they added. The survey of 1,000 adults around the U.S. found that, among those who prefer Trump, about 65% believe that only Republicans can lower food prices. Among Harris supporters, 50% think that only Democrats can accomplish the task.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-harris-on-food-prices/	2024-09-29T15:46:58-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2050741858.jpg?w=900
Mexican cartels flood US with fentanyl, causing 200+ deaths daily	(NewsNation) — Two Mexican drug cartels are primarily responsible for flooding the United States with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 80 times stronger than morphine that's killing over 200 Americans daily, authorities say. The Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels have established a sophisticated supply chain, sourcing precursor chemicals from China and manufacturing fentanyl in clandestine Mexican labs before smuggling it across the U.S. border, according to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reports. No substance comes close to the death toll caused by fentanyl. It claims over 200 lives every day – that's the equivalent of a full airplane crashing daily. Fact-checking claims Harris and Trump have made about the border DEA seizures highlight the escalating crisis. In 2021, authorities confiscated 23 million fentanyl pills and nearly 7,000 pounds of powder. By 2023, those numbers surged to over 80 million pills and about 12,000 pounds of powder. In 2024 alone, 37.7 million pills and more than 5,400 pounds of fentanyl powder have been seized – enough to produce 269 million lethal doses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported fentanyl-related overdose deaths increased from 70,000 in 2021 to over 74,000 in 2023, surpassing deaths from other drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine. Behind the statistics are tragic personal stories. Stefanie Turner of Texas lost her son Tucker to fentanyl poisoning after he purchased a single pill online while struggling with sleep and anxiety. ICE released 435,000 migrants with criminal convictions: Data 'Fentanyl is taking a whole generation of brilliant minds,' Turner said. 'If you don't receive medication from a pharmacy, count that it has fentanyl. One pill does kill.' Government efforts to combat the crisis are intensifying. California's task force seized 8.8 million fentanyl pills this year, while Texas now prosecutes fentanyl-related deaths as murders. The Biden administration has partnered with China to disrupt the supply of precursor chemicals. Despite these efforts, including high-profile arrests like that of Sinaloa Cartel co-founder Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada in July, the cartels have proven adaptable. They employ various tactics to evade detection, including mislabeled packages, encrypted messaging and cryptocurrency payments. The cartels have proven resilient and adaptable, shifting their strategies to maintain control over a billion-dollar fentanyl trade that's ripping through communities and lives.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/fentanyl/cartels-fentanyl-deaths/	2024-09-29T14:37:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/AP24046652384901-e1715598989656.jpg?w=900
200 chemicals linked to breast cancer found in food packaging: St...	(NewsNation) — Common food packaging materials — like shrink wrap, paper, cardboard and plastic — contain dozens of chemicals linked to breast cancer, researchers say. Published in Frontiers in Toxicology, a new article reports that 143 chemicals found in plastic are linked to breast cancer, while 89 were found in cardboard. The research team compared chemicals found in packaging with those listed in the Food Packaging Forum's database, noting that humans are regularly exposed to 76 of the carcinogenic chemicals through food. More brain injuries will occur from contact sports: Doctor In fact, many of them — 40 of those 76 — are already classified as hazardous internationally. Researchers say this shows existing regulations might not be enough to fully prevent exposure. 'Reducing population-wide exposure to potential mammary carcinogens can be achieved by science-based policy amendments addressing the assessment and management of food contact chemicals,' the article reads. The chemicals, including PFAs, bisphenols and phthalates, are known to be hazardous to health. PFAs resist breaking down naturally and can build up in the body over time, earning them the nickname 'forever chemicals.' They are associated with higher risk of certain cancers, such as kidney and testicular, as well as low birthweight, high cholesterol and pregnancy-induced hypertension, according to the CDC. ‘Dirty soda’: Regularly consuming the trendy drink is ‘risky,’ dietitian says This data just days after a peer-reviewed research published in the the journal Nature which found just over 3,600 chemicals — including some known carcinogens — were passed from food packaging to humans. The study cross-examined 14,000 chemicals approved for food contact with databases and biomonitoring programs, which researchers acknowledged as only a partial view of human chemical accumulation: 'Humans are known to be exposed to FCCs via foods, but the full extent of human exposure to all FCCs is unknown … [they] are exposed synthetic chemicals from food, drugs, household and personal care products, and environmental pollutants.' Nexstar’s Ashleigh Jackson and Ashley Bihun contributed to the report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/breast-cancer-chemicals-food-packaging/	2024-09-29T13:29:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/GettyImages-1230031258-e1709656349577.jpg?w=900
Rising egg prices linked to bird flu's impact on supply chain	(The Hill) — The rising price of eggs in the last year has been linked to bird’s flu impact on the supply chain. Eggs’ price tag has gone up by 28.1 percent in the last 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average price for a dozen large eggs was $3.20, according to the bureau's statistics. The spikes in prices occurred, in part, because of the high demand for the product, but also due to the bird flu outbreak at chicken farms in Colorado in July. ‘Dirty soda’: Regularly consuming the trendy drink is ‘risky,’ dietitian says 'Bird flu is the number one reason for higher prices, absolutely,' Phil Lempert, a grocery industry analyst, told CNN. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), also known as bird flu, has affected over 100 million in 48 states since January 2022, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. 'Think about how they are housed: small spaces with lots of chickens,' Lempert said. 'When one chicken gets bird flu, they’ve got to cull the entire flock. That’s the problem.' The sickness of the birds has affected the total egg output, and lower production of eggs, in part, leads to an increase in prices. Here are the top 10 states where you’re likely to find gold: survey 'Table egg-layer facilities tend to be very large, and so you can lose a million or two million birds on a single facility, because this is a highly contagious virus,' Amy Hagerman, an associate professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, told NPR. But bird flu is not the only factor causing the prices of eggs to go upward. Emily Metz, the president of the American Egg Board, told NPR that 'inflationary pressures' play a key role since fuel prices are higher, along with high labor costs and packaging. 'Egg farmers are price takers, not price makers, and the volatility that we’re seeing is reflecting a number of factors that are completely outside the control of the egg farmer,' Metz said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/egg-prices-bird-flu/	2024-09-29T12:16:32-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Eggs_041123_AP-e1727634263566.jpg?w=800
US retailers brace for potential pain from a longshoremen's strik...	With a dockworkers' strike threatening to close ports on the East and Gulf coasts beginning this week, Chris Butler is growing worried. Butler is CEO of the National Tree Company, and, like many businesses, his is counting on shipments that are en route from Asia but won't reach their ports before an expected strike by longshoremen starting at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday. The company, based in New Jersey, is an importer of artificial Christmas trees and other holiday decorations. If a strike were to last just a few days, there might be time afterward to unload the trees, transport them to warehouses and have them ready for customers this season. Yet if a strike were to keep ports closed until, say, November, about 150,000 trees might not arrive in time for the peak shopping season, imposing costs on National Tree and other businesses. In a worst-case scenario, those costs, multiplied across industries, could fuel inflation and pressure the U.S. economy. 'Definitely not an ideal situation,' Butler said. National Tree already has stockpiled or delivered most of the roughly 2 million artificial trees it sells each year. But it would lose revenue if 150,000 of the trees got stuck in the pipeline. Other businesses face the same predicament, with goods that could be stranded at sea if 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association make good on their threat to strike. They could shut down 36 ports from Maine to Texas that handle about half the goods shipped into and out of the United States. (West Coast dockworkers belong to a different union and aren't involved in the strike.) A prolonged strike would force companies to pay shippers for the delays, and goods could arrive too late for the high point of holiday shopping season. On Friday, top Biden administration officials met with port operators and told them they should negotiate with the union ahead of Tuesday, according to a White House official who insisted on anonymity to discuss an ongoing meeting. Butler says he's hoping for an agreement or for government intervention to halt a strike. But the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents shippers and ports, and the longshoremen’s union haven't met since June. And no talks are scheduled. The union is demanding significantly higher wages and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and moving containers in the loading and unloading of freight. The Toy Association, the nation’s leading toy trade group, was among about 200 organizations that asked President Joe Biden in a letter this month to work with both sides to reach an agreement. The National Grain and Feed Association also urged Biden to take action to avert a strike, which would come just as harvest season gets underway. Their push has put Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, in a sensitive position: Both have courted union support and don't want to be seen as pressuring the longshoremen to reach a settlement. Yet if an extended strike were to cause shortages of consumer goods or fuel high inflation, it could cost Harris votes in the November election. Under the Taft-Hartley Act, Biden could seek a court order to suspend the strike for an 80-day cooling-off period. Robyn Patterson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement that the administration has never invoked the act and isn't considering it now. Biden and Congress did step in two years ago to block a looming freight rail strike and force those workers to accept a deal because of widespread fears that a rail strike would have damaged the economy. Alex Hertel-Fernandez, an associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who served as a Labor Department official under Biden, suggested that the administration will follow the playbook it used in talks last year between West Coast ports and the union there: Mediating negotiations without directly intervening. Greg Ahearn, CEO of the Toy Association, said a strike would happen at a critical moment for toy sellers and makers: Up to 60% of annual sales occur from October through December. Though some toy companies shipped goods earlier, Ahearn said a strike would make it hard to replenish hot-selling items. A strike, he warned, could raise toy prices 'based on scarcity and increased costs.' At National Tree, Butler and his crew began preparing for a strike in July. They accelerated shipments for everything they could. But one major retail client, he said, asked for trees early. And until recently, factories in China and elsewhere couldn’t produce the rest of National Tree’s orders. Ships containing the trees are on the way to New York but won't get there before Tuesday. A prolonged strike, Butler said, would force most of the trees to be warehoused until next Christmas season. A longshoremen's strike would further distress a global supply chain that has already endured slowdowns from attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on commercial shipping. Those attacks have all but shut down the use of the Red Sea and Suez Canal, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation. The attacks are forcing longer transit times for vessels that must navigate around the Cape of Good Hope to reach East Coast and Gulf Coast ports. A dockworkers' strike, Gold said, could prove even more damaging than the pandemic-induced port congestion in 2021 and 2022, when cargo was allowed to move, albeit slowly. Eastern ports could be left at a standstill. Gold noted that carriers are already announcing surcharges on containers to address potential disruptions, a trend that could elevate inflation. Many retailers might find it difficult to charge customers more to make up for those expenses. Most vulnerable, Gold said, would be small businesses that don’t import directly and lack the financial resources to incur higher costs. Shippers could reroute some cargo to West Coast ports. But those ports couldn't come close to absorbing the additional cargo. The Port of Los Angeles, for example, moved 960,000 containers in August — about 80% of its capacity — said Gene Seroka, its executive director. The major Western railroads, Union Pacific and BNSF, have added capacity to their systems to handle more freight as imports have increased. Eastern railroads CSX and Norfolk Southern say they can move cars and crews to handle more freight coming to Chicago from the West. But it’s not clear just how much more the railroads can manage. In any case, Butler said, it would be too costly for him to ship trees across the country by rail. Taylor Green, co-founder of landscaping company Artificial Grass Solutions in Los Angeles, which imports artificial turf, said he bought 25% more turf than usual to ensure there would be enough for clients’ projects. He also made arrangements with alternative suppliers in case the strike goes on indefinitely. If it does, Green said, price increases would likely be necessary. Still, like some larger retailers and manufacturers, Artificial Grass says it's better prepared for shortages than it was during the pandemic. 'We’ve learned to be proactive rather than reactive,' Green said. ____ Associated Press Writers Anne D'Innocenzio and Mae Anderson in New York, Josh Boak in Washington and Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska, contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/ap-us-retailers-brace-for-potential-pain-from-a-longshoremens-strike/	2024-09-29T06:14:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f95331db86d5.07504581.jpeg?w=900
Harris-Trump race poses biggest test yet for reproductive rights	November will mark the first presidential election since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, posing the biggest test yet over the impact that women’s reproductive health will have up and down the ballot. Democrats rode anger about the overturning of Roe, which legalized abortion at the federal level, to a surprise victory during the 2022 midterm elections. And the party has racked up more wins in competitive races since then, with their success in large part attributed to the lingering power of the issue. Now, two years after the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling, Democrats are hoping the issue resonates enough to propel Vice President Harris to the White House. 'Very rarely is an election decided on one issue,' said Christina Reynolds, senior vice president at EMILY’s List, a group dedicated to elected Democratic women in favor of abortion rights. '[But] there is a clear lean to one side and that side is the Democrats,' she added. 'People are actually understanding and seeing what happens and your best way to deal with this is elect the people who will protect your rights.' Anti-abortion advocates push back on this argument, pointing to governors with anti-abortion policies in Georgia and Texas. 'No incumbent pro-life governor or senator lost in 2022, despite facing very vocal pro-abortion Democrats like Stacey Abrams and Beto O'Rourke,' said Emily Erin Davis, vice president of communications at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, 'Since the 2022 midterms, SBA Pro-Life America has invested significant resources in focus groups and polling to drill down on the most effective political messaging heading into 2024,' she said. The two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe has seen the issue largely kicked back to states, which conservatives and anti-abortion advocates have argued is where it belongs. 'Democrats won’t be getting the most bang for the buck anymore after this election on this issue simply because each of the states will have defined rules for themselves,' said Ford O’Connell, a Republican strategist. But Democrats point to polling that shows the issue playing to their advantage this November. A majority of voters have consistently opposed the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. According to a Marquette Law School poll released last month, 67 percent of respondents said they opposed the decision, while 33 percent said they favored it. Meanwhile, a CNN poll released earlier this week found that 52 percent of likely voters said they favored Harris’s approach to voters nationally, while 31 percent said they felt the same about Trump’s approach. 'We’re working with an electorate that really understands the harms that have come from these Trump abortion bans,' said Olivia Cappello of Planned Parenthood Action Fund. But Republicans note that abortion is not the only issue voters are voting on. 'The issue is important,' said Republican strategist Zack Roday. 'But I believe this election will be decided on who people believe can do a better job bringing down costs and keeping us safe.' According to data released by the Pew Research Center, 81 percent of voters said the economy was their top issue, followed by 65 percent who said the same about health care. Fifty one percent said the same about abortion. Democrats point to their past success in the 2022 midterm elections following the overturning of Roe. The midterm elections that year saw the expected red wave fail to materialize and a number of abortion-related ballot measures in red and blue states passing in favor of maintaining abortion access. This year, abortion-related measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri, Maryland, New York and Florida. 'On the ballot measure front, voters recognize that they have an opportunity in states that have direct democracy to make swift change in the state of abortion access in their state,' Cappello said. And unlike in 2022, access to in vitro fertilization is a central part of the conversation surrounding reproductive health care. Democrats have sought to tie Republicans to efforts in states like Alabama to limit or restrict access to the procedure. But many Republicans, including Trump, have expressed their support for the procedure. On Wednesday, the Trump campaign said if elected the former president would support 'universal access' to IVF. 'The stance that Trump has taken is the majority feeling within the Republican Party because at the end of the day, IVF is about life,' O’Connell said. But both candidates have addressed abortion and reproductive health. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier this week, Trump predicted that under his administration women 'will be happy, healthy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion.' Harris has repeatedly hammered Trump on the issue, citing his appointment of conservative judges to the Supreme Court. On Tuesday, she called to eliminate the filibuster to codify abortion rights in the Constitution. Earlier this month during a campaign stop in the battleground state of Georgia, Harris highlighted the stories of two women, who Harris said died as a result of the state’s abortion ban passed by Republicans following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. ProPublica first reported on the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller. Thurman waited 20 hours in a suburban Atlanta hospital after seeking medical care for an incomplete abortion, and, according to a state medical board review, died largely because of the hospital’s delay in treating her. Miller died after she did not seek medical care for complications from abortion medicine. Her family said she was fearful of getting medical treatment when it was clear the abortion was not complete. 'Good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying a healthcare provider will only start providing that care when you’re about to die?' Harris said. Georgia’s six-week ban on the procedure does have exceptions to save the life of the mother, but opponents of the ban say it creates confusion for doctors. Earlier this week SBA Pro-Life America’s partner, the Women Speak Out PAC, launched a $500,000 television and digital ad campaign in Georgia, responding to Harris. The group accused Democrats, including Vice President Harris, of spreading 'deadly misinformation' about the women’s deaths. Conservatives and groups like SBA Pro-Life America are pushing Republicans to paint their Democratic counterparts are radical and extreme on the issue, something they have worked to do in the past. 'Many GOP candidates even won by double-digit margins. Republicans will see more victories going forward if they emphasize support for pro-life protections, communicate on the issue with compassion and contrast their position with the deeply unpopular Democrat agenda for unlimited abortion in the seventh, eighth, and ninth months of pregnancy,' Davis said. Roday noted that this cycle both sides find themselves in 'uncertain terrain' on the issue given the top of the ticket. 'Simply because of it being a presidential [election], I do believe it’s a whole new dynamic,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-trump-race-poses-biggest-test-yet-for-reproductive-rights/	2024-09-29T05:31:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Abortion-first_0929_AP_Mark-Schiefelbein.png?w=900
Gabby Petito's father has a mission to help the missing	(NewsNation) — Turning tragedy into purpose — that’s the mission of Joe Petito, whose daughter Gabby was found dead in September of 2021. Gabby Petito's death Gabby Petito’s disappearance sparked a national search and news coverage across the world, in television, newspapers and especially social media. The search ended 8 days after her parents reported her missing when her body was found at a Wyoming campsite. The FBI later announced that her fiance, Brian Laundrie, was found dead and left a confession admitting he killed her. Drone video shows moment missing girl found in woods 'We found her inside of, what, eight, nine days, and brought her home, you know, and across the country,' Joe Petito told NewsNation’s Marni Hughes. 'How do you say ‘thank you’ for something so overwhelming? I mean, billions of people [paid attention to her case]; it sounds funny saying it. But now we’ve got to get those stories for other people. Everyone deserves the same attention.' Petito spoke during a special episode of Missing, highlighting three years of bringing the stories of missing people to the audience. It’s an effort inspired by the search for Gabby Petito. 150 cases have been profiled on the show, and Joe Petito has made it his mission to help other families find missing loved ones. 'Since Gabby’s story, we've seen an influx of missing person cases not only hit the national news, but also on our social media pages,' he told Hughes. 'And that's been amazing to see. I mean, you have a missing show inspired by Gabby. How do you say ‘thank you’ for that? To be honest, and I know you're doing it to help others and all, but it just, it is humbling to see that Gabby was able to touch that many people and inspire that many people, and we're just trying to help as many people as we can because so many helped us.' Joe Petito and the Gabby Petito foundation One way he is doing that is with the Gabby Petito Foundation, with a mission of supporting the search for missing people and stopping domestic violence. 'Domestic violence is an issue that's as old as time, to be honest with you,' he said. 'We know so much more now than we did before. So really, it's about helping the youth understand certain signs, places to go, information. People don't even know where to begin. And that's always troubling. So we always give out the National Domestic Violence Hotline.' Boy abducted from California in 1951 found more than 70 years later The foundation also highlights the 'Hope Can’t Wait' campaign of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Another partnership is with the Black and Missing Foundation. 'Most of the missing stories that you see on the national stage have my complexion, you know, and that's just the way it is. I don't know why, but you know what? I'm not going to sit here and post blame,' Petio said.' I don't care where the blame lines, but we know there's an issue. So now moving forward, let's fix that.' To the families who are trying to find loved ones, he says the most important thing is to keep working to get their stories to the public, in any way possible. 'First of all, don't give up, you know, reach out to us. Reach out to friends, family, if you're more comfortable. But you have to keep pushing. You have to keep this story out there. You know, keep putting those flyers up. Keep calling the networks, keep trying to get as many stories out there. The more people that see it, the more that it's going to be shared. And that's it helps. It really does make a difference,' he said. Samantha Tapp left a strange trail years after she vanished Petito and the foundation are working with national, state and local organizations. He says they are currently focused on a lethality assessment at statewide levels. In 2023, the foundation was instrumental in helping lawmakers pass the Gabby Petito Act in Florida. 'The more we can get it out there, the more trainings that we can do, the more education we can give, he said. 'That's the goal, to no longer need foundations like the Gabby Petito Foundation, that's the goal. Put me out of business, please. That's for us to close my doors. It's fine. That means we did our job.' To watch the entire one-hour special episode of Missing, click here NEED LINK. Missing airs Thursdays in the NewsNation app and at newsnationnow.com.

Florida fishing community 'devastated' over hurricanes: Boat capt...	(NewsNation) — A Florida fishing community is reeling from the impact of Hurricane Helene, the latest in a series of storms to batter the region in recent months. Capt. Kenny Mullins, a local charter boat operator, described the devastation in Keaton Beach, a small coastal town north of Gainesville. 'We just had total devastation,' Mullins said in a phone interview on 'NewsNation Now.' 'Lots of us have lost our homes. I have three boats that are damaged. We don't know when we're going to be able to get back out on the water.' Helene aftermath: At least 56 dead, severe flood risk remains The community, which relies heavily on the fishing industry, was still recovering from Hurricane Idalia 13 months ago. Insurance costs for boat operators in the area are high, Mullins said, especially for those with multiple vessels. With the busy fishing season approaching, many captains are facing canceled bookings and requests for deposit refunds. 'We were living on pennies, waiting for this busy season to come in, and then this hit right at that time,' Mullins said. 'I don't know when I'll be able to work again.' Massive rains from powerful Hurricane Helene left people stranded, without shelter and awaiting rescue Saturday, as the cleanup began from a tempest that killed at least 56 people, caused widespread destruction across the U.S. Southeast and left millions without power. Fact-checking claims Harris and Trump have made about the border Mullins said that one of his fellow captains' houses was 'literally in a pile.' He also said that entire houses have been swept into canals, compounding the damage. Helene blew ashore in Florida’s Big Bend region as a Category 4 hurricane late Thursday with winds of 140 mph. Despite the challenges, Mullins expressed hope that the community would come together. He and other local boat operators are considering alternative ways to generate income, including selling gift certificates for future charters. 'Anything will help,' Mullins said.

Fact-checking claims Harris and Trump have made about the border	(NewsNation) — With a few weeks until the 2024 presidential election, border security has emerged as a central campaign issue. Both Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump are projecting tough stances on migration, making various claims about their records on border policy. NewsNation fact-checked these claims, revealing a mix of truths, exaggerations, and falsehoods from both candidates. Fact check: GOP claims on noncitizen voting lack evidence Harris: 'Most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico' Fact check: True Harris correctly stated that most fentanyl in America comes from two Mexican cartels, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The DEA confirmed this, naming the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation Cartels as the primary sources of fentanyl entering the U.S., with most fentanyl seizures being at legal ports of entry. Harris: 'Last December I helped raise the rate of overtime pay for border agents' Fact check: True Harris accurately noted her support for increased overtime pay for border agents, as confirmed by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. The act devoted $125 million to address overtime pay for Customs and Border Protection agents. This funding aims to support agents as they manage increased workloads at the border. Fact-checking Kamala Harris’ border claims in new ad Harris: 'In the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system' Fact check: False Harris's claim that Trump 'did nothing' to address immigration during his presidency was found to be false. Trump implemented several measures, including the 'Remain in Mexico' policy and increased deportations, though these were often controversial. Harris: 'Donald Trump tanked [the border bill.] He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said stop the bill' Fact check: Misleading Harris has pointed to Trump as being responsible for blocking a key border security bill. However, this claim is misleading, as many proposed bills failed due to bipartisan disagreements rather than due to direct actions by Trump alone. DOJ accuses Alabama of clearing voter rolls too close to election Trump: 'He's allowed in my opinion...much more than 20 million people into our country' Fact check: False Trump's claim that the Biden administration has allowed 'much more than 20 million people' into the country is highly exaggerated, according to the House Committee on Homeland Security. The actual number of encounters at America's borders is expected to reach about 10 million by the end of the fiscal year, including repeat crossings and deportations. These encounters include repeat crossings and deportations, which means the actual number of unique individuals entering the country is much lower. Trump: 'That's the lowest point in the recorded history of the border' Fact check: Not entirely accurate Trump's assertion that illegal immigration reached its lowest point in history during his term is not entirely accurate. While there was a significant decline in crossings, FactCheck.org reports historical lows actually occurred in earlier decades, particularly in the early 2000s. In Pennsylvania, the Ukraine vote could prove pivotal Trump: 'We had the best numbers ever and we had them largely because of the wall' Fact check: Not entirely accurate The effectiveness of Trump's border wall construction is partially true. While it did lead to decreases in crossings in specific areas, Department of Homeland Security reports indicate it was just one aspect of a larger security strategy. Other measures, such as increased surveillance and policies like 'Remain in Mexico,' also played critical roles in reducing crossings. Trump: 'They're doing is protecting criminals which set loose illegal alien criminals rather than hand them over to ICE' Fact check: False Trump's characterization of sanctuary cities as places that protect criminals rather than handing them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is false, according to research from the American Immigration Council and Global Refugee. These cities often transfer individuals convicted of serious crimes to federal custody.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-trump-border-claims-factcheck/	2024-09-28T16:05:10-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/snapshot-5-1.jpg?w=900
Trump posts, then deletes, fake image of Kamala Harris with Diddy	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump reposted, then deleted, a fake image claiming to show a young Kamala Harris posing with Sean 'Diddy' Combs. It’s the latest of a handful of fake images that Trump has recently shared. The picture claiming to be Diddy, flanked by Harris and another woman, is actually a picture from 2001. And the man in the middle of the real image is talk show host Montel Williams, whom Harris dated at that time. The other woman is Ashley Williams, Montel Williams' daughter. The picture showed up online shortly after Diddy was indicted on a long list of charges, including racketeering, conspiracy, sex trafficking by force and transportation to engage in prostitution. AI deepfake videos threaten election integrity: Expert Trump posted the image Friday on his Truth Social site and wrote: 'Kamala, doing the Diddy?' the text read. 'Madam Vice President, have you ever been involved with or engaged in one of Puff Daddies freak offs?' Trump later deleted the post. Both candidates have crossed paths with Diddy. In 2020 on her X account, Harris thanked him for hosting a town hall about the impact of COVID-19 on Black communities. 'Thank you, @Diddy, for hosting this town hall last night,' the post read. 'There's a lot at stake for our communities right now, and it's critical we bring to the forefront how coronavirus is perpetuating racial inequality and health disparities.' Trump and Diddy have interacted many times over the years, including Trump attending Diddy’s 29th birthday party in 1998. AI-powered deepfake detection tool released by non-profit 'Donald Trump is a friend of mine, and he works very hard,' Diddy told the Washington Post in 2015. In 2012, Diddy appeared with Trump on an episode of 'The Celebrity Apprentice.' 'I love Diddy. You know he's a good friend of mine, he's a good guy,' Trump said. Trump’s recent history of sharing fake or AI-generated images on Truth Social includes two posts in August involving Taylor Swift. One showed women wearing 'Swifties for Trump' t-shirts. The other was a fabricated image of Swift that read 'Taylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump.' Trump also shared a fabricated image of Harris addressing what appeared to be a Soviet Union–era gathering, complete with hammer and sickle symbols.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-posts-deletes-fake-image-of-harris-with-diddy/	2024-09-28T15:51:29-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2172703783.jpg?w=900
Elon Musk embraces role as pro-Trump 'megaphone'	Elon Musk has gone from a tech entrepreneur largely avoidant of politics to what strategists call a 'megaphone' for right-wing views as an online surrogate for former President Trump in the White House race. The tech mogul began wading into the political landscape a few years ago, but the past few months have marked a significant increase in his partisan discourse, political experts said. His embrace of Republican politics and Trump can now be seen nearly daily on his social media platform X, which was known as Twitter until he bought it in 2022. DOJ accuses Alabama of clearing voter rolls too close to election Political strategists on both sides of the aisle contend Musk’s ramped up political activity – combined with his wealth and online visibility – could be an asset for Trump, whom he endorsed in July following the first assassination attempt on the former president. 'He probably does more to highlight the problems at the border than the entire corporate media complex just because of the size of his soapbox,' said one Republican strategist. The strategist compared Musk's shift into politics to Trump's, calling the Tesla and SpaceX CEO 'a quirky character that essentially pretty much everyone liked until he managed to buy Twitter and leaned in on some issues.' 'Donald Trump was immensely popular until he got involved in politics, and then half the country doesn’t like him,' the strategist said. A Wall Street Journal analysis of Musk’s posts on X this year found he had about 230 times as many exchanges a month that contain political terms in 2024 compared with 2019, while a Washington Post analysis said nearly 20 percent of his posts this year have been political. 'I would argue that anything that Musk says, you imagine, has been cosigned or even instigated by Donald Trump,' political strategist Basil Smikle told The Hill. Musk’s recent posts on X have ranged from reposting tweets criticizing Democrats — especially Vice President Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — to direct comments about Trump and the benefits of his re-election. Mark Robinson burns hand at event, returns to campaign Saturday Earlier this month, Musk claimed 'America will fall to tyranny' unless Trump is elected, garnering 83 million views. In another post following the second assassination attempt on Trump’s life, Musk wrote, 'The incitement to hatred and violence against President Trump by the media and leading Democrats needs to stop.' Musk's posts and actions mark a sharp contrast from nearly 10 years ago, when he told Vanity Fair in 2015 that he gets 'involved in politics as little as possible,' though his business ventures sometimes required him to get involved to 'some amount.' In that same interview, Musk said he hoped Trump would not get the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, saying 'that wouldn’t be good.' His amped-up political involvement has drawn scrutiny from the left, some of whom argue his sharing of misinformation or conspiracy theories could negatively impact Democrats’ prospects in November. 'It's totally putting a finger on the scale of our information ecosystem, with already such a tough landscape, and I think also a landscape that disadvantages Democrats from traditional media all the way to social media,' Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff said. Musk — the most followed user on X with nearly 199 million followers — drew criticism earlier this month when he reposted a since-deleted tweet about rumors of 'explosives' found in a car near a Trump rally, writing 'Wow,' on X. The post now has a community note clarifying New York officials denied the reports but still appears on Musk’s feed. In another post after the second attempt on Trump’s life, Musk came under fire for writing 'no one is even trying' to assassinate Harris in what he called a 'joke.' He later deleted the tweet amid backlash. 'Elon Musk is blatantly allowing misinformation to flow through that platform, that's just not. It's not good for democracy,' Democratic strategist Rodell Mollineau said. Five things to know about Social Security reforms being considered in Congress Musk is in a complex position as both the owner of a social media platform and a public, now partisan figure, strategists suggested. Since purchasing X in 2022, the tech mogul took a new approach to the platform's content policies, cutting back on several moderation features. The lack of moderation prompted various advertisers to flee the site and launch legal inquiries into company practices. The platform’s algorithm has since been accused of favoring Musk’s posts, drawing concerns from some strategists about his influence on voters. 'The voter may experience a different type of influence on his [Musk’s] part, in the sense that they may see his tweets, but what they’re unsure of is how much his leadership of X is influencing the algorithm so that the voter is seeing something different than they would have seen had he not moved in,' Smikle said. This 'helps Trump,' Smikle said, because 'it makes it feel to the viewer, to the consumer, that it is more organic than it probably is.' Another Trump ally agreed, stating Musk is 'extremely helpful' by simply using his X account to push attacks on Democrats that tend to get millions of views on the platform. Smikle went as far to say that he is 'getting a lot more antidemocratic content' on his feed since Musk’s takeover. 'I have seen a ton more anti Harris tweets by people of color and specifically African Americans, than I ever than I have seen any such, any such activity toward the Democrats or toward Biden,' he said, adding later, 'That’s where Trump gets help and Kamala gets hurt.' Todd Belt, the director of the political management program at the Graduate School of Political Management at the George Washington University, argued X’s algorithm puts Musk 'front and center,' but expressed doubt it could have any tangible effect on influencing voters. 'I don't know that it has a tremendous amount of effect, because it gets lost in all the noise of the campaign, right?' Belt told The Hill. 'It stimulates and activates the base,' he continued, 'but I don't think it's convincing people.' Wisconsin Supreme Court says Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name will remain on swing state’s ballot X nor the Trump campaign immediately responded to The Hill’s request for comment. As Musk aligned with Trump, the former president returned to posting on the platform in July. Trump's account was reinstated in 2023 after pre-Musk management banned him in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Musk restored Trump's account last year amid a slew of other content moderation changes, which drew praise from right-wing personalities and concerns from online misinformation groups. The X owner’s political reach has also stretched to the financial side. Musk has backed Save America PAC, a political group that has spent tens of millions of dollars on get out the vote efforts the Trump campaign is relying on to turn out low-propensity voters in swing states. Trump even suggested he would put Musk in his Cabinet before backtracking, saying the mogul would probably be too busy. The former president then said this month he would create a 'government efficiency commission' and tap Musk to lead the effort if he is reelected in November. Musk, who has long advocated for a smaller government, discussed the concept during a X Spaces conversation last month, suggesting such a panel could look at national debt and how Congress can reevaluate spending. It remains unclear exactly what this commission would do, and some Democrats have questioned whether it would be a serious effort.

ICE released over 435,000 migrants with criminal convictions, dat...	McALLEN, Texas (Border Report) -- The head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement told a Texas border lawmaker this week that 435,000 undocumented migrants with criminal convictions have been released by the agency to cities around the United States. Border Report Live: Where illegal immigration is trending up ICE Deputy Director Patrick Lechleitner sent a letter Wednesday to U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, saying as of July 21, there were 662,566 noncitizens with criminal histories on the agency's non-detained docket (NDD), meaning they are not detained while they await immigration proceedings. 'Of those, 435,719 are convicted criminals, and 226,847 have pending criminal charges,' Lechleitner wrote. The letter was sent after Gonzales in March asked the Department of Homeland Security for data on migrants with criminal backgrounds. Gonzales is a member of the GOP-led House Homeland Security Committee. 'The data released by ICE is beyond disturbing, and it should be a wake-up call for the Biden-Harris administration and cities across the country that hide behind sanctuary policies,' Gonzales said Friday. 'It’s time for Washington to move past rhetoric and toward results. Americans deserve to feel safe in their communities. On Friday, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, of Tennessee, called the new information 'shocking.' 'It may be shocking to hear that the Biden-Harris administration is actively releasing tens of thousands of criminal illegal aliens into our communities, but their own numbers conclusively prove this to be the case. This defies all common sense,' Green said in a statement. ‘Backdoor amnesty’: 14 GOP senators file bill to stop Biden’s immigrant parole program 'DHS law enforcement has been directed to mass-release illegal aliens whom they know have criminal convictions or are facing charges for serious crimes—and these dangerous, destructive individuals are making their way into every city and state in this country. How many more Americans need to die or be victimized before this administration is forced to abide by the laws they swore to uphold? This is madness. It is something no civilized, well-functioning society should tolerate,' Green said. According to Lechleitner, 62,231 noncitizens with criminal convictions for assault currently are not detained by ICE and have been released; 42,915 have pending assault charges. The agency currently is holding 2,348 noncitizens who have been convicted of assault and 1,498 who have pending charges. The agency also has released 15,811 who have been convicted of sexual assault, 56,533 noncitizens convicted of drug possession, and 2,521 who have been convicted on kidnapping, according to the letter. (ICE Graphic) Lechleitner blames some of the releases on law enforcement in 'sanctuary cities' not cooperating with ICE. 'Some jurisdictions have reduced their cooperation with ICE, to include refusal to honor ICE detainer requests, even for noncitizens who have been convicted of serious felonies and pose an ongoing threat to public safety. ICE recognizes that some jurisdictions are concerned that cooperating with federal immigration officials will erode trust with immigrant communities and make it harder for local law enforcement to serve those populations. However, 'sanctuary' policies can end up shielding dangerous criminals, who often victimize those same communities,' Lechleitner wrote. He also called the nation's immigration system 'broken' and said Congress needs to better fund DHS. Gonzales said that as an Appropriator, he vows to ensure ICE has the resources necessary to deport noncitizens with a criminal record 'This must be a priority,' he said. 'The Biden-Harris administration also plays a part in cleaning up the mess their failed policies have created. They have the ear of sanctuary city mayors — it’s time to encourage them to reverse course and put the safety of American citizens first.' Lechleitner said that under the Biden administration, DHS is removing and returning 'record numbers of migrants who are unable to establish a legal basis to remain in the United States and prioritizing for removal those who present national security and public safety risks and recent border crossers.' A Homeland Security official monitored media who were allowed on the tarmac before dawn on Tuesday, May 17, 2022, to watch an ICE Air expulsion flight with 132 migrants being deported from Harlingen, Texas, to Guatemala. (Sandra Sanchez/Border Report) Since May 2023 through July, DHS has removed or returned nearly 900,000 individuals, he says. He added that ICE is not allowed to release certain noncitizens from the agency's custody including those convicted of homicide. Other cases are determined 'on a case-by-case basis and take into account the individual case circumstances, primarily considering risk of flight, national security threat, and threat to public safety,' he wrote. ICE has the capacity to hold 41,500 noncitizens in Fiscal Year 2024, which is up from 34,000 in Fiscal Year 2023.

How climate change is intensifying storms like Hurricane Helene	(The Hill) — Climate change is making hurricanes like Hurricane Helene more intense, scientific research shows. Helene has unleashed high winds, heavy rain and a dangerous storm surge in the Southeast after making landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane Thursday night. As of Friday afternoon, the estimated death toll of the storm had climbed to more than 40 across four states. It follows roughly two and a half months after Hurricane Beryl — which peaked as a Category 5 storm — tracked destruction across the Caribbean as well as the United States, killing dozens of people. The proportion of hurricanes that fall into these more intense categories 4 and 5 are expected to increase as the planet heats up, according to the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a well-respected climate science authority from the United Nations. Peak hurricane wind speeds are also expected to rise. 'These hurricanes are getting bigger and stronger and that is due to simple energy transfer,' said Claudia Benitez-Nelson, a climate scientist at the University of South Carolina. Benitez-Nelson explained that a hotter planet means more energy can transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere. 'And what are hurricanes? They're big balls of energy and so that energy is now feeding into these tropical storms,' she said. That transferring effect is expected to continue and worsen as the planet heats up. Estimates of just how much it will do so can vary. But if the planet warms up by about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels, a hurricane’s maximum wind speeds could increase by about 5 percent, according to Tom Knutson, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab. Noting the increase in wind speeds, earlier this year scientists suggested adding a Category 6 to the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, saying that the currently used categories 1 through 5 are 'inadequate' as hurricanes continue to intensify. In addition to making hurricanes overall more intense, Benitez-Nelson noted that climate change is also causing hurricanes to intensify more quickly, potentially giving people less time to prepare. Hurricane Helene went from a Category 1 storm to a Category 4 in less than a day amid unusually warm ocean temperatures. Benitez-Nelson, who is a member of the climate education group Science Moms, said increased global temperatures lead to increased ocean temperatures that in turn lead to a 'more effective transfer of heat.' She added that this 'really helps to spin up a hurricane that moves from a tropical storm to a hurricane, and then makes these hurricanes even stronger and intensify more rapidly.' As well as fueling increased wind speeds, Knutson noted that climate change is also likely causing more rainfall to occur during hurricanes. 'With the warmer climate, the atmosphere is holding more water vapor systematically, and that's leading the storms to become basically bigger, more intense rain producers,' Knutson said. 'The air is holding more moisture than previously, so that causes some increase in the rainfall rates.' He added that modeling shows that every additional degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in the regional sea surface temperatures where the hurricane is leads to an average of 7 percent more rainfall. The Earth’s surface has already warmed by an average of about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) when compared to preindustrial levels, but the actual level of warming can vary across regions and between lands and oceans. Benitez-Nelson added that as hurricanes become stronger they also don’t dissipate as quickly and can move further inland, including to places that are not used to dealing with them. 'Hot air can hold more water,' she said. 'And it's dumping massive amounts of water in places that simply are ill prepared to handle that amount of rainfall.' She pointed to impacts from Hurricane Beryl’s remnants that made their way to Vermont earlier this year. 'That's ridiculous ... but that is our future,' she said. And beyond climate change’s own impacts on hurricanes, these storms can combine with other climate impacts like sea level rise to bring about more damage. 'Our ocean has been rising, and so, of course it has an impact when a hurricane comes along because now the height of your water is already higher and then you've got the storm surge on top of that,' said Jennifer Collins, a professor at the University of South Florida School of Geosciences. Collins expressed concern that going forward, this will cause significant harm, as people tend to pay more attention to a hurricane’s wind speed than its flood potential. 'We've seen other storms in the past that have had significant flooding from one of these weaker storms,' Collins said. 'I am very concerned about those type of storms, honestly, because people made their evacuation decisions sometimes purely based on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.' Climate change is caused by human activity releasing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which get trapped in the atmosphere and create a greenhouse effect that warms the planet. The burning of fossil fuels is the main driver of climate change, though other parts of the economy like agriculture and landfills are also major contributors. Benitez-Nelson said that to prevent climate-related harm going forward, 'the biggest thing that we can do is reduce emissions.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/how-climate-change-is-intensifying-storms-like-hurricane-helene/	2024-09-28T07:05:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2175042103-1-e1727483301635.jpg?w=800
Social Security COLA raise: How much will recipients get in 2025?	(NEXSTAR) – The Social Security Administration is less than two weeks away from announcing its cost of living adjustment (COLA), the percent increase in recipients' payments designed to offset inflation. According to the latest estimates, the COLA forecast is expected to be about 2.5%, but we'll have to wait for the Oct. 10 announcement to know for sure. The estimate comes from The Senior Citizens League (TSCL) and is based on a decline in consumer price inflation from 2.9% in July to 2.5% in August. 'Ensuring that seniors have enough to feed and house themselves with dignity is a major reason why we advocate for a minimum COLA of 3%,' Shannon Benton, TSCL's executive director, said in a news release. 'TSCL research shows that approximately two-thirds of seniors rely on Social Security for more than half of their monthly income, and 28% depend on it entirely.' Free COVID tests will be available again soon: How to get yours The projected COLA increase is less than it was in 2024, when beneficiaries received a 3.2% bump. The Social Security Administration calculates the COLA using average inflation data from the Consumer Price Index during July, August and September. While there's never been a negative adjustment, the COLA has been as low as 0% in 2010, 2011 and 2016. The largest COLA of the last two decades was 8.7% as the U.S. experienced soaring inflation in 2023. The greatest ever was in 1980 at 14%, SSA tables show. TSCL says its research shows that a combination of soaring health care costs and inadequate COLAs have decimated the buying power of these income bumps by 'over thirty percent.' The rising cost of Medicare, for instance, isn't covered in the COLA calculations, and some politicians are proposing a change. 'A monthly Social Security check is how most seniors make ends meet, we need it to pay our bills and pay for health co-pays and medications,' said U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), who introduced the Boosting Benefits and COLAs for Seniors Act in March. The bill was introduced and referred to the Committee on Finance, but has yet to see a vote in Congress.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/social-security-cola-raise-how-much-will-recipients-get-in-2025/	2024-09-28T07:00:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-1310131960-6.jpg?w=724
Helene causes Tennessee dam collapse, severe flood risk remains	(NewsNation) — The worst of Helene’s storm is behind, but catastrophic flooding as it moves east toward Kentucky and Tennessee is highly possible. A major dam in northeast Tennessee collapsed around 7:11 a.m. ET, according to an alert from the National Water Prediction Service at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Early Saturday morning, the National Weather Service warned of an 'imminent breach' of the Nolichucky Dam on the Nolichucky River, urging immediate evacuation. The area is about 70 miles northeast of the tourist town of Pigeon Forge. A flash flood warning is in effect until noon ET. 'Move to higher ground now! This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation,' the flash flood warning said. 'Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.' ⚠️ Flash Flood Warning for Imminent Breach of Nolichucky Dam Continues****Here is a detailed map of the impacted areas. The area in light red is the Flash Flood Emergency. ****https://t.co/hrzko3VCES https://t.co/UAJlLDc8mD&mdash; NWS Morristown (@NWSMorristown) September 28, 2024 At least 44 people died in five states from storm-related causes following Helene’s landfall Thursday night. The Category 4 hurricane reached wind speeds up to 140 mph. Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia experienced heavy rainfall and severe flooding on Friday, and each governor declared a state of emergency to receive federal assistance. Multiple deaths have been attributed to drowning, while some were the result of downed trees. State officials say dozens more are still trapped inside their homes, The Associated Press reports at least two died from a suspected tornado in Georgia. Keaton Beach, Florida, ‘unrecognizable’ in Helene’s wake: Resident As Helene continues to move eastward, the amount of rainfall will decrease. 'Most of the rainfall across the central and southern Appalachians has come to an end, although a few lingering showers are possible through Saturday,' the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. Several flood warnings remain in effect across the southeast. Some of the worst destruction occurred in the storm’s center in Florida’s Big Bend region and South Georgia. But inland cities like Atlanta and Asheville were not shielded from the storm’s impact. Within 48 hours, Atlanta received a record 11.62 inches of rain, according to the National Hurricane Center’s Weather Prediction Center data. Asheville received 13.15 inches of rain. Tornadoes also hit some areas, including one in Nash County, North Carolina, critically injuring four people, according to the AP. How to donate and assist Helene victims and survivors Around 3.8 million people are without electricity on Saturday; the majority of which are in South Carolina, with just over 1 million. Florida’s emergency services worked speedily, lowering the number of outages to 480,000. The entire community in Taylor County, Florida, still does not have power. Andrew Morgan, the county’s emergency management public information officer, said crews have worked tirelessly to clear 90% of all major roads, and once the roads are clear, they can begin fixing power lines. 'We’re going to continue to just move forward and clear out the debris and keep searching and we’ll get back to where we were before this,' Morgan said. Moody’s Analytics, a company that analyzes economic research, estimates up to $26 billion in property damage caused by Helene. Hurricane Helene rescues stretch resources Valdosta, Georgia, was directly hit. A 135-year-old shopping mall, which housed over 50 businesses, was torn apart brick by brick. The owner told NewsNation that rebuilding is not an option. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp will tour the damage in Valdosta sometime Saturday. 'The winds were really, really strong and picked up a lot of trees … motorcycles, cars were moving around,' said Valdosta resident Vonquez Garland. 'Houses were shaking. It’s a lot of oak trees completely out of the ground.' 'When I woke up, there was stuff everywhere.

Mark Robinson hospitalized: Sources	Two sources tell NewsNation's Libbey Dean that embattled North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson was rushed to a hospital Friday night. One source says that Robinson quickly left a campaign event in Mt. Airy, N.C., and remains in the hospital tonight. Robinson has been under intense pressure to quit his campaign for governor, and even to resign his current post, since CNN found old social media posts in which Robinson referred to himself as a ‘black NAZI;' said he enjoyed transgender pornography; said in 2012 he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama; and slammed the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as 'worse than a maggot.' Mark Robinson threatens CNN for bombshell report Brian LiVecchi, Robinson's chief of staff and general counsel, will resign effective next Tuesday, according to a friend. Over the weekend, Robinson announced that four key staff members on his gubernatorial campaign staff had left their jobs. Robinson denied writing the messages that CNN says were from more than a decade ago. He said Tuesday his campaign has hired a law firm to help investigate how what Robinson calls 'false smears' originated. But that hasn't stopped top Republicans from distancing themselves from Robinson. Former NBA star says Eric Adams ghosted him on Turkey’s orders Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump endorsed Robinson before the March primary and has let Robinson speak at the former president’s in-state rallies. But he was not involved in Trump rallies on Wednesday in suburban Charlotte and last weekend in Wilmington. This is a developing story. Check back for update.

50+ people awaiting rescue on roof of Tennessee hospital	UNICOI COUNTY, Tenn. (WJHL) — More than 50 people were sent to the roof of a Tennessee hospital on Friday and were awaiting rescue as flooding cut the hospital off from land, according to Ballad Health. Ballad, a hospital chain headquartered in Tennessee, said at 10:45 a.m. that the Unicoi County Hospital had closed and suspended operations due to the threat of flooding. Unicoi County Emergency Management Agency told hospital leadership that the hospital needed to be evacuated due to the 'unusually high and rising water from the Nolichucky River.' There were 11 patients at the hospital that Ballad planned to transfer. However, ambulances sent to evacuate the patients could not safely get to them due to the rising water. 'The hospital has been engulfed by extremely dangerous and rapidly moving water,' Ballad said in a news release. The water started coming into the building and was moving so quickly, rescue boats weren't able to safely navigate the area. Ballad confirmed that as of 12:27 p.m., 54 people had been relocated to the hospital's roof. 'Due to high winds, no helicopters could safely fly in an effort to help evacuate the hospital,' the company said. By 2:50 p.m., conditions had improved and rescues by helicopter got underway. Nexstar's WJHL made attempts to get close to the hospital, but roads in the area are impassable. WJHL's Drone 11 was able to capture video of the people stranded on the roof. The drone footage also shows the extent of the flooding in the area. WATCH: Drifting boat ripped below bridge as Roan Mountain floods Photo: Carolina Avenue in Unicoi County.

Satellite video shows 'potentially historic' Helene from space	(NEXSTAR) – The view on land in Florida Thursday afternoon was overcast and stormy, but incoming Hurricane Helene looked even more ominous from space. The storm was upgraded to a Category 3 as it barreled toward the Florida coast. It could be seen churning over the Gulf of Mexico and picking up steam in satellite videos taken by NOAA. The bands of clouds stretching out from the hurricane's eye are so vast, they obscure almost the entire Southeastern United States when seen from space. Helene weakens to tropical storm, at least 4 dead This satellite image provided by NOAA shows Hurricane Helene advancing across the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida on Thursday, Sept. 26, 2024. (NOAA via AP) Helene was expected to make landfall Thursday evening along Florida's northwest coast. The National Weather Service office in Tallahassee forecast storm surges of up to 20 feet and warned they could be particularly 'catastrophic and unsurvivable' in Apalachee Bay. It added that high winds and heavy rains also posed risks. 'You cannot survive 20 feet or even 15 feet of storm surge,' said Jeff Berardelli, chief meteorologist at NewsNation affiliate WFLA. 'If you’re near the water and you know you’re going to flood, especially if you’re in a mobile home, too. You’ve got to go. You cannot take your chances. This is not survivable.' The dangerous impacts of Helene could extend far beyond Florida. While the hurricane will likely weaken as it moves inland, damaging winds and heavy rain were expected to extend to the southern Appalachian Mountains, where landslides were possible, forecasters said. For Atlanta, Helene could be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd. Close Thank you for signing up!

Cleanup begins as Helene moves inland with flooding, power outage...	(NewsNation) — After making landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, Helene is continuing to track inland as a weakened tropical storm, bringing flooding and leaving millions without power in the southeast. There have been four reported fatalities from the storm so far after catastrophic flooding and storm surgery that left destruction in their wake. A person died from a falling sign on a Tampa roadway during the storm, according to Gov. Ron DeSantis, and two others died in a possible tornado in south Georgia as the storm approached, according to the Associated Press.

Trump rally moved over Secret Service staffing concerns	Former President Trump moved the venue for his Saturday campaign rally in Wisconsin amid concerns over Secret Service staffing, a senior official briefed on the planning confirmed to The Hill. Trump was reportedly expected to hold his campaign event at an outside airport, according to NBC and CBS News, which first reported details of the switch. The senior official confirmed that his event was moved to a smaller venue given a shortage of Secret Service staff – an event that also coincided with the United Nationals General Assembly. 'The agency was never configured to provide such an elevated level of protection for an increasing number of protectees. Our personnel and equipment are being pushed to their limits to sustain the current operational tempo,' the senior official said. How to watch the Vance-Walz vice presidential debate 'This proposed Wisconsin event also took place during the United Nations General Assembly, where the Secret Service is responsible for the safety and security of over 140 world leaders amid a challenged global threat level,' the senior official noted. The senior official also noted that acting U.S. Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe has been advocating for a 'paradigm shift.' 'This paradigm shift would also position the agency to enhance its operational readiness to reduce reliance on external partners when providing heightened protection,' the official said. An advisory on the Trump campaign website notes the event is scheduled to take place at the Prairie du Chien Area Arts Center. U.S. Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi noted that the agency could not offer specifics on resources allocated for the event.

NYC Mayor Eric Adams to appear in federal court Friday	(NewsNation) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams will go before a New York federal judge Friday on charges alleging he accepted bribes and illegal foreign campaign contributions. Friday’s arraignment at noon ET will mark Adams’ first court appearance on federal conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery allegations. The court procedure typically involves a formal reading of the charges, often followed by an initial plea. It’s not uncommon for criminal defendants to plead not guilty at that time. It’s unclear whether Adams will turn himself in or if authorities will take the mayor into federal custody. Adams said Thursday he has no plans to resign. NewsNation will cover Friday’s court appearance and publish updates as they become available. Mayor Eric Adams corruption investigation, indictment: Timeline What is Eric Adams accused of? The accusations against Adams are outlined in a 57-page grand jury indictment that a judge unsealed Thursday. The indictment comes on the heels of a widespread ongoing investigation into the mayor’s administration and the resignation of several top city officials. Adams — who oversees public operations in the nation’s largest city — is accused of accepting bribes from foreign nationals and taking illegal campaign contributions in exchange for favors. Authorities said this included helping Turkish officials secure fire-safety approvals for a 36-story Turkish consulate building even though it didn’t pass inspection. The allegations of long-running corruption date back nearly a decade, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said at a Thursday news conference announcing the indictment. They include alleged straw donor contributions and abuse of a city program that promised to provide up to $8 in matching funds for each $1 of up to $250 in donations from New York City residents. That amounts to nearly $13,000 in matching funds during the 2021 election cycle, according to charging documents. Harris to visit southern border for first time in 3 years What's next for Eric Adams, New Yorkers? Adams addressed the charges at a news conference Thursday when he told New Yorkers to 'wait to hear our defense before making any judgments.' Several top city officials have announced their resignation from the Adams administration in recent weeks. It’s unclear if or how those resignations may be connected to the mayor’s criminal case. 'The conduct alleged in the indictment, the foreign money, the corporate money, the bribery, the years of concealment, is a grave breach of the public’s trust,' Williams said Thursday. 'We continue to dig, and we will hold more people accountable.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/eric-adams-new-york-city-charges-court/	2024-09-27T06:26:45-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/66005dbace75c0.94178341.jpeg?w=900
Harris to visit southern border for first time in 3 years	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris will visit the U.S.-Mexico border for the first time in three years Friday, and the first time since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, in hopes of addressing one of the biggest topics on voters’ minds. Harris will deliver a speech on immigration policy in Douglas, Arizona, a mostly Democratic border town with 16,000 residents. Harris and the Biden administration have faced criticism for their handling of border security and immigration. Former President Donald Trump has faulted her for spending little time at the border during her vice presidency. The last time she was publicly known to have been at the border was in 2021 when she toured a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing center in El Paso, Texas.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) 'The American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games,' Harris plans to say in the speech, according to an excerpt of her remarks previewed by her campaign, the Associated Press reported. Douglas is an overwhelmingly Democratic border town in GOP-dominated Cochise County, where the Republicans on the board of supervisors are facing criminal charges for refusing to certify the 2022 election results. Trump was in the area last month, using a remote stretch of border wall and a pile of steel beams to draw a contrast between himself and Harris on border security. Harris struggles to break through with young Latinos On Thursday, Trump gave a speech in New York giving his opinion on Harris’ visit that hadn’t happened yet: 'Anything she says tomorrow, you know is a fraud because she was the worst in history at protecting our country. So, she’ll try and make herself look a little bit better. But it’s not possible.' Election day is less than six weeks away, and Arizona is a key battleground state with the potential to swing the election for either Harris or Trump.

Floridians who didn't evacuate hurricane should write info on leg...	(The Hill) — The Taylor County Sheriff's Office asked residents who did not evacuate to write contact information on their arms or legs for identification purposes to help with rescue and recovery efforts, following Hurricane Helene's landfall Thursday night. 'If you or someone you know chose not to evacuate, PLEASE write your, Name, birthday and important information on your arm or leg in A PERMANENT MARKER so that you can be identified and family notified,' the sheriff's office wrote in a post on Facebook. Hurricane Helene heads inland after landfall Officials requested that people provide information about whether their residence is inland or on the coast, their full address, and the names of individuals and animals so that search and rescue teams can prioritize certain locations. Although mandatory evacuations were ordered for the area, NBC reported that Sheriff Wayne Padgett said he estimated up to half of the population was staying. Damage is predicted to compare to the Asheville floods of 1916, which killed at least 80 people and caused millions of dollars in damage, and to exceed other extreme weather events in the region such as Tropical Storm Fred in 2021, the weather service said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/florida-sheriff-write-contact-info-on-leg/	2024-09-27T00:18:31-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24269442220437-e1727277251473.jpg?w=900
Journalist booted from X after publishing hacked Vance document	Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein was suspended Thursday from the social platform X after sharing materials about Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) that were allegedly obtained in an Iranian hack on former President Trump’s campaign. Klippenstein published the 271-page report compiled by the Trump campaign to vet Vance, now the Republican nominee’s running mate, on his Substack. Rudy Giuliani disbarred in DC over 2020 election subversion efforts An X spokesperson said in a statement that the journalist’s account was suspended for posting 'unredacted private personal information' about Vance. 'Ken Klippenstein was temporarily suspended for violating our rules on posting unredacted private personal information, specifically Sen. Vance’s physical addresses and the majority of his Social Security number,' the spokesperson said. The Trump campaign revealed last month that it had been hacked and internal documents had been leaked. The FBI later confirmed that Iran was behind the breach and that the country had attempted to disrupt both presidential campaigns. The documents were shared with various media outlets, but they opted not to publish the stolen materials. Vance, Walz face potential game-changing moment with VP debate Iran also attempted to share the materials with the Biden campaign, the FBI revealed last week. However, the Harris campaign said its staffers ignored what appeared to be phishing emails sent by Iran to their personal emails. Klippenstein explained his decision to publish the stolen materials on his Substack, arguing that 'it’s of keen public interest in an election season.' '[S]ince June, the news media has been sitting on it (and other documents), declining to publish in fear of finding itself at odds with the government’s campaign against ‘foreign malign influence,’' he wrote. 'I’m just not a believer of the news media as an arm of the government, doing its work combatting foreign influence,' he later added. 'Nor should it be a gatekeeper of what the public should know.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ken-klippenstein-jd-vance-x-document-hack/	2024-09-26T16:01:55-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24267776749023-e1727288498319.jpg?w=900
Trump says he's meeting with Zelensky on Friday	Former President Trump said Thursday he would be meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a move that came after the former president had earlier reportedly rejected a meeting with the Ukrainian president. 'As you know, President Zelensky has asked to meet with me, and I will be meeting with him tomorrow morning at around 9:45 in Trump Tower,' Trump said during a press conference in New York. 'And it's a shame what's happening in Ukraine, so many deaths, so much destruction. It's a horrible thing.' NBC News reported Wednesday that Trump had decided not to meet with Zelensky. The former president criticized the Ukrainian president, saying while in North Carolina on Wednesday, 'He’s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me,' according to the news outlet. Zelensky rankled Republicans after he called Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) 'too radical' during an interview with The New Yorker that was released earlier this week. Zelensky’s decision to join Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) during an ammunition factory tour was also interpreted by some members of the GOP as campaigning for Democrats. Trump’s announcement was made the same day that Zelensky visited the White House. The Hill has reached out to the Ukrainian Embassy for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/trump-says-hes-meeting-with-zelensky-on-friday/	2024-09-26T15:53:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/zelenskyvolodymyr_071024jg05_w.jpg?w=900
Half of all homes for sale have sat for 60-plus days: Redfin	(NewsNation) — Mortgage rates have come down in recent months, but according to a new report, 'extra stale' listings have continued to rise with more homes sitting on the market for longer. Last month, nearly half (48%) of all homes for sale had been on the market for at least 60 days, a Redfin analysis found. That's up from 43% a year ago and the highest share for August since 2019. 'We usually see home sales pick up when mortgage rates fall but this year we are seeing the opposite — sales are dropping and homes are sitting longer on the market,' Redfin Senior Economist Sheharyar Bokhari said in a statement. Hurricane Helene now a Category 3 as it moves toward Florida It's a sign buyers are starting to regain some bargaining power as housing inventory improves and interest rates come down. Nationally, the typical home was listed for 37 days before going under contract in August — six more than a year earlier. But in some markets, homes are sitting much longer. Florida has four of the top five metros with the slowest sales. Homes in West Palm Beach, Florida, took the longest to sell, spending a median 79 days on the market before finding a buyer. Fort Lauderdale (75 days), Jacksonville (65 days) and Miami (65 days) weren't far behind. Florida is home to the fastest-cooling housing markets in the US The recent cooldown in the Sunshine State is due to several factors. A surge in new construction has helped boost inventory and ease competition, alleviating supply pressures after Florida became a popular pandemic destination. Demand has also taken a hit amid severe weather concerns, rising insurance costs and climbing HOA fees. Meanwhile, homes continue to fly off the market in Seattle (12 days), Indianapolis (16 days) and Warren, Michigan (17 days). San Jose (18 days) and Oakland, California (20 days) rounded out the top five major metros with the fastest sales. Buyers have dealt with a competitive housing market for several years, and that's changed how they view homes that have been sitting for a while, Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather noted. Should you refinance your mortgage? Here’s what to consider 'Now if a home is still on the market after a few weeks, buyers assume there's something wrong with it,' she said. 'That's why it's so important to price your home to move quickly.' Last month, the typical home spent roughly the same amount of time on the market as in August 2019, an indication the uptick in 'extra stale' listings is more of a return to normal than a sign of turmoil. If the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates further, as it's expected to, mortgage rates may continue to fall — potentially drawing more buyers off the sidelines.

NYC Mayor Eric Adams indicted but says he won't resign	(NewsNation) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Thursday morning said he won't resign despite being indicted on on federal charges that he secured bribes from foreign nationals and took illegal campaign contributions in exchange for favors. Authorities said this included helping Turkish officials get fire safety approvals for a 36-story Turkish consulate building despite it not passing inspection. The 'long-running' corruption goes back nearly a decade, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said at a Thursday news conference. The investigation into Adams is continuing, Williams said. 'The conduct alleged in the indictment, the foreign money, the corporate money, the bribery, the years of concealment, is a grave breach of the public’s trust,' Williams said. 'We continue to dig and we will hold more people accountable.' Adams maintained his innocence, both in a statement to NewsNation and at a Thursday news conference of his own where he said he's not stepping down. 'I always knew that If I stood my ground for New Yorkers, that I would be a target—and a target I became,' the statement said. Mayor Eric Adams corruption investigation, indictment: Timeline To reporters, Adams said his 'day-to-day will not change.' 'From here, my attorneys will take care of the case so I can take care of the city,' Adams said. 'I ask New York to just wait to hear our defense before making any judgments.' Attorney Alex Spiro, who is representing Adams, said that the federal authorities were trying to 'tell a story' despite the mayor not doing anything 'illegal or wrong.' He argued that a free flight referenced by prosecutors happened years before Adams assumed his positions as mayor, and that the upgrades they alluded to were on airlines with open seats. 'We're going to see everybody in court, hopefully tomorrow. If not Monday,' Spiro said. A retired police captain who was elected as New York City’s 110th mayor nearly three years ago, Adams is now the first sitting New York City mayor to face criminal charges. Eric Adams indicted News of Adams' indictment comes weeks after the FBI raided the homes of multiple top Adams aides, City Hall sources confirmed to NewsNation local affiliate WPIX. Federal investigators had seized Adams’ electronic devices nearly a year ago as part of an investigation focused, at least partly, on campaign contributions and Adams’ interactions with the Turkish government. Prosecutors said Adams did not disclose free and discounted travel to places including France, China, Turkey, Sri Lanka, India and Hungary and created a paper trail to suggest he had paid it. One staffer was directed by Adams to make sure his activities in Turkey from 2021 were not made public, according to prosecutors. A senior official from Turkey's diplomatic establishment facilitated straw donations to Adams. 'The mayor had a duty to disclose these gifts on his annual public disclosure forms so that the public could see who was giving him what,' Williams said. 'But as we allege year after year after year, he kept the public in the dark.' In addition, Adams 'compounded his gains' from illegal contributions he allegedly obtained by gaming the city’s matching funds program, authorities said in the indictment. Through false certifications, Adams' campaign got more than $10 million in matching public funds, the indictment said. NYC investigations: Who’s resigned from Eric Adams’ administration? Recent resignations Several top city officials have announced their resignation from the Adams administration in recent weeks. So far, federal prosecutors have declined to comment on the investigations or provide details about their scope. Recent resignations include New York City Schools Chancellor David Banks, head of the largest school system in the U.S. He submitted his resignation Tuesday, effective at the end of the calendar year. Banks’ decision to step down came after federal agents seized his phone and other devices earlier this month, The Associated Press reported. New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan additionally announced he would resign early next year. Vasan was appointed in December 2021 while the omicron variant of COVID-19 was in full swing and was soon after confronted with the city’s first case of polio in a decade. He’s the third high-ranking city official to announce a resignation this month. Unnamed sources reportedly told NBC New York that Vasan’s announcement is unrelated to the investigation involving several other city officials. Former New York City Police Department Commissioner Edward Caban and chief legal counsel Liza Zornberg also announced their resignations in recent weeks. Caban, the city’s former police commissioner, resigned in early September — one week after investigators seized his phone. Federal officials seized phones from Caban and two New York police lieutenants who worked in the commissioner’s office and on his detail, sources told NewsNation local affiliate WPIX. Officials also took devices from the home of Caban’s twin brother, James Caban — a former police officer who now runs a nightlife consulting business, according to the AP. Zornberg is a former federal prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s office who led some of the investigative efforts into the Adams administration and also resigned abruptly around that time. Officials did not seize her phone, the AP reported. The Associated Press and NewsNation partner The Hill contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/eric-adams-indicted-wont-resign/	2024-09-26T10:44:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24270549143810.jpg?w=900
Vance, Walz face potential game-changing moment with VP debate	Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) are set to take to the debate stage next week at a critical moment in the presidential race, with more than a month to go before Election Day and polls showing a razor-tight race. Both men face pressure to perform well, with Vance looking to make up lost ground after former President Trump’s rocky debate against Vice President Harris earlier this month and as he faces growing scrutiny over his controversial remarks. Meanwhile, Walz likely will be pressed over his and Harris’s liberal track records at a time when her campaign is tacking to the center. While most observers note vice presidential debates haven’t moved the needle much in the past, they say this year could be different. Polls show a highly competitive race between Harris and Trump in the final stretch, and any big misstep or knockout blow by one of the vice presidential contenders could change the game. 'All the needle needs to be moved is 0.1 percent in either direction, and that could be the difference in four or five states,' said Democratic strategist Steven Maviglio. Vance and Walz will make their pitches to voters Tuesday night from the CBS News stage in New York City as Harris boasts a 4-point edge over Trump, according to the latest national averages from Decision Desk HQ and The Hill. Recent polls have also put her up by narrow margins in key swing states. The vice president was widely seen as the winner of her debate with Trump earlier this month, although her slight lead nationally grew by just a fraction of a percentage point across some two dozen polls afterward, underscoring the tight contest and candidates’ uphill climb to tip the scales. 'Usually, when you have a vice presidential debate, the public views it sort of as an undercard — a secondary event,' said GOP strategist Ford O’Connell. 'But in this case, both campaigns are fighting for inches on the electoral map. I think that's what makes this vice presidential debate different from many of the others that we've seen in the past.' 'It's so close that you don’t know, at the end of the day, what will make the difference and push one of the tickets over the other,' O’Connell said. Trump and Harris are well-known political entities, but their running mates are relatively new to the national stage. Vance, 40, is a Marine veteran and Yale Law School graduate who was catapulted into the national conversation with the success of his memoir, 'Hillbilly Elegy.' He worked as a venture capitalist before lodging a bid for the Senate. Walz, 60, is a former high school teacher and football coach who served in the National Guard before stepping into politics. He gained traction in the veepstakes talks earlier this year after going viral for his folksy branding of the Trump-Vance ticket as 'weird.' Both have touted their middle-class, Midwestern upbringings as they’ve entered the national spotlight. But when they face off on the debate stage next week — which they’re notably set to do standing up, a rare break from seated vice presidential debates — they’re likely to underscore their contrasts as they look to define themselves. Walz has faced fire from the right over his progressive record as Minnesota governor, and he may have to parry critiques against the Biden-Harris administration. He’s also been criticized for how he’s represented his military service and his family’s struggle with infertility. But he’s heading into the showdown with better favorability than his GOP rival. Polling from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research suggests Vance has become more unpopular as voters get to know him, while Walz has gained popularity. The Ohio senator has faced sharp criticism for amplifying a false claim about Haitian migrants eating pets in a small Ohio town and for comments that the country was being run by 'childless cat ladies.' Vance is going in with 'a lot of baggage' and 'personally has a stake in reviving' his profile on the debate stage, said Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of public communication at American University. He’ll also want to 'do better than Trump did' against Harris, said Aaron Kall, the director of debate at the University of Michigan and editor of a book about Trump’s past debates. 'The vice presidential debate won't really move the gauge of the election, but they can stop the bleeding,' Kall said. 'A solid performance by Vance can really help the campaign [following] ... a little bit of a setback after the presidential debate.' Some experts are skeptical Tuesday night’s showdown, which is set to be moderated by 'CBS Evening News' anchor Norah O’Donnell and 'Face the Nation' moderator Margaret Brennan, could really change the game. Vice presidential debates have rarely made major waves, and vice presidents often stand in the shadows even once they get into office. Still, in an already unprecedented election cycle, even more doubtful observers were open to the chance that a major gaffe or strong viral moment could roil the race. 'Every public appearance, especially one with such a massive, outsized audience, matters,' said Democratic strategist Jon Reinish. More than 67 million people tuned in to watch Harris and Trump debate, 15 million more than who viewed Trump and Biden. Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said on MSNBC this week this could be 'the most important vice presidential debate' in U.S. history. It could also be the last White House debate of the cycle. Harris was quick to call for a second presidential debate, but Trump said earlier this month he wouldn’t do another. Both camps are expected to spend the coming days prepping. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is serving as a stand-in for Vance in his personal capacity, according to a source familiar. On the Trump side, Vance has turned to another Minnesotan, Rep. Tom Emmer (R), to stand in for the North Star State governor. 'This could be a final opportunity for the vice-presidential candidates to make the closing arguments for their campaigns in front of a very large audience that is even closer to the starting of early voting in several of the battleground states … and closer to Election Day, which is just around the corner,' Kall said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/vance-walz-face-potential-game-changing-moment-with-vp-debate/	2024-09-26T08:31:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/JD-Vance-Tim-Walz-09.20.png?w=900

Florida man convicted of sex trafficking multiple women, girls	(NewsNation) — A federal jury this week convicted a Florida man of sex trafficking nearly a dozen girls and women, whom prosecutors say he threatened, abused and required to have sex with other men and himself. Shannima Yuantrell Session faces a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life in prison on 13 charges for sex trafficking. The 47-year-old from Lake Placid, Florida, is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 19. The convictions stem from allegations that Session made women engage in commercial sex acts between July 2011 and July 2013, and then from February 2016 to February 2019, according to a Justice Department news release. Suge Knight claims Diddy participated in abuse, assault with higher-ups Prosecutors said Session offered empty promises of legitimate work and housing assistance to people who were struggling with unstable living conditions. At times, he prevented them from eating if they didn’t obey his demands. He also often required them to engage in sex acts with him after making them perform commercial sex acts with as many as 18 men. Prosecutors additionally presented evidence at trial alleging Session beat and choked the women, held their heads underwater in a nearby lake and threatened to drown them, and used a firearm to threaten and control the women. 'The defendant used despicable and horrific means to terrify and coerce nearly a dozen women and girls to engage in commercial sex,' said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

House panel investigating Trump assassination attempts is holding...	WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan congressional task force investigating the assassination attempts against Donald Trump is set to hold its first hearing Thursday as lawmakers rush to ensure candidate safety just weeks before the U.S. presidential election. The panel — comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats — has spent the last two months trying to decipher the security failures that allowed a gunman to scale a roof and open fire at the former president during a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania, killing a spectator. Now they are also investigating this month's Secret Service arrest of a man with a rifle on Trump's Florida golf course who also allegedly sought to assassinate the GOP presidential nominee. The suspect in the second assassination attempt, Ryan Wesley Routh, was allegedly aiming a rifle through the shrubbery surrounding Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course when he was detected by a Secret Service agent. The agent opened fire and Routh fled before being apprehended by local authorities. Rep. Jason Crow, the top Democrat on the task force, said the group is now shifting to 'a longer term, holistic look at both Butler and Florida.' The hearing Thursday will be the first time the task force will present its findings to the public after spending weeks conducting nearly two dozen interviews with law enforcement and receiving more than 2,800 pages of documents from the Secret Service. It will focus on the use of local law enforcement by the Secret Service, featuring testimony from Pennsylvania state and Butler County police officials. The Secret Service often relies on local authorities to secure bigger events where protectees like Trump appear around the country. But after the Butler rally, the Secret Service was heavily criticized for failing to clearly communicate what they needed from those local agencies that day. Thursday's session will be the fourth congressional hearing about the Butler shooting since July. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned one day after she appeared before a congressional hearing where she was berated for hours by both Democrats and Republicans for the agency's security failures. Cheatle called the attempt on Trump’s life the Secret Service’s 'most significant operational failure' in decades, but she angered lawmakers by failing to answer specific questions about the investigation. An interim report Wednesday from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is also conducting an investigation, said the Secret Service failed to give clear instructions on how state and local officials should cover the building where the gunman eventually took up position. Their report also said the agency didn’t make sure they could share information with local partners in real-time. The Secret Service has also released a five-page document summarizing the key conclusions of a yet-to-be-finalized agency report on what went wrong in Butler. The House panel is expected to propose a series of legislative reforms and issue their own final report before Dec. 13. While the oversight investigations have been bipartisan, Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on whether to give the Secret Service more money in the wake of its failures. A government funding bill that passed Wednesday includes an additional $231 million for the agency, even though many Republicans were skeptical and said an internal overhaul of the Secret Service is needed. As lawmakers prepare to probe the second attempt in Florida, they are also grappling with the major differences between the two assassination attempts. 'It’s going to be different in a lot of respects. I mean, the size of the event was very different. The use of local law enforcement was very different. The challenges were different,' Crow said. 'Whereas in Butler, there are very obvious series of cascading failures.' The Colorado lawmaker said the Justice Department and FBI have also informed Congress that given the ongoing criminal investigation into what happened in Florida and the prosecution of Routh, it will be more challenging for them to turn over documents or provide witness testimony. The shooter in Butler, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by a sniper.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-politics/ap-house-panel-investigating-trump-assassination-attempts-is-holding-its-first-hearing/	2024-09-26T04:46:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f54acab470d1.43705538.jpeg?w=900
Live: House panel probing Trump assassination attempts hold heari...	(NewsNation) — The bipartisan House task force investigating the plots to assassinate former President Donald Trump held its first hearing Thursday with testimony expected from several law enforcement officials. The public hearing comes just a day after a Senate subcommittee released a report on Secret Service failures in Butler, Pennsylvania, leading up to the July 13 attempt on Trump's life. Lawmakers claim 'foreseeable' and 'preventable' mistakes by the Secret Service 'directly contributed' to the July shooting. Mayor Eric Adams corruption investigation, indictment: Timeline To date, most of the panel's work has been conducted behind closed doors, including dozens of interviews with law enforcement agents and witnesses from the rally site where the former president was shot. Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. was among those the task force had spoken to prior to the hearing, especially now that the agency is under a microscope. However, no Secret Service member is anticipated to appear at Thursday's hearing. The only exception is a former agent slated to testify. While Thursday's hearing will focus exclusively on the shooting in Butler, last week the House held a vote to expand the purview of the task force to include an investigation into the second assassination attempt on Trump's life outside of his West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course. This opens the door to future hearings. Aerospace scientist says he can measure psychic abilities The House task force was scheduled to travel to West Palm Beach on Friday for a site visit; however, that trip has been postponed due to Hurricane Helene. Members of the task force told NewsNation they want to visit the site to gather critical information that would hopefully give them further insight and perspective to properly investigate the second assassination attempt.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/house-panel-trump-assassination-attempts-hearing/	2024-09-26T04:35:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2167843860.jpg?w=900
Minimum wage on the ballot in these 5 states	(NewsNation) — The federal minimum wage hasn't changed since 2009, but voters in several states will have the chance to raise hourly wages at the state level in November. Voters in Alaska, California and Missouri will decide whether to increase their state's minimum wage. If history is any indicator, those efforts are likely to be successful. From 1996 to 2022, voters approved 26 of the 28 minimum wage increase measures on the ballot, according to Ballotopedia. Euthanasia, pronouns, sports betting: Intriguing 2024 ballot measures Meanwhile, ballot measures in Massachusetts and Arizona would affect wages for tipped workers. In Arizona, the initiative would allow employers to pay tipped workers less, whereas in Massachusetts, tipped workers would see their hourly minimum wage rise from $6.75 an hour to $15 an hour over five years. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have also weighed in on tipped wages, both promising to end federal taxes on tips. Minimum wage by the numbers The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour and has not changed since 2009. Currently, 34 states, territories and districts have minimum wages above the federal minimum wage, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Lebanese officials say an Israeli strike killed 23 Syrian workers...	BEIRUT (AP) — An Israeli airstrike in Lebanon hit a building housing Syrian workers and their families, killing 23 people, Lebanese officials said Thursday. It was one of the deadliest single strikes in an intensified air campaign against the militant Hezbollah group. The strike late Wednesday came as the United States and its allies called for an 'immediate' 21-day cease-fire to 'provide space for diplomacy.' Israel has threatened to launch a ground invasion, and the increasingly heavy exchanges of fire could trigger an all-out war. Lebanon's National News Agency said the strike occurred near the ancient city of Baalbek in Lebanon's northeastern Bekaa Valley, which runs along the Syrian border. It quoted Ali Kassas, mayor of the village of Younine, as saying that the bodies of 23 Syrian citizens were pulled from under the rubble. He said four Syrians and four Lebanese were wounded. Hussein Salloum, a local official in Younine, said most of the dead were women and children, and that rescue efforts lasted through the night and into Thursday morning. 'We dug through the rubble with our own hands' until a small bulldozer was brought in, Salloum told The Associated Press by telephone. 'We had very limited capabilities.' The Lebanese Red Cross said it recovered nine bodies, while others were recovered by the Hezbollah militant group’s paramedic service and the Lebanese Civil Defense. Lebanon, with a population of around 6 million, hosts nearly 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands who are unregistered — the world’s highest refugee population per capita. Israel has carried out days of heavy strikes across Lebanon, targeting what it says are Hezbollah rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. The militants have fired hundreds of rockets into Israel and on Wednesday targeted Tel Aviv for the first time with a longer-range missile that was intercepted. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is traveling to the United States for the U.N. General Assembly, has not yet responded to the cease-fire proposal. But his foreign minister, Israel Katz, said Israel would continue fighting 'with full force until victory.' Hezbollah has also not yet responded to the proposal. The militant group has insisted it would only halt its strikes if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears out of reach despite months of negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. Israeli strikes since Monday have killed more than 630 people in Lebanon, according to local health authorities, who say around a quarter were women and children. Several people have been wounded by shrapnel in Israel. Israel struck 75 sites overnight across southern and eastern Lebanon, the military said. At least 45 projectiles were fired from Lebanon early Thursday, all of which were intercepted or fell in open areas, it said. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack ignited the war in Gaza, hoping to pin down Israeli forces. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are close allies of Iran. The fighting has killed dozens of people in Israel and driven tens of thousands from their homes on both sides of the border. Israel has vowed to do whatever is necessary to allow its citizens to return, and it has moved thousands of troops to the northern border in preparation for a possible ground operation. ___ Lidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-lebanese-state-media-says-an-israeli-strike-killed-23-syrian-workers/	2024-09-26T02:51:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f52fec1aa961.91943472.jpeg?w=900
Hurricane Helene's arrival to bring 'unsurvivable' storm surge	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Helene is forecast to make landfall Thursday night as a Category 4 storm, threatening Florida’s coast and southern Georgia with the potential for 'unsurvivable' storm surges as high as 20 feet and 'catastrophic' winds up to 130 mph. Helene, the fifth hurricane of the Atlantic season this year, will deliver heavy rainfall, flash flooding and a life-threatening storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center. Before landfall early Thursday morning, sustained winds were near 90 mph, heading northward. The NHC predicts the winds will intensify reach 130 mph upon landfall. Could the Fujiwhara effect influence Helene’s path? As of 5 a.m. Eastern, Helene was a Category 1 storm about 350 miles southwest of Tampa, Florida, with a northward trajectory. After making landfall in Florida’s Big Bend area in the northwest part of the state, forecasters expect the storm to turn northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday. More than 20 counties were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders as of Thursday morning, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for most of Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster did the same, as wind damage is forecast to extend far beyond the storm’s center and inland across the southeastern U.S. 'There is a danger of catastrophic and unsurvivable storm surge for Apalachee Bay … this forecast, if realized, is a nightmare surge scenario for Apalachee Bay,' the National Weather Service in Tallahassee said, pleading with residents to 'please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously.' ‼️Situation Overview for #HurricaneHelene from our Hurricane Local Statement Product ‼️(https://t.co/Hr6fIdtCfA). PLEASE give this a read and do not take #Helene lightly. #FLwx #ALwx #GAwx pic.twitter.com/ZPvvAY4xCB&mdash; NWS Tallahassee (@NWSTallahassee) September 26, 2024 The storm surge causes normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The destructive Hurricane Ian in 2022 had storm surge levels of 10 to 15 feet above ground level. Helene, meanwhile, could produce storm surge of 15-20 feet in some areas. The NHC warns of prolonged power outages lasting days to weeks, damage to trees and powerlines and inaccessible roads. Tornadoes are also possible.

Mayor Eric Adams corruption investigation, indictment: Timeline	(NewsNation) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been indicted by a federal grand jury on criminal charges that are still sealed, according to two people familiar with the matter. The charges against Adams, a Democrat, were still sealed late Wednesday, according to the sources who spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Adams is a retired police captain who was elected as New York City’s 110th mayor nearly three years ago. The indictment makes Adams the first sitting New York City mayor to face criminal charges. NYC investigations: Who’s resigned from Eric Adams’ administration? Timeline of events in the federal investigation: Nov. 2, 2023 The investigation into Adams’ 2021 mayoral campaign fundraising became widely known in November 2023. That’s when FBI agents searched the home of Brianna Suggs, who was a fundraiser for Adams during his 2021 campaign, and Rana Abbasova, who worked in the mayor’s international affairs office. Nov. 6, 2023 Four days later, FBI agents seized phones and an iPad from Adams as he was leaving a public event in Manhattan. 'The mayor immediately complied with the FBI’s request and provided them with electronic devices,' lawyer Boyd Johnson’s statement said. 'The mayor has not been accused of any wrongdoing and continues to cooperate with the investigation.' Feb. 29, 2024 Federal agents raided two homes owned by Winnie Greco, Adams’ director of Asian affairs. It is unclear if the raid was connected to Adams. The search of the properties came months after Adams associates’ homes were searched as part of a federal corruption probe centered on the mayor’s 2021 election campaign, which allegedly conspired with the Turkish government to receive illegal foreign donations. Following the raid, Greco was put on leave. July 2024 Adams received his own subpoena from federal prosecutors seeking information from him, his campaign, and City Hall. Those subpoenas requested information about the mayor’s schedule, his overseas travel and potential connections to the Turkish government, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigations. Sept. 4, 2024 Federal agents on took devices from Adams’ police commissioner, his schools chancellor, two deputy mayors and several other advisers. None of the officials involved have been charged with a crime, but the wave of searches added to a cloud of suspicion around Adams. They also raised questions internally about the administration’s ability to stay focused on serving the nation’s largest city. Sept. 12, 2024 New York Police Department Commissioner Edward Caban resigned amid a federal investigation involving alleged corruption, according to Mayor Eric Adams. Caban said he decided to resign after the 'news around recent developments' had 'created a distraction for our department,' according to an email to the police department obtained by The Associated Press. 'I am unwilling to let my attention be on anything other than our important work, or the safety of the men and women of the NYPD,' he added. Sept. 14, 2024 City Hall announced Lisa Zornberg’s abrupt departure. She had advised Adams and other city officials on legal strategy for over a year and often parried legal questions from the media on his behalf. She was not his personal lawyer. 'It has been a great honor to serve the City. I am tendering my resignation, effective today, as I have concluded that I can no longer effectively serve in my position. I wish you nothing but the best,' Zornberg wrote in a three-sentence resignation letter to Adams. Officials did not seize her phone, the AP reported. Sept. 16, 2024 Two former New York City Fire Department chiefs were in custody Monday on charges that they solicited tens of thousands of dollars in bribes before ensuring the department’s fire-safety division gave preferential treatment to some individuals and companies. Anthony Saccavino and Brian Cordasco were arrested on bribery, corruption and false statements charges alleging that they solicited and accepted the bribe payments from at least 2021 through 2023, authorities said. Sept. 20, 2024 Federal prosecutors subpoenaed the director of the city’s Office of Asylum Seeker Operations to testify before a grand jury. Molly Schaeffer, who coordinates the city’s efforts to get housing and social services for newly arrived migrants, received the subpoena at her Brooklyn home in September, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the subpoena. The authorities did not seize Schaeffer’s electronic devices — as they had done to several other Adams’ aides in recent weeks — but served her a subpoena requesting her presence in front of a federal grand jury in Manhattan, the person said. Sept. 25, 2024 U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called on Adams to resign, the first nationally prominent Democrat to do so. She cited the federal criminal investigations into the mayor’s administration and the string of unexpected departures of top city officials. 'I do not see how Mayor Adams can continue governing New York City,' Ocasio-Cortez wrote on the social platform X. Adams reacted with scorn, dismissing Ocasio-Cortez as self-righteous. In a statement to NewsNation on Wednesday night, Adams maintained his innocence. Eric Adams indicted on federal criminal charges: Sources 'I always knew that If I stood my ground for New Yorkers that I would be a target—and a target I became. If I am charged, I am innocent and I will fight this with every ounce of my strength and spirit,' Adams said.

Suge Knight claims Diddy participated in abuse, assault with high...	(NewsNation) — Suge Knight, co-founder and former CEO of Death Row Records tells 'CUOMO' that Sean 'Diddy' Combs is 'not the only one' to put younger artists through humiliating sexual acts, describing various industry practices throughout the decades. The video above contains excerpts of his live, exclusive interview with Chris Cuomo. Combs, who has gone by various aliases including P. Diddy, Diddy, Puffy and Puff Daddy, was arrested on Sept. 16 following a grand jury indictment for several felonies, including sex trafficking and racketeering. The arrest came as the producer faced a mounting list of civil lawsuits alleging abuse and assault spanning over three decades. He's being held in Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center, and two of his bids for a bail release have failed. Diddy has pleaded not guilty to all charges. What we know about the Diddy investigation Knight, who has been serving a 28-year prison sentence in California for voluntary manslaughter, tells NewsNation he sees Diddy's current situation as a product of a corrupt industry, saying Diddy 'stepped in this s--t. Even if he wiped off his shoe, it still stinks. But he's not the only one. They got all the tapes.' Knight: Abuse was learned from industry Knight claims Diddy 'was taught from people before him, and he did it to the younger people after him.' It's an industry that, according to Knight, has a long history of sexually abusing and assaulting its newest members. He said one practice, called an 'egg test,' went as follows: 'Those guys pull their pants down and bent over. They stick (the egg) up their a--. Their eggs break. They say they're not ready yet, they ain't put enough work in. This is Hollywood,' Knight said. Without attending 'those butt naked parties,' it's hard to comprehend what happened — but that doesn't mean it was a secret, according to Knight. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs arrest and indictment: A timeline of key events 'Because this been going on in the industry for a whole bunch of years, for decades and at the same time. You know, nobody wanted to be true, and it shouldn't have to be true,' Knight said. Knight also said he believes Diddy's allegations stem from his own experiences. 'You know, hurt people hurt people ... Someone was sexually abused, they wind up being a perpetrator. Is that what you're suggesting about Sean Combs, that he was sexually abused, and he now sexually abuses?' NewsNation's Chris Cuomo asked. 'Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. I think it was done to him,' Knight said. Knight accuses others in industry In his exclusive interview with NewsNation, Knight accused other industry professionals including a man whose 'job was to bring underage girls and girls and have sex with employees and other artists, to the point where his friend got caught up with the same thing,' Knight said. Knight went on to mention that Interscope and Universal have a policy of not dealing with artists who get into trouble and are often the ones paying off the alleged victims of their artists.

He claimed the company put her on the payroll as a means of repayment, with Knight adding he believes 'she had to pay taxes.' 'I shouldn't say that, because I'm trying to protect her, her image, but he beat the s--- out of her and Cassie. He did things to her you should never do to a woman,' Knight said. He also mentioned artists by name who should have been 'whistleblowers,' including Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross, among others. Knight called for change in the industry, telling Cuomo, 'If we don't fix it and do something about it, history will constantly be repeating itself.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/suge-knight-claims-diddy-participated-in-abuse-assault-with-higher-ups/	2024-09-25T12:21:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-51236760.jpg?w=900
Mexican cartels targeting police with tire spikes	(NewsNation) —Mexican cartels are becoming increasingly confrontational with law enforcement, using tire deflation devices like caltrops to disable vehicles during pursuits to evade arrest. While these devices have been in use quietly for nearly two decades, there has been a recent resurgence and Border Patrol has issued an alert to agents warning them of an uptick in tire deflation tactics by smugglers. Cartels and criminal smugglers are finding 'ways to evolve based on what we're doing as law enforcement, they're going to change their tactics,' Texas Department of Public Safety Lt. Chris Olivarez told NewsNation. Is Arizona the new migrant hotspot as Texas beefs up security? 'If they are constantly being pursued by law enforcement, getting arrested by law enforcement, they have no other way to get away.' The use of tire deflation devices Tire deflation devices, like caltrops, were seen by DPS as early as 2008 when drug smugglers would use them against law enforcement to protect drug loads and evade law enforcement, Olivarez said. But they became less common over the years. Caltrops are devices with four metal points arranged so that when any three are on the ground, the fourth spike projects upward to puncture tires. While they look different, the devices act similarly to the tire deflation mechanisms law enforcement uses and has the same goal. 4 family members sentenced for human smuggling ‘family enterprise’ in South Texas The use of a caltrop or other tire deflation device against an officer is a third-degree felony. 'We started seeing caltrops now this particular instance, we haven't seen them in years,' Olivarez said. Olivarez said he is concerned with the resurgence as the agency has been contending with human smuggling on a daily basis. Cartels and smugglers are starting to get 'desperate,' now, he said. 'They want to evade law enforcement by any means whatsoever, and if that means using a weapon such as caltrops, and that's what we could possibly start seeing in the future.' Caltrops are likely used by a more advanced smuggler who has been working for the criminal cartels for years, he added. Incidents where tire deflation devices used Tire deflation devices have long been used by the Texas DPS, which works under the state’s Operation Lone Star program, created by Gov. Greg Abbott. Since Operation Lone Star launched in 2021, troopers have made 9,730 human smuggling arrests and filed nearly 2,200 charges for the offense. In one incident, a truck driver fled from DPS troopers in La Salle County, leading troopers to deploy a tire deflation device causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle and leading to his arrest. Venezuelan gang member arrested again for human smuggling During a chase in Kinney County, two teenage smugglers who had been paid $9,000 to move migrants hit a light pole after their tires were punctured. Both were arrested and charged. But now, it appears the tables have turned with smugglers employing the same tactics. Both law enforcement and civilian vehicles have been damaged in these attempts to escape. Texas DPS officers found caltrops in a vehicle used to smuggle undocumented migrants after a car pursuit resulted in the suspects fleeing near Uvalde, Texas. Neither the driver nor the occupants of the vehicle were found. 'Clearly, those devices are meant to stop the pursuit, to allow them to evade,' Olivarez said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/mexican-cartels-targeting-police-with-tire-spikes/	2024-09-25T10:22:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/AP24022754027378-e1706546059657.jpg?w=800
Trump counters Harris speech with ‘prebuttal’ in North Carolina	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak Wednesday in North Carolina about the economy to counter a speech by Vice President Kamala Harris later in the day. Trump's campaign said the former president's so-called 'prebuttal' in Mint Hill would focus on his 2019 executive order that forced federal agencies to buy products made with more American components. He is also expected to revisit how he strengthened the Buy American Act. Where are Harris, Walz, Trump and Vance today? Wednesday's visit to the Tarheel State comes as new Gallup polling shows the 2024 election environmental is favorable for the Republican Party. GOP gubernatorial fallout However, the North Carolina governor's race took a turn after a CNN report last Thursday that GOP gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson made many inflammatory comments concerning race, gender and sexual preferences. Robinson said Tuesday his campaign hired a law firm to help investigate the CNN report, saying the lawyers will look at how what Robinson calls 'false smears' originated. New national polling from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ now shows Robinson's opponent Democrat Josh Stein leading by nearly 11 points. The scandal has left Republicans seeking distance from Robinson, and most of his top campaign staffers also quit in the aftermath of the report. Republican officials are anxious that Robinson’s situation could pull down Trump and help Harris in the battleground state, and threaten the outcomes of other key races on the ballot. Robinson was endorsed by Trump before the primary and has spoken at the former president’s in-state rallies. But, he was not involved in a Trump rally in Wilmington last weekend and Trump didn’t mention him. Speaking Monday in Charlotte, Trump running mate Sen. JD Vance said it was up to North Carolina voters to decide what they think of Robinson’s messages and whether they believe Robinson’s defense.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-economic-speech-north-carolina/	2024-09-25T09:57:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24263004455564.jpg?w=900
Kentucky sheriff accused of killing judge due in court	(NewsNation) — The Kentucky sheriff arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of a local judge in his courthouse chambers is set to appear virtually in court Wednesday morning. Authorities say Letcher County Sheriff Shawn 'Mickey' Stines, 43, shot District Judge Kevin Mullins multiple times last Thursday following an argument in the courthouse. Mullins, 54, died at the scene. Stines, according to The Mountain Eagle, allegedly walked into the judge’s outer office, then told court employees and others gathered there that he needed to speak with Mullins alone. After the two walked into the judge's chambers, witnesses heard shots. Stines walked out with his hands up and surrendered to police. Letcher County official shares what he knows about shooting Stines was charged with one count of first-degree murder. Police have not revealed a motive. According to the Associated Press, a brief arrest citation from Thursday says: 'Perpetrator used a firearm to shoot ... Letcher County District Judge Kevin Mullins. Judge Mullins succumbed to his injuries after the shooting.' Mullins was shot at 2:55 p.m., and Stines' arrest came five minutes later, per the citation, which has no other information related to the shooting.

Judge to weigh $600M East Palestine train derailment settlement	(NewsNation) — A federal judge could decide Wednesday whether to approve Norfolk Southern’s $600 million class-action settlement offer, more than a year after the 2023 toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. The hearing comes on the heels of an Associated Press analysis that raised concerns about the Environmental Protection Agency’s handling of contamination data from the derailment site. Many residents question the agency’s transparency about potential resulting health risks. The hearing will start at 10 a.m. CT at the Northern District Court of Ohio in Youngstown. A rally in support of the people affected by the derailment is planned for the same time outside the courthouse. NewsNation will publish updates here as they become available. 2 injured on United flight after plane tries to avoid collision A black plume rises over East Palestine, Ohio, as a result of a controlled detonation of a portion of the derailed Norfolk Southern trains, Feb. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) East Palestine train derailment A Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals derailed just before 9 p.m. local time Feb. 3, 2023, in East Palestine. Some 1,500 residents were told to evacuate. Fearing an explosion, officials vented and burned five tank cars, releasing the carcinogen vinyl chloride into the air. Minutes later, a toxic plume of smoke smothered the region. Three days after the derailment, the EPA said it hadn’t detected contaminants at 'levels of concern' and gave the all-clear for residents to return. Those who did reported developing rashes and feeling ill. In March 2023, an independent testing expert confirmed residents’ fears that carcinogens undetected by the Ohio EPA were in the water. More tests revealed dioxins — the most toxic compounds on the planet — in the soil, water and residents’ air filters. Today, those who remain in East Palestine and the surrounding area say their health problems are getting worse.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore, File) Norfolk Southern settlement The rail company agreed in April to pay $600 million in a class-action lawsuit settlement tied to the derailment. Residents, however, worry the money won’t cover potential future health needs and won’t amount to much once it’s divided among recipients. Attorneys for East Palestine residents filed a motion in August asking the judge to reevaluate the settlement. 'To accept, we would have to say that Norfolk Southern is not liable for anything, when, in fact, they were guilty of so many crimes here,' East Palestine resident Tammy Tsai told NewsNation ahead of Wednesday's hearing. The residents' complaint focused on allegations that settlement lawyers buried a contracted exposure expert’s findings about the state of soil and water in the affected area. They argue the settlement agreement was rushed and allege lawyers are colluding with Norfolk Southern. That exposure expert, Stephen Petty, was among several people who filed affidavits with the court and the EPA's inspector general. 'It is one of the few times where I’ve been involved, where I don’t think that the information that should get out there is getting out there,' Petty told NewsNation in an exclusive interview earlier this week.

Passenger killed in hijacking, pursuit of MTA bus in Los Angeles	(KTLA) — One person was fatally shot when an MTA bus was hijacked and then pursued by police from South Los Angeles to downtown early Wednesday morning. Officers responded to a 'Call 911' sign seen flashing on the bus around 12:45 a.m. at South Figueroa Street and Manchester Avenue in the Vermont Knolls neighborhood of South Los Angeles, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed. The bus driver had posted the emergency after a suspect pulled out a gun during some type of dispute. Watch live: One of Titan submersible owner's top officials to testify Several passengers quickly exited the bus but at least two others were still on board when the bus driver took off with the suspect then holding a gun to his head. Officers deployed spike strips, which flattened the tires of the bus and the pursuit came to an end at East 6th Street and South Alameda Street in downtown L.A., the spokesperson said. SWAT officers arrived at the scene and deployed flash-bang devices during a standoff with the suspect. Video showed the bus driver getting out of the bus through a window with the assistance of police. At least one passenger was also rescued from the bus.

Helene now a Category 1 hurricane as it moves over Gulf toward Fl...	(NewsNation) — Helene strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane Wednesday as it moved over the Caribbean into the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida. Floridians along the peninsula's west coast have been preparing for another hurricane forecast to bring strong winds and dangerous flooding as soon as Thursday across the Gulf Coast. What was a tropical storm early Wednesday morning continues to strengthen ahead of its anticipated landfall in the United States on Thursday. Helene is anticipated to be the fourth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this year. Thousands along Florida's coast have been advised to evacuate as Helene approaches — especially those living in areas previously hit hard by recent hurricanes. Brad Reinhart, a senior hurricane specialist, said in a phone interview with the Associated Press that Helene could become a Category 3 by the time it reaches the Gulf Coast. 'People in the Florida Panhandle and the west coast of Florida certainly need to pay close attention,' Reinhart said. 'It’s a pretty aggressive forecast for intensification over the next few days. ... People need to remain on high alert.' Could the Fujiwhara effect influence Helene's path? Tracking Helene's movement in the Gulf As of Wednesday morning, Helene was about 500 miles southwest of Tampa, Florida, with maximum winds of 80 mph. Helene, which formed Tuesday in the Caribbean, is expected to move over deep, warm waters, fueling its intensification. People in regions under hurricane warnings and watches should be prepared to lose power and should have enough food and water for at least three days, forecasters warned. President Joe Biden declared an emergency in Florida and deployed Federal Emergency Management Agency teams to Florida and Alabama to support local first responders. Federal authorities were positioning generators, food and water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams, the White House said. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency in 41 counties. On Tuesday morning, the storm moved through the Caribbean Sea near Cuba and the Cayman Islands, according to the National Hurricane Center. 'Prepare that it's going to be as strong as possible,' DeSantis said. 'The wind you can hide from ... it's the water that can be really, really devastating if you remain there when you're told to evacuate.' The storm is anticipated to be unusually large and fast-moving, meaning storm surges, wind and rain will likely extend far from the storm’s center, the hurricane center said. States as far inland as Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana could see rainfall. Can this caterpillar really predict winter weather?

(AP Photo/Luis Alberto Cruz) Watches and warning have been issued for parts of the Yucatan Peninsula, western Cuba, Grand Cayman and Florida, according to the Weather Channel. A hurricane warning was in effect for the Anclote River to Mexico Beach, Florida; and Cabo Catoche to Tulum, Mexico including Cozumel. A hurricane watch is in effect for the Cuban province of Pinar del Rio; and in Florida, from Englewood to Anclote River, including Tampa Bay. Hurricane watches mean that hurricane conditions are possible. They are usually issued 48 hours before forecasters predict the first occurrence of tropical storm-force winds. In Florida, a storm surge warning was in effect for Indian Pass southward to Flamingo; Tampa Bay; and Charlotte Harbor. This means there's a possibility of life-threatening 'inundation' in those areas for the next 36 hours. The Dry Tortugas; all of the Florida Keys; the Florida west coast from Flamingo to Anclote River, includingTampa Bay; west of Mexico Beach to the Walton/Bay County Line; the Florida east coast from Flamingo northward to the mouth of the St. Mary's River; Lake Okeechobee; Rio Lagartos to Cabo Catoche, Mexico; and Cuban provinces of Artemisa, Pinar del Rio, and the Isle of Youth are under a tropical storm warning. A tropical storm warning indicates tropical storms conditions are expected in the next 24-36 hours. The Georgia and South Carolina coasts north of the mouth of the St. Mary's River to the South Santee River are under a tropical storm watch, so these conditions are possible in the areas within 48 hours. In the coming days, people in regions under storm watches and warnings should be prepared to lose power, Lisa Bucci, a hurricane specialist, told AP. Bucci added that those in affected areas should stock up on enough food and water for at least three days. 'Now is the time to start preparing. If you’re in an evacuation zone, you should evacuate,' Bucci said. 'Don’t be fooled by the way the storm looks at the moment. We are expecting it to rapidly intensify.'

Hezbollah fires a missile at Tel Aviv in deepest strike yet after...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Hezbollah hurled dozens of projectiles into Israel early Wednesday, including a missile aimed at Tel Aviv that was the militant group's deepest strike yet and marked a further escalation after Israeli strikes on Lebanon killed hundreds of people. The Israeli military said it intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, which set off air-raid sirens in Tel Aviv and across central Israel. There were no reports of casualties or damage. The military said it struck the site in southern Lebanon where the missile was launched. Hezbollah said it fired a Qader 1 ballistic missile targeting the headquarters of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, which it blames for a recent string of targeted killings of its top commanders and for an attack last week in which explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies killed dozens of people and wounded thousands, including many Hezbollah members. The Israeli military said it was the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel. Hezbollah claimed to have targeted an intelligence base near Tel Aviv last month in an aerial attack, but there was no confirmation. The Palestinian Hamas militant group in Gaza repeatedly targeted Tel Aviv in the opening months of the war. The launch ratcheted up tensions as the region appeared to be teetering toward another all-out war, even as Israel continues to battle Hamas in the Gaza Strip. A wave of Israeli strikes on Monday and Tuesday killed at least 560 people in Lebanon and forced thousands to seek refuge. Fleeing families have flocked to Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon, sleeping in schools turned into shelters, as well as in cars, parks and along the beach. Some sought to leave the country, causing a traffic jam at the border with Syria. Hezbollah's latest strikes included dozens of rockets fired Wednesday into northern Israel, with one hitting an empty home and sparking a fire in the city of Safed. The Israeli military said that at one point the militants fired 40 projectiles simultaneously. Israel responded with its own new strikes on Hezbollah. In Lebanon, at least three people were killed and nine wounded in an Israeli strike near Byblos, according to the country's Health Ministry. The coastal town is north of Beirut and far from Hezbollah's main strongholds. The Israeli military has said there are no immediate plans for a ground invasion, but it has declined to give a timetable for the air campaign. Tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group have steadily escalated over the last 11 months. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation. The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Lebanon for Wednesday at the request of France. Nearly a year of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel had already displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border before this week’s escalation. Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, something that appears increasingly remote. The rocket fire over the past week has disrupted life for more than 1 million people across northern Israel, with schools closed and restrictions on public gatherings. Many restaurants and other businesses are shut in the coastal city of Haifa, and there are fewer people on the streets. Some who fled south from communities near the border are coming under rocket fire again. Israel has moved thousands of troops who had been serving in Gaza to the northern border. It says Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including some capable of striking anywhere in Israel, and that the group has fired some 9,000 rockets and drones since last October. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said the missile fired Wednesday had a 'heavy warhead' but declined to elaborate or confirm it was the type described by Hezbollah. He dismissed Hezbollah's claim of targeting the Mossad headquarters, located just north of Tel Aviv, as 'psychological warfare.' The Iranian-made Qader is a medium-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile with multiple types and payloads. It can carry an explosive payload of up to 800 kilograms (1,760 pounds), according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Iranian officials have described the liquid-fueled missile as having a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles). Cross-border fire began ramping up Sunday in the wake of the pager and walkie-talkie bombings, which killed 39 people and wounded nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility. On Sunday, Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel. The next day, Israel said its warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones, including weapons concealed in private homes. The strikes racked up the highest one-day death toll in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006. An Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday killed Ibrahim Kobeisi, whom Israel described as a top Hezbollah commander with the group’s rocket and missile unit. Military officials said Kobeisi was responsible for launches toward Israel and planned a 2000 attack in which three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and killed. Hezbollah later confirmed his death. It was the latest in a string of assassinations and other setbacks for Hezbollah, which is Lebanon's strongest political and military actor and is widely considered the top paramilitary force in the Arab world. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said six people were killed and 15 were wounded in the strike in a southern Beirut suburb, an area where Hezbollah has a strong presence. The country’s National News Agency said the attack destroyed three floors of a six-story apartment building. The U.N.’s High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon said one of its staffers and her young son were among those killed Monday in the Bekaa region, while a cleaner under contract was killed in a strike in the south. Hezbollah fired 300 rockets on Tuesday, injuring six Israeli soldiers and civilians, most of them lightly, according to the Israeli military. The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 564 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Monday, including 50 children and 94 women, and that more than 1,800 have been wounded, a staggering toll for a country still reeling from the deadly pager and walkie-talkie bombings last week. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

Secret Service failures before Trump rally shooting were 'prevent...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Multiple Secret Service failures ahead of the July rally for former President Donald Trump where a gunman opened fire were 'foreseeable, preventable, and directly related to the events resulting in the assassination attempt that day,' according to a bipartisan Senate investigation released Wednesday. Similar to the agency’s own internal investigation and an ongoing bipartisan House probe, the interim report from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee found multiple failures on almost every level ahead of the Butler, Pennsylvania shooting, including in planning, communications, security and allocation of resources. 'The consequences of those failures were dire,' said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the Democratic chairman of the Homeland panel. Investigators found that there was no clear chain of command among the Secret Service and other security agencies and no plan for coverage of the building where the shooter climbed up to fire the shots. Officials were operating on multiple, separate radio channels, leading to missed communications, and an inexperienced drone operator was stuck on a help line after his equipment wasn’t working correctly. Communications among security officials were a 'multi-step game of telephone,' Peters said. The report found the Secret Service was notified about an individual on the roof of the building approximately two minutes before shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire, firing eight rounds in Trump’s direction less than 150 yards from where the former president was speaking. Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper. Approximately 22 seconds before Crooks fired, the report found, a local officer sent a radio alert that there was an armed individual on the building. But that information was not relayed to key Secret Service personnel who were interviewed by Senate investigators. The panel also interviewed a Secret Service counter-sniper who said that they saw officers with their guns drawn running toward the building where the shooter was perched, but the person said they did not think to notify anyone to get Trump off the stage. The Senate report comes just days after the Secret Service released a five-page document summarizing the key conclusions of a yet-to-be finalized Secret Service report on what went wrong, and ahead of a Thursday hearing that will be held by a bipartisan House task force investigating the shooting. The House panel is also investigating a second assassination attempt on Trump earlier this month when Secret Service agents arrested a man with a rifle hiding on the golf course at Trump’s Florida club. Each investigation has found new details that reflect a massive breakdown in the former president’s security, and lawmakers say there is much more they want to find out as they try to prevent it from happening again. 'This was the result of multiple human failures of the Secret Service,' said Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the top Republican on the panel. The senators recommended that the Secret Service better define roles and responsibilities before any protective event, including by designating a single individual in charge of approving all the security plans. Investigators found that many of the people in charge denied that they had responsibility for planning or security failures, and deflected blame. Advance agents interviewed by the committee said 'that planning and security decisions were made jointly, with no specific individual responsible for approval,' the report said. Communication with local authorities was also poor. Local law enforcement had raised concern two days earlier about security coverage of the building where the shooter perched, telling Secret Service agents during a walk through that they did not have the manpower to lock it down. Secret Service agents then gave investigators conflicting accounts about who was responsible for that security coverage, the report said. The internal review released last week by the Secret Service also detailed multiple communications breakdowns, including an absence of clear guidance to local law enforcement and the failure to fix line-of-sight vulnerabilities at the rally grounds that left Trump open to sniper fire and 'complacency' among some agents. 'This was a failure on the part of the United States Secret Service. It’s important that we hold ourselves to account for the failures of July 13th and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again,' said Ronald Rowe Jr., the agency’s acting director, after the report was released. In addition to better defining responsibility for events, the senators recommended that the agency completely overhaul its communications operations at protective events and improve intelligence sharing. They also recommended that Congress evaluate whether more resources are needed. Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on whether to give the Secret Service more money in the wake of its failures. A spending bill on track to pass before the end of the month includes an additional $231 million for the agency, but many Republicans have said that an internal overhaul is needed first. 'This is a management problem plain and simple,' said Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the top Republican on the Homeland panel's investigations subcommittee.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-secret-service-failures-before-trump-rally-shooting-were-preventable-senate-panel-finds/	2024-09-25T02:03:13-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f3d2b6da2f17.47689031.jpeg?w=900
Live: NTSB engineer to testify before Coast Guard in Titan submer...	An engineer with the National Transportation Safety Board is scheduled to testify in front of the Coast Guard on Wednesday about the experimental submersible that imploded en route to the wreckage of the Titanic. Engineer Don Kramer is slated to testify as the investigation continues into the implosion of OceanGate's Titan submersible. OceanGate co-founder Stockton Rush was among the five people who died when the submersible imploded in June 2023. The Coast Guard opened a public hearing earlier this month that is part of a high level investigation into the cause of the implosion. Some of the testimony has focused on the troubled nature of the company. Earlier in the hearing, former OceanGate operations director David Lochridge said he frequently clashed with Rush and felt the company was committed only to making money. 'The whole idea behind the company was to make money,' Lochridge testified. 'There was very little in the way of science.' Lochridge and other previous witnesses painted a picture of a company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident set off a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration. The hearing is expected to run through Friday and include several more witnesses, some of whom were closely connected to the company. Other witnesses scheduled to testify Wednesday were William Kohnen of Hydrospace Group Inc. and Bart Kemper of Kemper Engineering. The co-founder of the company told the Coast Guard panel Monday that he hoped a silver lining of the disaster is that it will inspire a renewed interest in exploration, including the deepest waters of the world’s oceans. Businessman Guillermo Sohnlein, who helped found OceanGate with Rush, ultimately left the company before the Titan disaster. 'This can’t be the end of deep ocean exploration. This can’t be the end of deep-diving submersibles and I don’t believe that it will be,' Sohnlein said. Coast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice. That and Titan’s unusual design subjected it to scrutiny in the undersea exploration community. OceanGate, based in Washington state, suspended its operations after the implosion. The company has no full-time employees currently, but has been represented by an attorney during the hearing. During the submersible’s final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts about Titan’s depth and weight as it descended. The support ship Polar Prince then sent repeated messages asking if Titan could still see the ship on its onboard display. One of the last messages from Titan’s crew to Polar Prince before the submersible imploded stated, 'all good here,' according to a visual re-creation presented earlier in the hearing. When the submersible was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said. No one on board survived. OceanGate said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began. Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/missing-titanic-tourist-submarine/ap-ntsb-engineer-to-testify-before-coast-guard-in-titan-submersible-disaster-hearing/	2024-09-24T21:16:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f38feab86ae3.11546757.jpeg?w=900
Israel bombards Hezbollah, killing a top commander, while familie...	BEIRUT (AP) — Kg rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation. Israel said a strike in Beirut on Tuesday had killed Ibrahim Kobeisi, who it said was a top Hezbollah commander with the group's rocket and missile unit. Military officials said Kobeisi was responsible for launches towards Israel and planned a 2000 attack in which three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and killed. Hezbollah later confirmed Kobeisi’s death. It was the latest in a string of assassinations and setbacks for Hezbollah, the strongest political and military actor in Lebanon and widely considered the top paramilitary force in the Arab world. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said six people were killed and 15 were wounded in the strike in a southern Beirut suburb, an area where Hezbollah has a strong presence. The country’s National News Agency said the attack destroyed three floors of a six-story apartment building. The U.N.’s High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon said one of its staffers and her young son were among those killed Monday in the Bekaa region, while a cleaner under contract was killed in a strike in the south. Hezbollah said its missile attacks Tuesday targeted eight sites in Israel, including an explosives factory in Zichron Yaakov, 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the border. It fired 300 rockets, injuring six soldiers and civilians, most of them lightly, according to Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman. The renewed exchange came after Monday's barrages racked up the highest death toll in any single day in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006. On Tuesday, mourners carried 11 bodies through the streets of the Lebanese village of Saksakieh, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the Lebanon-Israel border, including those of four women, an infant and a 7-year-old girl. All were killed in Israel’s bombardment of the village Monday. Some of the bodies were draped in Hezbollah flags, others wrapped in black clothes. A wreath of flowers was placed on top of the smallest one. Mohammad Halal, father of 7-year-old Joury Halal, said his daughter was an 'innocent child martyr.' 'She is a martyr for the sake of the south and Palestine,' Halal said and defiantly stated his allegiance to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel said it targeted sites where Hezbollah had stored weapons. Data from American fire-tracking satellites analyzed Tuesday by The Associated Press showed the wide range of Israeli airstrikes aimed at southern Lebanon, covering an area of over 1,700 square kilometers (650 square miles). NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System typically is used to track U.S. wildfires, but can also be used to track the flashes and burning that follow airstrikes. Data from Monday showed significant fires across southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley. The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 564 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Monday, including 50 children and 94 women, and that more than 1,800 have been wounded — a staggering toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week. Nearly a year of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel had displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border before this week's escalation. Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly remote. The Israeli military says it has no immediate plans for a ground invasion but is prepared for one. It has moved thousands of troops who had been serving in Gaza to the northern border. It says Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including some capable of striking anywhere in Israel, and that the group has fired some 9,000 rockets and drones since last October. Israel said its warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets Monday, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones, including weapons concealed in private homes. Monday's escalation came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire Sunday, when Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel. Last week, thousands of communications devices used mainly by Hezbollah members exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility. ___ Melzer contributed from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Woman alleges Diddy filmed himself, bodyguard raping her: Lawsuit	(NewsNation) — Another woman has accused Sean 'Diddy' Combs of sexual assault. Thalia Graves said the music mogul, along with his bodyguard, Joseph 'Big Joe' Sherman, 'viciously raped her' at the Bad Boy Records studio in the summer of 2001, according to court documents obtained by NewsNation local affiliate KTLA. Attorney Gloria Allred and Graves allege that the assault was filmed and then shared without the victim's consent — including selling it as pornography. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits: timeline Allred announced the newest lawsuit at a Tuesday press conference, calling the accusations a 'violation of New York City’s victims of gender-motivated violence protection law by viciously and violently forcing sexual contact [including] oral sex and sexual intercourse on the plaintiff.' 'By raping the plaintiff and recording it,' Allred added, 'the defendants caused the plaintiff to be depicted in a video image unclothed and with intimate body parts exposed and engaged in sexual conduct with another person.' Diddy may have stopped eating in jail: Former inmate At the time of the alleged assault, Graves was in a relationship with one of Diddy's employees. At the Tuesday press conference, she shared that she was going through a divorce and family issues at the time of the assault. Court documents show that Graves didn't report it for decades out of fear they 'would use their power to ruin her life, as they had repeatedly, explicitly threatened to do.' The incident left her traumatized and contemplating suicide, according to the filing. Ben Affleck given tapes of Jennifer Lopez from Diddy raids by FBI: Suge Knight 'It goes beyond just physical harm caused by the assault,' she said at the press conference. 'It’s a pain that reaches into the very core of who you are and leaves emotional scars that may never fully heal. Some of the hardest parts of this pain are the shame and the guilt I have experienced that plays a negative part in my day-to-day ability to function properly.' Graves said that the assault left her with lasting physical ailments, including chronic pain and a fear of leaving her house. Who is Kristina Khorram, Diddy’s former chief of staff? 'The trauma of the assault has taken a toll on my mental health. I’ve had PTSD, depression and anxiety,' she continued. 'It has been hard for me to trust others, create relationships or even feel safe in my own skin. The combination of physical and emotional pain has created a cycle of suffering from which it is so hard to break free.' Allred said the charges filed by Graves — the 11th of their kind — will not overlap with the existing criminal charges against Diddy. Diddy’s allegations, arrest Diddy is accused of using his music empire to engage in sex trafficking and accused of having a pattern of abusing women. He was arrested Sept. 16 after months of allegations and a federal raid on two of his properties. He pleaded not guilty in New York court the next day.

Dangerous gas leak forces immediate evacuations in Cleves, Ohio	This is developing story. Check back for updates. (NewsNation) — A dangerous chemical leak rapidly spewing from a train tanker car has forced immediate emergency evacuations for residents in Cleves, Ohio, 16 miles west of Cincinnati. The Hamilton County Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency warned people in Cleves and Whitewater Township to 'leave the area immediately' due to a 'dangerous chemical leak' in an alert, adding that they have opened a public shelter for those fleeing. Video acquired by NewsNation shows white fumes pumping out of a stalled tanker car. Several fire trucks were seen in the area spraying water on a tanker car, according to WCPO. Aerial video showed firefighters spraying down a railcar sitting upright on tracks between the highway and an asphalt plant. Cleves sits on the Ohio border with Indiana and has a population of about 3,000 people. Tom Ciuba, a spokesman for the Central Railroad of Indiana, said it was notified around 1 p.m. about a railcar in the area of Cleves that was venting styrene, which is used to make plastic and rubber. 'Ohio EPA's Emergency Response team arrived on scene in Cleves around 4:00 p.m., Tuesday. Our on-scene coordinator is there to assist the local fire department that is in charge of Incident Command Operations,' an Ohio Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson said in a statement. 'The volume of styrene in the release is unknown at this time.' Three nearby school buildings also were being evacuated, according to Lisa Whiteley, a spokesperson for the Three Rivers Local School District. Styrene gas, a neurotoxin, can immobilize people within minutes of inhalation and can be fatal at high concentrations. Last year in the Indian city of Visakhapatnam, a leak of styrene gas from a chemical factory killed 12 people and sickened more than 1,000.

Haitian group wants Trump, Vance arrest warrants after Ohio comme...	(NewsNation) — A group of private citizens is calling for the arrests of former President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in a municipal court in Ohio, over comments they made about Haitian migrants living in Springfield. Court documents demand arrest warrants for Trump and Vance, claiming comments made by the two Republicans about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio were criminal, according to a court filing. The charges were filed by Guerline Jozef of The Chandra Law Firm in Cleveland, on behalf of the Haitian Bridge Alliance. Trump suspect’s son arrested on child porn charges The documents — filed in Clark County Municipal Court — include criminal charges, which the law firm claims can be brought against Trump and Vance by private civilians under Ohio law. Those listed charges include disrupting public services, making false alarms, complicity, telecommunications harassment and aggravating menacing, according to the complaint. The law firm representing the group claims in a blog post that Ohio statute allows private citizens to file criminal changes. The law firm said that because the Clark County prosecuting attorney has not acted 'to protect the community and hold Trump and Vance accountable for what they have instigated', Jozef is asking the court to find probable cause and issue arrest warrants for both Trump and Vance. NewsNation has reached out to the Trump-Vance campaign for comment and did not immediately hear back. This is a developing story.

Americans adopt more critical view of US Secret Service	(NewsNation) — Americans’ rating of the U.S. Secret Service’s job performance has taken a nosedive in the past decade, according to Gallup polling that was mostly completed before the Sept. 15 alleged assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. About one in three U.S. adults rate the Secret Service’s performance as excellent or good, while 25% say the agency’s work is 'only fair.' Another 36% characterized the Secret Service’s job performance as 'poor.' The polling was conducted amid ongoing investigations into the July 13 shooting at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump suffered a graze wound to his ear. One rallygoer died and several others were injured. Florida dad turns in son after school shooting threat, police say Americans and lawmakers scrutinized the Secret Service after the shooting and an alleged assassination attempt two months later only drew more attention to the agency’s perceived security lapses. Although more than half of Americans, on average, have had a positive outlook on the Secret Service since 2014, it’s not the first time faith in the agency has dipped. The current approval rating is the lowest it's been in 10 years. Americans in 2014 were more skeptical of the Secret Service's efficacy, following several security lapses — including an intruder who jumped a fence and entered the White House. The public's outlook on the agency's performance has been mostly positive since 2014 — until now. Forty-three percent of Americans at the time said the Secret Service was doing an 'excellent' or 'good' job, while 16% rated the agency’s performance as 'poor.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/americans-adopt-critical-view-us-secret-service/	2024-09-24T08:36:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/AP24196239341747_6adf5e-e1722618930657.jpg?w=900

Afghanistan withdrawal hearing: Will Blinken show?	(NewsNation) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to miss a hearing Tuesday about the nation's withdrawal from Afghanistan, despite threats to hold him in contempt of Congress. Last week, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul subpoenaed Blinken to attend the hearing, threatening contempt if he didn’t. The meeting was originally scheduled for 10 a.m. EDT Tuesday. The committee made its livestream for the hearing private about an hour before it was set to begin and posted another stream titled, 'Markup to Find Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Contempt of Congress.' Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told NewsNation Tuesday morning he doesn’t expect Blinken to attend. 'He’s going to be a no-show,' Burchett said Tuesday on 'Morning in America.' 'I don’t think he wants to face us. He’s got no excuse. This thing was a disaster.' Brett Favre to testify in Mississippi welfare scandal civil case Why is Antony Blinken unlikely to attend House hearing? The State Department lashed at House Republicans over the subpoena earlier this month, accusing them of repeatedly calling for hearings on days they knew Blinken was unavailable. McCaul said he was trying to accommodate Blinken. He had first set a hearing for Thursday while Blinken was in Egypt and France. On Tuesday, Blinken is expected to attend the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders in New York and listen to President Joe Biden’s speech at the time of the hearing. It wouldn’t have been the secretary of state’s first time speaking publicly about the six-month withdrawal that began in February 2020. Blinken has testified about Afghanistan 14 times, including four times before McCaul’s committee. JD Vance, Tim Walz prep for debate that could influence tight race Why did lawmakers plan the Afghanistan withdrawal hearing? House Republicans issued a report on their investigation into the military withdrawal earlier this month. They alleged — in part — that the Biden-Harris administration 'was determined to withdraw from Afghanistan, with or without the Doha Agreement,' also known as the Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan. The deal was brokered between the Taliban and U.S. when former President Donald Trump was in office and signed in February 2020. It called for the drawdown of U.S. forces from the country and a full withdrawal by May 2021, a timeline Biden vowed to stick to when he took office. The report also said the Biden-Harris administration failed to prepare for civilian evacuation operations and created an unsafe environment. As a result, 13 U.S. service members were killed by a terrorist attack on Aug. 26, 2021 — the deadliest day for the U.S. military in Afghanistan since 2012. Previous investigations and analyses have pointed to a systemic failure spanning the last four presidential administrations and concluded that Biden and Trump share the heaviest blame.

Live: Biden addresses UN General Assembly for final time	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden will deliver remarks before the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday as the body gathers for its annual session in New York City. It will be the last time Biden addresses the U.N. as president, having withdrawn from the November presidential race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. His remarks come as Secretary-General António Guterres has called the world a 'powder keg' and said the current situation, including geopolitical divides, climate change, inequality, ongoing wars and threats from nuclear weapons, is unsustainable. JD Vance, Tim Walz prep for debate that could influence tight race But, he said, 'the challenges we face are solvable' if the international community confronts the uncertainty of unmanaged risks, the inequality that underlies injustices and grievances and the impunity that undermines international law and the U.N.‘s founding principles. 'Today, a growing number of governments and others feel entitled to a 'get out of jail free’ card,' he said in a reference to the classic board game Monopoly. The gathering is set to begin after hundreds were reported killed following Israeli strikes on Lebanon. Israel has ramped up attacks on Hezbollah in recent days, raising the risk that the war in Gaza, now nearly a year long, could spiral into a wider regional conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is one of the leaders set to address the U.N. this week, as is Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also set to address the U.N. as his country continues to fight back against Russian invasion in another ongoing war.

JD Vance, Tim Walz prep for debate that could influence tight rac...	(NewsNation) — Vice presidential candidates Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will go head-to-head in one week. Without a second presidential debate on the books, the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate could be the last chance either campaign has to sway crucial undecided voters. CBS News will moderate the debate in New York City. The last time a vice presidential debate drew more viewers than a presidential debate was in 2008 when then-Sen. Joe Biden faced off with then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Where are Trump, Harris, JD Vance and Tim Walz campaigning today? How are JD Vance, Tim Walz preparing for the vice presidential debate? Both Vance and Walz are deep in debate preparation when they’re off the campaign trail. Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., will stand in for Walz as part of Vance’s debate prep, while Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will play Vance’s role during Walz’s preparations. Independent and more moderate voters may decide the November election, meaning both candidates may try to paint their opponent as extreme. What are JD Vance's, Tim Walz's strategies going into the debate? The latest polling from Decision Desk HQ and The Hill suggests a close race, with Harris having a 3.6-point lead over Trump as of Tuesday. Harris has about a 2-point lead in key battleground states. Amid a neck and neck race, anything the vice presidential candidates say at the debate stands to make an impact. Vance will likely try to tie Harris closely to the Biden administration and convince voters they’re no better off since Biden and Harris entered the White House. He’s also likely to talk about the number of migrants entering the U.S. under the current administration. As for Walz, the governor will likely mention Vance's comments about 'childless cat ladies' and paint him as a threat to reproductive rights. Melania Trump to sit for interview on ‘Fox &amp; Friends’ Why the debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz matters This will be the last time candidates from either party will face off on a debate stage unless Trump agrees to an Oct. 23 CNN debate. The Democratic National Committee launched new billboards showing Trump dressed as a chicken and accusing him of being too scared to debate Harris, who accepted the debate invitation this week. 'I've done two,' Trump said. 'Had Biden and, after that, he had to drop out. He shouldn't have dropped out, to be honest. He got 14 million votes. She got none.' On Saturday, Trump said it was too late for another debate since early voting has already started in some states. However, Trump previously debated in October both against Biden in 2020 and Hillary Clinton in 2016.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/walz-vance-vice-presidential-debate-prep/	2024-09-24T05:13:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Vance-Walz_Matt-Freed-and-Julia-Nikhinson-AP.png?w=900
Florida dad turns in son after school shooting threat, police say	(NewsNation) — A 10-year-old Florida boy is in custody after his father turned in him for threatening to open fire at a school, police said. The investigation began Wednesday when officials at Wakulla High School were alerted to a social media threat after the school day ended, the Wakulla County Sherriff's Office said in a post on Facebook. A student told a school resource officer of a Snapchat conversation they had with another person who said, 'Yes I’m finna Shoot up your school It’s yalls last day.' The sheriff's office located south of Tallahassee enlisted the help of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's cybercrimes unit to identify the person who allegedly made the threat, and deputies interviewed the boy Thursday at his home in neighboring Leon County. After police obtained an arrest warrant, the boy's father turned him in, according to the sheriff's office. The agency told school officials Thursday morning there was no threat to Wakulla High School or any other school in the district. The 10-year-old faces a charge of making a written or electronic threat to kill, do bodily injury, or conduct a mass shooting or an act of terrorism. Is parent of teen driver in fatal crash responsible for the crime? Florida school shooting threat is latest this year The arrest in Florida comes less than a month after two students and two teachers died in a shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia, where students are returning to class Tuesday. Police say 14-year-old student Colt Gray slipped out of math class on the morning of Sept. 4 with an AR-15-style rifle given to him by his father. Within minutes, sounds of gunshots rippled across the hall and students crouched behind desks as teachers barricaded classroom doors. Within two days of the shooting, Gray was charged with four counts of murder, and his father with related charges. Officials say Gray shot and killed Christian Angulo and Mason Schermerhorn, both 14, and teachers Richard Aspinwall, the 39-year-old football coach, and Cristina Irimie, 53. Another teacher and eight other students were injured. Elsewhere in Florida, a string of hoax threats has prompted a sheriff to begin shaming the alleged juvenile suspects on social media. Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood said he’s tired of the hoaxes targeting students, disrupting schools and sapping law enforcement resources. In social media posts, Chitwood has warned parents that if their kids are arrested for making threats, he’ll make sure the public knows. Chitwood recently posted the full name and mug shot of an 11-year-old boy who allegedly threatened to carry out a school shooting. While many praised Chitwood online, the sheriff's tactics sparked criticism from some who say the weight of the responsibility should fall on the boy's parents. Under Florida law, juvenile court records are generally exempt from public release — but not if the child is charged with a felony, as in this case. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs may have stopped eating in jail: Former inmate Parents charged over children's actions The charges against Colt Gray's father resemble a case in Michigan where the parents of Ethan Crumbley were convicted of manslaughter after their son shot and killed classmates at Oxford High School in 2021. Prosecutors said during the separate trials of Jennifer and James Crumbley that the parents were grossly negligent when they failed to tell Oxford High School officials that the family had guns, including a 9 mm handgun that was used by their son at a shooting range just a few days earlier. Besides knowledge of the gun, the Crumbleys are accused of ignoring their son’s mental health needs. In a journal found by police in his backpack, the son wrote his parents wouldn’t listen to his pleas for help. In another case in Virginia, Deja Taylor, the mother of a 6-year-old boy who shot his first grade teacher at school, was sentenced to two years in prison after she pleaded guilty to one felony count of child neglect. In states like California and Illinois, strict 'safe storage' laws require firearms to be securely locked away, especially in homes with minors. Failure to do so can result in criminal charges if the weapon is accessed and used in an act of violence. Trial attorney Mercedes Colwin says parents are contemplating their own freedom when they weigh the decision on whether to speak up. 'They're afraid,' Colwin told NewsNation. 'They're afraid of the penalties. They're afraid of the criminal charges. They're afraid of the process.' Critics of these arrests and charges, meanwhile, argue that while parental responsibility is important, the root cause of gun violence — easy access to firearms — must be addressed. They’re calling for stricter gun control measures and federal legislation on safe storage.

World leaders meet under shadow of global divisions, 3 wars and p...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — World leaders will open their annual meeting at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday under the shadow of increasing global divisions, major wars in Gaza, Ukraine and, Sudan and the threat of an even larger conflict in the wider Middle East. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres previewed his opening 'State of the World' speech to presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and ministers at Sunday’s 'Summit of the Future,' saying 'our world is heading off the rails — and we need tough decisions to get back on track.' He pointed to conflicts 'raging and multiplying, from the Middle East to Ukraine and Sudan, with no end in sight' and to the global security system, which he said is 'threatened by geopolitical divides, nuclear posturing, and the development of new weapons and theaters of war.' He also cited huge inequalities, the lack of an effective global system to respond to emerging and even existential threats, and the devastating impact of climate change. Biden will appear as president for the final time One notable moment at Tuesday’s opening assembly meeting: U.S. President Joe Biden’s likely final major appearance on the world stage, a platform he has tred upon for decades. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters last week that the U.S. focus in the assembly will be on ending 'the scourge of war,' lamenting that roughly 2 billion people live in conflict-affected areas. 'The most vulnerable around the world are counting on us to make progress, to make change, to bring about a sense of hope for them,' she said. Among other speakers on opening day are Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Iran’s new President Masoud Pezeshkian. The Iranian leader accused Israel on Monday of seeking a wider war in the Middle East and laying 'traps' to lead his country into a broader conflict. He pointed to the deadly explosions of pagers, walkie-talkies and other electronic devices in Lebanon last week, which he blamed on Israel, and the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, hours after Pezeshkian’s inauguration. 'We don’t want to fight,' the Iranian president said. 'It’s Israel that wants to drag everyone into war and destabilize the region. … They are dragging us to a point where we do not wish to go.' Iran supports both Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants. Pushing the principle that ‘right makes might’ International Rescue Committee President David Miliband recalled that at the San Francisco conference in 1945 where the U.N. was established, then-U.S. President Harry Truman pleaded with delegates to reject the premise that 'might makes right' and reverse it to 'right makes might,' which was enshrined in the U.N. Charter. 'Almost 80 years later, we have seen the terrible consequences of the failure to flip this equation,' Miliband said. 'In contexts like Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, might is making right.' Facing mounting global humanitarian needs, unchecked conflict, unmitigated climate change and growing extreme poverty, Miliband challenged world leaders asking: 'How will you strengthen, not weaken, the principles of the U.N. Charter for the next 80 years?' The assembly’s annual meeting, which ends on Sept. 30, followed the two-day Summit of the Future, which adopted a blueprint aimed at bringing the world’s increasing divided nations together to tackle the challenges of the 21st century from conflicts and climate change to artificial intelligence and women's rights. The 42-page 'Pact for the Future' challenges leaders of the 193 U.N. member nations to turn promises into real actions that make a difference to the lives of the world’s more than 8 billion people. 'We are here to bring multilateralism back from the brink,' Guterres said. By adopting the pact, leaders unlocked the door, he said. 'Now it is our common destiny to walk through it. That demands not just agreement, but action.' Leaders embroiled in conflicts will speak At last year’s U.N. global gathering, Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, took center stage. But as the first anniversary of Hamas’ deadly attack in southern Israel approaches on Oct. 7, the spotlight is certain to be on the war in Gaza and escalating violence across the Israeli-Lebanon border, which is now threatening to spread to the wider Middle East. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is scheduled to speak Thursday morning and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday afternoon. Zelenskyy will get the spotlight twice. He will speak Tuesday afternoon at a high-level meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by the United States, France, Japan, Malta, South Korea and Britain, whose foreign ministers are expected to attend. He will also address the General Assembly on Wednesday morning. ___ Edith M. Lederer, chief U.N. correspondent for The Associated Press, has been covering global affairs for more than 50 years.

Watch live: One of Titan submersible owner's top officials to tes...	One of the top officials with the company that owned the experimental submersible that imploded en route to the wreckage of the Titanic is scheduled to testify in front of the Coast Guard on Tuesday. Amber Bay, OceanGate's former director of administration, is one of the key witnesses Tuesday. OceanGate co-founder Stockton Rush was among the five people who died when the submersible imploded in June 2023. The Coast Guard opened a public hearing earlier this month that is part of a high level investigation into the cause of the implosion. Some of the testimony has focused on the troubled nature of the company. The co-founder of the company told the Coast Guard panel Monday that he hoped a silver lining of the disaster is that it will inspire a renewed interest in exploration, including the deepest waters of the world’s oceans. Businessman Guillermo Sohnlein, who helped found OceanGate with Rush, ultimately left the company before the Titan disaster. 'This can’t be the end of deep ocean exploration. This can’t be the end of deep-diving submersibles and I don’t believe that it will be,' said Sohnlein. Earlier in the hearing, former OceanGate operations director David Lochridge said he frequently clashed with Rush and felt the company was committed only to making money. 'The whole idea behind the company was to make money,' Lochridge testified. 'There was very little in the way of science.' Sohnlein said Monday he had the opportunity to dive in Titan 'many times' and he declined. He said his reasons included not wanting to take space away from potential customers. He also said when Rush reached a point when it was 'time to put a human in there,' he wanted to do it himself. Rush felt it was his design and said 'if anything happens, I want it to impact me,' Sohnlein said. But Lochridge and other previous witnesses painted a picture of a troubled company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident set off a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration. The hearing is expected to run through Friday and include several more witnesses, some of whom were closely connected to the company. Coast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice. That and Titan’s unusual design subjected it to scrutiny in the undersea exploration community. OceanGate, based in Washington state, suspended its operations after the implosion. The company has no full-time employees currently, but has been represented by an attorney during the hearing. During the submersible’s final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts about Titan’s depth and weight as it descended. The support ship Polar Prince then sent repeated messages asking if Titan could still see the ship on its onboard display. One of the last messages from Titan’s crew to Polar Prince before the submersible imploded stated, 'all good here,' according to a visual re-creation presented earlier in the hearing. When the submersible was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said. No one on board survived. OceanGate said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began. Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/missing-titanic-tourist-submarine/ap-one-of-titan-submersible-owners-top-officials-to-testify-before-the-coast-guard/	2024-09-23T21:05:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f23bf9d4b941.13730100.jpeg?w=900

Diddy may have stopped eating in jail: Former inmate	(NewsNation) — Former inmate Larry Levine tells 'Banfield' that a source close to the Sean 'Diddy' Combs investigation believes the entertainment mogul may not be eating in jail because he is 'paranoid' and 'scared.' 'There's people out there that he has things on that do have a substantial amount of money. Imagine if someone paid someone off on the inside to actually poison his food, give him a heart attack and he dies, and no one would really think anything of it,' Levine said. 'So that may be one of the reasons he's not eating.' Other possibilities include a hunger strike or just bad food, according to Levine. He said the food at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center includes 'a lot of carbohydrates' and is incredibly bland. Who is Kristina Khorram, Diddy’s former chief of staff? 'There's mold in a lot of that food, the food coming to him is cold. It's not coming to him warm like it would be in a regular housing unit, because they feed the people in the shoe last,' Levine added. 'Maybe he got sick from the food. That's another possibility.' Levine said Diddy has been in touch with his kids, a dietitian, a lawyer and a minister during his first week of pretrial detention. Diddy's allegations, arrest Diddy is accused of using his music empire to engage in sex trafficking and accused of having a pattern of abusing women. He was arrested Sept. 16 after months of allegations and a federal raid on two of his properties. He pleaded not guilty in New York court the next day. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits: timeline Both his bids to bail out of jail have been rejected, leaving him in MDC Brooklyn for the foreseeable future. Diddy at MDC Brooklyn There are 1,218 people at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is located in the Eastern New York Judicial District, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Like the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the MDC is also 'plagued by chronic understaffing, constant lockdowns, outbreaks of violence, delayed access to medical care, and a rash of suicides and death,' The Daily Beast reported. 'Several courts in this District have recognized that the conditions at Metropolitan Detention Center are not fit for pre-trial detention,' Combs’ lawyers said in a motion they filed for bail Tuesday, per the news outlet. ‘People knew what goes on’ in Diddy’s after-after party: Friend Mentioned by Combs’ attorneys in their filing was a June 7 incident; Uriel Whyte, a man who had been at MDC for gun charges, was stabbed to death in the facility. Spectrum News New York reported that Whyte was awaiting trial on gun charges for two years. A second man named Edwin Cordero died after being injured in a jail fight in August. Cordero’s lawyer, The New York Times reported, wrote about the 'awful' conditions his client faced in a June letter to a federal judge. The detention center, Cordero’s lawyer said, is 'an overcrowded, understaffed and neglected federal jail that is hell on earth.' Along with the deaths this past summer, suicides and an electrical fire in 2019 that caused those in the facility to be without heat and power for days have been reported at MDC. Judges and advocates have called out the Bureau of Prisons for 'dangerous, barbaric conditions' in MDC, and pressed the agency to make improvements. What we know about the Diddy investigation In a statement to the Associated Press, the federal Bureau of Prisons said it is 'addressing the staffing and other challenges at MDC Brooklyn.'

Tren de Aragua is in cities like Chicago, but to what extent?	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — A notorious Venezuelan prison gang that has infiltrated the United States has been in Chicago for nearly a year, putting local law enforcement agencies on high alert. Tren de Aragua developed out of a Venezuelan prison and into a dangerous transnational criminal organization that focuses on sex trafficking, drugs and human smuggling. With more than 5,000 members, the gang is Venezuela's largest criminal organization that has been linked to several high-profile crimes in various parts of the U.S. The gang's presence in sanctuary cities like Chicago, Denver and New York raises concern; however, the level of their activity remains in question. What is the Tren de Aragua gang, linked to several crimes in US? Emails obtained by NewsNation from intelligence officials within the Cook County Sheriff’s Office show warnings to Chicago area law enforcement agencies about the gang’s presence as early as October of last year. The gang is described as a 'new threat developing amongst the newly arriving immigrant community,' describing Tren de Aragua as an organization that has strong human trafficking operations in Latin America and is likely engaged in sex and labor trafficking in the U.S. In one email, two officials from the sheriff’s office acknowledge discussions about the possibility that a criminal network would be operating within the migrant community and likely would 'victimize members of that population.' 'It appears we have confirmation of that now,' the email states. Tren de Aragua in sanctuary cities Along with Chicago, law enforcement in New York City and Denver have also confirmed the gang's presence. All three cities were the final destinations for buses sent by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott from the southern border filled with migrants. Robert Almonte, a former U.S. Marshal and deputy chief with the El Paso Police Department, told NewsNation that Tren de Aragua has had a U.S. presence for the past two years. Gang members have been tied to the shooting of two New York City police officers and other violent acts. Almonte said that the group's activity in sanctuary cities could be even more problematic. While many cross the border in search of a new life or to seek asylum., the Venezuelan gang travel to the cities because they already have associates to continue their criminal enterprise, Almonte said. Tren de Aragua poses ‘serious’ threat: VP of National Border Patrol Council 'If we don't get a handle on them, they're going to become a bigger problem than they are today,' Almonte said. Getting a handle on the issue, however, also presents its challenges. Gang members often have identifying tattoos such as the Nike 'Jumpman' logo and other designs specific to Tren de Aruagua, Chicago area law enforcement emails show. But at the border, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials often have difficulty separating gang members from others crossing into the U.S. because of trouble vetting those crossing the border coming from Venezuela, Almonte said Tren de Aragua's reported clash with Chicago gangs Tren de Aragua members have been linked to violent crimes, including murder, but the scope of the gang’s presence in places like Chicago has not been verified. The New York Post reported Sunday that members of the Tren de Aragua had not only moved into Chicago’s South Side but were clashing with local gang members. The report was based on interviews with former gang member Tyrone Muhammad, who spent 20 years in prison and who now runs a street patrol and violence protection program. Muhammad claims that Venezuelan gang members who arrived in the U.S. and flooded Chicago’s migrant shelters are now overtaking local apartment buildings. Chicago police investigate the scene of a shooting in Chicago. Five alleged gang members have been indicted on murder charges in last year's shooting death of Chicago rapper Carlton Weekly, also known as 'FBG Duck,' in the fashionable Gold Coast neighborhood, which prosecutors say was part of an ongoing violent effort to protect gang territories on the city's South Side. (Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune via AP, File) While Chicago law enforcement officials have confirmed that the Tren de Aragua is present in the city, it has not addressed claims made by Muhammad in the New York Post report. 'When the Black gangs here get fed up with the illegalities and criminal activities of these migrants or non-citizens, the city of Chicago is going to go up in flames and there will be nothing the National Guard or the government can do about it when the bloodshed hits the streets,' Muhammad told the newspaper. 'It’ll be blacks against migrants.' Muhammad did not respond to an interview request from NewsNation on Monday. Police investigate claims regarding Tren de Aragua In early September, a 911 call was placed claiming that 32 Venezuelan migrants had taken over an apartment complex in Chicago. The report made its way to social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and went viral after being shared by Elon Musk and others. Chicago Police Department officials investigated the claims and found no such incident took place. The alderperson for the area, Jeanette Taylor, also denied anything had happened, blaming the rumors on political motivations. 'It’s better for them to make it seem like Black and brown people fight amongst each other than for them to deal with the real issue and create real policies that make everybody safe,' Taylor said, according to the Chicago Tribune. In the suburban Denver community of Aurora, claims of Venezuelan migrants taking over an apartment building with semiautomatic long guns also went viral on social media. Police in Aurora could not confirm gang activity but said in a statement that 'they are aware that components of TdA are operating in Aurora.' The department said that it has increasingly been collecting evidence to show the gang is connected to crimes in the area. However, it said that it would be improper to make 'conclusory statements' about certain incidents. Chicago gang expert: Tren de Aragua takeover unlikely Lance Williams, a professor of educational inquiry and curriculum studies at Northeastern Illinois University and an expert on Chicago gangs, said that despite social media posts and claims to police of trouble caused by Venezuelans, his conversations with gang members in South Side neighborhoods suggest otherwise. 'I haven’t seen any substantial evidence that there was some Venezuelan gang presence in any of the hotspot neighborhoods in Chicago,' Williams told NewsNation. He added: 'I’m not saying there are no Venezuelan gangs here … but I see absolutely no gang activity and no presence of Venezuelans in the hood trying to take over anything or any conflict between African American neighborhoods and Venezuelan gangs.' 10 more dead amid reported Sinaloa Cartel infighting in Mexico Williams, whose father was a member of one of Chicago’s first Black street gangs, cites the clickbait nature of stories like what took place in Aurora, Colorado, as a driver of misinformation when it comes to Tren de Aragua’s activity in Chicago. Williams also said that individuals with political interests are often the source of information tied to the Venezuelan street gangs. Williams said that Chicago’s gang activity has shifted dramatically over the past 30 years. He said rather than large criminal organizations with hierarchal systems of leadership, the gangs that are present in neighborhoods are heavily fragmented. While conflicts may exist on a much smaller level, disputes between gangs are much different than in the past and typically don’t cross racial lines, Williams added. '(Gang) members don’t know the difference between a Venezuelan and a Mexican,' Williams said. 'So just the idea of them having conflict with Venezuelans doesn’t make sense because they don’t understand the difference between the two.' Risks of ignoring Tren de Aragua: Law enforcement expert Almonte said cities run a significant risk if they ignore the presence of Tren de Aragua. In working with local police departments, Almonte said that law enforcement should focus on neighborhoods where migrants from Venezuela are currently living. In many cases, the gang members are targeting their countrymen by extorting them and luring them into criminal activities. Almonte said if police officers are encountering members of the gang, city leaders should identify the scope of their presence and 'go after them.' 'To have a mayor or some other city official come out and deny that they're there, all they're doing is hurting their own people,' Almonte said. 'That doesn't serve any purpose. I think the reason they do that is they don't want to give their city a bad image, like 'Oh, my God, we're getting taken over by a gang.''	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/venezuelan-gang-tren-de-aragua-chicago/	2024-09-23T16:41:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/HSI-TURNS-OVER-TREN-DE-ARAGUA-MEMBER-TO-DENVER-SHERIFFS-DEPARTMENT-7-31-2024.jpg?w=900
Two more drugged children intercepted in smuggling attempt	(NewsNation) — U.S. Border Patrol agents intercepted two suspected drugged children being smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border, the second such incident in the El Centro Sector in California within days, sources within the agency exclusively confirmed to NewsNation. The incident occurred when a U.S. citizen with an extensive criminal history attempted to smuggle two Mexican children, ages 4 and 8, through the San Luis port of entry in Arizona on foot. The woman possessed Navajo birth certificates that did not belong to the children, sources said. Agents stopped the vehicle carrying the children at a Border Patrol checkpoint on Highway 86 in El Indio around 8:45 p.m. Wednesday. The children appeared drowsy, and a bottle of liquid melatonin was found next to them in the vehicle. One child is now acting as a material witness against the driver, while the other was turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. Police Cybertruck sparks excitement, scrutiny in Southern California The U.S. Attorney's Office has accepted the case for prosecution. Former Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Victor Avila told NewsNation that 'this is an SOP [standard operating procedure] of the child traffickers.' He explained that this method is used to maintain better control over the children. This incident follows a similar case in the El Centro sector just days earlier, where agents reported encountering a child who required a sternum rub to become coherent. However, no sleep aids were found in that instance. According to federal fact sheets, traffickers often target unaccompanied minors and vulnerable families, knowing that the children have no way to protect themselves. Authorities believe this tactic of sedating children is a way of making sure the children are seen but not heard by border authorities. Multiple reports of these druggings have come to light in recent weeks. Rare ‘liger’ rescued from abandoned home near US border In Arizona, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at the San Luis port of entry intercepted a woman attempting to smuggle two children across the border on Aug. 29. The children, aged 8 and 11, had also been sedated. The woman, an American citizen, presented birth certificates that didn’t belong to the children. The suspect was arrested and the children were turned over to authorities. And in Laredo, Texas, a 23-year-old woman has pleaded guilty to smuggling a toddler across the border, sedating her with melatonin gummies and using a fraudulent birth certificate just days ago. That suspect was part of a child smuggling operation that targeted young children under 5 years old. Members of the smuggling ring pretended to be related to the children when crossing the border, a common tactic. Weapons found on Mexico side of border: Border Patrol alert A recent House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs report said that as many as three in 10 children had no familial relationship whatsoever to the adults that claimed them. During the Trump administration, DNA testing was used to verify familial relationships at the border in an effort to crack down on smugglers posing as family members. While the DNA testing program ended during the Biden administration, some tests are still being conducted for specific age groups of migrants during their appointments with CBP One.

US troops deployed to Middle East after Israeli strike on Lebanon	(NewsNation) — More than 270 people were killed in Lebanon after Israeli airstrikes on Monday, making it the deadliest day for the country since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. A small number of U.S. troops have now been deployed to the Middle East in response to the violence, which has raised people's fears of a greater regional war. The United States already has an aircraft carrier in the region, but at this time, officials have no plan to send another one. Officials from the Biden administration as well as lawmakers have been worried for weeks now about the situation in the area escalating. Officials wanted Ohio train derailment to ‘go away,’ expert tells NewsNation Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad told a news conference in Beirut Monday that the Israeli military's attacks hit hospitals, medical centers and ambulances. Government officials ordered schools and universities to close across most of Lebanon and began preparing shelters for people displaced from the south. In a recorded message Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Lebanese civilians to heed calls to evacuate, saying that once the operation is finished, they could come back to their homes. 'I have a message for the people of Lebanon,' he said. 'Israel's war is not with you, it's with Hezbollah.' However, Lebanon's information minister, Ziad Makary, said in a statement his office had received one of these messages, telling people to leave the building. These warnings come 'in the framework of the psychological war implemented by the enemy,' Makary said, telling people 'not to give the matter more attention than it deserves.' Israeli military officials, claiming they are going after Hezbollah weapons sites, announced the strikes hit 800 targets. Some of these strikes, according to the Associated Press, struck residential areas of towns in the south and the eastern Bekaa Valley. One hit a wooded area as far away as Byblos in central Lebanon, more than 80 miles from the border north of Beirut. On Sunday, Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes last week that killed a top commander and fighters, as well as dozens of civilians including women and children. It is not clear whether there have been any deaths or injuries resulting from this attack. Last week, thousands of communications devices such as pagers exploded in different parts of Lebanon as part of an attack widely believed to be carried out by Israel.

Trump to speak on China buying US farmland, food supply concerns	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump is visiting western Pennsylvania on Monday to speak at an event held by the Protecting America Initiative, a nonprofit spotlighting the potential risk posed by the Chinese Communist Party to the U.S. agriculture system. If he wins in November, Trump has vowed to ban Chinese nationals from buying U.S. farmland. China being part of a marijuana foreign black market in Oklahoma and amassing farmland have been concerns for Americans this year. The latest U.S. governmental data from 2021 showed that China owns less than 1% of foreign-owned land, while Canada owns the most at over 30%. Boy abducted from California in 1951 at age 6 found alive on East Coast more than 70 years later However, China has purchased more land within the last three years. Should the Chinese Communist Party gain control over essential parts of the food supply chain, it could lead to future disruptions or manipulation of the supply of critical food resources, critics argue. Last June, the Treasury Department announced proposed new rules that would give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, the ability to block Chinese corporations from owning land near U.S. military bases.

Officials wanted Ohio train derailment to 'go away,' expert tells...	(NewsNation) — A preeminent expert on chemical exposure hired to review the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio told NewsNation in an exclusive interview that the parties involved now want the situation to go away. Days after officials in East Palestine, Ohio, burned five tankers and sent 116,000 gallons of toxic vinyl chloride over the city, the law firm Simmons Conroy hired Stephen Petty to conduct testing. Petty says the parties involved now want the situation to go away. His affidavit filed Monday is one of several statements the Government Accountability Project is issuing to the EPA Office of the Inspector General. Trump assassination suspect admitted to plot in letter: Court filing Petty is currently bound by confidentiality but said he would speak publicly about his findings if a judge called on him to testify. Until then, Petty said he must be careful about what he says while a $600 million class-action settlement is pending. 'Enough information suggests that we really ought to try to figure this out and see if everything's OK or not, and I don't think we've done that yet,' Petty said. NewsNation has been covering the East Palestine train derailment and the aftermath extensively. Find more of our coverage here. Attorneys for East Palestine residents filed a motion in August asking a federal judge to reevaluate the $600 million train derailment settlement. Their complaint focused on allegations that settlement lawyers are hiding Petty’s findings about locals’ soil and water. They argue the ruling was rushed and lawyers are in collusion with Norfolk Southern, the company whose train derailed. East Palestine train derailment In February 2023, a Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. Some 1,500 residents were told to evacuate. Fearing an explosion, officials decided to vent and burn five tank cars, releasing the carcinogen vinyl chloride into the air. Minutes later, a toxic plume of smoke smothered the region. Three days later, the Environmental Protection Agency said it hadn't detected contaminants at 'levels of concern' and gave the all-clear for residents to return. Those who did reported developing rashes and feeling ill. In March 2023, an independent testing expert confirmed residents’ fears that carcinogens undetected by the Ohio EPA were in the water. More tests revealed dioxins — the most toxic compounds on the planet — in the soil, water and people’s air filters. Today, those who remain in East Palestine and the surrounding area say their problems are getting worse. Why is Stephen Petty speaking up about East Palestine now? 'My job initially was to figure out: Was there contamination of the environment, and if so, to what extent?' Petty said. Residents have complained of rashes, respiratory issues and other ailments since the February 2023 Norfolk Southern train derailment. Eighteen months later, none of Petty’s data or analysis has been publicly available to East Palestine’s residents. He’s bound to confidentiality, but is choosing to speak out now, Petty said. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. 'I suspect there'll be some people that are unhappy because it could have an impact on a settlement where the plaintiffs have spent a lot of money,' he said. In his affidavit, Petty spoke in support of Scott Smith — another scientist who has been testing in East Palestine. Smith has found elevated levels of dioxins and sounded the alarm for residents. The EPA has tried to label Smith as a fake scientist and so has the settlement attorneys' team. Scott Smith tested soil and water dioxins two weeks after tanker cars tipped over and chemicals in the damaged railcars were deliberately burned for safety reasons in East Palestine, Ohio. Photo courtesy: Scott Smith 'I wanted to support Mr. Smith because I think he's being smeared and I don't think it's appropriate,' Petty said, adding that he believes the data Smith has reported so far is accurate. A decade earlier, Mark Durno, the EPA coordinator in East Palestine, had only praise for Smith’s work in Flint, Michigan. 'He certainly understands environmental sampling,' Durno said at the time. 'He certainly understands how to use appropriate laboratories… from that perspective he seems qualified to collect samples and share data.' The scrutiny Smith faces now is unfair Petty said. 'It is one of the few times where I've been involved, where I don't think that the information that should get out there is getting out there,' he said. Invasive stink bugs are back: What to do about them A video of a local toxicologist that plaintiff attorneys brought in to make their case for settlement also compelled Petty to speak. 'There will not be any long-term health impact of chemical exposure from the derailment to community members of East Palestine,' the toxicologist, Dr. Arch Carson, said. Petty interpreted the comments as a 'PR sort of event' and said it’s too early to declare there won’t be long-term health impacts. 'What troubled me was that if he's going to make those statements, then bring the receipts on the exposure analysis and show me the exposure analysis that says we have no issues,' Petty said. He believes Carson was bought in to encourage a settlement. Petty also criticized the EPA for its handling of the derailment and the aftermath. That includes a decision to allow residents to return three days later. 'They're not being transparent in what they know because they're not providing the raw data from the lab to my knowledge,' Petty said. 'And they're taking that raw data and summarizing it in a way that's misleading.' What does Petty want to happen? Petty also said something major has been overlooked. The day of the burn, the wind shifted from the northwest, and the East Palestine evacuation zone to the southeast should have been redefined based on those winds, he said. It never was. Petty also accused the EPA of testing for dioxins in the wrong places. 'Of course, they impugned me for a while, saying that I didn't know what I was doing in February,' Petty said. 'And I said, ‘Well, we have to look.’' He declined to say why he believes the EPA would might knowingly conduct testing in the wrong area, citing a confidentiality order. 'I’ve had many conversations about this…that's why I produce some very specific data just for this thing,' Petty said. 'I will just say that it's either incompetence or it's intentional.' Sunken superyacht has sensitive intelligence info aboard: Reports Petty's work was — in part — based on materials under a protective order. That means attorneys disclose certain information without violating the order. However, Petty said he would break that agreement if the judge asked him to testify. His research would add to what the public already knows 'and people can make their own decisions,' Petty said. 'If you're asking at full transparency, should it be out there along with all the other information that's out there — all the railroad stuff, all the whistleblower stuff, etc.? Yeah,' Petty said. 'Then you put it all in the pot and let people figure out what they what they think.' Neither the EPA nor the plaintiff’s attorneys have responded to NewsNation’s requests for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/ohio-train-derailment/east-palestine-exposure-experts-concerns/	2024-09-23T09:00:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/01/65bad11cc2a844.21820508.jpeg?w=900
Inside a DEA drug vault that stores seized fentanyl pills	(NEXSTAR) -- The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) plays an essential role in the fight against fentanyl. When agents seize drugs, the evidence gets sent to a DEA lab for testing. The agency reports more than 70% of illicit drugs seized are laced with fentanyl. All drugs seized by federal agencies from five states are sent to a DEA lab in Dallas, Texas to be tested. 'Our vault processes it and stores it until it's time for our forensic chemist to analyze it. And our forensic chemists determine the content of the evidence, as well as sometimes the purity of it,' DEA Laboratory Assistant Director Jamie Vasquez said. Permanent truck ban at El Paso port of entry proposed Vasquez said the number one drug that they see is methamphetamine, followed by cocaine, fentanyl and heroin. 'It has changed drastically over the last five years. We've gone from submissions of 3% fentanyl to now close to 20% of what we see contains some sort of fentanyl,' Vasquez said. The DEA acts as the first line of defense against drugs coming across the border. 'The key number is 70%. You have to know that 70% of these pills right now could kill, it could be an overdose,' Special DEA Agent Daniel Comeaux said. 'It's all about money. It’s about the dollar bill. It’s about greed. And that's who we are going after.' Comeaux, who is with the DEA’s Houston Division, said drug cartels are mass producing synthetic fentanyl with deadly precision. 'So, you might have even someone as young as a middle schooler saying, well I heard about the Xanax. So let me take the Xanax one time just to get a high effect. And they take one of these fake pills, and they end up dead. 70% of these pills contain a lethal dose,' Comeaux said. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Wherever they are, we are too now,' Comeaux said. He urged parents to talk to their kids about the dangers of fentanyl.

Ryan Routh, suspect in Trump assassination attempt, due in court	(NewsNation) — Prosecutors on Monday will argue to keep the man charged in an apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump behind bars while he awaits trial. Ryan Routh, 58, will appear in federal court on a pair of gun charges. Investigators say he pointed a rifle through a tree line Sept. 15 at Trump’s West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course while the former president and GOP presidential nominee was playing. It’s the second apparent assassination attempt against Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign season. Trump given handcuffs used on alleged would-be assassin: Sheriff What is Ryan Routh charged with? Routh is charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. A conviction of each charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He has not yet entered a plea. U.S. prosecutors may reveal new details about the investigation at Monday’s hearing, where they’re expected to argue that Routh poses a danger to public safety and must remain in jail. What is Ryan Routh accused of? Unlike the gunman behind the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, Routh isn’t accused of firing a weapon. He was about 400-500 yards away from the former president, crouched in bushes near the golf club perimeter and armed with a weapon that had a scope, according to investigators. Trump was not within his line of sight. Boy abducted from California in 1951 at age 6 found alive on East Coast more than 70 years later The situation began about 1:30 p.m. local time when authorities received a call reporting shots fired at the golf course where Trump was playing. Those shots came from a U.S. Secret Service agent who spotted a rifle sticking through the fence. A witness told police the suspect fled the scene in a black Nissan, which police located and stopped about 45 miles north of the golf course. Martin County Sheriff William D. Snyder told WPTV the man 'was not armed when we took him out of the car.'

Israel warns civilians to evacuate as it strikes wide swaths of s...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel on Monday urged residents of southern Lebanon to evacuate from homes and other buildings where it claimed Hezbollah has stored weapons, saying the military would conduct 'extensive strikes' against the militant group. It was the first warning of its kind in nearly a year of steadily escalating conflict and came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire on Sunday. Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters. There was no sign of an immediate exodus from the villages of southern Lebanon, and the warning left open the possibility that some residents could live in or near targeted structures without knowing that they are risk. The increasing strikes and counterstrikes have raised fears of an all-out war, even as Israel is still battling Hamas in Gaza and trying to return scores of hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Hezbollah has vowed to continue its strikes in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel says it is committed to returning calm to its northern border. Associated Press journalists in southern Lebanon reported heavy airstrikes targeting many areas Monday morning, including some far from the border. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said the strikes hit a forested area in the central province of Byblos, about 130 kilometers (81 miles) north of the Israeli-Lebanese border, for the first time since the exchanges began in October. No injuries were reported there. Israel also bombed targets in the northeastern Baalbek and Hermel regions, where a shepherd was killed and two family members were wounded, according to the news agency. It said a total of 30 people were wounded in strikes. The Lebanese Health Ministry asked hospitals in southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa valley to postpone surgeries that could be done later. The ministry said in a statement that its request aimed to keep hospitals ready to deal with people wounded by 'Israel’s expanding aggression on Lebanon.' An Israeli military official said Israel is focused on aerial operations and has no immediate plans for a ground operation. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with regulations, said the strikes are aimed at curbing Hezbollah's ability to launch more strikes into Israel. Lebanese media reported that residents received text messages urging them to move away from any building where Hezbollah stores arms until further notice. 'If you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice,' the Arabic message reads, according to Lebanese media. Lebanon's information minister, Ziad Makary, said in a statement that his office in Beirut had received a recorded message telling people to leave the building. 'This comes in the framework of the psychological war implemented by the enemy,' Makary said, and urged people 'not to give the matter more attention than it deserves.' It was not immediately clear how many people would be affected by the Israeli orders. Communities on both sides of the border have largely emptied out because of the near-daily exchanges of fire. Israel has accused Hezbollah of transforming entire communities in the south into militant bases, with hidden rocket launchers and other infrastructure. That could lead the Israeli military to wage an especially heavy bombing campaign, even if no ground forces move in. The military said it had targeted more than 150 militant sites early Monday. Residents of different villages in southern Lebanon posted photos on social media of airstrikes and large plumes of smoke. The state-run National News Agency also reported airstrikes on different areas. An Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday killed a top Hezbollah military commander and more than a dozen fighters, as well as dozens of civilians, including women and children. Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000. Lebanon blamed Israel for the attacks, but Israel did not confirm or deny any responsibility. Hezbollah began firing into Israel a day after the Oct. 7 attack in what it said was an attempt to pin down Israeli forces to help Palestinian fighters in Gaza. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict has steadily intensified over the past year. The fighting has killed hundreds of people in Lebanon, dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. It has also sparked brush fires that have destroyed agriculture and scarred the landscape. Israel has vowed to push Hezbollah back from the border so its citizens can return to their homes, saying it prefers to do so diplomatically but is willing to use force. Hezbollah has said it will keep up its attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but that appears increasingly elusive as the war nears its anniversary. Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after most of the rest were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. Israel's offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. It says women and children make up a little over half of those killed. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut.

People knew what goes on' in Diddy's after-after party: Friend	(NewsNation) — A radio personality and former associate of Sean 'Diddy' Combs said that people in the music industry were generally aware of what happened at the more exclusive 'after after' parties that the hip-hop mogul was known for hosting. DJ Steph Lova of Baltimore's Magic 95.9, who attended Howard University with Combs and worked at a New York radio station during his rise to prominence, said she was unaware of the alleged 'freakoffs' or illegal activities. 'The freakoffs ... that's all new to me,' Lova said Sunday on 'NewsNation Prime.' She added that while Combs was known for throwing parties, 'All the stuff that happened after the actual party, those were private invites.' 'You had to be kind of with the sugar, honey, iced tea ... people knew what goes on at the after-after party. It's just a matter if you know you want to get down like that. This is the music business ... it's not for the weak,' Lova said. Kathryn Crosby, actor and widow of Bing Crosby, dies at 90 Combs was arrested last week in Manhattan on federal charges including racketeering, sex trafficking and prostitution. These charges come amid several civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual abuse and other misconduct. And the charges follow raids on his properties where authorities reportedly found evidence of drug-fueled sex parties and weapons. Lova said she was shocked at the music mogul's arrest, calling the situation 'unbelievable' given his rise to fame and philanthropic efforts. Regarding the music industry's muted response to the allegations, Lova suggested that many might be concerned about potential evidence. 'A lot of them might be on them tapes,' she said, referring to reported recordings seized by authorities. Lova speculated that recent departures of music industry executives might be connected to fears of being implicated. 'People should be nervous. They should be very cautious,' she added. YouTube ads will now play even when your video is paused Dawn Richard has faced backlash after suing Diddy: Attorney The attorney for a woman suing Combs says recent federal charges against the music mogul have been 'validating' for his client. Arick Fudali, representing singer Dawn Richard in a civil lawsuit against Combs, told NewsNation that the similarities between his client's allegations and the federal indictment are 'striking.' 'Seeing that has been very encouraging and validating for our client,' Fudali said Sunday on 'NewsNation Prime.' Richard was a member of Diddy’s Danity Kane and Dirty Money groups. TV setting makes movies look bad: How to turn it off Richard's lawsuit, filed days before Combs' arrest, accuses the rapper of sexual battery, sexual harassment and false imprisonment. Fudali emphasized that his client's primary goal is 'accountability and justice,' not financial gain. 'We specifically and intentionally did not put a dollar amount in our civil complaint,' Fudali stated. 'For her, it's really about justice, it's really about accountability, and it's really about also inspiring and empowering others.' Fudali said Richard was inspired to come forward after Cassie Ventura, Combs' former girlfriend, filed her own lawsuit. That suit was settled one day after filing. Combs has denied all allegations against him. His defense attorney has characterized some of the alleged threats as a 'lover's spat,' a description Fudali strongly disputes. Fudali said that Richard 'has faced some online backlash' for coming forward with her lawsuit against Combs. 'So it's very brave of her, and very difficult because anytime someone is brave enough to sue or to bring charges or allegations against someone as powerful and prominent as Mr. Combs, you face backlash,' Fudali said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/people-knew-diddys-after-after-party-friend/	2024-09-22T19:37:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/6560e2e3c60089.94514980.jpeg?w=900
Human traffickers drugging kids crossing southern border: Officia...	(NewsNation) — A U.S. Border Patrol chief is calling the discovery of a child dosed with sleep aids by a human trafficker in El Centro, California, 'criminal actions so horrendous they defy human decency.' The traffickers allegedly drugged the child to prevent them talking to agents at the border, just one instance of the dangerous tactics being used to exploit children at the U.S.-Mexico border. Sometimes we encounter criminal actions so horrendous they defy human decency.The #PremierSector rescued this child from a trafficker who heavily dosed him w/ sleep aids to prevent him from talking to agents. Scarier still is the trafficker had birth certificates for more kids. pic.twitter.com/coQHTYBEiB&mdash; USBP Chief Patrol Agent Gregory K. Bovino (@USBPChiefELC) September 20, 2024 According to federal fact sheets, traffickers often target unaccompanied minors and vulnerable families, knowing that the children have no way to protect themselves. And authorities believe this tactic of sedating children is a way of making sure the children are seen, but not heard, by border authorities. Rival Sinaloa cartel factions fighting after US arrests leaders Multiple reports of these druggings have come to light in recent weeks. In Arizona, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at the San Luis Port of Entry intercepted a woman attempting to smuggle two children across the border on Aug. 29. The children, aged 8 and 11, had also been sedated. The woman, an American citizen, presented birth certificates that didn’t belong to the children. The suspect was arrested and the children were turned over to authorities. And in Laredo, Texas, a 23-year-old woman has pleaded guilty to smuggling a toddler across the border, sedating her with melatonin gummies and using a fraudulent birth certificate just days ago. That suspect was part of a child smuggling operation that targeted young children under 5 years old. Members of the smuggling ring pretended to be related to the children when crossing the border, a common tactic. Denver, Chicago change migrant plans citing fewer border encounters A recent House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs report said that as many as three in 10 children had no familial relationship whatsoever to the adults that claimed them. During the Trump administration, DNA testing was used to verify familial relationships at the border, in an effort to crack down on smugglers posing as family members. While the DNA testing program ended during the Biden administration, some tests are still being conducted for specific age groups of migrants during their appointments with CBP One.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/human-traffickers-drug-kids-border/	2024-09-22T17:10:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/calexico-border-barrier.png?w=617
Key staffers exit Mark Robinson campaign for NC governor in wake ...	RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN/AP) -- Just days after a CNN report outlining evidence that North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson made disturbing posts on a pornography website's message board more than a decade ago, several key people in the Republican's campaign for governor stepped down, his campaign announced Sunday afternoon. Conrad Pogorzelski III, general consultant and senior advisor; Chris Rodriguez, campaign manager; Heather Whillier, finance director; and Jason Rizk, deputy campaign manager have stepped down from their roles with the campaign, a news release said just after 5 p.m. In his first public appearance since Thursday's CNN report, Robinson spent several minutes Saturday evening speaking and leading a prayer at the Fayetteville Motor Speedway. He didn’t mention the CNN report or answer questions from reporters on hand. NC Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson speaks to supporters in Fayetteville amid major controversy The Sunday campaign announcement did not elaborate on the departure of the senior staffers only saying they 'stepped down.' In Sunday's announcement, the campaign said new staffing would be released 'soon.' Robinson also included comments in the news release Sunday. 'I appreciate the efforts of these team members who have made the difficult choice to step away from the campaign, and I wish them well in their future endeavors. I look forward to announcing new staff roles in the coming days,' the news release said. On Saturday night, Robinson spoke to an apparently supportive crowd at the speedway just south of Fayetteville in Cumberland County. 'We’re going to focus on the issues that you are concerned with,' Robinson said. 'While everybody else wants to focus on the garbage, and the trash that tries to besmirch people, we’re out here telling people about what we want to do, how we want to partner with you to make this state better and help North Carolina be better.' Robinson earlier denied writing the posts, which include lewd and racist comments, saying Thursday that he wouldn’t be forced out of the race by 'salacious tabloid lies.' He directed his focus to other issues on Saturday. 'We’re going to work our butts off to make sure that we build an economy in this state that works for everybody,' Robinson said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/key-staffers-exit-mark-robinson-campaign-for-nc-governor-in-wake-of-report-about-online-posts/	2024-09-22T14:59:53-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/MARK-ROBINSON-IN-HUNTERSVILLE.jpg?w=900
Johnson rolls out plan B to avert government shutdown	House GOP leaders on Sunday unveiled a plan to keep the government funded for three months after Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-La.) opening gambit to avoid a shutdown failed due to opposition from Republicans. The continuing resolution (CR), which was the result of bipartisan negotiations in the House and Senate, would keep the government funded at current levels through Dec. 20 — setting up a holiday funding fight. The three-month time frame is shorter than Johnson's opening offer of a six-month stopgap, and the bill notably excludes a Trump-backed measure requiring proof of citizenship to vote. Republican leaders are aiming to bring the bill up under a regular rule process, with a floor vote on the legislation by Wednesday, according to GOP aides. It would then head to the Senate ahead of the Sept. 30 shutdown deadline. Johnson warned Republicans against a shutdown in a 'Dear Colleague' letter on Sunday. 'While this is not the solution any of us prefer, it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances. As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice,' Johnson said, citing a McLaughlin &amp; Associates survey that found two-thirds of likely voters oppose a government shutdown. The bill also includes $231 million for the Secret Service, which has again come under scrutiny in the wake of an apparent second assassination attempt against former President Trump. Johnson outlined the legislation to GOP lawmakers in his letter Sunday, saying: 'Since we fell a bit short of the goal line, an alternative plan is now required.' The Speaker added that the clean, three-month CR is intended 'to prevent the Senate from jamming us with a bill loaded with billions in new spending and unrelated provisions,' and that the legislation is 'a very narrow, bare-bones CR including only the extensions that are absolutely necessary.' House Republicans will almost certainly need help from Democrats to pass the legislation. Many GOP lawmakers are expected to oppose the bill because of the lack of spending cuts, shorter time frame and exclusion of the voting bill, which hard-line conservatives and Trump pushed to be part of the final product. Bringing the bill up under regular order, rather than fast-tracking it, could present a hurdle as it means the measure will need to clear a procedural vote. Such votes on rules, which govern the debate over a bill, are traditionally party-line affairs regardless of lawmakers' views on the underlying legislation. Throughout this Congress, however, hard-line conservatives have voted against rules to protest legislation they disagree with, opposition that, if large enough, could block the bill from being considered in the House. The roughly three-month timeline is the duration preferred by Democrats and GOP defense hawks. Conservatives, on the other hand, sought a longer stopgap through spring to lessen chances of a massive end-of-year omnibus spending package, and to potentially allow Trump more input regarding fiscal 2025 funding if he wins in November. In a press call ahead of the stopgap text’s release, House GOP leadership aides said that the three-month timeline 'does not necessarily mean we will be doing an omnibus in December' — hinting at another funding battle after the election. The short-term spending bill is Republican leadership’s latest attempt at avoiding an Oct. 1 government shutdown after Johnson’s opening salvo in the spending talks failed last week. Fourteen GOP lawmakers joined with the overwhelming majority of Democrats to torpedo a six-month CR coupled with the voting bill, dubbed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act — dealing a blow to Johnson. Johnson, nonetheless, has stressed that the six-month CR-plus-SAVE Act was the right 'play call.' It was intended to put the focus on Democrats’ stance on voting issues and be an initial offer for negotiations, even though Republicans knew the Democratic-controlled Senate and White House would never approve it. Democrats note that noncitizen voting is already illegal and exceedingly rare, and worry about burdening eligible voters. Trump also seemed to complicate matters when he called on Republicans in Congress to not pass any CR, forcing a shutdown, unless Democrats approve the SAVE Act. But Republicans overwhelmingly say a shutdown would hurt them in November. Johnson, who has talked to the former president about the funding issues, said Friday that Trump 'understands the situation' House Republicans are in. Democratic leaders in both chambers lauded the proposed CR, while slamming Johnson and Republicans for their attempt to pass the partisan stopgap last week. 'As a result of a bipartisan and bicameral process recently underway, the continuing resolution currently under consideration is now consistent with the spending levels agreed upon in the Bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act. It is also devoid of any partisan, right-wing policy changes that House Republicans inappropriately attempted to jam into the appropriations legislation,' House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.'Upon our return to Washington, House Democrats will collectively evaluate the spending legislation in its entirety in advance of its consideration on the Floor.' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) noted that he began the lengthy process of originating a funding bill in the Senate, saying 'Hopefully, this vehicle will be unnecessary.' 'While I am pleased bipartisan negotiations quickly led to a government funding agreement free of cuts and poison pills, this same agreement could have been done two weeks ago. Instead, Speaker Johnson chose to follow the MAGA way and wasted precious time. As I have said throughout this process, there is only one way to get things done, with bipartisan, bicameral support,' he said. The stopgap would keep funding in line with levels last hashed out by both chambers earlier this year. It excludes $10 billion in additional funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) disaster relief fund that was previously included in House Republican’s initial six-month plan. But it does include replenishment of FEMA’s disaster relief fund. A GOP leadership aide said negotiations with Democrats about the stopgap aimed to 'keep only things that are absolutely necessary on the table and leave everything off the table.' Funding for the Virginia Class Submarine program that was included in the earlier GOP-backed plan is also missing from the stopgap, as well as additional dollars to address what the Department of Veterans Affairs has warned is a potential $12 billion shortfall facing the agency for medical care for fiscal year 2025. However, the 46-page bill also features a number of health-care extensions for the VA, including measures appropriators say would extend its authority to provide nursing care to veterans with 'service-connected disabilities,' as well as the authority for the joint Department of Defense-Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Facility Demonstration Fund. The move comes after Congress passed legislation last week to address a more immediate $3 billion shortfall for the VA, as officials warned that benefit payments for veterans were at risk of being disrupted next month absent congressional action. While the bill does include Secret Service funding, House GOP leadership aides said the funding is 'confined to help their immediate needs for campaign purposes,' as Trump and Vice President Harris enter the final stretch to Election Day. GOP leadership aides did, however, say there will be 'a number of conditions' on the funding, including meeting congressional demands as its panels, like the House task force formed to investigate the July assassination attempt against Trump, conduct oversight of the agency. The inclusion of more funding for the Secret Service comes after Congress debated whether to provide the agency with more dollars after the pair of assassination attempts against Trump. Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe earlier this month said the agency had 'immediate' and 'future needs,' adding 'we also have the necessary need to make sure that we're getting the personnel that we have, and that requires us to be able to have the funding to be able to hire more people.' Republicans on Capitol Hill, however, have been skeptical of sending more money to the agency, with some arguing that it is grappling with a manpower allocation issue, not a funding issue.

Johnson rolls out plan B to avert government shutdown	House GOP leaders on Sunday unveiled a plan to keep the government funded for three months after Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-La.) opening gambit to avoid a shutdown failed due to opposition from Republicans. The continuing resolution (CR), which was the result of bipartisan negotiations in the House and Senate, would keep the government funded at current levels through Dec. 20 — setting up a holiday funding fight. The three-month time frame is shorter than Johnson's opening offer of a six-month stopgap, and the bill notably excludes a Trump-backed measure requiring proof of citizenship to vote. Republican leaders are aiming to bring the bill up under a regular rule process, with a floor vote on the legislation by Wednesday, according to GOP aides. It would then head to the Senate ahead of the Sept. 30 shutdown deadline. Johnson warned Republicans against a shutdown in a 'Dear Colleague' letter on Sunday. 'While this is not the solution any of us prefer, it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances. As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice,' Johnson said, citing a McLaughlin &amp; Associates survey that found two-thirds of likely voters oppose a government shutdown. The bill also includes more than $231 million for the Secret Service, which has again come under scrutiny in the wake of an apparent second assassination attempt against former President Trump. Johnson outlined the legislation to GOP lawmakers in his letter Sunday, saying: 'Since we fell a bit short of the goal line, an alternative plan is now required.' The Speaker added that the clean, three-month CR is intended 'to prevent the Senate from jamming us with a bill loaded with billions in new spending and unrelated provisions,' and that the legislation is 'a very narrow, bare-bones CR including only the extensions that are absolutely necessary.' House Republicans will almost certainly need help from Democrats to pass the legislation. Many GOP lawmakers are expected to oppose the bill because of the lack of spending cuts, shorter time frame and exclusion of the voting bill, which hard-line conservatives and Trump pushed to be part of the final product. Bringing the bill up under regular order, rather than fast-tracking it, could present a hurdle as it means the measure will need to clear a procedural vote.

Trump says he will not run in 2028 if he loses in November	Former President Trump said this would be his last presidential campaign and he would not run in 2028 if he loses the race this November. In an interview on the television show Full Measure, Trump told host Sharyl Attkisson Sunday he doesn’t have any plans to run again if he loses to Vice President Harris. Harris to release new economic proposals on wealth creation, sources say 'I think that that will be, that will be it. I don’t see that at all,' he said when asked if a fourth campaign would happen. Trump is currently in the fight for his political life with Harris. After successfully winning his first election in 2016, he lost to President Biden in 2020. He reentered the race and was polling well against Biden, despite his ongoing legal battles and guilty felony conviction. Trump would be 82 by the 2028 election. Age has surrounded this campaign season, as Biden faced criticism for his age and eventually passed the torch to a new generation and Harris. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Harris has a 55 percent chance of winning. Both candidates are vying for a set of critical battleground states. New polling shows Harris has increased her support in those states after the presidential debate against Trump.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-2028-election/	2024-09-22T12:40:21-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24262024467543-e1726657352431.jpg?w=900
Harris to release new economic proposals on wealth creation, sour...	WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris plans to roll out a new set of economic policies this week that aim to help Americans build wealth and set economic incentives for businesses to aid that goal, three sources with knowledge of the matter said. The new policies, which have not been previously reported and could be announced in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, come as undecided voters continue to ask for more information about how Harris would help them economically if she were elected president in November, including those in critical swing states, the sources said. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters The rollout would follow heated debate in Democratic circles over whether releasing more economic policies so close to election day is a smart strategy. 'It's not just about affordability, it's also about showing (voters) they have a path to building wealth,' said one of the sources with direct knowledge of Harris's economic plans, adding she wanted to show Americans how they can 'get a foot in the door.' None of the sources would provide specific details on the expected new policies, and the Harris campaign would not comment on any new proposals. However, Harris' 2020 presidential run and President Joe Biden's administration included plans with similar goals. In her 2020 campaign, Harris proposed significant pay hikes for the millions of public school teachers, forcing companies to disclose their pay gap between men and women and penalizing those who are not narrowing it. The Biden and Harris administration have pushed to eliminate bias in home appraisals and use the over $700 billion federal contracting budget to buoy minority businesses. Harris has released a basket of economic policies focused on the high cost of housing, taxes, small business expenses, childcare and goods. Her plans often build on Biden's policies, like increasing the child tax credit and lifting the corporate tax rate to 28%. Campaign spokesman James Singer told Reuters that Harris 'will continue to present her opportunity economy agenda to lower costs, make housing more affordable, and spur economic growth across America.' Releasing new economic policy with less than 50 days left in a tight presidential election race could mean the new measures never reach crucial voters, some advisers acknowledge. 'Typically you'd see a campaign wrap up persuading voters by September and move to mobilizing people but this is not a typical campaign,' said a source with knowledge of the new plans, referring to Harris' jump to the top of the ticket in late July. 'We have to continue persuading and mobilizing folks at the same time until the very end.' Republican Donald Trump's economic proposals aimed at working-class Americans include eliminating taxes on tips and Social Security benefits, opening up federal lands to housing construction and deporting millions of immigrants to the country who Republicans say are driving up costs. The former president has also proposed new across-the-board tariffs on goods not made in the U.S. that could raise costs for American consumers and inflation, but that is backed by a slim majority of voters. Trump has tried to pin on Democrats inflation that popped globally as the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns eased and has made the still-high cost of groceries, particularly bacon, a rally speech staple. From 2019 to 2023, the food Consumer Price Index rose by 25%, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported. HARRIS GAINS ON ECONOMY Republicans have traditionally polled better on the economy than Democrats, and Trump beat Biden and then Harris on the topic earlier this year. Some polls, however, are shifting in her direction. A Financial Times-Michigan Ross poll this month showed 44% of registered voters trusted Harris' economic stewardship compared with 42% who backed Trump, and Reuters/IPSOS polling in August showed her narrowing the gap on the economy. The Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by half a percentage point last week, reflecting the belief that inflation risks have fallen, could lower some costs for consumers. Some Harris supporters have urged the campaign to double down on the economic message that is already out there instead of rolling out new ideas. 'My recommendation is to do more show-and-tells. Rather than address this with endless white papers, go to grocery stores and apartment buildings and more,' said Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic strategist. 'Inflation may have gone down, but the cost of living hasn't changed. Some of this is post pandemic and that still must be addressed,' she said. Others believe more economic policy is not a priority. Adam Newar, a money manager and Harris donor said 'it's a character election' and not a policy election. 'I'm not sure what more policy information actually brings to the table. She really has to continue articulating a vision, communicate that vision to people who really feel like they've been left behind,' Newar said. Many of Harris' proposals would require congressional approval, and would be unlikely to pass unless Democrats win both the House and Senate. (Reporting by Nandita Bose.

Hezbollah hits back with rockets as it declares an 'open-ended ba...	NAHARIYA, Israel (AP) — Hezbollah fired over 100 rockets early Sunday across northern Israel, with some landing near the city of Haifa, as Israel launched hundreds of strikes on Lebanon. A Hezbollah leader declared an 'open-ended battle' was underway as both sides appeared to be spiraling closer toward all-out war. The overnight rocket barrage was in response to Israeli attacks in Lebanon that have killed dozens, including a veteran Hezbollah commander, and an unprecedented attack targeting the group’s communications devices. Air raid sirens across northern Israel sent hundreds of thousands of people scrambling into shelters. One struck near a residential building in Kiryat Bialik, a city near Haifa, wounding at least three people and setting buildings and cars ablaze. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said four people were wounded. Avi Vazana raced to a shelter with his wife and 9-month-old baby before he heard the rocket hitting. Then he went back outside to see if anyone was hurt. 'I ran without shoes, without a shirt, only with pants. I ran to this house when everything was still on fire to try to find if there are other people,' he said. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said three people were killed and four wounded in Israeli strikes near the border, without saying whether they were civilians or combatants. Hezbollah responds to unprecedented blows The rocket attacks followed an Israeli airstrike Friday in Beirut killed at least 45 people, including Akil, one of Hezbollah’s top leaders, several other fighters, and women and children. Hezbollah was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies to explode just days earlier. But it faces a difficult balance of stretching the rules of engagement by hitting deeper into Israel, while at the same time trying to avoid large-scale attacks on civilian areas and infrastructure that could trigger a full-scale war that it would rather not start and take the blame for. Hezbollah’s deputy leader Naim Kassem said Sunday's rocket attack was just the beginning of what’s now an ″open-ended battle' with Israel. 'We admit that we are pained. We are humans. But as we are pained — you will also be pained,' Kassem said at the funeral of top Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Akil. He vowed Hezbollah will continue military operations against Israel in support of Gaza but also warned of unexpected attacks 'from outside the box,' pointing to rockets fired deeper into Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would take whatever action was necessary to restore security in the north and allow people to return to their homes. 'No country can accept the wanton rocketing of its cities. We can’t accept it either,' he said. White House national security spokesman John Kirby remained hopeful for a peaceful resolution, telling 'Fox News Sunday' the U.S. has been 'involved in extensive and quite assertive diplomacy.' 'We are watching all these escalating tensions that have been occurring over the last week or so, with great concern, and we want to make sure that we can continue to do everything we can to try to prevent this from becoming an all-out war there with Hezbollah across that Lebanese border,' he said. Israel says it thwarted an even larger attack from Hezbollah The Israeli military said it struck about 400 militant sites, including rocket launchers, across southern Lebanon in the past 24 hours, thwarting an even larger attack. 'Hundreds of thousands of civilians have come under fire across a lot of northern Israel,' said Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani. 'Today we saw fire that was deeper into Israel than before.' The military also said it intercepted multiple aerial devices fired from the direction of Iraq, after Iran-backed militant groups there claimed to have launched a drone attack on Israel. School was canceled across northern Israel, and the Health Ministry said all hospitals in the north would begin moving operations to protected areas within the medical centers. Separately, Israeli forces raided the West Bank bureau of Al-Jazeera, which it had banned earlier this year, accusing it of serving as a mouthpiece for militant groups, allegations denied by the pan-Arab broadcaster. U.N. envoy says the region is on the brink of catastrophe Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire since the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly a year ago, when the militant group began firing rockets in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed ally Hamas. The low-level fighting has killed dozens of people in Israel, hundreds in Lebanon, and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the frontier. Until recently, neither side was believed to be seeking an all-out war, and Hezbollah has so far stopped short of targeting Tel Aviv or major civilian infrastructure. But in recent weeks, Israel has shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon. Hezbollah has said it would only halt its attacks if the war in Gaza ends, as a cease-fire there appears increasingly elusive. The war in Gaza began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. They are still holding about 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It doesn't say how many were fighters, but says women and children make up more than half of the dead. 'With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,' Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the U.N. envoy for Lebanon, said in an X post. Families of Israeli hostages and residents of Gaza expressed fears the fighting in Lebanon will direct international attention from their own plights. 'I’m incredibly concerned with the increased tensions with Hezbollah because, my biggest concern is that, all the public’s attention and the world’s attention' would be distracted, said Udi Goren, a relative of Tal Haimi, an Israeli man who was killed Oct. 7 and whose body was taken into Gaza. Enas Kollab, a Palestinian displaced from Gaza, voiced similar fears. 'We are afraid that the situation in Lebanon will affect us -- that all attention will turn to Lebanon and we will become forgotten,' she said. Hezbollah says it's using new weapons Hezbollah said it had launched dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles — a new weapon the group hadn't used before — at the Ramat David airbase, southeast of Haifa, 'in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.' In July, the group released what it said was video it had taken of the base with surveillance drones. Hezbollah also said it had targeted the facilities of the Rafael defense firm, headquartered in Haifa, calling it retaliation for the wireless devices attack. It didn't provide evidence, and the Israeli military declined to comment on the statement. Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate for a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people — including two children — and wounding about 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which hasn't confirmed or denied responsibility. An Israeli airstrike Friday took down an eight-story building in a densely populated neighborhood in Beirut’s southern suburbs as Hezbollah members met in the basement, according to Israel. Among those killed was Akil., who commanded the group's special forces unit. ___ Kareem Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

Over 700 high-ranking national security officials endorse Harris	Over 700 high-ranking national security officials have endorsed Democratic candidate Vice President Harris in her run for the White House, with some leaders expressing concerns about former President Trump's 'scary authoritarian streak.' 'Vice President Harris has all the leadership qualities needed to be a strong commander in chief. She’s prepared. She’s strategic. She’s understands all sides of an issue,' retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Michael Smith told The Hill. 'We saw as much during the debate.' 'As we’ve seen for nearly a decade, however, former President Trump has none of those qualities, and he has a scary authoritarian streak,' Smith, who is also the president of National Security Leaders for America, added. The letter endorsing Harris consists of 741 former high-ranking national security officials, including 233 general and flag officers. Among those 741 officials are 15 four-star generals, 10 former cabinet secretaries and 10 service secretaries as well as leaders who served in Republican administrations. 'We do not agree on everything, but we all adhere to two fundamental principles,' the letter reads. 'First, we believe America’s national security requires a serious and capable Commander-in-Chief. Second, we believe American democracy is invaluable.' 'Each generation has a responsibility to defend it,' the letter continues. 'That is why we, the undersigned, proudly endorse Kamala Harris to be the next President of the United States.' The signatories praise Harris as the more diplomatic and realistic candidate for office, distinguishing her from former President Trump, who they call 'impulsive and ill-informed.' It cites Trump’s relations with Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un and the terrorist leaders of Hezbollah. 'Our endorsement of Vice President Harris is an endorsement of freedom and an act of patriotism. It is an endorsement of democratic ideals, of competence, and of relentless optimism in America’s future,' the letter concludes. This endorsement comes after over 100 former GOP national security figures already endorsed Harris earlier this week. That letter cited Trump’s 'demonstrated chaotic and unethical behavior' as president as reason to support Harris, who they say 'posesses the essential qualities to serve as president.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/over-700-high-ranking-national-security-officials-endorse-harris/	2024-09-22T07:32:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/harriskamala_091824gn11_w.jpg?w=900
Bank warns of voice-based AI scams that could utilize your social...	(NEXSTAR) – Forget about the complexity of your online password, your own voice could be the tool criminals use to access your money, new research warns. Starling, a UK-based online bank, said Wednesday in a news release that 'millions' of people are at risk of falling victim to voice cloning scams. The data, based on a representative survey of roughly 3,000 UK adults, found that 28% of people said they had been targeted by an AI voice cloning scam at least once in the past year. Forty-six percent of UK adults were not aware such scams even existed, Starling's researchers found. Powerful artificial intelligence-based programs are able to replicate a person's voice using just seconds of original audio, which the study's authors noted is not difficult to find thanks to social media accounts, YouTube and other internet archives. In March, OpenAI unveiled its Voice Engine, which can accurately replicate someone's speech using just a 15-second clip. The FBI issued a similar warning in early May, saying that the AI tools are publicly available and allow crooks to increase the speed, scale and automation of their attacks. While incorrect grammar or misspellings might have been obvious clues in the past, the AI tools can polish convincing messages to victims. 'Malicious actors increasingly employ AI-powered voice and video cloning techniques to impersonate trusted individuals, such as family members, co-workers, or business partners,' the FBI said in a release. 'By manipulating and creating audio and visual content with unprecedented realism, these adversaries seek to deceive unsuspecting victims into divulging sensitive information or authorizing fraudulent transactions.' 'If a call sounds like your boss (asking for bank account numbers) or your family member (begging for help in an emergency), you’re more likely to act,' a Federal Trace Commission warning reads. 'That’s why scammers use voice cloning to make their requests for money or information more believable.' Major banks such as HSBC, Schwab and others have implemented a Voice ID security screening to speed up customer service interactions. Banks often reassure customers that their voices are as unique as their fingerprints, but what happens if one's voice can be accurately recreated by a bad actor? Nexstar reached out to both HSBC and Schwab to ask about the security of their Voice ID features, but did not receive a reply as of publishing time. In a piece for Vice, a journalist documented himself using an AI clone of his own voice to fool the automated system at Lloyds Bank in the UK, using only the recording and his birth date to gain access to the account. The article was one of several cited in a US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs letter to Brian Moynihan, the CEO of Bank of America, asking for information on how banks use – and protect – voice data. When it comes to the safety of voice authentication technology, Wells Fargo recently defended the tool, telling KQED that it relies on a 'layered approach' that doesn't grant access solely on the basis of a customer's voice. 'This service must be paired with other identity verification methods to allow access to customer accounts.' The FBI and Starling recommend people do the following to keep their information – and money – safe: Stay vigilant: Messages asking for money or credentials are red flags. Businesses should employee technical solutions to fight phishing tactics and make sure to train employees against them. Multi-factor authentication: This is a crucial tool against crooks trying to take control of an account or system. Consider a 'safe phrase': While AI tools can mimic your voice, it won't be able to guess what phrase you might have previously agreed upon with friends and relatives. If you do experience a scam attempt, the FTC asks you to send them an email.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/bank-warns-of-voice-based-ai-scams-that-could-utilize-your-social-media-posts/	2024-09-22T07:24:24-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-1400050206.jpg?w=872
Springfield students suffer collateral damage over anti-immigrant...	The students of Springfield, Ohio, are caught in a mess they had nothing to do with. Schools had to shut down for multiple days after 33 separate bomb threats, and two universities moved classes online after threats of a shooting, one specifically targeting 'members of the Haitian community,' after baseless accusations of immigrants eating people's pets. Experts worry not only about the students' ability to focus and learn amid the threats but the long-term takeaways they may have after seeing how false political allegations can upend their community. 'Exposure to threats of violence or safety concerns, even indirectly through overhearing conversations between adults or news coverage, can detrimentally impact kids. In response, kids might display obvious signs of fear and anxiety, for example, by verbally expressing their worries and seeking reassurance, having trouble separating from caregivers, or not wanting to go back to school,' said Sabrina Liu, assistant professor and licensed clinical psychologist at California State University-San Marcos. 'However, it’s also common for kids to display more difficulty concentrating, disruptive behavior, and/or changes to their sleep or appetite in response to events such as these,' Liu added. And those feelings can become even more difficult with the political context around Springfield, as migrants can feel singled out or ostracized due to the rumors spread about their communities. 'I would be concerned for students that hear this language or rhetoric towards aspects of their personal identities as very stressful. [...] Oftentimes we do try to promote a feeling of belongingness and connectedness to schools,' said Justin Heinze, director of the School Safety Section and co-director of the Research and Scholarship Core at the Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention and an associate professor at the University of Michigan. 'And so, if you're hearing language about your school or your school community that's also either derogatory or very negative, that could be impactful.' False allegations of Haitian migrants stealing and eating pets first emerged at a Springfield City Commission meeting late last month, which saw a speaker from a neo-Nazi group expelled for making threats 'for every Haitian you bring in.' A week later, a Facebook post — attributed to the poster's neighbor's daughter's friend — accused Haitians of killing a cat that has since been found alive. The conspiracy theory was amplified by GOP vice presidential nominee and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, and later by his running mate, former President Trump, during his high-profile debate with Vice President Harris. 'In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs,' Trump exclaimed. Two days later, the bomb threats began. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R), who has denounced the unfounded claims, deployed state troopers to every school in the city. He says none of the bomb threats have been found to be legitimate. 'As a supporter of former President Donald Trump and Senator JD Vance, I am saddened by how they and others continue to repeat claims that lack evidence and disparage the legal migrants living in Springfield,' DeWine said in a New York Times op-ed published Friday. 'This rhetoric hurts the city and its people, and it hurts those who have spent their lives there.' 'It is disappointing to me that Springfield has become the epicenter of vitriol over America’s immigration policy,' he wrote, 'because it has long been a community of great diversity.' Pressed on the conspiracy, Vance has said he's trying to bring attention to immigration more broadly and the strained infrastructure of Springfield in particular, which has seen an influx in recent years. But the false allegations, experts say, are doing considerable harm. 'There is kind of this broader political frenzy, or almost hysteria, surrounding this particular situation, and I think that those types of situations have a tendency to feed on themselves, right?' said Jessie Borelli, professor and associate director of clinical training at the University of California-Irvine. 'So, there's been one accusation that's been made and then other accusations that can create fear, right? So that can be especially frightening for children, where they can start to wonder, 'Well, what's the next thing that's going to be pulled out from underneath? What's the next scary thing that's going to happen?'' she added. It can be a balancing act for schools and parents to try to explain the situation going on, especially between different grade levels. 'I think many children at a younger age than many adults might be expecting are attentive to the political conversations occurring in the background,' said Winston Thompson, associate professor of philosophy and history of education at the Ohio State University. 'So I would say it's entirely appropriate to have conversations with children about these issues, because remaining silent about these issues doesn't mean that the children are going to be exposed. It just means that the children are going to be grappling with and trying to make sense of circumstances that about which they might have incomplete information or misinformation.' Some parents have called for the schools to go remote over the threats until the spotlight gets off their city. But parents and adults also need to be aware of the tension in the community given the racial and ethnic underpinning of the conflict. 'I think with an influx of immigrant populations, a school really has to be careful to make sure that it's not creating the context within which there's going to be alienation for those who are relatively newly arrived, nor will there be suspicion and xenophobia from those whose families have longer histories in the area and deeper roots over time,' Thompson said. 'Schools should be trying to educate people so that they can recognize their shared humanity and our shared faith as members of a political and civic context,' he added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/springfield-students-suffer-collateral-damage-over-anti-immigrant-conspiracy-theory/	2024-09-22T06:23:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/springfield-students_lonas_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
Israel-Hamas war latest: Israel claims death of Hezbollah command...	Israel claimed the death of a senior Hezbollah military official after a rare Israeli airstrike on Beirut as the death toll rose Saturday to at least 37 people, with dozens more wounded, shortly after Hezbollah pounded northern Israel with 140 rockets. The strikes are part of a new cycle of escalation between the enemies that has raised fears of a full-out war erupting in the Middle East, particularly after two separate attacks in Lebanon in which communication devices exploded simultaneously around the country, reportedly killing 37 people and injuring more than 3,400 others. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire regularly since Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel ignited the Israeli military’s devastating offensive in Gaza. Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory during the nearly 1-year-old Israel-Hamas war. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Here's the latest: Hezbollah announces strike on Israeli military base near Haifa using new missile type BEIRUT — The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah announced a strike early Sunday on an Israeli military base near Haifa using a new missile type for the first time. Israel’s emergency medical services reported that a man was lightly wounded by shrapnel from a missile shot from Lebanon that was intercepted in a village in the lower Galilee. Local media reported rockets shot from Lebanon were intercepted in the areas of Haifa and Nazareth. The Israeli military said only that it had monitored the launch of 'about ten rockets' from Lebanon, of which most were intercepted. 'A rocket was also monitored falling in the area and the incident is being investigated,' the statement said. Hezbollah said it had launched 'dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles, in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.' Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel for a wave of apparently remotely detonated explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people - including two children - and wounding around 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility. On Friday, an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs killed at least 37 people, including one of the militant group’s senior leaders as well as women and children, raising fears of a further escalation. Israeli military announces new safety guidelines after striking over 400 rocket launchers in Lebanon JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said that about 90 rockets had been fired at northern Israel from Lebanon on Saturday and that it struck more than 400 rocket launchers in Lebanon. It wasn’t immediately clear if anyone was killed or wounded in the back-and-forth attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, which follow an Israeli strike on Beirut that killed a top Hezbollah commander on Friday. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli defense spokesperson, announced updated safety guidelines for areas north of Haifa, including caps on gatherings of 30 people in open spaces and 300 in enclosed spaces. Work and school can continue if people can reach protected areas promptly. In practice, the new guidelines likely mean school will be canceled in parts of the north, since students and teachers wouldn’t be able to reach shelters in the required time. Within an hour of the announcement, Sunday classes were canceled in at least one border region in western Galilee. The cancellations include locations well outside the ordinary five-kilometer (three-mile) evacuation zone in northern Israel. Iran forces unveil new ballistic missile TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s armed forces unveiled a new ballistic missile during an annual military parade Saturday amid tensions in the region. State television reported that the missile, called Jahad, was a single-stage liquid-fuel ballistic missile with a high-explosive warhead, and it had a range of 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles), making it theoretically capable or reaching Israel. Iran routinely unveils the technological achievements of its armed forces. In April, it launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike that killed two Iranian generals in an Iranian consular building in Syria. Israel said most of the missiles were intercepted. Lebanon's prime minister says he will not attend the UN General Assembly BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati says he will not go to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly because of the ongoing acts of violence with Israel. Mikati’s office said the prime minister was scheduled to give Lebanon’s speech later this month at the United Nations but now he will discuss Lebanon’s diplomatic moves with Foreign Minster Abdallah Bouhabib who is currently in New York. 'There is no priority at the present time than stopping the massacres committed by the Israeli enemy,' Mikati was quoted as saying, a day after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut killed 37 people and wounded 68. Mikati said he calls for drafting international laws that prevent the use of civilian technological devices for military purposes. Mikati’s comments came days after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000 members of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group. Israel was blamed for the attack. White House national security adviser calls reported death of Hezbollah commander ‘a good outcome’ WILMINGTON, Del. — White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called the reported death of Ibrahim Akil 'a good outcome' and said that he planned to speak with Israeli officials later Saturday about the operation. Akil, the main target of the Friday strike, had been wanted by the U.S. for years for his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and in taking American and German hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s. He was under U.S. sanctions and in 2023, the U.S. State Department announced a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his 'identification, location, arrest, and/or conviction.' 'That individual has American blood on his hands and has a rewards for justice price on his head,' Sullivan told reporters on the sidelines of the Quad summit that U.S. President Joe Biden is hosting in Wilmington, Delaware. 'He is somebody who the United States promised long ago we would do everything we could to see brought to justice.' Sullivan added the moment was also meaningful for the American victims. 'You know 1983 seems like a long time ago,' Sullivan said. 'But for a lot of families and a lot of people, they’re still living with it every day.' — from AP White House correspondent Zeke Miller in Wilmington, Delaware. Israeli strike on a school kills 22 people, Gaza Health Ministry says DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli fire killed 22 people in a strike on a school in the north of the enclave, the Gaza Health Ministry said on Saturday. The strike on the school in the Zeitoun area of Gaza City injured another 30, the statement said. Earlier Saturday, the Israeli army said it struck a Hamas 'command and control center, which was embedded inside a compound that previously served' as a school. Death toll from Israeli strike on Beirut suburb rises to 31 BEIRUT, Lebanon — The death toll from an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb has risen to 31, including seven women and three children, Lebanon’s health minister said Saturday. Firass Abiad told reporters that 68 people were also wounded in Friday's airstrike, of whom 15 remain in hospital, in the deadliest Israeli strike on Beirut since the Israel-Hezbollah war in the summer of 2006. Among the dead was Ibrahim Akil, a Hezbollah commander who was in charge of the group’s elite Radwan Forces, and about a dozen members of the militant group who were meeting in the basement of the building that was destroyed. Israel launched the rare airstrike in the densely populated southern Beirut neighborhood on Friday afternoon during the rush hour when people were returning home from work and students were leaving schools. On Saturday morning, Hezbollah’s media office took journalists to the site of the airstrike where workers were still digging through the rubble. Lebanese troops cordoned off the area around the building that was destroyed as members of the Lebanese Red Cross stood nearby to take any recovered bodies from under the rubble. Weaponizing ordinary devices violates international law, United Nations rights chief says UNITED NATIONS — Weaponizing ordinary communication devices represents a new development in warfare, and targeting thousands of Lebanese people using pagers, two-way radios and electronic equipment without their knowledge is a violation of international human rights law, the United Nations human rights chief said Friday. Volker Türk told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council there must be an independent and transparent investigation of the two attacks in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday where these devices exploded, reportedly killing 37 people and injuring more than 3,400 others. 'Those who ordered and carried out these attacks must be held to account,' he said. Lebanon has blamed Israel for the attacks, which appeared to target Hezbollah militants but also saw many civilian casualties, including children. Hezbollah has fought many conflicts with Israel, including a war in 2006, and it has conducted near-daily strikes against Israel to support Hamas militants who attacked Israel on Oct. 7. When reporters asked Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon about speculation Israel was behind the two explosions, he said: 'We are not commenting.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israel-hamas-war-latest-israel-claims-death-of-hezbollah-commander-as-beirut-toll-rises/	2024-09-21T16:19:42-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66ef552b28f4b7.78354791.jpeg?w=900
Biden tells Quad leaders that Beijing is testing region at turbul...	CLAYMONT, Del. (AP) — President Joe Biden told Indo-Pacific allies on Saturday that he believes China’s increasing military assertiveness is an effort to test the region at a turbulent moment for Beijing. Biden's comments were caught by a hot mic after he and fellow leaders of the so-called Quad delivered opening remarks before the press at a summit he’s hosting near his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. He said his administration sees Beijing’s actions as a 'change in tactic, not a change in strategy.' China continues to struggle to pull up its economy that was pummeled by the coronavirus pandemic and has seen an extended slowdown in industrial activity and real estate prices as Beijing faces pressure to ramp up spending to stimulate demand. 'China continues to behave aggressively, testing us all across the region, and it’s true in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, South China, South Asia and the Taiwan Straits,' Biden told Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. He added, 'At least from our perspective, we believe (Chinese President) Xi Jinping is looking to focus on domestic economic challenges and minimize the turbulence in China's diplomatic relationships, and he’s also looking to buy himself some diplomatic space, in my view, to aggressively pursue China’s interest.' Starting with a trade war that dates back to 2018, China and the United States have grown at odds over a range of issues, from global security, such as China’s claims over the South China Sea, to industrial policy on electric vehicle and solar panel manufacturing. The administration has repeatedly spoken out about concerns about Chinese aggression toward Taiwan and more recently on the frequent clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China also has longtime territorial disputes involving other claimants including Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. U.S. officials worry about China’s long-stated goals of unifying Taiwan with China's mainland and the possibility of war over Taiwan. The self-ruled island democracy is claimed by Beijing as part of its territory. Biden recently dispatched his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Beijing for three days of talks with Chinese officials. Sullivan during that visit also met with Xi. Both governments are eager to keep relations on an even keel ahead of a change in the U.S. presidency in January. And both sides have said they remain committed to managing the relationship, following up on a meeting between Xi and Biden in San Francisco last November. Biden added that he continues to believe 'intense competition requires intense diplomacy.' The comments came as Biden showed off a slice of his Delaware hometown to the leaders of Australia, Japan and India as he hosted what is likely the last gathering of the Indo-Pacific partnership that has grown in prominence under his White House tenure. When Biden began his presidency he looked to elevate the Quad, which until then had only met at the foreign minister level, to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and opportunities in the Indo-Pacific. This weekend's summit is the fourth in-person and sixth overall gathering of the leaders since 2021. 'It will survive way beyond November,' Biden told the leaders. The president, who has admitted to an uneven track record as a scholar, also seemed tickled to get to host a gathering with three world leaders at the school he attended more than 60 years ago. He welcomed each of the leaders individually for one-on-one talks at his nearby home before they gathered at the school for talks and a formal dinner. 'I don’t think the headmaster of this school thought I’d be presiding over a meeting like this,' Biden joked to fellow leaders. Albanese, Modi and Kishida came for the summit before their appearances at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. 'This place could not be better suited for my final visit as prime minister,' said Kishida, who like Biden, is set to soon leave office. Earlier, the president warmly greeted Kishida when he arrived at the residence on Saturday morning and gave the prime minister a tour of the property before they settled into talks. White House officials said holding the talks at the president's house, which sits near a pond in a wooded area several miles west of downtown, was intended to give the meetings a more relaxed feel. Sullivan described the vibe of Biden's one-on-one meeting with Albanese, who stopped by the house on Friday, as 'two guys — one at the other guy’s home — talking in broad strokes about where they see the state of the world.' He said Biden and Albanese also swapped stories about their political careers. The Australian leader remarked that the visit had given him 'insight into what in my view makes you such an extraordinary world leader.' Modi also stopped by the house on Saturday to meet with Biden before the leaders gathered for their joint talks at Archmere. 'There cannot be a better place than President Biden's hometown of Wilmington to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Quad,' Modi said. As part of the summit, the leaders were set to announce new initiatives to bolster maritime security in the region — with enhanced coast guard collaboration through the Pacific and Indian oceans — and improve cooperation on humanitarian response missions. The measures are meant to serve as a counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. Biden and Modi discussed Modi's recent visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that maintains a neutral position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden and Kishida, who are both stepping away from office amid sliding public support, count the tightening of security and economic ties among the U.S., Japan and South Korea as one of their most significant accomplishments. The improved relations between Japan and South Korea, two nations with a deep and complicated history that have struggled to stay on speaking terms, have come amid worrying developments in the Pacific, including strides made by North Korea in its nuclear program and concerns about China. Biden during their face-to-face meeting commended Kishida for demonstrating 'courage and conviction in strengthening ties' with South Korea, according to the White House. They also discussed China, Russia's war against Ukraine and emerging technology issues. The U.S. and Japan are dealing with a rare moment of tension in the relationship. Biden, as well as presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, have opposed a $15 billion bid by Japan’s Nippon Steel to take over American-owned U.S. Steel. Biden administration officials indicated this week that a U.S. government committee's formal assessment of the proposed deal has yet to be submitted to the White House and may not come until after the Nov. 5 election. The Biden administration promised that the leaders would issue a joint statement containing the strongest-ever language on China and North Korea to be agreed upon by the four countries. The White House said the leaders later Saturday will rollout a new collaboration aimed at reducing cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific. The announcement is related to Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative, a long-running passion project of the president and his wife, Jill Biden, aimed at reducing cancer deaths. The Bidens’ son Beau died in 2015 at age 46 of brain cancer. ___ Madhani reported from Washington.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-biden-is-putting-personal-touch-on-asia-pacific-diplomacy-in-his-final-months-in-office/	2024-09-21T15:40:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66ef4bc9e26b90.70857788.jpeg?w=900
Rival Sinaloa cartel factions fighting after US arrests leaders	(NewsNation) — Rival factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel are waging a deadly war in northwestern Mexico, leaving dozens dead and missing in the wake of U.S. arrests of key cartel leaders. The violence between groups known as the 'Mayos' and the 'Chapos' erupted after U.S. authorities apprehended Joaquín Guzmán López and Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada in late July. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador claims these arrests, which he says were made without Mexico's knowledge, triggered the current bloodshed. Mexican president blames US for cartel violence in Sinaloa 'They made a deal and did not inform us,' López Obrador said, citing Mexico's attorney general. 'The Department of Justice was in talks with one of the criminal groups in Sinaloa and they made deals.' More than 50 people have been killed and another 50 are missing in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa state. Gruesome displays of violence include severed heads left on pizza boxes and bodies wearing baseball caps similar to those in 'El Mayo' wanted posters. The conflict has disrupted daily life in Sinaloa. While schools have reopened, many businesses close early and residents remain indoors despite heavy military patrols. Cartels infiltrating native reservations with fentanyl: Tribal leader U.S. intelligence analysts suggest the conflict could last for years. The Drug Enforcement Administration reports the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels have a presence in all 50 U.S. states, controlling global networks that dominate the fentanyl and methamphetamine trade. López Obrador questioned why the U.S. hasn't focused on arresting its own drug lords and blamed America's demand for driving the surge in fentanyl trafficking. U.S. officials have not yet responded to these accusations. The Mexican president's claims have sparked debate about U.S.-Mexico cooperation in combating drug cartels.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/sinaloa-cartel-factions-fighting-arrests-leaders/	2024-09-21T14:46:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/cartel.jpg?w=370
Harris debate performance falls short of moving the needle in swi...	Vice President Harris was widely seen by voters as the clear winner of her debate against former President Trump, but that sentiment has failed to move the needle in key battleground states where the presidential nominees are still neck-and-neck heading into November. Harris’s debate performance has been hailed in the nearly two weeks since it occurred, with voters in several surveys, including those conducted that evening, believing she is better at staying calm under pressure, more intelligent and has higher moral integrity than Trump. But in the nearly two dozen polls conducted since the match-up, Harris’s slight lead over Trump nationally and in swing states grew by less than one percentage point and, in some states, Trump’s lead grew, albeit by razor-thin margins. Harris currently holds a 3.6 percentage point lead over Trump nationally, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ aggregate polling, which has grown just slightly since the day before the debate, when she had a 3.2 percentage point lead. Surveys in battleground states tell a similar story. Harris saw slight spikes in her lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin in the weeks since the debate but her lead remained the same in Michigan, which makes up part of the blue wall. Trump has a 0.1 lead over Harris in Arizona and Georgia, two other key states a candidate needs to proclaim victory. 'While it's true that the battleground states remain on a knife's edge, that was always going to be the case in a country as split along partisan lines as we are right now, and no debate performance was going to shift those state numbers significantly,' said John LaBombard, former communications director to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.). Harris is up 1.2 percentage points in Michigan, the aggregate polling shows, which is the same lead she had the day before the debate. Harris is up 1.1 percentage point in Pennsylvania, which is a minor increase from the 0.7 percentage point lead she had pre-debate. And, in Nevada, Harris has a 1.2 percentage point lead, which is an uptick from the 0.5 percentage point lead she had pre-debate. Her biggest lead is in Wisconsin, by 2 percentage points, but that’s a decline from the 3 percentage point lead she had on Sept. 9. Meanwhile, in Arizona, the aggregation shows Trump with a 0.1 percentage point lead over Harris, which is a flip from the 0.1 percentage point lead Harris had over him before the debate. Trump has a 0.1 percentage point lead in Georgia, which is a decease from his 0.3 percentage point lead he had before the debate. Strategists don’t see much in the way of either candidate coming out that far ahead in key battleground states where the margins are so thin. 'Anyone who is expecting the polling to break open one way or the other will be sorely disappointed,' said Clayton Cox, former Democratic National Committee (DNC) national finance director, noting what he called a 'calcified electorate.' 'What matters now is ground game, enthusiasm and ability to motivate a volunteer army. On that basis, I would rather be Harris over Trump any day of the week,' Clayton said. Democrats since the debate have been cautious to claim victory just yet and are painting Harris, as she herself often does on the campaign trail, as the underdog in the race. 'We are still in a margin of error race. It’s a tie,' Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said at a fundraising event with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday. 'We’ve got to go persuade those people who don’t know enough about the vice president and her vision for the future…have those hard conversations in big and small ways, we’re going to inch our way over the finish line.' Republicans, too, see the race as too close to call. Stewart Verdery, who served in former President George W. Bush’s administration, expects there won’t be a big, game-changer moment before November. 'When Trump has a bad debate or there’s a new oddball poll, it’s treated as a game-changer. But the simple truth is that two parties are within 2 to 3 points of each other nationally so there will never be a definitive moment in the campaign,' he said. 'But within those slim margins, Harris has improved her odds considerably since the debate and now appears to be going into the old basketball ‘four corners’ to run out the clock.' To that point, individual polls also paint varying pictures of the state of the race. An Emerson College and The Hill poll on Thursday found Trump edging out Harris in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all by just one point, and edging out Harris in Georgia by 3 points. Harris edged out Trump in Michigan by 2 points, North Carolina by 1 point and the two candidates were tied in Nevada. Harris and Trump were tied in Pennsylvania in a Marist poll released on Thursday. That poll found that Harris edged out Trump by five points in Michigan and by 1 point in Wisconsin. A Quinnipiac University poll on Wednesday found Harris leading Trump by 6 points in Pennsylvania, 5 points in Michigan, and by 1 point in Wisconsin. Democrats still, however, are optimistic that the groundwork Harris has put into the swing states will pay off by election day, despite the lack of movement in the polls after the debate. 'It's still a close, competitive election, but we are in a stronger position than they are… we have more money, more volunteers, we have more enthusiasm. There's a lot of optimism on our side that we're in a stronger position today, and we have a much stronger capacity to close,' said Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg. 'There is no good news for Trump in the battlegrounds.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-debate-performance-falls-short-of-moving-the-needle-in-swing-states/	2024-09-21T14:20:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/harriskamala_trumpdonald_092024gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Top Hezbollah leader was among the 37 people killed in an Israeli...	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Israel and Hezbollah exchanged fire on Saturday as rescue crews in Beirut searched the rubble of an apartment building that was leveled by an Israeli airstrike that killed at least 37 people, including one of the militant group's senior leaders as well as women and children. The Israeli government braced for an expected surge in Hezbollah rocket attacks by setting new caps on the size of gatherings and other restrictions in the north of the country, near Israel's border with Lebanon, that led to schools in some communities canceling classes on Sunday. The airstrike Friday took down an eight-story building in a densely populated neighborhood in southern Beirut as Hezbollah members were meeting in the basement, according to Israel. Among those killed was Ibrahim Akil, a top Hezbollah official who commanded the group’s special forces unit the Radwan Force. Also killed was Ahmed Wahbi, a top commander in the group’s military wing, the Israeli military said. Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said the attack, which came days after devastating coordinated attacks on Hezbollah that used exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, thwarted the group's chain of command while taking out Akil, who he said was responsible for Israeli deaths and who was on the U.S. wanted list for years. 'This is our commitment to the fallen and their loved ones. This is our commitment to the residents of the north. And this is a clear message to all those who seek to harm us,' he posted on X. Lebanon’s health minister, Firass Abiad, told reporters that at least seven women and three children were killed in Friday's airstrike on the building. He said another 68 people were injured, including 15 who were hospitalized. It was the deadliest strike on Beirut since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, and the casualty count could grow, with 23 people still missing, a government official said. Hezbollah confirms more than a dozen operatives were killed Akil, the main target, had been wanted by the U.S. for years for his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s. The U.S. State Department last year announced a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his 'identification, location, arrest, and/or conviction.' White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called Akil’s death 'a good outcome' and said he had 'American blood on his hands' for the embassy attack. 'You know, 1983 seems like a long time ago,' Sullivan said. 'But for a lot of families and a lot of people, they’re still living with it every day.' Wahbi was described as a commander who played major roles within Hezbollah for decades and was imprisoned in an Israeli jail in southern Lebanon in 1984. Hezbollah said he was one of the 'field commanders' during a 1997 ambush in southern Lebanon that left 12 Israeli troops dead. Hezbollah announced overnight that 15 of its operatives had been killed by Israeli forces, but it didn’t how or where they died. Meanwhile, the Israeli army spokesperson, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, said Saturday 16 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Friday’s strike. Israel airstrikes and Hezbollah rocket attacks continue It wasn’t immediately clear if anyone was killed or wounded in the back-and-forth attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on Saturday. The Israeli military confirmed that about 90 rockets had been fired at northern Israel and that Israel had struck more than 400 rocket launchers in Lebanon during the day. Expecting a surge in rocket attacks, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli defense spokesman, announced updated safety guidelines for areas north of Haifa, including caps on gatherings of 30 people in open spaces and 300 in enclosed spaces. Work and school can continue if people can reach protected areas in a timely manner. But since students and teachers in some places wouldn’t be able reach shelters in the required time, Sunday classes were canceled in at least two border regions within an hour of the announcement. Earlier this week, Israel’s security cabinet said stopping Hezbollah’s attacks on the country’s north, which would allow displaced residents to return to their homes, is now an official war goal, as Israel considers a wider military operation in Lebanon that could spark an all-out conflict. Israel has since sent a powerful fighting force to its northern border. Hezbollah has maintained that it will halt its strikes only when a cease-fire is reached between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire regularly since Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel ignited the Israeli military’s devastating offensive in Gaza. But previous cross-border attacks have largely struck areas in northern Israel that had been evacuated and less-populated parts of southern Lebanon. Hezbollah bombardments preceded the Israeli strike Friday's strike came hours after Hezbollah launched one of its most intense bombardments of northern Israel in nearly a year of fighting, largely targeting Israeli military sites. Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of the Katyusha rockets. The militant group said its latest wave of rocket salvos was a response to Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon. However, it came days after mass explosions of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies killed at least 37 people, including two children, and wounded roughly 3,000 others. Abiad, the Lebanese health minister, said Saturday that hospitals across the country were filled with the wounded. The pager and walkie-talkie attacks have been widely attributed to Israel, which hasn't confirmed or denied involvement. They marked a major escalation in the past 11 months of simmering conflict along the Israel-Lebanon border. ___ Associated Press writers Jack Jeffery and Natalie Melzer in Jerusalem, White House correspondent Zeke Miller in Wilmington, Delaware, and Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-the-death-toll-from-israeli-airstrike-on-a-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31/	2024-09-21T13:30:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24265302346271.jpg?w=900
Harris accepts invitation to second debate, urges Trump to join	WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Vice President Kamala Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN to participate in a debate on Oct. 23, her campaign said on Saturday. 'Donald Trump should have no problem agreeing to this debate. It is the same format and setup as the CNN debate he attended and said he won in June, when he praised CNN’s moderators, rules, and ratings,' campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/harris-accepts-invitation-to-second-debate-urges-trump-to-join/	2024-09-21T09:51:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24255043023737_fc8275.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr., Gabbard eye top roles in possible Trump administration	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard are angling for positions in a possible Trump administration, hoping to help spark an anti-establishment surge in Washington post-November. The two former Democrats, who have enthusiastically endorsed Trump’s Republican nomination for the White House, want to influence American policy issues ranging from health care and the environment to national security. They jumped on board with the former president after moving rightward following their own quixotic runs — Gabbard’s in 2020 and Kennedy’s in 2024. Gabbard, a military veteran who served as a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii before retiring, said this week that she would 'be honored to serve' under a second Trump term. She told Fox News that she’s hoping for a role working on foreign policy while stumping for him in Georgia. Kennedy, meanwhile, wants to help Trump dismantle and rebuild the public health care system and said his former rival has asked him to 'be involved in the administration at a high level.' The two are now headed for Nevada this weekend, hitting a third battleground after Arizona and Georgia, in the hopes that they will elevate Trump’s chances of success with voters in Las Vegas. The positive expectation-setting from Trump himself has excited Kennedy and Gabbard allies, who see them already helping to form a non-traditional coalition they hope can win less than two months from Election Day. 'I truly believe [Trump] will keep his word and not hose Kennedy,' said Eric Jackman, a senior adviser for the newly formed Kennedy-aligned Make America Healthy Again PAC, modeled after Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan. 'He understands he will need much better people around him, should he win. Having experienced hands like Bobby and Tulsi in Trump’s corner is an immense advantage and asset to his campaign and future administration,' he said. Jackman, a friend of Gabbard’s who has worked on issues supporting Kennedy this cycle, sees the former independent candidate’s strength now as guiding Trump to reach new audiences, including skeptical voters and independents. 'It’s been very exciting and encouraging to see how MAGA crowds are responding to Kennedy’s call for cleaning up our food, environment and government,' he said. Trump has famously attracted non-conformist characters into his orbit, many of whom have right-leaning sympathies. Kennedy and Gabbard’s swift emergence on the Republican scene is the latest extension of that. The two have bonded over anti-interventionism that also extends to what they perceive as other kinds of excessive government reach. For Gabbard, the military industrial complex is a particular focus, while Kennedy has channeled his advocacy against vaccines and modern science into a war on the nation’s disease crisis. Kennedy hasn’t explicitly said which position, if any, he would want the most if Trump wins, but those close to him, including his former vice-presidential nominee Nicole Shanahan, have suggested Health and Human Services as a possibility. 'They are helping to create a bridge for Independents and unhappy Democrats to the Trump campaign,' said Larry Sharpe, a political consultant with knowledge of Kennedy’s campaign. 'Many voters who are unhappy with the establishment have hope that both RFK and Gabbard will be able to make changes,' Sharpe said. Like others in Kennedy’s orbit, he suggested there’s a suitable place for them ahead of a possible government change-over, when Trump would theoretically usher in his own bench. 'Many hope that they both are on the transition team so they can make many changes to permanent Washington,' he said. The Hill reported earlier this month that nominating Kennedy for any Cabinet position would likely come with inherent challenges, especially tough battles for confirmation in the Senate if Democrats hold onto the upper chamber. Some Democratic strategists see the chances that either politician would make it to Washington as increasingly unlikely, given the fickle nature of Trump’s promises and personal alliances. There’s a growing disbelief among liberals that he would stay true to his word and offer top positions to the two ex-candidates. 'I don’t think it takes an advanced degree in psychology to observe that when it comes to Donald Trump loyalty is a one-way street. And his word is about as valuable as one of his bankrupt casinos,' said Doug Gordon, a Democratic strategist. 'The most likely outcome here is that Tulsi and RFK are simply the latest examples of people becoming useful idiots for Trump with nothing to show for it,' Gordon said. Kennedy and Gabbard have also faced scrutiny since taking on roles on the campaign. Ahead of the debate between Trump and Vice President Harris, the former president’s campaign commissioned Gabbard to prepare him with a mock performance, something that drew negative attention after the former president’s rocky debate. Gabbard delivered what supporters considered to be a blow to Harris in 2019, early into the last presidential campaign cycle, when both candidates competed in a debate in Michigan. Gabbard challenged Harris on her criminal justice record and was seen as putting Harris, a former prosecutor and California’s top cop as attorney general, on her toes at the time. She’s since taken an even more adversarial posture towards Harris while promoting Trump’s candidacy. 'President Trump did in his last administration what President Obama refused to do, what President Biden refused to do, what Kamala Harris has made clear she refuses to do — which is to go out and do that tough work that a president and commander in chief has to do in diplomacy,' Gabbard told Fox News, where she is a frequent guest. Trump’s debate performance, while widely perceived as poor, has seemingly done little to move the needle ahead of November. New polls released over the past few days show a close, if not statistically tied, race in almost all of the important swing states. Kennedy’s Democratic name also doesn’t appear to be hurting Trump. Post-endorsement, he has stayed within the margin of error against Harris. One Trump ally argued Kennedy is especially valuable because he has a built-in following and is the type of add-on who can single-handedly draw a crowd and media attention. He also follows the same adage as Trump that all press is good press. 'This is another interesting thing that the Trump team has going for them that I don’t think Team Kamala has going for them: Multiple people who can draw earned media,' the ally to the former president said. 'RFK is going to be on the trail. It wasn’t just an endorsement,' the source said.

Ex-Bad Boy Records rapper says Diddy 'destroyed' his life	(NewsNation) — A former Bad Boy Records rapper turned Belizean politician responds to the arrest of his former mentor and associate, Sean 'Diddy' Combs, with a harsh reality: 'This is someone that destroyed my life.' Moses 'Shyne' Barrow was 21 years old when he went to a New York City nightclub with Combs, who signed the up-and-coming rapper to his record label upon meeting in 1998. About a year later, Barrow was with Combs when his new boss and another man were arguing. Shots rang out, injuring three bystanders. Barrow was convicted in 2001 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Upon his release, he was deported to his native country of Belize. Barrow spoke to the media at a press conference on Sept. 18 in Belize when he made the comments in response to Diddy’s arrest two days prior. 'He pretty much sent me to prison,' he said at the conference. Ray J says industry still trying to ‘digest’ Diddy news The now-45-year-old is the Leader of the Opposition for the Belize House of Representatives, first becoming a member of the House in 2020. Born Jamal Michael Barrow, the rapper’s stage name was Shyne. A native of Belize, he moved to New York City with his mother as a child, and that’s where he met Diddy when his rap career took off in the late 1990s. 'Shyne' wrote and performed on several popular albums including Usher’s 'Confessions,' Lil Wayne’s 'Carter IV,' Notorious B.I.G’s 'Born Again' and Diddy’s (at the time Puff Daddy’s) 'Forever' (released three months before the 1999 shooting). In previous interviews, Barrow has said he was the 'fall guy' for the shooting but clarified that he doesn’t blame Combs. At the September press conference, he says he’s forgiven his former mentor, who he says he was never close enough to consider a 'brotherhood' with him.

(Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage via Getty Images) 'This is someone who, in a sense, testified against me when I was on trial, when I was an 18-year-old kid, just wanting to do nothing other than make my mom proud …' said Barrow, who has maintained his innocence from the start. 'This is someone who destroyed my life and who I forgave.' Combs’ then-girlfriend singer and actress Jennifer Lopez was with him the night of the shooting, and both were soon arrested after fleeing the scene. Neither were charged in connection to the shooting. Weighing in on Comb’s recent arrest, Barrow said, 'One of the things I would never wish on my worst enemy is to be incarcerated … so I take no joy in anyone’s challenges whether with the criminal justice system or otherwise.' J-Lo’s mom didn’t like Diddy: Video resurfaces 'Do I take satisfaction in what he is going through? Absolutely not,' he continued. Natania Reuben, one of the shooting victims, told NewsNation in March that she has spent the past 25 years trying to clear Barrow’s name.

Harris sees reasons for cautious optimism in Pennsylvania	Vice President Harris is seeing encouraging signs in Pennsylvania, a state that many see as the key battleground in the fight for the White House in November. Many recent polls have shown Harris holding a slim lead over former President Trump in the Keystone State, and she has a 53 percent chance to win the state in Decision Desk HQ and The Hill’s election forecast. But some polls also underscore just how close the race in Pennsylvania will be, with multiple surveys in recent days showing Harris and Trump tied there — underscoring how fierce the battle for the state’s 19 electoral votes will be. 'I would rather be where we are than where they are,' said Joe Corrigan, a Pennsylvania-based Democratic strategist. 'But nothing is over. It’s just all gas and no breaks until Nov. 5.' On Thursday, a Washington Post poll showed Harris ahead of Trump by 1 point, with a margin of error of 3.6 percentage points. A Franklin &amp; Marshall College poll released the same day found Harris leading Trump 49 percent to 46 percent, with a 4.1 point margin of error. Meanwhile, a Quinnipiac University poll out Thursday showed Harris up by 6 points in Pennsylvania with a margin of error of 2.7 points. The poll marks the first time either candidate has surpassed the 50 percent mark in the state this cycle. But a Marist survey out the same day showed the candidates deadlocked in the state with a margin of error of 3.1 points. Both campaigns are crisscrossing the state this weekend, with Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) attending events in Leesburg and Hershey on Saturday. On Sunday, second gentleman Doug Emhoff will travel to Bucks County, one of the state’s swing areas. David Urban, who was a senior adviser to Trump’s campaign in 2016, sounded an optimistic note about the former president’s chances in the Keystone State, but he acknowledged the closeness of the race. 'It is neck and neck,' Urban said. 'I like our chances still better than her chances in the state. I think if the election were held today, Trump would win, but again, I’m talking about win by 75,000 votes, win by 100,000 votes.' Urban noted that on the ground, the race feels more like it did in 2016 than in 2020, noting President Biden’s close ties to the state. And he pointed to questions about Harris’s policy stances as a weakness for her. 'You can say I am not going to ban fracking once, but you need to say it 300 times to kind of counter the 300 times you said it before,' Urban continued, referring to Harris’s reversal on the issue from when she ran for president in 2020. Fracking in Pennsylvania has been a particular focal point for Republicans in their attacks against Harris, particularly in the southwestern region, where it is a major industry. Harris told CNN last month her values 'have not changed' and that a thriving, clean energy economy can be achieved without banning fracking. 'People, when they come into new information, can come to conclusions that are different from the conclusions that they’ve held in the past,' Corrigan said, regarding Harris’s reversal. Democrats say they are cautiously optimistic about Harris’s standing in the polls and point to her favorability ratings over Trump. A Suffolk University poll found that 49 percent of likely Pennsylvania voters had a favorable view of Harris, while 47 percent said they had an unfavorable view. Trump, on the other hand, had a 43 percent favorability rating and a 54 percent unfavorable rating. 'If you look at the vice president’s favorability numbers in Pennsylvania, I think the fact she’s still above water speaks to the fact that people trust her more on any number of issues,' Corrigan said. Harris’s allies also tout what they say is a strong campaign infrastructure and presence in the state. The vice president made headlines last week when she made a campaign stop in Johnstown in the western portion of the state. The town is not considered as deeply red as the region it’s in, but it still underscores Harris’s strategy of seeking to chip away at Trump’s margins in Republican strongholds. The move is reminiscent of the 2022 midterms, when Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) and Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) waded into more rural, conservative parts of the state. 'Vice President Harris and Governor Walz would do well spending a few days in the interior of the Commonwealth,' said former Rep. Chris Carney (D-Pa), a senior policy adviser at Nossaman. 'There are gettable independent and blue dog votes there, but those voters need to see Harris and Walz, assess them up close, and develop some comfort with them. The voters there need to hear directly that a Harris administration will not end fracking, will not take away guns and will keep the nation secure.' Republicans argue the strategy employed by Shapiro and Fetterman in the state’s rural counties won’t play the same way two years later, noting Shapiro’s weak Republican opponent in state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R) and Fetterman’s connections with rural voters in the western part of the state. 'She can go to every rural community in the state and, bluntly, it’s not going to make much of a difference. She doesn’t connect with them. They don’t trust her,' a Pennsylvania-based GOP strategist and former gubernatorial candidate. Trump will seek to run up the margins in the state’s conservative and rural strongholds, while Harris will seek to maximize turnout in the state's most populated regions in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh areas. The race could come down to a handful of counties that voted for former President Obama in 2012 but flipped for Trump. Those counties include Erie, Luzerne, and Northampton. Trump retained Luzerne County in 2020, but lost Northampton and Erie in 2020. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll released earlier this week showed Harris leading Trump 50 percent to 45 percent in Northampton and 48 percent to 44 percent in Erie. While the poll numbers looks good for her, many Republicans are still expressing skepticism that she will resonate with voters in the Keystone State. 'With Kamala Harris, there’s lots of question marks,' said Urban, the GOP strategist. 'What people know of her is what they saw in the 2020 campaign.'

Trump's shutdown push falls flat with Republicans	House Republicans are overwhelmingly dismissing former President Trump’s calls for a government shutdown in the absence of a proof-of-citizenship voting bill being signed into law, a public break from the GOP presidential nominee in the lead-up to the November election. A group of Republicans this week rejected a bill that combined a six-month continuing resolution (CR) with the Trump-backed voting bill, tanking the legislation in a move that thwarted Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) funding strategy. Now, as the Speaker prepares to defy Trump’s wishes and stage a vote on a 'clean' three-month stopgap, rank-and-file Republicans are expected to back it — balking at the former president’s request. Republicans almost universally support the voting bill, but they say pushing the issue so intensely that it results in a shutdown would backfire on the party. 'Everybody wants to go home and campaign, and there are some, particularly that want to go home and campaign, because they're in really tough races,' Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) said. The Alabama Republican, who currently serves as policy chair of the House GOP conference, also pointed to national security concerns. 'A government shutdown would embolden our enemies, further undermine our reliability and respect among our allies,' Palmer said. 'So, I don't think a shutdown is good for anybody.' Trump for weeks has urged House Republicans to pair government funding with a conservative voting bill. Johnson fulfilled that request with his opening salvo in the government funding talks. The former president, however, amped up his request last week, urging Republicans to shut down the government if they did not secure 'absolute assurances on Election Security.' And he reiterated that position Wednesday, hours before the House rejected the six-month stopgap-plus-SAVE Act. 'If Republicans don’t get the SAVE Act, and every ounce of it, they should not agree to a Continuing Resolution in any way, shape, or form,' Trump posted on Truth Social, adding: 'BE SMART, REPUBLICANS, YOU’VE BEEN PUSHED AROUND LONG ENOUGH BY THE DEMOCRATS. DON’T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN. Remember, this is Biden/Harris’ fault, not yours!' Trump’s pleas contrasted with the strategy among GOP lawmakers, who saw the CR-plus-SAVE Act as an opening offer — and a way to play into Trump’s past false stolen election claims and repeated skepticism of the voting system — but knew it would not be the measure that prevented a shutdown. Even if the lower chamber passed it, the Democratic-controlled Senate and White House — which point out that it is already illegal for noncitizens to vote and expressed concern about burdening eligible voters — never would have accepted it. Republicans believe the blame for any shutdown would be placed on their own shoulders, not the Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), for example, called a government shutdown at this juncture 'politically beyond stupid' and predicted the GOP would bear responsibility for allowing the lights to turn off in Washington. House Republicans are echoing that sentiment. 'I don't know that a shutdown really helps us right now, and what we're trying to accomplish — keep the majority, win the White House,' said Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), chair of the Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative caucus in the House. Rep. Dave Joyce (R-Ohio), a subcommittee chair on the House Appropriations Committee, sounded a similar note while zeroing in on the looming election. 'Closing down the government during this process is not a good idea for anyone involved, certainly for our government, certainly for momentum going into an election,' Joyce said. 'I think it's important that we stay open and get through this election and then make decisions in November and December.' The insistence from Trump, nonetheless, is complicating the GOP’s path to averting a shutdown at the end of the month as House GOP leaders move on to their plan B: A clean, short-term stopgap until December. Johnson is now in the delicate position of managing the expectations of the former president, with whom he has kept a good relationship — and whose support he will likely need to remain Speaker next year if Republicans win the House. The Speaker has spoken to Trump about the current government funding fight, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to The Hill. Punchbowl News first reported the conversations. Johnson met with Trump in Washington on Thursday night — the second gathering of the two leaders in a week. The Speaker would not detail their discussion, but he did say the former president 'understands the situation' House Republicans are currently in. 'I’ve had a lot of conversations with President Trump, and I won’t divulge all of them, but he understands the situation that we’re in, and he is doggedly determined to ensure that election security remains a top priority,' Johnson told reporters Friday. 'And I am as well, which is why I put the SAVE Act with CR.' 'We want to make sure that everybody understands, it is illegal to vote if you’re a noncitizen,' he continued. 'And we’re gonna press that at every opportunity, we’ll use every vehicle coming out of this chamber and every platform that we have to make this message loud and clear.' Johnson’s office, meanwhile, has continued to put out messaging on the SAVE Act vote, noting that 206 House Democrats voted against the bill requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. Friday morning, he posted a photo of Trump’s Truth Social message that read: 'IF YOU VOTE ILLEGALLY, YOU’RE GOING TO JAIL.' Asked about Trump’s shutdown calls or the prospects of a funding lapse, the Speaker has sought to tamp down concern. In a CNBC interview Wednesday before the failed six-month CR vote, Johnson said 'no one needs to worry' about a shutdown. Later in the day on Fox News after the vote failed, Johnson said: 'I don't think it's going to come to a shutdown. I believe we can get this job done.' Not every Republican, however, is resistant to a shutdown, with some fiscal hawks wishing the Speaker would have used the threat of a shutdown as a real leverage point to pressure Democrats to swallow the SAVE Act. 'He still has an aversion to any kind of shutdown,' Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) said of Johnson. 'Trump is saying, have a shutdown. And just hadn't happened. We got to fight at some point.' Norman added that he did not 'buy' the idea that vulnerable House Republicans could be threatened by a government shutdown. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), lead sponsor of the SAVE Act and major proponent of pairing it with a stopgap, also said Republicans should not shy away from a shutdown. 'Everybody knows that I’m certainly comfortable with fighting and having a shutdown to force the question on whether or not we’re gonna fund government at the right levels, which means cutting spending, and make sure that we ensure that only citizens vote,' said Roy, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. 'I’d be happy to do that. But you got to have the votes to go do it.' But those most involved with the intricacies of government funding strongly disagree. 'We can't have a shutdown,' said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), another appropriator. 'A shutdown would be catastrophic for our national defense, for our economy.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-shutdown-push-falls-flat-with-republicans/	2024-09-21T04:40:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/trump-shutdown_brooks_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
Trump says 'Jewish people would have a lot to do' with his loss '...	Former President Trump, speaking at two events raising awareness for combating antisemitism, is telegraphing that a loss in the 2024 presidential election largely would be blamed on the American Jewish vote. The Republican presidential nominee lashed out at what he said is 40 percent support among the Jewish American community in the U.S., saying the 60 percent polled who favor Kamala Harris are voting for the 'enemy.' 'In my opinion, the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss, if I’m at 40 percent,' Trump said during a campaign event at an event called 'Fighting Antisemitism' and hosted by Israeli American Republican mega-donor Miriam Adelson, at the Hyatt Regency Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. After the event, Trump was the keynote speaker at the Israeli American Conference, also a beneficiary of Adelson, where he repeated similar comments. 'If I don’t win this election — and Jewish people would have a lot to do with that, 60 percent are voting for the enemy — Israel will cease to exist in two years,' Trump said to a favorable and receptive crowd. 'I believe I’m 100 percent right. … If I do win, Israel will be safe and secure, and we’ll stop the toxic poison of antisemitism.' The comments drew quick criticism from supporters of Vice President Harris and raised warnings among leaders in the Jewish community. 'Treating Jews and Israel as political footballs makes Jews, Israel, and all of us less safe,' Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said in a statement to The Forward. 'Dividing Jews into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ camps and engaging in dual loyalty tropes further normalizes antisemitism. Anyone who cares about Jewish safety should call it out,' she added. 'This is not partisan politics — it’s about the fundamental safety of the Jewish community.' 'If any other national politician said: 'the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss' - to preemptively blame Jews for a potential loss- their career &amp; candidacy would be over. How people continue to ignore this is scary,' Alyssa Farah Griffin, a onetime Trump administration official who has become an outspoken critic of the former president, posted on the social platform X. 'Donald Trump is now saying that the ‘Jewish people’ will be to blame if he loses this election. This is vile and dangerous and should be condemned by all Americans. Antisemitic rhetoric like this makes Jews less safe,' Andrew Weinstein, a Jewish Democrat from South Florida who served as a delegate to the United Nations for the Biden administration, posted on X. Likewise, Common Defense, a grassroots organization of U.S. military veterans, described Trump’s remarks as 'antisemitic rhetoric' that 'puts Jewish lives at risk.' 'Donald Trump is now saying the 'Jewish people' will be to blame if he loses the election. This is disgusting and, more importantly, dangerous. Antisemitic rhetoric like this puts Jewish lives at risk, and all Americans should be outraged,' the group said in a statement on X.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-says-jewish-people-would-have-a-lot-to-do-with-his-loss-if-that-happens/	2024-09-20T17:23:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24256801720496-e1726180709936.jpg?w=900
Kentucky sheriff who shot judge 'angry' in deposition: Lawyer	(NewsNation) — Sheriff Shawn M. Stines allegedly shot and killed District Judge Kevin Mullins in Letcher County, Kentucky, on Thursday. As the rural community processes the incident, more details are emerging about Stines' ongoing legal battles and his disposition in the days leading up to the shooting. Stines faces a civil lawsuit, filed by lawyer Ned Pillersdorf, alleging he ignored one of his subordinate's sexual abuse toward women on house arrest. The suit accuses Stines of 'deliberate indifference in failing to adequately train and supervise' the deputy, Ben Fields, CBS reports. Body found off Kentucky interstate identified as Joseph Couch 'In return for not reporting them for violating the terms of their probation, they would give sexual favors. Fields did that to approximately three women,' Pillersdorf said. Some of the abuses happened in Mullins' chambers, according to the attorney's client. 'The tie-in to Judge Mullins is, according to the plaintiff ... the sexual encounters occurred in the judge's chambers,' he said, later clarifying that at least one sexual encounter happened in the chambers itself and another in its bathroom. Earlier this year, Fields left the department, pleaded guilty to rape among other counts and was sentenced to six months in jail followed by 6 1/2 years on probation. The judge in that case was not Mullins but rather a judge from nearby Pike County. 84-year-old Mississippi minister robbed, beaten with rifle When asked if the civil suit has anything to do with Thursday's incident — or whether Judge Mullins knew about the abuse in his chambers — Pillsersdorf said there is no way to know right now.

'There's certainly been a lot of social media chatter, but no telling.'

(Kentucky Court of Justice via AP) Stines allegedly walked into the judge’s outer office, then told court employees and others gathered there that he needed to speak with Mullins alone, according to The Mountain Eagle. Shortly after the two walked into the judge’s chambers, shots were heard. Then, Stines walked out with his hands up and surrendered to police. State police say measures were made to attempt to save Mullins’ life, but none were successful. No other injuries were reported, according to NewsNation local affiliate WJHL.

Robinson won't be at Trump's North Carolina rally Saturday	North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson (R) will not be in attendance when former President Trump rallies supporters in the state Saturday, a source told The Hill. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Wilmington, two days after a bombshell CNN report about posts Robinson made on an online pornography forum between 2008 and 2012, including that he supported slavery and called himself a 'Black Nazi.' The former president has endorsed Robinson, who has vowed to stay in the race despite widespread criticism over his past remarks. Trump himself has not yet weighed in on Robinson since the latest report on his incendiary past remarks. The former president previously compared Robinson to Martin Luther King Jr., and Robinson was given a prominent speaking slot at July's GOP convention. Robinson attended a Trump rally in North Carolina in August. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign issued a statement that did not mention Robinson but called North Carolina a 'vital part' of the plan for winning the White House. 'We are confident that as voters compare the Trump record of a strong economy, low inflation, a secure border, and safe streets, with the failures of Biden-Harris, then President Trump will win the Tar Heel State once again. We will not take our eye off the ball,' national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. Republicans had already expressed concerns about Robinson’s viability as a candidate given the many controversial and derogatory statements he has made about various groups, including women and Jewish people. But the newest allegations further mire Robinson in controversy, with polls already showing him down by double digits to Democratic candidate Josh Stein, the state's attorney general. North Carolina will also be a pivotal state in determining the outcome of November's presidential election. Trump narrowly carried the state in 2020, but a Decision Desk HQ/The Hill average of polls from the state show Vice President Harris leading by 3.6 percentage points.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/robinson-wont-be-at-trumps-north-carolina-rally-saturday/	2024-09-20T12:46:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Robinson-Trump-09.20.png?w=900
RFK Jr., Olivia Nuzzi's reported relationship reviewed by NY Mag	(NewsNation) — New York Magazine has confirmed Washington correspondent Olivia Nuzzi is on leave after admitting to a 'personal relationship' with a previous subject she covered. In a statement to its readers Thursday night, New York Magazine said the relationship was with an individual 'relevant to the 2024 campaign.' 'Recently our Washington Correspondent Olivia Nuzzi acknowledged to the magazine’s editors that she had engaged in a personal relationship with a former subject relevant to the 2024 campaign while she was reporting on the campaign, a violation of the magazine’s standards around conflicts of interest and disclosures,' the statement read. 'Had the magazine been aware of this relationship, she would not have continued to cover the presidential campaign. An internal review of her published work has found no inaccuracies nor evidence of bias. She is currently on leave from the magazine, and the magazine is conducting a more thorough third-party review. We regret this violation of our readers’ trust.' Secret Service details failures preceding July Trump shooting Reporter Olivia Nuzzi arrives for the White House Correspondents' Association dinner at the Washington Hilton in Washington, DC, April 29, 2023. Nuzzi provided a statement of her own to Status, who first broke the news. It reported former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the subject with whom Nuzzi allegedly had a personal relationship. She told The New York Times on Thursday that 'some communication between myself and a former reporting subject turned personal' earlier in 2024. 'During that time, I did not directly report on the subject nor use them as a source,' Nuzzi told the outlet. 'The relationship was never physical but should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict. 'I deeply regret not doing so immediately and apologize to those I’ve disappointed, especially my colleagues at New York.' A Kennedy representative has told multiple outlets, including the Times, 'Mr. Kennedy only met Olivia Nuzzi once in his life for an interview she requested, which yielded a hit piece.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ny-mag-relationship-reporter-rfk-jr/	2024-09-20T10:50:09-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/RFK-HHS_090624_AP_Evan-Vucci_2a0d9a-e1725643840297.jpg?w=900
Live: Secret Service update on July Trump assassination attempt	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Communication breakdowns with local law enforcement hampered the U.S. Secret Service's performance ahead of the July attempt on former President Donald Trump’s life, according to a new report that lays out a series of missed opportunities to stop the gunman who opened fire from an unsecured roof. A five-page document summarizing the Secret Service report's key conclusions finds fault with both local and federal law enforcement, underscoring the cascading and wide-ranging failings that preceded the July 13 shooting at a Butler, Pennsylvania, campaign rally where Trump was wounded in the ear by gunfire. What went wrong? The report details a series of 'communications deficiencies' before the shooting by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot by a Secret Service counter-sniper after firing eight rounds in Trump's direction from the roof of a building less than 150 yards from where Trump was speaking. It makes clear that the Secret Service knew even before the shooting that the rally site posed a security challenge. Among the problems: Some local police at the site were unaware of the existence of two communications centers on the grounds, meaning officers did not know that the Secret Service was not receiving their radio transmission. Law enforcement also communicated vital information outside the Secret Service's radio frequencies. As officers searched for Crooks before the shooting, details were being transmitted 'via mobile/cellular devices in staggered or fragmented fashion' instead of through the Secret Service's own network. What is the Secret Service doing about it? The report's executive summary does not identify specific individuals who may be to blame nor does it indicate whether any staff members have been disciplined, though The Secret Service's investigation is one of numerous inquiries, including by Congress and a watchdog probe by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general office.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/secret-service-update-on-july-trump-assassination-attempt/	2024-09-20T09:52:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/66953219a7aff4.02450292.jpeg?w=900
$100 million judgment against Sean 'Diddy' Combs set aside	(NewsNation) — A $100 million judgment against hip-hop mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs was set aside by a Michigan judge this week after it was determined that a lawsuit claiming Combs sexually assaulted a man in 1997 was not properly served. The judge set aside the judgment against Combs — who remains behind bars on sex trafficking and racketeering charges in New York — after also ruling the man who brought it would likely not prevail due to the statute of limitations on sexual assault. The Michigan case stems from a 1997 incident that led Derrick Lee Cardello-Smith to file a civil lawsuit against Combs in June. Cardello-Smith is currently serving up to 75 years in prison after he was sentenced in 2008 on first-degree criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping charges, the Detroit Free Press reported. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs is ‘on suicide watch’: Former inmate The lawsuit claims Combs drugged and then sexually assaulted Cardello-Smith as other consensual sex involving women was taking place, according to media reports. Cardello-Smith claims Combs sexually assaulted him during a party at a hotel in 1997 before the two men, along with high-ranking Michigan law enforcement officials and other police officers, conspired not to prosecute Combs for the assault. The newspaper reported that Cardello-Smith would go to prison for 14 sexual assaults allegedly committed by Combs to protect his family from harm by Combs’ representatives or law enforcement. Earlier this month, a judge awarded Cardello-Smith the $100 million judgment against Combs after the rap mogul didn't show up in court to contend the case. The judge also issued a temporary restraining order that prevented Combs from selling any personal assets that he could use to pay for the judgment. However, this week, the judge ruled the lawsuit was not properly served. The lawsuit was mailed to a home that Combs owns in Los Angeles, but the judge ruled it was not mailed in compliance with court rules, the Free Press reported. Who else could be charged in the Diddy investigation? The law does not require lawsuits to be delivered to a potential defendant’s primary address but does require the sender to mail the lawsuit for restricted delivery. In court this week, Cardello-Smith, who is representing himself in the case, told Combs’ lawyer to tell his client that the matter was not resolved. According to Metro Times in Detroit, Cardello-Smith told the court he would file a motion to reconsider this week’s ruling. The judge has set a Nov. 4 hearing in the case.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/100-million-judgment-diddy-aside/	2024-09-20T08:57:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/GettyImages-1780945546_5cf865.jpg?w=900
House unanimously passes bill to bolster Trump’s security after a...	The House unanimously passed a bill on Friday that seeks to bolster former President Trump’s security, the first legislative move the chamber has made in response to the second apparent assassination attempt against the Republican presidential nominee. The House cleared the legislation — titled the Enhanced Presidential Security Act — in a bipartisan 405-0 vote, sending it to the Senate for consideration. It's unclear if the upper chamber plans to consider the measure, though similar legislation has been proposed by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.). House Republican leadership staged a vote on the legislation less than one week after a Secret Service spotted a gunman — later identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58 — hiding among trees and sticking a rifle through the fence at the Trump International Golf Club, where the former president was playing. A security team conducting a screening of the holes Trump was approaching spotted the gunman and fired shots at Routh, who fled the scene and was later arrested by local authorities. It was the second attempt on Trump’s life within 60 days. In July, a gunman opened fire at the former president’s rally in Butler, Pa., piercing Trump’s ear and leaving him bloodied on stage. The bill — introduced by Reps. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) and Ritchie Torres (R-N.Y.) after the first assassination attempt — requires the Secret Service to 'apply the same standards' for determining how many agents should be used to protect the president, vice president, and those running for those offices. The Secret Service has not commented on the pending legislation, but the purpose of the bill seems to clash with their own contention that Trump and Harris now have the highest levels of security. 'President Biden made it clear that he wanted the highest levels of protection for former President Trump and for Vice President Harris. Secret Service moved to sustain increases in assets and the level of protection … and those things were in place yesterday,' acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told reporters Monday. 'The President is aware that he has the highest levels of protection that Secret Service is providing him. …There’s a lot of tactical assets in place, things that have been put in place as a result of what happened 60 days ago. Those elements are working,' he added. The sitting president has the support of a vast infrastructure that includes the military to support the Secret Service posture. Candidates, meanwhile, have their Secret Service protection supplemented by local law enforcement. Trump has the same counter surveillance and counter sniper teams afforded to sitting presidents, along with protective intelligence and drone teams. Still, the president travels with other non-Secret Service assets, including those related to the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. The House voted on the legislation Friday as Congress continues to debate to provide the Secret Service with additional funding following the pair of assassination attempts. While some leaders have floated a funding increase, other lawmakers — including Johnson — have suggested that the issue is one of manpower allocation and not funding. The Speaker did, however, say he would be prepared to provide the agency with more money if deemed necessary. 'We have got to get down to the bottom of this. We got to ensure that this doesn't happen again,' Johnson said this week. 'If they need additional funding, Congress will supply that. But we're told it's a manpower problem.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/house-unanimously-passes-bill-to-bolster-trumps-security-after-apparent-assassination-attempt/	2024-09-20T08:30:09-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/trumpdonald_091924gn07_w.jpg?w=900
Three governors races to watch this November	(NewsNation) — As the 2024 general election comes into view, there are three gubernatorial races Americans should keep their eyes on: New Hampshire, North Carolina and Washington State. The incumbent governors in all three states have decided not to seek reelection this fall, leaving their seats wide open for a new name and potential party upset. In each of the three states, the close governor races could determine which way the state leans politically. When does early voting begin in my state?

(DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images) New Hampshire's Republican Gov. Chris Sununu has chosen not to seek a fifth term as governor, with the state being one of two where a governor is elected every two years. As a result, the seat is now up for grabs and has morphed into one of the few competitive governor races this year. The state has historically voted blue, with Democrats making up all four members of its Congressional delegation. But Republican Sununu also scored four terms as governor and Republicans hold the edge in the state legislature. The outgoing governor backed former Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who lost her Senate seat in 2016 to Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. Ayotte will face Democrat Joyce Craig, who served as mayor of Manchester and was backed by Hassan and Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey.

(Photo by Grant Baldwin/Getty Images) A potentially historic governor’s race pits North Carolina’s centrist tendencies against the rise of populist conservatism in the era of former President Donald Trump's Republican party. The Republican nominee is Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a 55-year-old who, if he wins, would be the state’s first Black governor. Democrats have chosen Attorney General Josh Stein, a 57-year-old who is trying to keep the office in his party’s control after two terms under outgoing Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Most polls in recent months have shown Stein leading Robinson, an ally of Trump who has drawn criticism for his past rhetoric on everything from abortion to the civil rights movement. Some Republicans fear Robinson’s controversial persona could cost them the governor’s mansion — and the challenge will be even tougher for him as Vice President Harris has seemingly made inroads in the state as well. Meanwhile, the state is also a must-win for Trump if he is to make it back to the White House in January. On Thursday, Robinson continued to come under fire after CNN published an article claiming he made disturbing racial and sexual comments on a pornography forum. Amid calls for him to step out of the race, Robinson defiantly announced in a video on X that he planned on staying in the race and denied the claims made in the article.

(Photo by Scott J. Ferrell/Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images) Washington has voted Democrats into the governor’s mansion since the mid-1980s, but this year, the race for Washington state's governor has emerged as unexpectedly competitive. Gov. Jay Inslee’s decision to retire attracted a crowded field of candidates for the state’s nonpartisan primary, from which Washington's Democratic Attorney General Bob Ferguson and former Republican Rep. Dave Reichert advanced to the November ballot. Ferguson, who’s been the state’s top attorney for more than a decade, has Inslee’s endorsement to succeed him. Reichert, a former sheriff, snagged recognition among constituents for helping catch Washington State’s 'Green River Killer.' Cook Political Report shifted the seat from 'solid' to 'likely' Democrat in February, and then again to 'lean' Democrat in June. After the primary, and after Harris launched her campaign, the race shifted back to 'likely' blue. But the election handicapper noted Reichert 'still has a path' to flipping the state. One Cygnal poll from late August found Ferguson up just three points.

Live: Titan hearing resumes with mission specialist testimony	(NewsNation) — The Titan submersible hearing is scheduled to resume Friday with testimony from another mission specialist who went on a dive aboard the OceanGate vessel that imploded last year while on its way to the wreckage of the Titanic. Mission specialist Fred Hagen is scheduled to be the first to testify Friday. Other witnesses have characterized mission specialists as people who paid a fee to play a role in OceanGate’s underwater explorations. The Coast Guard's investigatory panel has listened to three days of testimony that raised questions about the company’s operations before the doomed mission. The public hearing is part of a high-level investigation into the cause of the implosion. OceanGate co-founder and CEO Stockton Rush was among five people who died when the submersible imploded en route to the site of the Titanic wreck in June 2023. Earth will soon have a 'second moon' — sort of What has been learned so far? Mission specialist Renata Rojas was the latest person to testify before the investigatory panel Thursday. Rojas refuted testimony from previous witness David Lochridge regarding the OceanGate mission to the wreck of the Andrea Doria. She said that while the submersible did crash into the side of the wreck, there was no panicking or crying from passengers as Lochridge described. Lochridge labeled the experimental submersible unsafe before its last, fatal voyage. During questioning about her role in various dives, Rojas described the role she and other passengers played. She also likened the project to NASA's Apollo program of the 1960s, saying it was 'testing by doing.' In an emotional closing statement, Rojas said the loss of her friends was still very raw but 'exploration takes risks' and she hopes the implosion does not dampen innovation or other projects involving citizen scientists. On Monday, witnesses painted a picture of a troubled company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident sparked a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration. OceanGate said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began. The Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021. OceanGate Scientific Director Steven Ross also testified before the hearing wrapped Thursday. More witnesses are expected to testify with the hearing set to continue into next week.

(AP Photo/Anjum Naveed) The Titan, owned by OceanGate, made its last dive June 18, 2023. The craft lost contact with its support vessel an hour and 45 minutes into the dive. Five people were on board, diving 12,000 feet below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. The loss of communication launched a four-day search for the vessel, which ended when evidence of an implosion was found on the ocean floor. Officials concluded that the craft had been destroyed and all five people on board were killed. Few vessels dive that deep into the ocean, and engineers and experts in the field noted previous problems with the Titan as well as warnings that the submersible was unsafe. The search-and-recovery mission is estimated to have cost up to $1.6 million. The Coast Guard quickly convened a high-level investigation into what happened. Concerns leading up to the investigation included the Titan’s unconventional design and its creator’s decision to forgo standard independent checks. The investigation into the Titan implosion originally had a 12-month timeline but has been extended multiple times. In addition to Rush, the implosion killed two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.
