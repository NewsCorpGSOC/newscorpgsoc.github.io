Trump Cabinet appointees targeted in violent threats: transition ...	(NewsNation) — Several people who have been nominated for Cabinet positions in President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming administration have reportedly been targeted in 'violent, unAmerican' threats to their lives and those of their family members, Trump’s transition team said Wednesday. The threats were reportedly made Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, a Trump transition team spokesperson said. The attacks ranged from bomb threats to 'swatting.' 'President Trump and the Transition (team) are focused on doing the work of uniting our nation by ensuring a safe and prosperous future,' the spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement. 'With President Trump as our example, dangerous acts of intimidation and violence will not deter us.' Harris campaign is ‘self-congratulatory’: DNC committee member In response, law enforcement and other authorities acted quickly to ensure the safety of those who were targeted, Leavitt said. NewsNation has not yet confirmed with law enforcement that the threats took place. In a social media post on Wednesday, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, R-New York, wrote that they received word Thursday morning that their New York residence was the target of a bomb threat. Stefanik, Trump's pick for UN Ambassador, wrote that she, her husband, and their 3-year-old son were driving from Washington to New York when they were informed of the threat. She said that New York State Police and other law enforcement along with the U.S. Capitol Police, responded immediately 'with the highest levels of professionalism.' 'We are incredibly appreciative of the extraordinary dedication of law enforcement officers who keep our communities safe 24/7,' Stefanik wrote. 'We want to share our best wishes to the Update NY community for a happy and safe Thanksgiving. We are especially grateful to our law enforcement officers and military families are are on duty over the holidays.' A recent CBS News/YouGov poll, meanwhile, shows that 59% of the people surveyed approve of the way Trump is handling his transition back to the White House. For instance, 44% of those asked thought Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio would be a good choice for Secretary of State. There were 47% who felt that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a good choice to be Secretary for Health and Human Services, and 33% thought the same of Fox News host Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense. Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence was thought of as a good choice by 36% of people. Leavitt did not say how many Cabinet nominees had been targeted or which of those people nominated for spots in Trump's admininstration reportedly received threats. This is a developing story.

China releases 3 Americans in prisoner swap	(NewsNation) — China has released three American prisoners who were detained for at least eight years, White House officials confirmed Wednesday. Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung were freed after years of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials, according to Politico, which first reported the prisoner swap. Fugitive on FBI’s ‘Most Wanted Terrorist’ list captured after more than 20 years on run Full details of the swap were not immediately clear. The news comes about two months after China released 68-year-old California pastor David Lin, who was detained for almost 20 years. 'We are pleased to announce the release of Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and John Leung from detention in the People’s Republic of China,' a State Department spokesperson said. 'Soon they will return and be reunited with their families for the first time in many years. Thanks to this Administration’s efforts and diplomacy with the PRC, all of the wrongfully detained Americans in the PRC are home.' The number of Americans considered wrongfully detained has sky-rocketed since 2012, according to the James Foley Legacy Foundation. This story is developing.

US economy grows at 2.8% pace in third quarter on consumer spendi...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The American economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% annual pace from July through September on strong consumer spending and a surge in exports, the government said Wednesday, leaving unchanged its initial estimate of third-quarter growth. The Commerce Department reported that growth in U.S. gross domestic product — the economy's output of goods and services — slowed from the April-July rate of 3%. But the GDP report still showed that the American economy — the world's largest — is proving surprisingly durable. Growth has topped 2% for eight of the last nine quarters.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Still, American voters — exasperated by high prices — were unimpressed by the steady growth and chose this month to return Donald Trump to the White House to overhaul the nation's economic policies. He will be supported by Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, accelerated to a 3.5%% annual pace last quarter, up from 2.8% in the April-June period and fasted growth since the first quarter of 2023. Exports also contributed to the third quarter’s growth, increasing at a 7.5% rate, most in two years. Still, the third-quarter growth in both consumer spending and exports was lower than the Commerce Department initially estimated. But growth in business investment slowed sharply on a drop in investment in housing and in nonresidential buildings such as offices and warehouses. By contrast, spending on equipment surged. When he takes office next month, President-elect Trump will inherit an economy that looks broadly healthy. Growth is steady. Unemployment is low at 4.1%. Inflation, which hit a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022, has fallen to 2.6%. That is still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, but the central bank felt satisfied enough with the progress against inflation to cut its benchmark interest rate in September and again this month. Most Wall Street traders expect the Fed to cut rates again in December. Mexico suggests imposing its own tariffs in response to Trump's The public still feels inflation's sting: Prices are about 20% higher than they were in February 2021, just before inflation started picking up Trump has promised an economic shakeup. On Monday, for example, he vowed to slap new import taxes on goods from China, Mexico and Canada. Mainstream economists view such taxes — or tariffs — as inflationary. That is because they are paid by U.S. importers, who then seek to pass along the higher costs to their customers. Wednesday's report was the second of three looks at third-quarter GDP. The Commerce Department will issue the final report on Dec. 19. © Copyright 2023 Associated Press.

Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire appears to hold and Lebanese begin str...	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — A ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah appeared to be holding Wednesday, as residents in cars heaped with belongings streamed back toward southern Lebanon despite warnings from the Israeli and Lebanese military that they stay away from certain areas. If it holds, the ceasefire would bring an end to nearly 14 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which escalated in mid-September into all-out war and threatened to pull Hezbollah's patron Iran and Israel into a broader conflagration. It could give some reprieve to the 1.2 million Lebanese displaced by the fighting and the tens of thousands of Israelis who fled their homes along the border with Lebanon. 'They were a nasty and ugly 60 days,' said Mohammed Kaafarani, 59, who was displaced from the Lebanese village of Bidias. 'We reached a point where there was no place to hide.' The U.S.- and France-brokered deal, approved by Israel late Tuesday, calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. Thousands of additional Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor compliance. Israel says it reserves the right to strike Hezbollah should it violate the terms of the deal. The deal would not address the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, where Israel is still fighting Hamas militants in response to the group’s cross-border raid into southern Israel in Oct. 2023. But President Joe Biden on Tuesday said his administration would make another push in the coming days to try to renew efforts for a deal there. Lebanese are streaming south despite warnings Hours before the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon took effect, Israel launched broad strikes that shook the Lebanese capital Beirut and a volley of rockets from Hezbollah set off air raid sirens across a large swath of northern Israel. But after the ceasefire began early Wednesday, quiet appeared to take hold, prompting waves of Lebanese to head home. Israel’s Arabic military spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned displaced Lebanese not to return to their villages in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military said forces opened fire to push back vehicles that were entering a restricted area. The Lebanese military asked displaced returning to southern Lebanon to avoid frontline villages and towns near the border where Israeli troops are still present until they withdraw. But some videos circulating on social media show displaced Lebanese defying these calls and returning to villages in the south near the coastal city of Tyre. Israeli troops were still present in parts of southern Lebanon after Israel launched a ground invasion in October. On the highway linking Beirut with south Lebanon, thousands of people drove south with their belongings and mattresses tied on top of their cars. Traffic was gridlocked at the northern entrance of the port city of Sidon. Residents will return to vast destruction wrought by the Israeli military during its campaign, which flattened villages where the military said it found vast weapons caches and infrastructure it says was meant to launch an Oct. 7-style attack on northern Israel. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon the past 13 months, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. Hezbollah emerges from the war battered and bloodied, with the reputation it built by fighting Israel to a stalemate in the 2006 war tarnished. Yet its fighters still managed to put up heavy resistance on the ground, slowing Israel’s advance while continuing to fire scores of rockets, missiles and drones across the border each day. 'This is a moment of victory, pride and honor for us, the Shia sect, and for all of Lebanon,' said Hussein Sweidan, a resident returning to Tyre in southern Lebanon, who said he saw the ceasefire as a victory for Hezbollah. Sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard at a main roundabout in the city, as people returning honked the horns of cars and residents cheered. Some Israelis are concerned the deal doesn't go far enough In Israel, the mood was far more subdued, with displaced Israelis concerned that the deal did not go far enough to rein in Hezbollah and that it did not address Gaza and the hostages still held there. 'I think it is still not safe to return to our homes because Hezbollah is still close to us,' said Eliyahu Maman, an Israeli displaced from the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona, which is not far from the border with Lebanon and was hit hard by the months of fighting. On Wednesday morning, Kiryat Shmona remained quiet on a cold, rainy day. A handful of people milled about, inspecting damage from earlier rocket attacks, including to the roof of a bus. The town’s shopping mall, which had been hit before, appeared to have new damage, and a rocket was seen stuck in the ground next to an apartment building. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel, more than half civilians, as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon. A significant return of the displaced to their communities, many of which have suffered extensive damage from rocket fire, could take months. But Israel can claim major victories in the war, including the killing of Hezbollah’s top leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of its senior commanders, as well as the destruction of extensive militant infrastructure. A complex attack involving exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, widely attributed to Israel, appeared to show a remarkable degree of penetration of the secretive militant group. The kinds of massive, long-range rocket barrages that many Israelis had feared before the war never fully materialized, either because they were destroyed by Israeli strikes or Hezbollah held them in reserve. Hezbollah also failed to launch any ground attacks across the border, despite evidence presented by the Israeli military that it had invested heavily in preparing for such operations. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

Hannah Kobayashi may have been taken by stranger: Former FBI agen...	(NewsNation) — The disappearance of Hannah Kobayashi has taken a tragic turn, with experts suggesting she may have been 'snatched' and her father dying by suicide during the search, according to law enforcement and search professionals. Former FBI agent Jennifer Coffindaffer and Dog the Bounty Hunter told NewsNation they believe Kobayashi, 30, may have been taken by a stranger after unusual circumstances surrounding her last known movements in Los Angeles. Kobayashi was last seen on Nov. 11 after missing a connecting flight from Maui to New York. She was reportedly seen at the Grove shopping mall and at a LeBron James event before sending cryptic text messages claiming she had been 'tricked' and that 'Deep State hackers' had stolen her funds. Coffindaffer said law enforcement is carefully reviewing extensive surveillance footage from the airport and train station where Kobayashi was last seen. 'I think she could be in the hands of a stranger taking advantage of her,' Coffindaffer told NewsNation's 'CUOMO.' Hannah Kobayashi: Timeline of Hawaiian woman’s disappearance Dog the Bounty Hunter, whose daughter knew Kobayashi, suggested she was potentially 'snatched' and expressed hope she is still alive. He also noted the text messages did not sound like Kobayashi's typical communication style. The search has been further complicated by the death of Kobayashi's father, Ryan, who took his own life after searching for his daughter for 13 days. According to the Los Angeles Police Department’s Missing Persons Unit, Kobayashi is 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighs about 140 pounds. She has brown hair and eyes and fair skin with freckles as well as a tattoo that says 'knife' on her forearm. Authorities continue to investigate the disappearance. Anyone with information is urged to contact local law enforcement.

Harris campaign is 'self-congratulatory': DNC committee member	(NewsNation) — A DNC finance committee member said the Harris campaign was 'self-congratulatory' during a call with top donors Tuesday, making no mention of what the party could have done better. Lindy Li, a member of the DNC finance committee, told NewsNation she was 'stunned that there was no sort of postmortem or analysis of the disastrous campaign.' 'It was just patting each other on the back,' Li said. 'They praised Harris as a visionary leader, and at one moment during the call, she was talking about her Thanksgiving recipe.'

The Harris campaign appears to have imploded following her Election Day loss to President-elect Donald Trump, and the internal strife has led some staffers to leave altogether. The campaign is now $20 million in debt, per a source familiar with the campaign. Obama, Pelosi did not want Kamala Harris to be nominee: Democratic megadonor Li, on behalf of confused voters and disappointed donors, has been speaking out about the party’s financial woes and frustrations. She called party leaders 'detached from reality' after they discussed how more than $1 billion was spent during the nearly 110-day campaign during an interview with 'Pod Save America' Tuesday. 'They failed to mention that hundreds of millions of dollars went to them and their friends right through these consulting firms. These consultants were the primary beneficiaries of the Harris campaign, not the American people,' Li said. Li said the many in the inner workings of the party share similar frustrations in the aftermath of the election. Kamala Harris disqualified ‘forever’ over Democratic overspending: Donor The Harris campaign can still raise money to recoup some of these debts and pay those who still need it. According to the Federal Election Commission, some House and Senate campaigns end with outstanding debts, such as those owed to campaign vendors. Roll Call, in March 2023, reported that 18 members of the House and Senate started the year with campaign committees with at least $100,000 in unpaid bills. 'If they [the DNC] don't have an explanation as to what happened with the billions of dollars and why hundreds of millions went to consultants, ice cream, private jets, celebrities, I don't think donors are going to be willing to give again,' Li said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/dnc-harris-campaign-self-congratulatory/	2024-11-26T14:01:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/672bffe3aa48e7.87321731.jpeg?w=900
Appeals court agrees to end Trump’s classified documents case	The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday granted a request from special counsel Jack Smith to drop President-elect Trump’s Florida documents case, ending the battle to charge him over retaining records with classified markings after leaving office. The order fulfills a request from Smith to end an appeal in the case as it relates to Trump though the case continues for his two co-defendants – valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira. The move comes after Smith similarly moved to dismiss without prejudice Trump’s election interference case, in both cases noting Trump’s coming inauguration and a DOJ policy that bars the prosecution of sitting presidents. In the classified documents case, Smith was fighting a ruling from Judge Aileen Cannon that tossed the case, determining that the special counsel was unlawfully appointed. Legal observers saw the appeal as having a fair chance of success. Cannon’s decision counters 50 years of prior rulings regarding special counsel regulations, and the court has previously reversed one of her decisions. Nonetheless, it brings to an end for Trump a serious case focused largely on his conduct after leaving the White House. It was potentially the stronger of Smith’s two cases after a Supreme Court ruling that determined former presidents retain broad immunity for their conduct while in office. Prosecutors brought both Espionage Act and obstruction of justice charges against Trump after he repeatedly refused requests to return White House records, including defying a subpoena. An unprecedented search of his estate at Mar-a-Lago returned more than 300 documents with classified markings, with photos showing boxes stored in a bathroom and even on a ballroom stage.

Middle East latest: Israel's Netanyahu announces support for a ce...	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that he would recommend his Cabinet adopt a United States-brokered ceasefire agreement with Lebanon’s Hezbollah, as Israeli warplanes struck across Lebanon, killing at least 23 people. The Israeli airstrikes and evacuation warnings were in a sign that Netanyahu aims to inflict punishment on Hezbollah in the final moments before any ceasefire takes hold. Hezbollah, meanwhile, had resumed its rocket fire into Israel, triggering air raid sirens across the country's north. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon the past 13 months, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The bombardment has driven 1.2 million people from their homes. Hezbollah began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel, in support of the Palestinian militant group. That has set off more than a year of fighting escalated into all-out war in September with massive Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon and an Israeli ground invasion of the country’s south. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israeli military bases, cities and towns, including some 250 projectiles on Sunday. It’s not clear how the ceasefire will affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, where more than 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 wounded in the 13-month war between Israel and Hamas, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. ——— Here's the Latest: Netanyahu recommends his Cabinet approve a Hezbollah cease-fire proposal JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that he would recommend his Cabinet adopt a United States-brokered ceasefire agreement with Lebanon’s Hezbollah, as Israeli warplanes struck across Lebanon, killing at least 23 people. The Israeli military also issued a flurry of evacuation warnings — a sign it was aiming to inflict punishment on Hezbollah down to the final moments before any ceasefire takes hold. For the first time in the conflict, Israeli ground troops reached parts of Lebanon’s Litani River, a focal point of the emerging deal. In a televised statement, Netanyahu said he would present the ceasefire to Cabinet ministers later on Tuesday, setting the stage for an end to nearly 14 months of fighting. Netanyahu said the vote was expected later Tuesday. It was not immediately clear when the ceasefire would go into effect, and the exact terms of the deal were not released. The deal does not affect Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, which shows no signs of ending. Israeli strikes in Lebanon’s south and east kill at least 13 people BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state media said Israeli strikes on Tuesday killed at least 10 people in Baalbek province the country’s east. At least three people were killed in the southern city of Tyre when Israel bombed a Palestinian refugee camp, said Mohammed Bikai, a representative of the Fatah group in the area. He said several more people were missing and at least three children were among the wounded. He said the sites struck inside the camp were 'completely civilian places' and included a kitchen that was being used to cook food for displaced people. Israelis protest for a Gaza hostage release deal JERUSALEM — Dozens of Israeli protesters took to a major highway in Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening to call for the return of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, as the country awaited news of a potential ceasefire in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah. Protesters chanted 'We are all hostages,' and 'Deal now!' waving signs with faces of some of the roughly 100 hostages believed to be still held in Gaza, at least a third of whom are thought to be dead. Most of the other hostages Hamas captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack were released during a ceasefire last year. The prospect of a ceasefire deal in Lebanon has raised desperation among the relatives of captives still held in Gaza, who once hoped that the release of hostages from Gaza would be included. Instead of a comprehensive deal, the ceasefire on the table is instead narrowly confined to Lebanon. Dozens of Israelis were also demonstrating against the expected cease-fire, gathering outside Israel’s military headquarters in central Tel Aviv. One of the protesters, Yair Ansbacher, says the deal is merely a return to the failed 2006 U.N. resolution that was meant to uproot Hezbollah from the area. 'Of course that didn’t happen,' he says. 'This agreement is not worth the paper it is written on.' G7 leaders endorse Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire and insist Israel follow international law FIUGGI, Italy — Foreign ministers from the world’s industrialized countries said Tuesday they strongly supported an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah and insisted that Israel comply with international law in its ongoing military operations in the region. At the end of their two-day summit, the ministers didn’t refer directly to the International Criminal Court and its recent arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister over crimes against humanity. Italy had put the ICC warrants on the official meeting agenda, even though the G7 was split on the issue. The U.S., Israel’s closest ally, isn’t a signatory to the court and has called the warrants 'outrageous.' However, the EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell said all the other G7 countries were signatories and therefore obliged to respect the warrants. In the end, the final statement adopted by the ministers said Israel, in exercising its right to defend itself, 'must fully comply with its obligations under international law in all circumstances, including international humanitarian law.' And it said all G7 members — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States – 'reiterate our commitment to international humanitarian law and will comply with our respective obligations.' It stressed that 'there can be no equivalence between the terrorist group Hamas and the State of Israel.' The ICC warrants say there's reason to believe Netanyahu used 'starvation as a method of warfare' by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeted civilians in Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza — charges Israeli officials deny. Israel strikes in central Beirut kill at least 7 people and wound 37 BEIRUT — An Israeli strike on Tuesday levelled a residential building in the central Beirut district of Basta — the second time in recent days warplanes have hit the crowded area near the city’s downtown. At least seven people were killed and 37 wounded in Beirut, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. It was not immediately clear if anyone in particular was targeted, though Israel says its airstrikes target Hezbollah officials and assets. The Israeli military spokesman issued a flurry of evacuation warnings for many areas, including areas in Beirut that have not been targeted throughout the war, like the capital’s commercial Hamra district, where many people displaced by the war have been staying. The warnings, coupled with fear that Israel was ratcheting up attacks in Lebanon during the final hours before a ceasefire is reached, sparked panic and sent residents fleeing in their cars to safer areas. In areas close to Hamra, families including women and children were seen running away toward the Mediterranean Sea’s beaches carrying their belongings. Traffic was completely gridlocked as people tried to get away, honking their car horns as Israeli drones buzzed loudly overhead. The Israeli military also issued warnings for 20 more buildings in Beirut’s suburbs to evacuate before they too were struck — a sign it was aiming to inflict punishment on Hezbollah in the final moments before any ceasefire takes hold. Independent Israeli commission blames Netanyahu and others for October 2023 attack TEL AVIV, Israel — The independent civilian commission of inquiry into the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel has found Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly responsible for the failures leading up to the attack, alongside former defense ministers, the army chief and the heads of the security services. The civil commission presented its findings today after a four-month probe in which it heard some 120 witnesses. It was set up by relatives of victims of the Hamas attack, in response to the absence of any state probe. The commission determined that the Israeli government, its army and security services 'failed in their primary mission of protecting the citizens of Israel.' It said Netanyahu was responsible for ignoring 'repeated warnings' ahead of Oct. 7, 2023 for what it described as his appeasing approach over the years toward Hamas, and for 'undermining all decision-making centers, including the cabinet and the National Security Council, in a way that prevented any serious discussion' on security issues. The commission further determined that the military and defense leaders bear blame for ignoring warnings from within the army, and for reducing the army’s presence along the Gaza border while relying excessively on technological means. On the day of the Hamas attack, the report says, the army’s response was both slow and lacking. The civil commission called for the immediate establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack. Netanyahu has opposed launching a state commission of inquiry, arguing that such an investigation should begin only once the war is over. Israeli ground troops in Lebanon reach the Litani River JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says its ground troops have reached parts of Lebanon’s Litani River — a focal point of the emerging ceasefire. In a statement Tuesday, the army said it had reached the Wadi Slouqi area in southern Lebanon and clashed with Hezbollah forces. Under a proposed ceasefire, Hezbollah would be required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the Israeli border. The military says the clashes with Hezbollah took place on the eastern end of the Litani, just a few kilometers (miles) from the border. It is one of the deepest places Israeli forces have reached in a nearly two-month ground operation. The military says soldiers destroyed rocket launchers and missiles and engaged in 'close-quarters combat' with Hezbollah forces. The announcement came hours before Israel’s security Cabinet is expected to approve a ceasefire that would end nearly 14 months of fighting. Israeli airstrikes hit buildings near Beirut airport BEIRUT — Israeli jets Tuesday struck at least six buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs Tuesday, including one that slammed near the country’s only airport. Large plumes of smoke could be seen around the airport near the Mediterranean coast, which has continued to function despite its location beside the densely populated suburbs where many of Hezbollah’s operations are based. The strikes come hours before Israel’s cabinet was scheduled to meet to discuss a proposal to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The proposal calls for an initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River. There were no immediate reports of casualties from Tuesday’s airstrikes. EU top diplomat calls for urgent aid to Gaza FIUGGI, Italy — EU top diplomat Josep Borrell, whose term ends Dec. 1, said he proposed to the G7 and Arab ministers who joined in talks on Monday that the U.N. Security Council take up a resolution specifically demanding humanitarian assistance reach Palestinians in Gaza, saying deliveries have been completely impeded. 'The two-state solution will come later. Everything will come later. But we are talking about weeks or days,' for desperate Palestinians, he said. 'Hunger has been used as an arm against people who are completely abandoned.' It was a reference to the main accusation levelled by the International Criminal Court in its arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister. Borrell said the signatories to the court, including six of the seven G7 members, are obliged under international law to respect and implement the court’s decisions. Host Italy put the ICC warrants on the G7 agenda at the last minute, but there was no consensus on the wording of how the G7 would respond given the U.S., Israel’s closest ally, has called the warrants 'outrageous.' Italy, too, has said it respects the court but expressed concern that the warrants were politically motivated and ill-advised given Netanyahu is necessary for any deal to end the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Like it or not, the International Criminal Court is a court as powerful as any national court,' Borrell said. 'And if the Europeans don’t support International Criminal Court then there would not be any hope for justice,' he said.

Obama, Pelosi did not want Kamala Harris to be nominee: Democrat ...	(NewsNation) — Democratic megadonor John Morgan joined 'CUOMO' on Monday night to discuss the failed Harris-Walz campaign, claiming former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not want Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee to replace President Joe Biden. Biden stepped down from the presidential race in July, amid pressure from high-ranking Democratic figures. He endorsed Harris no less than an hour later, while former President Obama took five days to endorse Harris on his X page. Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi did not want Kamala Harris 'He did not want to go gently,' Morgan said of Biden. 'He nominated her, basically Obama did not want her. Obama did not endorse her for five days, Pelosi did not want her.' According to Morgan, Biden's endorsement of Harris was an 'F you' to Obama and Pelosi. Democratic overspending disqualifies Harris ‘forever’: Megadonor 'I think it was to say, F you to Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama and every representative that was pushing him out... and I think he was pissed,' Morgan told Cuomo. No vote for Kamala Harris as Democratic nominee Morgan said another stumbling block for the Democrats was that voters did not choose Harris in the primaries or caucuses and instead was set in motion by Biden's decision to swiftly nominate his No. 2. 'Pelosi told her California delegation, there will be a conference, there will be a caucus, there will be a convention,' Morgan said, a point touched upon by many Republican politicians and commentators during the process. 'We basically ran on this deal where 'democracy, democracy!' And then we didn't have democracy in picking our nominee.' You can watch the full interview with Morgan on CUOMO in the player below. The failure of Kamala Harris' campaign Morgan, who admitted he did not personally donate to Harris's campaign, criticized the way the campaign handled its funds, saying it could put her presidential future in doubt. Morgan's critique comes amid multiple reports the Harris campaign is $20 million in debt after a lavish spending spree. The megadonor claimed those alleged squandered campaign funds should permanently disqualify her from running for president again. How will Trump’s tariffs impact everyday Americans? 'The same thing is going to follow Harris for the rest of her career. She cannot be trusted with the money, and the donors are going to be, like, ‘Where is this money?'' he said. Lindy Li, a member of the DNC finance committee, told NewsNation’s Rich McHugh the internal strife and monetary confusion at the center of the party led some staffers to leave altogether. The Harris campaign has denied there are any outstanding debts or bills. Morgan argued that despite Harris's performance in the presidential debate against President-elect Donald Trump, her history showed she was unsuitable to take on the Republican party this election cycle. 'We already saw what she looked like on the national stage,' Morgan said. 'Look, she's got to be talented to have done what she did in California. I'll give her that. 'But she was not ready for prime time, and then they rolled her out in prime time, and she got destroyed.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/obama-pelosi-did-not-want-harris-democratic-megadonor/	2024-11-26T09:59:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2180864136.jpg?w=900

Mexico suggests it would impose its own tariffs to retaliate agai...	MEXICO CITY (AP) — President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican goods if the country doesn’t stop the flow of drugs and migrants across the border. Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues, but said drugs were a U.S. problem. 'One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,' Sheinbaum said, referring to U.S. automakers that have plants on both sides of the border. She said Tuesday that Mexico had done a lot to stem the flow of migrants, noting 'caravans of migrants no longer reach the border.' She also said Mexico had worked to stem the flow of drugs like the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl, despite an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States. She said the flow of drugs 'is a problem of public health and consumption in your country’s society.' Sheinbaum also criticized U.S. spending on weapons, saying the money should instead be spent regionally to address the problem of migration. 'If a percentage of what the United States spends on war were dedicated to peace and development, that would address the underlying causes of migration,' she said. Sheinbaum’s bristly response suggests that Trump faces a much different Mexican president than he did in his first term. Back in late 2018, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump. The two were eventually able to strike a bargain in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border — and received other countries’ deported migrants — and Trump backed down on the threats. But Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump. However, it's not clear how serious Trump’s threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it’s not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt. 'It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,' Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. 'Dialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,' Sheinbaum said. 'I hope our teams can meet soon.' Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent U.S. Census data. Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows. 'On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,' he wrote, complaining that 'thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,' even though violent crime is down from pandemic highs. He said the new tariffs would remain in place 'until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!' 'Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power,' he went on, 'and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-mexico-suggests-it-would-impose-its-own-tariffs-to-retaliate-against-any-trump-tariffs/	2024-11-26T06:58:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6745dd41adb339.50622463.jpeg?w=900
Israel bombards central Beirut as its leadership prepares to vote...	BEIRUT (AP) — Israeli warplanes struck central Beirut and the city's southern suburbs on Tuesday, raising palls of smoke over the Lebanese capital ahead of a planned vote by Israel's leadership on whether to accept a U.S.-brokered ceasefire aimed at ending more than a year of fighting with Hezbollah. The Israeli military also issued warnings for 20 more buildings in Beirut's suburbs to evacuate before they too were struck — a sign it was aiming to inflict punishment on Hezbollah down to the last moments before any ceasefire takes hold. Israeli ground troops also reached parts of Lebanon’s Litani River for the first time in the conflict— a focal point of the emerging ceasefire. A ceasefire was still not a sure thing, but Israel’s security Cabinet, meeting Tuesday afternoon, was expected to approve the U.S.-backed proposal. Lebanese officials have said Hezbollah also supports the deal. If approved by all sides, the deal would be a major step towards ending the Israel-Hezbollah war that has inflamed tensions across the region and raised fears of an even wider conflict between Israel and Hezbollah's patron, Iran. The deal calls for a two-month initial halt in fighting and would require Hezbollah to end its armed presence in a broad swath of southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops would return to their side of the border. Thousands of Lebanese troopsand U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor all sides’ compliance. But implementation remains a major question mark. Israel has demanded the right to act should Hezbollah violate its obligations. Lebanese officials have rejected writing that into the proposal. Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz insisted on Tuesday that the military would strike Hezbollah if the U.N. peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, doesn’t provide 'effective enforcement' of the deal. 'If you don’t act, we will act, and with great force,' he said, speaking with U.N. special envoy Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert. The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said Tuesday that Israel’s security concerns had been addressed in the U.S.-French-brokered deal. 'There is not an excuse for not implementing a ceasefire. Otherwise, Lebanon will fall apart,' Borrell told reporters in Fiuggi, Italy, on the sidelines of a Group of Seven meeting. He said the U.S. would chair a ceasefire implementation committee, and France would participate at the request of Lebanon. Bombardment of Beirut's southern suburbs continues Even as Israeli, U.S, Lebanese and international officials have expressed growing optimism over a ceasefire, Israel has continued its campaign in Lebanon, which it says aims to cripple Hezbollah’s military capabilities. An Israeli strike on Tuesday levelled a residential building in the central Beirut district of Basta - the second time in recent days warplanes have hit the crowded area near the city’s downtown. There were no immediate report of casualties. It was not immediately clear if anyone in particular was targeted, though Israel says its airstrikes target Hezbollah officials and assets. Earlier, Israeli jets struck at least six buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs Tuesday. One strike slammed near the country’s only airport, sending large plumes of smoke into the sky. The airport has continued to function despite its location on the Mediterranean coast next to the densely populated suburbs where many of Hezbollah’s operations are based. Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee issued evacuation warnings for 20 buildings in the suburbs, as well as a warning for the southern town of Naqoura where UNIFIL is headquartered. Other strikes hit in the southern city of Tyre, where the Israeli military said it killed a local Hezbollah commander. The Israeli military also said its ground troops clashed with Hezbollah forces and destroyed rocket launchers in the Slouqi area on the eastern end of the Litani River, just a few kilometers (miles) from the border. Previous ceasefire hopes were dashed Under the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah would be required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the Israeli border. A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the strongest Iranian-backed force in the region, would likely significantly calm regional tensions that have led to fears of a direct, all-out war between Israel and Iran. It’s not clear how the ceasefire will affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Hezbollah had long insisted that it would not agree to a ceasefire until the war in Gaza ends, but it dropped that condition. Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel, saying it was showing support for the Palestinians, a day after Hamas carried out its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, triggering the Gaza war. Israel returned fire on Hezbollah, and the two sides have been exchanging barrages ever since. In early September, Israel escalated its campaign of bombardment and sent troops into Lebanon, vowing to put an end to Hezbollah fire. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon the past 13 months, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The bombardment has driven 1.2 million people from their homes. Israel says it has killed more than 2,000 Hezbollah members. Hezbollah fire has forced some 50,000 Israelis to evacuate homes in the country’s north, and its rockets have reached as far south in Israel as Tel Aviv. At least 75 people have been killed, more than half of them civilians. More than 50 Israeli soldiers died fighting in the ground offensive in Lebanon. After previous hopes for a ceasefire were dashed, U.S. officials cautioned that negotiations were not yet complete and noted that there could be last-minute hitches that either delay or destroy an agreement. 'Nothing is done until everything is done,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. While the ceasefire proposal is expected to be approved if Netanyahu brings it to a vote in his security Cabinet, one hard-line member, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, said he would oppose it. He said on X that a deal with Lebanon would be a 'big mistake' and a 'missed historic opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah.' ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israel-bombards-beirut-suburbs-as-its-leadership-prepares-to-vote-on-ceasefire-with-hezbollah/	2024-11-26T05:41:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6745d04fa61e23.09179355.jpeg?w=900
Tom Homan, Trump's new border leader, meets with Texas Gov. Greg ...	(NewsNation) — The nation’s incoming border leader Tom Homan is heading to Texas, where’s expected to tour the southern border with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. They’ll be in Eagle Pass on Tuesday, which has been a focus of the state's Operation Lone Star program. Trump pledges Mexico, Canada, China tariffs over border, fentanyl Abbott says Homan is the man for the job — and so does President-elect Donald Trump, who appointed him Homan to the position. Touring the border Homan and Abbott will begin their tour at a Texas military base along the banks of the Rio Grande. Border officials say migrant crossings are down thanks to seasonal trends, federal executive action and Operation Lone Star. 'Priorities for the mass deportation operation are public safety threats and national security threats, Homan said. He’ll be visiting National Guard soldiers and Texas Department of Public Safety troopers stationed on the border in areas like Edinburg. It’s a region Ron Vitello, a former U.S. Border Patrol chief and retired Immigration and Customs Enforcement director knows firsthand. 'It's well known for drug trafficking,' Vitello said. 'It has, for generations, been a place where cartels have elected used to smuggle a lot of drugs.' Land for mass deportations In that same well-known area, Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham is hosting a 'border wall construction kick-off' event. Buckingham is offering a 1,400-acre ranch to the incoming Trump administration for mass deportation facilities. 'We think it's so important for our communities to shut down this trafficking this mass migration of illegal immigrants and get our community safe again,' she said. Homan has promised drastic changes in U.S. border security, including mass deportations on day one of the Trump administration.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/morninginamerica/tom-homan-border-visit-wall-construction/	2024-11-26T05:01:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/HomanTom_061322_AP_Matt-York_4abc2b-e1731322259758.jpg?w=900
Biden proposes Medicare and Medicaid cover costly weight-loss dru...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning. The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services immediately sets the stage for a showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the agency, could block the measure. While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade. 'It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,' U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. 'It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.' The rule would not be finalized until January, days after Trump takes office. A bipartisan coalition of congressional members has lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity. While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag. Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese — someone who has a body mass index of 30 or higher — would qualify for coverage. Some people may already get coverage of the drugs through Medicare or Medicaid, if they have diabetes or are at risk for stroke or heart disease. Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese. Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs. The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the Food and Drug Administration approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound to treat obesity. People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat. The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies. Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. should not cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships. 'For half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,' Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-biden-proposes-medicare-and-medicaid-cover-costly-weight-loss-drugs-for-millions-of-obese-americans/	2024-11-26T03:43:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6745b56c72e325.67875198.jpeg?w=900
Trump pledges Mexico, Canada, China tariffs over border, fentanyl	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump on Monday proposed aggressive economic measures against Mexico, Canada and China over concerns about border security and drug trafficking. Trump called for a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, citing the influx of migrants and drugs across the United States' borders. 'As everyone is aware, thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,' Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. 'On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders.' The former president also addressed the issue of fentanyl, specifically targeting China's role in the drug trade. How will Trump’s tariffs impact everyday Americans? Trump claimed he had previously discussed the matter with Chinese representatives, who reportedly promised the 'maximum penalty' of death for drug dealers. However, he alleged that no substantial action was taken. As a result, Trump proposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese products, which would be layered on top of existing trade restrictions. Trump pledged during his campaign to impose import taxes of 10 to 20% on all foreign goods, with tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. Canada, Mexico and China are the U.S.’s largest trading partners. Trump’s threat comes days after he announced he would nominate investor Scott Bessent as his Treasury secretary. His selection makes Bessent a key player in implementing Trump trade’s agenda and attempting to keep markets calm amid the expected disruption. American farmers brace for new tariffs under Trump The former president rattled financial markets and key U.S. trading partners throughout his first term with his tariff agenda. Trump imposed tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum — including from Canada and Mexico, two close U.S. allies — citing national security concerns. He also compelled both countries to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with terms meant to boost U.S. manufacturing and improve compliance with labor laws. Trump’s most aggressive actions, however, were focused on China. The former president imposed tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese goods as he pressured Beijing to renegotiate major aspects of the U.S.-China economic relationship.

2-year-old migrant crosses border alone looking for parents in US	(NewsNation) — A 2-year-old girl from El Salvador, traveling alone with nothing more than a piece of paper bearing a phone number, was found by Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) officials, spotlighting the growing crisis of unaccompanied migrant children at the U.S. southern border. Lt. Chris Olivarez told NewsNation that the child was part of a larger group of 60 unaccompanied minors encountered in Eagle Pass ranging in age from 2 to 17 years old. The toddler carried a single piece of paper with a phone number and a name, claiming her parents were already in the United States. 'We don't know who this little girl is going to end up with or who is that person behind that phone number,' Olivarez said. An August Department of Homeland Security report revealed that more than 32,000 unaccompanied children failed to attend immigration hearings between 2019 and 2023, with another nearly 300,000 never receiving a court date. Trump’s mass deportation plans create anxiety among immigrants The child was examined for signs of abuse and turned over to Border Patrol, with her ultimate destination uncertain. Olivarez speculated that increased migration might be linked to potential political changes, suggesting 'desperation to get more kids across by themselves' as a new administration approaches. The Texas DPS reported encountering 211 immigrants in Maverick County, including the 60 unaccompanied children and six immigrants from Mali and Angola. 'This is a stark example of the precarious journey these children make,' Olivarez said in a post on X, highlighting the risks of human trafficking and the vulnerability of unaccompanied minors. National Guard training for mass illegal crossings at border The agency claims to have rescued over 900 children during Operation Lone Star from potential abandonment and human smuggling. Last week, Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, released a report claiming that 'failures' by President Joe Biden’s administration have led to the 'exploitation and abuse of migrant children.' Cassidy launched a formal investigation more than a year and a half ago into the administration’s policies on the treatment and care of unaccompanied children after he said he noticed an alarming rise in illegal child labor.

Surveillance footage shows Hannah Kobayashi Nov. 11, 2024: Family members say Kobayashi was spotted on surveillance video around 10 p.m. in downtown LA near the Pico Metro Station. That's roughly a block away from the Crypto.com Arena and near LAX. Pidgeon said the unreleased surveillance footage showed Kobayashi was not alone and that she did not look well in the video. Kobayashi was wearing the same clothing she had worn when she arrived from Maui. Pidgeon told NewsNation that Kobayashi had 'no reason' to visit the metro stop so late at night 'unless she was misled, unless she was forced to or, unfortunately, now we’re thinking, unless she was drugged.' It's unknown when the surveillance video was shown to Kobayashi's family, and it has not yet been released to the public. Family files missing person report for Kobayashi Nov. 12: Following the alarming texts, Kobayashi's family files a formal missing persons report in California. The LAPD Missing Persons Unit posts on social media about her disappearance. Concerned loved ones rally outside Crypto.com Arena Nov. 21, 2024: The rally, held just blocks from where Kobayashi was last seen, calls for her return home. It takes place the same day as the Los Angeles Lakers and Orlando Magic's game, a move to hopefully find new leads in her case. Since there is no hard evidence of a crime or foul play, the family fears her case is not a priority to officers. Hannah Kobayashi's aunt: Police taking case seriously Nov. 22, 2024: Pidgeon tells NewsNation's 'Banfield' that the entire family is playing the 'waiting game' as police have started taking her disappearance more seriously. Unsolved Ohio: Columbus woman missing for nearly seven years Hannah Kobayashi's father found dead near LAX Nov. 24, 2024: Ryan Kobayashi, the father of missing woman Hannah Kobayashi, was found dead in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport around 4 a.m. In a statement posted on Facebook by the RAD Movement, a nonprofit organization that works to find people, the organization confirmed the 58-year-old 'tragically took his own life.' The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office and LAPD confirmed his identity. The family said the loss has compounded their suffering 'immeasurably.' 'What the family needs most in this difficult time is for all communities to rally around them with support, compassion, and prayers,' the statement said. 'Please be considerate with your comments and posts. The trauma they are enduring is profound, and they now face the additional burden of grieving the loss of their family’s pillar and navigating next steps.'

Canada braces for surge of immigrants hoping to move from US	(NewsNation) — Canada is bracing for a surge of immigrants to cross the United States' northern border as President-elect Donald Trump continues to press for the largest domestic deportation in American history after he takes office in January. Canadian officials are preparing to add more border patrols and vehicles and plan to set up emergency reception facilities along the border of New York state and the province of Quebec in anticipation of the large number of new arrivals, The New York Times reported. The plans come amid Trump’s pledge to use U.S. military assets and state and local law enforcement to locate and apprehend immigrants with criminal convictions. Meanwhile, Tom Homan, Trump’s appointed 'border czar,' the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has claimed that the northern border may be vulnerable because of insufficient checks that are made on people attempting to enter the U.S. During Trump’s first term in the White House, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau conveyed that his country would be friendly to asylum-seekers at a time when Trump pushed to tighten security along the southern border and threatened to separate families. However, Trudeau recently announced that Canada will significantly reduce the number of immigrants it allows into the country. The Associated Press reported that Trudeau’s Liberal government had come under fire for plans to allow up to 500,000 new permanent residents to enter Canada in each of the next two years. Texas DPS launches first border mounted patrol unit Last week, however, Trudeau said that the figure would drop to 396,000 new permanent residents in 2025 and 380,000 in 2026, the AP reported. In 2027, the number of new permanent residents will drop to 365,000, the prime minister vowed. 'In the tumultuous times as we emerged from the pandemic, between addressing labor needs and maintaining population growth, we didn’t get the balance right,' Trudeau told reporters in Toronto, according to the AP. 'Immigration is essential for Canada’s future, but it must be controlled, and it must be sustainable.' Trump responded to Trudeau’s new plans to limit new permanent residents on social media. 'Even Justin Trudeau wants to close Canada’s Borders,' Trump wrote on the Truth Social platform, according to the AP. Trump’s mass deportation plans create anxiety among immigrants Despite the limits announced by the prime minister last week, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have announced plans to bolster the number of agents and vehicles it has along the Canadian border. The agency anticipates a spike in new arrivals into Canada even before Trump is sworn into office on January 20, a spokesman for the agency told the New York Times. 'We knew that if Mr. Trump came into power, the status quo at the border would change,' Sgt. Charles Poirier said. In addition to the Royal Canadian Police, other national security agencies have been preparing for an influx of immigrants moving north in anticipation of Trump’s plan to begin the mass deportation efforts, The New York Times reported. Canadian authorities are also planning to draw up an agreement between Canada and the U.S. to send people seeking asylum back across the border after they cross over, the report said. The newspaper reported that the pact designates both countries as 'safe third countries' so that when asylum-seekers travel from one country to the other, they can be sent back.

Menendez brothers resentencing hearing moved to January	(NewsNation) — A judge is allowing more time for the incoming Los Angeles District Attorney to consider the Menendez brothers case before moving forward with a possible resentencing. The outgoing DA recommended resentencing for Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989. A hearing date was initially set for December, but the judge has now pushed the resentencing hearing to the end of January. Woman charged after car left hanging from parking garage The judge did allow testimony from two elderly witnesses in the family on Monday, one in her 90s and another in her 80s, The murder of Jose and Kitty Menendez In 1989, Jose and Kitty Menendez were shot and killed in their Beverly Hills, California, home. The crime shocked the public and initial speculation included the possibility that it was a mob hit related to Jose Menedez's work in the entertainment industry. Lyle and Erik Menendez were arrested months after their parents' death. During the investigation and their trials, media attention focused on their behavior following the murders, including spending money on apartments, designer clothes and cars. The brothers' first trial ended in a mistrial and in 1994, both men were given life sentences without the possibility of parole. The trials of Lyle and Erik Menendez Defense attorneys argued that both Lyle and Erik Menendez had been sexually abused by their father from a young age and were afraid for their lives. At the time of the murders, both men were legally adults, something the prosecution pointed to as a reason they could have left home instead of killing their parents. Prosecutors characterized the crime as one of greed because they believed they were being written out of their parents' will. 4 kids die in crash when driver takes photo of Florida welcome sign In the first trial, witnesses for the defense included cousins who said they were aware the brothers were being sexually abused. In the second trial, testimony around alleged abuse was limited as were the number of witnesses that could be called. Another controversial element of both trials was evidence from the brothers' psychiatrist, Jerome Oziel, in the form of tapes of therapy sessions. The tapes were allowed after Oziel alleged they had threatened him, allowing him to break patient confidentiality. However, the tapes were initially brought to the attention of investigators not by Oziel himself, but by his former mistress who was also a patient of his. Resentencing recommendation for Lyle and Erik Menendez Last month, Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón announced he supported resentencing the brothers to a sentence of 50 years to life, which would make them eligible for parole immediately. The announcement came following increased public attention to the decades-old case, much of it from social media, with many of the advocates being younger users who weren't alive when the case first took place. Father of missing Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi found dead near LAX Other factors include additional evidence that has been unearthed that supports the claims of sexual abuse and changes in how society understands childhood sexual abuse. At the time of the trial, some suggested it wasn't possible for boys to be abused and there was less public discussion about the long-term psychological impacts of that kind of abuse.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/menendez-brothers-resentencing-january/	2024-11-25T12:16:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6722c1e6434b13.34519485.jpeg?w=900
Trump's mass deportation plans create anxiety among immigrants	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump and his 'border czar' Tom Homan have promised swift action in apprehending and removing immigrants who entered the United States illegally, stoking fear among some asylum seekers who worry they will be forced to leave the country in which many are just starting to settle. Deportation doesn’t set well with Anangela Hernandez, who is among the more than 50,000 immigrants sent to Chicago from Texas. She arrived from Venezuela via Texas with her husband and two children in January. Hernandez agrees immigrants with criminal convictions should not have refuge here. But she worries, like others awaiting asylum or temporary protective status, that she and her family could be targeted by the new administration. Confessions of a cartel hunter: Man frees 200 sex trafficked victims 'Our fear is that the new president comes with other expectations as far as immigrants are concerned,' Hernandez told NewsNation in Spanish. Trump has pledged the largest domestic deportation in American history. Trump and Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), insist their initial primary focus will be criminals who pose a security threat. Tom Homan speaks as Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump listens at a primary election night party in Nashua, N.H., Jan. 23, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke/ File) But Homan doesn’t stop there. 'If you’re in the country illegally, you’re in violation of law, so you’re not off the table,' Homan told NewsNation’s 'CUOMO.' Immigrants worry for their future under Donald Trump Although she entered the country via the CBP One app, Hernandez understood her chosen means of entry came with no long-term guarantees. Hernandez and her husband recently appeared in court in Chicago to submit their asylum application months after receiving their work permits. Although she is convinced the couple is on the right track toward legal U.S. residency, Trump and Homan’s comments stir up emotions. 'He should not go against good working people,' Hernandez said. Homan told 'CUOMO' that the current asylum system allows too many migrants to enter the U.S. based on an initial screening with a 'very low' threshold of proof. In a '60 Minutes' interview this fall, Homan was asked about how mass deportations could happen without separating families. He replied, 'That's not a problem. Families can be deported together.' That is especially concerning for Leticia Alvarez, who arrived in Chicago after making the journey from Venezuela while pregnant. She gave birth to a daughter in March in a Chicago hospital but endured much of her pregnancy alone after her husband, Lisandro Escola, was held in a detention center for seven months in Texas after the couple surrendered after crossing the border. Leticia Alvarez gave birth to her daughter in March in a Chicago hospital after she and her family arrived in late 2023 from Venezuela. (Photo courtesy of Leticia Alvarez) Alvarez previously told NewsNation that she remains uncertain why her husband was detained. He was released just weeks before the couple’s daughter arrived. Knowing that she along with Escola, her infant daughter, husband, and sister could be forced to leave under Trump’s mass deportation plan is difficult enough, she said. But considering the amount of time Escola was detained in Texas creates more anxiety because of Trump’s and Homan's promise to prioritize convicted immigrants. 'It’s something that worried me and that still worries me and my husband,' she told NewsNation in Spanish last week. 'And we’re all that he has,' she also said. Trump’s border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, along with other leaders of Democratic-led sanctuary cities have pledged to protect immigrant families from mass deportation efforts. Homan and Trump have responded by saying that sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts will risk losing federal funding. Despite the threats, Hernandez told NewsNation she refuses to live in fear as an example to her 10-year-old son and 7-year-old son. Instead, she said she and will continue to put trust in the system they used to enter the country. 'We are Venezuelans with a good heart and a faith that is greater than anything else and if we are here, it is because (God) allowed us to be,' Hernandez said in Spanish. 'We cannot wait, nor can we be rushed into something that has not happened yet.' The effort to help protect migrants In Denver, officials with the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, said immigrants are bracing for what is coming under Trump. The new administration’s promises and rhetoric surrounding immigrants have created an environment of uncertainty, stress, and fear, the group’s development director, Marine Brichard, said. CIRC recently hosted more than 150 immigrants for a post-election briefing in which many of these concerns were voiced. The organization is planning workshops that instruct immigrants to know the difference between ICE agents and police and to help them understand their legal rights should they appear in court or face deportation. 13 migrants rescued from remote, rugged area of Big Bend Lisa Koop, the national director of legal services for the National Immigration Justice Center, told NewsNation that immigrants have good reason to be fearful. She said they should be considering an action plan that includes speaking to an immigration attorney to better navigate uncertain times. Koop’s office has received an uptick of inquiries from immigrants who are in various stages of waiting for asylum or temporary protective status. Even for those who have been granted immigration protection that affords them some levels of due process, Koop said many fear that could all be stripped away once Trump takes office. 'To me, it’s a great sadness that our country maybe no longer feels like a welcoming place of refuge or is choosing not to be a place of refuge in some ways,' Koop said. Koop believes the process could be expedited because Trump has a better understanding of his presidential power as he prepares for a second White House term. In practice, Koop said enforcement of mass deportation could happen in cycles if officials carry through with targeting convicted immigrants first and then considering others later. But she doesn’t believe that makes everyone else safe. 'I think there is a pretty broad fear and concern about what comes next,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/trumps-mass-deportation-anxiety-immigrants/	2024-11-25T11:24:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1258485376.jpg?w=900
Special counsel moves to dismiss election interference, documents...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal judge on Monday to dismiss the case accusing President-elect Donald Trump of plotting to overturn the 2020 election, citing longstanding Justice Department policy shielding presidents from prosecution while in office. The move announced in court papers marks the end of the Justice Department's landmark effort to hold Trump accountable for what prosecutors called a criminal conspiracy to cling to power in the run-up to his supporters' attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Justice Department prosecutors, citing longstanding department guidance that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted, said the department’s position is that 'the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.'

'That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government’s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Government stands fully behind,' the prosecutors wrote in Monday’s court filing. Federal prosecutors also moved Monday to abandon the classified documents case against Trump in light of longstanding Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot face criminal prosecution. The announcement in an appeals court filing in Florida came shortly after a similar filing to dismiss the case accusing Trump of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. The move amounts to a predictable but nonetheless stunning conclusion to a criminal case that just one year ago had been seen as the most perilous legal threat that he faced. It reflects the practical consequences of Trump’s victory, ensuring he enters office free from scrutiny over his hoarding of top secret documents and conduct that prosecutors said had jeopardized national scrutiny. The dismissal had been foreshadowed in recent weeks by the revelation that special counsel Jack Smith was evaluating how to wind down both that case and a separate pending prosecution he brought charging Trump with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Justice Department legal opinions dating back decades say sitting presidents cannot be indicted or prosecuted while in office. The Justice Department believes Trump can no longer be tried in accordance with longstanding policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted. Trump has cast both cases as politically motivated, and had vowed to fire Smith as soon as he takes office in January. The 2020 election case brought last year was once seen as one of the most serious legal threats facing the Republican as he vied to reclaim the White House. But it quickly stalled amid legal fighting over Trump’s sweeping claims of immunity from prosecution for acts he took while in the White House. The U.S. Supreme Court in July ruled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, and sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine which allegations in the indictment, if any, could proceed to trial. The case was just beginning to pick up steam again in the trial court in the weeks leading up to this year’s election. Smith’s team in October filed a lengthy brief laying out new evidence they planned to use against him at trial, accusing him of using 'resorting to crimes' in an increasingly desperate effort to overturn the will of voters after he lost to President Joe Biden.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/special-counsel-moves-to-dismiss-election-interference-case-against-president-elect-donald-trump/	2024-11-25T10:33:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24311784190911-e1732559417189.jpg?w=800

(NewsNation) — The father of Hanna Kobayashi, a Maui woman who went missing in California, was found dead near Los Angeles International Airport early Sunday morning. At 4 a.m. Sunday, officers responded to the 6100 block of West Century Boulevard for a death investigation, the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement. An investigation by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office revealed the decedent to be 58-year-old Ryan Kobayashi, according to the LAPD. NBC LA reports that he died after jumping from a parking structure. In a statement posted on Facebook by the RAD movement, a non-profit organization that works to find people, the family said the loss has compounded their suffering 'immeasurably.'

Senators sound alarm over TSA face scan technology	(NewsNation) — Travelers at dozens of airports can expect to have their faces scanned with the Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) facial recognition technology. A bipartisan group of senators is sounding the alarm over the technology this morning, calling it 'out of control.' AAA predicts an uptick in travelers this holiday season, putting security technology and TSA manpower to the test at busy airports. Facial recognition technology will be used in a few dozen airports, and the TSA0 plans to expand it to more than 430 airports. Forecasts warn of possible winter storms across US during Thanksgiving week Not everyone feels comfortable with its test run before a full review. Senators Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and John Kennedy, R-La., along with bipartisan support, sent over a letter last week to the TSA inspector general, asking the office to look into the facial recognition technology. They feel it poses risks to passengers' civil liberties. 'This technology will soon be in use at hundreds of major and mid-size airports without an independent evaluation of the technology's precision or audit of whether there are sufficient safeguards in place to protect passenger privacy,' the letter stated. The TSA declined to comment on any discussions with the inspector general but said it will cooperate fully with any possible audit that may happen. TSA Administrator David Pekoske says biometrics such as facial recognition will eventually be required across the board for its efficiency and efficacy. Thanksgiving travel: Which dishes are TSA-approved? For now, the TSA and its administrator stress facial recognition is optional and in no way mandatory. They told NewsNation the technology is the most secure form of identity verification and that they do not retain any personal data from passengers. If you want to opt out of a face scan at an airport, all you have to do is tell the TSA you decline facial recognition. You can proceed normally through security by presenting an identification document, such as a driver's license or passport.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/senators-alarm-tsa-face-scan-technology/	2024-11-25T05:52:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/TSAGettyImages-2166907456-e1724161672354.jpg?w=800
Trump transition: Poll shows people approve of picks for new admi...	(NewsNation) — Lawmakers and leaders have been making their case for and against some of the people President-elect Donald Trump is picking for his incoming administration. A CBS News/YouGov poll, meanwhile, shows that 59% of the people surveyed approve of the way Trump is handling his transition back to the White House. For instance, 44% of those asked thought Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio would be a good choice for Secretary of State. There were 47% who felt that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a good choice to be Secretary for Health and Human Services, and 33% thought the same of Fox News host Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense. Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence was thought of as a good choice by 36% of people. What did Brendan Carr, Trump’s FCC chair pick, say in Project 2025? Although Trump's current selections for agency heads and cabinet picks were rated as a net-positive by those who took CBS' poll, the news outlet notes many had not heard enough about the nominees to rate them yet. There was also a clear partisan divide — however, fewer than half of Democrats polled say they're feeling motivated to actively oppose Trump at this stage. Along with the new administration, Americans are also feeling optimistic about Trump's policies. According to the poll, 44% of people thought that Trump's actions would make food and grocery prices drop, and 35% thought they would cause them to go up. On immigration, 57% are in favor of Trump's planned mass deportations of migrants in the country illegally. When it comes to who should carry those deportations out, 82% said immigration and border patrol agencies should do it; 64% want to leave it to federal law enforcement, and 40% think it should be the U.S. military.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-transition-people-approve-new-admin-picks/	2024-11-25T04:45:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24310038373142-e1731155969822_e32711-e1732201082917.jpg?w=900
Charlotte airport workers strike at outset of busy Thanksgiving t...	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Service workers at Charlotte Douglas International Airport have gone on strike during a busy week of Thanksgiving travel to protest what they say are unlivable wages. Employees of ABM and Prospect Airport Services cast ballots Friday to authorize the work stoppage in North Carolina, which a spokesperson said began Monday morning. Officials with Service Employees International Union announced the impending strike in a statement early Monday, saying the workers would demand 'an end to poverty wages and respect on the job during the holiday travel season.' ABM and Prospect Airport Services contract with American Airlines to provide services including cleaning airplane interiors, removing trash and escorting passengers in wheelchairs. Workers say they previously raised the alarm about their growing inability to afford basic necessities, including food and housing. They described living paycheck to paycheck, unable to cover expenses like car repairs while performing jobs that keep countless planes running on schedule. 'We’re on strike today because this is our last resort. We can’t keep living like this,' ABM cabin cleaner Priscilla Hoyle said in a statement. 'We’re taking action because our families can’t survive.' Several hundred workers were expected to walk off the job and continue the work stoppage throughout Monday. Most of them earn between $12.50 and $19 an hour, which is well below the living wage for a single person with no children in the Charlotte area, union officials said. Charlotte Douglas International Airport officials have said this holiday travel season is expected to be the busiest on record, with an estimated 1.02 million passengers departing the airport between last Thursday and the Monday after Thanksgiving. In addition to walking off the job, striking workers plan to hold an 11 a.m. rally and a 1 p.m. 'Strikesgiving' lunch 'in place of the Thanksgiving meal that many of the workers won’t be able to afford later this week,' union officials said. 'Airport service workers make holiday travel possible by keeping airports safe, clean, and running,' the union said. 'Despite their critical role in the profits that major corporations enjoy, many airport service workers must work two to three jobs to make ends meet.' ABM said it would take steps to minimize disruptions from any demonstrations. 'At ABM, we appreciate the hard work our team members put in every day to support our clients and help keep spaces clean and people healthy,' the company said in a statement last week. Prospect Airport Services said last week that the company recognizes the seriousness of the potential for a strike during the busy holiday travel season.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/ap-charlotte-airport-workers-plan-to-strike-during-busy-thanksgiving-travel-week/	2024-11-25T02:24:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/674450f1353b36.02415033.jpeg?w=900
Forecasts warn of possible winter storms across US during Thanksg...	WINDSOR, Calif. (AP) — Another round of wintry weather could complicate travel leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday, according to forecasts across the U.S., while California and Washington state continue to recover from storm damage and power outages. In California, where two people were found dead in floodwaters on Saturday, authorities braced for more rain while grappling with flooding and small landslides from a previous storm. The National Weather Service office in Sacramento, California, issued a winter storm warning for the Sierra Nevada through Tuesday, with heavy snow expected at higher elevations and wind gusts potentially reaching 55 mph (88 kph). Total snowfall of roughly 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast, with the heaviest accumulations expected Monday and Tuesday. The Midwest and Great Lakes regions will see rain and snow Monday and the East Coast will be the most impacted on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, forecasters said. A low pressure system is forecast to bring rain to the Southeast early Thursday before heading to the Northeast. Areas from Boston to New York could see rain and breezy conditions, with snowfall possible in parts of northern New Hampshire, northern Maine and the Adirondacks. If the system tracks further inland, there could be less snow and more rain in the mountains, forecasters said. 'The system doesn’t look like a powerhouse right now,' Hayden Frank, a meteorologist with the weather service in Massachusetts, said Sunday. 'Basically, this is going to bring rain to the I-95 corridor so travelers should prepare for wet weather. Unless the system trends a lot colder, it looks like rain.' Frank said he isn't seeing any major storm systems arriving for the weekend anywhere in the country so travelers heading home Sunday can expect good driving conditions. Temperatures, however, will get colder in the East while warming up out West. More rain expected after deadly 'bomb cyclone’ on West Coast Two people died in the Pacific Northwest after a rapidly intensifying ' bomb cyclone ' hit the West Coast last Tuesday, bringing fierce winds that toppled trees and power lines and damaged homes and cars. Hundreds of thousands lost electricity in Washington state before powerful gusts and record rains moved into Northern California. Fewer than 25,000 people in the Seattle area were still without power Sunday evening. Two bodies were found Saturday in Sonoma County wine country, north of San Francisco, authorities said. Someone walking on a trail near Santa Rosa found the body of a man in a swollen creek, according to the sheriff's department. Hours later, rescue crews recovered a body inside a vehicle bobbing in floodwaters in nearby Guerneville, Deputy Rob Dillion said. Investigators are trying to determine if the deaths were storm-related. Santa Rosa saw its wettest three-day period on record with about 12.5 inches (32 centimeters) of rain by Friday evening, the National Weather Service in the San Francisco Bay Area reported. Vineyards in nearby Windsor were flooded. Forecasters said the risk of flooding and mudslides remained as the region gets more rain starting Sunday. But the latest storm won't be as intense as last week's atmospheric river, a long plume of moisture that forms over an ocean and flows over land. 'However, there’s still threats, smaller threats, and not as significant in terms of magnitude, that are still going to exist across the West Coast for the next two or three days,' weather service forecaster Rich Otto said. As the rain moves east throughout the week, Otto said, there’s a potential for heavy snowfall at higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada, as well as portions of Utah and Colorado. California's Mammoth Mountain, which received 2 feet (.6 meters) of fresh snow in the recent storm, could get another 4 feet (1.2 meters) before the newest system clears out Wednesday, the resort said. Northeast gets needed precipitation Into Thanksgiving, parts of the Midwest and East Coast can expect to see heavy rain, and there’s potential for snow in Northeastern states. A storm last week brought rain to New York and New Jersey, where wildfires have raged in recent weeks, and heavy snow to northeastern Pennsylvania. The precipitation was expected to help ease drought conditions after an exceptionally dry fall. 'It’s not going to be a drought buster, but it’s definitely going to help,' said Bryan Greenblatt, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Binghamton, New York. Heavy snow fell in northeastern Pennsylvania, including the Pocono Mountains. Higher elevations reported up to 17 inches (43 centimeters), with lesser accumulations in valley cities including Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. Around 35,000 customers in 10 counties were still without power, down from 80,000 a day ago. In the Catskills region of New York, nearly 10,000 people remained without power Sunday morning, two days after a storm dumped heavy snow on parts of the region. Precipitation in West Virginia helped put a dent in the state’s worst drought in at least two decades and boosted ski resorts as they prepare to open in the weeks ahead.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/ap-forecasts-warn-of-possible-winter-storms-across-us-during-thanksgiving-week/	2024-11-24T18:34:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6743e2d005fa46.62812347.jpeg?w=900
Donald Trump Jr., Elon Musk joke about purchasing MSNBC	(The Hill) -- Donald Trump Jr. and tech billionaire Elon Musk joked on Friday about purchasing MSNBC. It started with Trump Jr., President-elect Trump’s oldest son, sharing a meme about MSNBC being up for sale. Trump Jr. quote-tweeted the meme Friday on X and said 'Hey @elonmusk I have the funniest idea ever!!!' 'How much does it cost,' Musk replied. Musk later responded to the viral interaction, saying the sale would be 'the most entertaining outcome,' while suggesting it would be 'ironic.' Senate Intelligence Committee to ask Gabbard ‘lots of questions’: Lankford The exchange occurred just two days after Comcast, one of the largest media conglomerates in the nation, said it planned to spin off NBCUniversal assets, including USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, to 'create a new publicly traded company.' Comcast did not mention any indication it would be open to selling MSNBC. Musk’s exchange with Trump Jr. is similar to one he had with a Twitter user in 2017 after he was encouraged to purchase the social media platform. 'How much is it' Musk wrote in December of 2017. In 2022, he bought the social media platform, which was later renamed to X, for $44 billion. Popular podcaster Joe Rogan chimed in on the banter on Friday, telling Musk on X that if the billionaire would buy MSNBC, Rogan would like to replace MSNBC star host Rachel Maddow. New Arizona Democrat weighs in on her win and Harris’s loss 'If you buy MSNBC I would like Rachael Maddow’s job,' Rogan wrote. 'I will wear the same outfit and glasses, and I will tell the same lies.' Some of MSNBC’s hosts, including Maddow, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, have been long-time critics of Trump. The co-hosts of MSNBC’s 'Morning Joe' said on Monday that they went to Mar-a-Lago last week to meet with Trump to discuss toning down the political rhetoric and unifying the country. Brzezinski said it was the first time they met face-to-face with the president-elect in seven years, a meeting that sparked backlash from critics and viewers. Following Trump’s win in the 2024 presidential election over Vice President Harris, MSNBC viewership is down 38 percent, The Wrap reported on Thursday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/musk-msnbc-comcast-trump/	2024-11-24T16:23:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24318569633728-e1731532012925_3d1ae4-e1732493115731.jpg?w=800
GOP rep pushes back on Hegseth’s idea to fire 'woke' generals	Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) pushed back on Pete Hegseth’s idea to fire 'woke' generals, noting that they are only considered 'woke' because of the Biden administration. Bacon joined NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt on 'The Hill Sunday,' where he noted that as a member of the House, he’s not going to have a say when Hegseth undergoes the Senate confirmation process as President-elect Trump's nominee for Defense secretary. Still, he believes some senators will take issue with some of his 'character issues,' including multiple marriages, infidelity and sexual assault allegations. 'I think I’m in agreement with 90% of what he has to say. I would like to push back on one thing though,' Bacon said, noting Hegseth’s idea for generals. During an interview, President-elect Trump’s new Defense secretary pick outlined proposals to 'fire' the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other 'woke' generals. Hegseth argued that anyone involved with diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts has 'got to go.' Bacon noted Sunday that many of those generals may not have wanted to push DEI efforts but were instructed by President Biden to do so. 'He’s the commander in chief and they’re gonna follow the orders of the civilian leadership proposal,' he said.

Drones detected near 3 US bases in England last week: Air Force	(NewsNation) — Small drones were spotted last week around three U.S. Air Force bases in eastern England, the military branch confirmed Saturday. Between Wednesday and Friday, multiple unidentified drones were detected near RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell, which are used by American forces. The drones were actively monitored after being seen near and over the three bases, U.S. Air Forces Europe said in a statement. 'To protect operational security, we do not discuss our specific force protection measures but retain the right to protect the installation,' the Air Force told the Associated Press. 'We continue to monitor our airspace and are working with host-nation authorities and mission partners to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities, and assets.' 2016 UFO mystery has been solved, Pentagon says The Air Force didn’t identify who was behind the incursions but said base officials determined there was no impact on residents or critical infrastructure. 'We take threats seriously and maintain robust measures at defence sites. This includes counter-drone security capabilities,' a British Ministry of Defense spokesperson told NewsNation. 'We won’t comment further on security procedures.' The Pentagon confirmed with NewsNation that it is looking into the unidentified drones. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/drones-detected-us-bases-england/	2024-11-24T12:59:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/airforce.jpg?w=900
What did Brendan Carr, Trump’s FCC chair pick, say in Project 202...	(NewsNation) — Brendan Carr, Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for chair of the Federal Communications Commission, outlined what he wants to see happen at the agency in a chapter for Project 2025. In a statement released after Trump won the election, Carr said 'the FCC will have an important role to play reining in Big Tech, ensuring that broadcasters operate in the public interest, and unleashing economic growth' — all topics he touched on in Project 2025. Project 2025 is a handbook from conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, as well as other organizations, outlining what policies and practices they want the next presidential administration to implement. While Trump disavowed the plan on the campaign trail, many people who have worked closely with the President-elect and helped shaped his last administration are involved with the plan. Along with Carr, there are several contributors and authors to Project 2025 whom Trump has chosen for his incoming administration including Russell Vought and Tom Homan. Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt maintained in a statement to the Associated Press that Trump did not have anything to do with Project 2025, and that his nominees and appointments are 'whole-heartedly committed to President Trump’s agenda, not the agenda of outside groups.' Carr was appointed to the FCC by Trump in 2017, and currently serves as one of its commissioners. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Brendan Carr wrote FCC chapter in Project 2025 The objectives Carr outlined in Project 2025 include 'reining in big tech, protecting America's national security, unleashing economic prosperity and holding government accountable.' Those who Carr considers 'big tech' are companies such as Google, Facebook and Youtube, who he says 'attempt to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.' 'The FCC has an important role to play in addressing the threats to individual liberty posed by corporations that are abusing dominant positions in the market,' Carr wrote. Section 230 Supporting legislation that 'scraps Section 230's current approach' is part of addressing big tech, Carr said. Section 230 is a section of the Communications Act of 1934 that makes it so online platforms are not held liable for content posted by their users, and so these companies can remove posts that violate their services' standards. In Project 2025, Carr advocated for the FCC working with Congress on 'more fundamental Section 230 reforms that go beyond interpreting its current terms.' Some of the reforms Carr has in mind are ones that prohibit discrimination against what he said were core political viewpoints. 'Transparency rules' are another requirement Carr wants to impose on tech companies. The FCC presently has a rule that broadband providers have to provide disclosures about practices that shape Internet traffic. Carr in Project 2025 suggests that the FCC take a similar approach to 'Big Tech,' and use Section 230 and the Consolidated Reporting Act as potential sources of authority. Progressives begin search for a new leader National Security Although Trump has said he opposes prohibiting TikTok in America, Carr wrote that he wants to address its 'threat to U.S. national security.' Saying the app 'provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information' provided to users, Carr said a new administration should ban TikTok. TikTok says on its website that while its parent company ByteDance Ltd. was founded by Chinese entrepreneurs, about 60% of it is owned by global investors, 20% by co-founders and 20% by employees 'around the world.' Earlier this year, Democratic President Joe Biden signed a law mandating ByteDance divest from TikTok or it would be banned. Auchincloss: Senate must reject ‘dangerous’ RFK Jr. as HHS head Carr also wants the Trump administration to create a more 'regular and timely process' for reviewing entities that have ties to China, and have the FCC do a better job of ensuring that a list of communications equipment and services that pose a risk to natural security stays up to date. Loopholes allowing companies such as China Telecom that are banned from operating in the United States to continue providing very similar services in America should be closed, Carr wrote. Economic Opportunity When it comes to boosting economic prosperity, Carr wrote that one of the most 'significanttechnological developments of the past few years' has been low-earth orbit satellites like SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's StarLink and Amazon's Kuiper. 'This technology can beam a reliable, high-speed Internet signal to nearly any part of the globe at a fraction of the cost of other technologies,' Carr wrote. 'The FCC should expedite its work to supportthis new technology by acting more quickly in its review and approval of applications to launch new satellites. Otherwise, the U.S. risks ceding space leadership to entities based in countries with more friendly regulatory environments.' Reuters reports that Carr was a harsh critic of the FCC’s decision not to finalize nearly $900 million in broadband subsidies for Starlink. It's a decision Reuters said the incoming FCC chair said would likely not be revisited. Carr also wrote that the FCC and new administration need to work together to develop a national spectrum strategy identifying specific airwaves that can be freed for commercial wireless services. House passes Social Security bill, will the Senate? Eliminating Regulations As a 'New Deal-era agency,' Carr wrote, the FCC's history of regulation is heavy-handed rather than allowing 'competition and market forces to produce optimal outcomes.' Rapidly evolving market conditions favor eliminating these regulations, Carr argued, including many of the FCC's media ownership rules. 'Ultimately, FCC reliance on competition and innovation is vital if the agency is to deliver optimal outcomes for the American public,' Carr wrote. 'The FCC should engage in a serious top-to-bottom review of its regulations and take steps to rescind any that are overly cumbersome or outdated.' Dr. Oz’s disputed health claims could jeopardize Senate confirmation Project 2025 ethics concerns Democrats sent a letter this summer to the inspector general of the FCC saying that Carr contributing to Project 2025 violates ethics rules. 'Given the close ties between Project 2025, Trump, and his re-election campaign, it is deeply troubling that Commissioner Carr would use his official title and position to author part of the political playbook for a Republican presidential candidate,' the lawmakers wrote at the time, according to NewsNation partner The Hill. Carr said in a statement to The Hill that he cleared his work on the project with the FCC's ethics office before participating. 'I made clear to Heritage that I would only be participating in my personal capacity,' Carr said in the statement. Reactions to Carr as potential FCC chair Trump's choice of the next head of the FCC drew praise and criticism. Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron wrote in a statement that Carr has been campaigning for the job 'with promises to do the bidding of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.' 'While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact-check him during the campaign,' Aaron wrote. The self-described 'center-left tech industry policy' group 'Chamber of Progress' chastised Carr's agenda in Project 2025 as 'extremist' and a way to attack content moderation. 'Brendan Carr has clearly stated that he plans to attack Section 230 and force online platforms to carry sludge,' Chamber of Progress Founder and CEO Adam Kovacevich said in a statement. 'That’s why Democrats need to defend Section 230, which protects content moderation and keeps the Internet from becoming a cesspool.' Trump taps Brooke Rollins to head USDA Calling Carr a 'friend,' former FCC Chair Ajit Pai wrote on x that he was a 'brilliant' adviser and general counsel for the agency, and has been a 'superb commissioner.' Current Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel issued a statement congratulating Carr after he was announced as Trump's selection for the next FCC leader. 'From his time here, I am confident that Commissioner Carr is familiar with the staff, the responsibilities of this new role and the importance of continued U.S leadership in communications,' Rosenworcel wrote.

What's next for Kamala Harris?	Questions are swirling over Vice President Harris’s next move as she readies to exit the White House in the wake of her loss to President-elect Trump. Early polling suggests Democrats want to see Harris back in the running for the Oval Office in 2028, despite her defeat this cycle. But some in the party speculate the vice president could seek another office — for starters, the governor’s mansion in California — or pursue avenues outside electoral politics to help bolster the resistance against a second Trump term. 'She still has a long career ahead of her,' said Democratic strategist Kate Maeder. 'She’s young for politics in this country, and I think that folks are really excited to see what she does next, because she’s built such a powerful following around her, and I think that that will carry through after the election.' Election Day was a bruising night for Democrats. Trump swept all of the swing states and made inroads in blue strongholds as most of the country shifted rightward, and the GOP secured both chambers of Congress to pave way for a trifecta of power in Washington next year. But in her speech conceding the 2024 race to her Republican rival, Harris stressed she will never give up on 'the fight that fueled' her fast-tracked bid. The outgoing vice president, 60, 'still has a fight in her,' Maeder said. 'Whether it’s around public policy or it’s fighting the good fight in the private sector, I think it’s left to be seen.' Harris is among a small handful of vice presidents in recent history who tried for the presidency and lost, and each took different paths in the aftermath, noted Joel Goldstein, a professor emeritus at Saint Louis University’s law school and an expert on the vice presidency. Richard Nixon mounted an unsuccessful bid for California governor before his comeback White House win in 1968, and Hubert Humphrey returned to the Senate. Al Gore never ran for political office again, focusing on environmental activism and earning the Nobel Peace Prize. 'So there’s a lot of different options available to her,' Goldstein said. 'I would think that if she wants to remain active in presidential politics, that that's certainly something that's open to her … if that’s the course she wanted.' A poll from the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and the Los Angeles Times this month found nearly half of California voters would be likely to support her if she were to enter the 2026 gubernatorial race. 'If she decided she wanted to run for president in 2028, she would start out as a favorite,' said Jim Kessler, a co-founder of the left-center think tank Third Way. 'I don’t think a prohibitive favorite, but definitely someone who would start out on top, would be able to raise money, is known by voters, and who acquitted herself very well in her short campaign against Trump.' But early lists of possible 2028 contenders are already crowded with Democratic rising stars, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.A stacked field might make it difficult for Harris to re-seize the momentum she saw this year. 'I think she would struggle to win a primary in 2028 and that's just too long to go between now and then … when you have so many of the people sitting out there who are going to run, likely to run,' said Democratic strategist Fred Hicks. Instead, there might be another opening for Harris in her home state of California, which is already seen as a bastion of blue-state resistance to the incoming Trump term. Newsom is term-limited and ineligible to seek reelection when his seat is up in 2026, leaving the governor’s mansion up for grabs. A poll from the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and the Los Angeles Times this month found nearly half of California voters would be likely to support her if she were to enter the 2026 gubernatorial race. Doing so could put her in 'a prime position to fight against Trumpism for the latter part of his term,' Hicks said. Newsom’s office has said California officials are ready to 'Trump-proof' state laws, and the state attorney general is similarly on alert to resist controversial Trump policies. But both the governorship and the AG seat will be on the ballot in 2026. As she campaigned for the White House this year, Harris touted her experience as a prosecutor in California. She served as San Fransisco district attorney and then state attorney general, making history as the first woman, first African American and first Asian American in both offices.She ascended in 2017 to the U.S. Senate, where she represented the progressive stronghold until she joined the Biden administration. Running for a four-year term as governor would likely take Harris out of 2028 contention, but it wouldn’t necessarily mean she’d never try for the Oval Office again, Hicks said, pointing to 2032 and stressing Harris’s young age relative to Trump and Biden, both more than 20 years her senior. But regardless of which path Harris picks, 'she can and should become the face of the Democratic resistance,' Hicks contended. Attorney and Democratic strategist Abou Amara said the California governor’s race, another presidential run or even a step into the advocacy world all look like they’re on the table for Harris, but 'Goal No. 1' is to 'really preserve flexibility as she moves forward.' 'Another part of this question is: What does she want her capstone to be on her political career?' Amara said. And as the dust settles on 2024, experts also expect Harris may wade into the Democratic Party’s soul-searching efforts and tell her own story of what happened in the race. After her 2016 loss to Trump, for example, Clinton chronicled her bid in a memoir aptly titled 'What Happened.' 'I think that will absolutely be part of the next eight to 12 months, to decompress what happened,' Amara said. 'I expect her, whether it be through speeches or writing a book, to really lay out her understanding of what happened. Because Democrats are going to squabble back and forth with different theories … but I think it would be important to hear directly from her.' Experts and Democratic operatives alike stressed that, just a couple weeks past Election Day and two months before the White House changes hands, it’s early to peer into the crystal ball for Harris’s future. Still, the consensus prediction is that the outgoing vice president will stay in the game and remain a change-maker figure for the party as it rebuilds post-2024. 'I do think that she deserves some well-earned time to rest and think about her next steps,' Maeder said. 'I think that she proved to the Democratic Party and to the nation that she has something to offer when it comes to leadership and the next generation of leadership that the Democratic party is so hungry for. And so what she does next, I think that’s left to be seen.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/whats-next-for-kamala-harris/	2024-11-24T10:27:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/harris-next-move_mueller_AssociatedPress.jpeg?w=900
Progressives begin search for a new leader	Progressives are debating who should lead their movement as they seek to remake the Democratic Party in a new populist mold following devastating losses in November. Initial conversations are starting to take place on the left among political strategists, activists and sources close to lawmakers about who is poised to advocate for their flank in the coming Trump era. Some believe the progressive left is at its best without a dominant figurehead tethered to Washington, instead shifting much of the power and influence within the movement to the grassroots. 'The progressive movement is strongest when we aren’t over-reliant on any single leader to guide us forward,' said Usamah Andrabi, spokesperson for Justice Democrats. After helping to identify and recruit progressive candidates from working-class backgrounds, Andrabi says he sees an upside 'when we build the collective power of the people that no amount of corporate influence or super PAC spending can break.' As progressives prepare to face an incoming Republican-controlled Senate and House, some believe there’s even more of an imperative to seize on the anger felt toward Democrats who lost both the executive and legislative branches of government and channel it towards a search for a strong leader. 'They’re especially not going to care now that the Democrats got handed so thoroughly,' said Nina Turner, who co-chaired Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt) 2020 campaign. 'They’re going to say they don’t want more of the same.' 'The Democrats need an opposite and equal force in terms of celebrity,' Turner said, referring to President-elect Trump. Finding that 'celebrity' figure — a charismatic leader who resoundingly rejects corporatism — has its challenges in a capitalist country. But progressives like Turner are urging fellow leftists to look beyond places like the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which is thought of as a go-to pool of liberal talent, for rising stars. 'Very few of them have charisma,' Turner said. 'They have a title that gets media attention. But they can’t motivate.' 'Trump was an anomaly in that,' she continued. 'He was able to galvanize in a moment when people were desperate for change. And we’re right back in that moment now.' 'To me, the progressive left has the strength because this is our moment. The masses of people on the Democratic side or people who would lean Democrat, they’re over mainstream Democrats,' she said. 'They’re saying ‘y’all lost.’ Who builds a monument to the losers?' Figures on the outside are, for now, operating on a smaller scale than those who hold office. Alternative media personalities like Cenk Uygar, Kyle Kulinski and Turner herself are being talked about in some circles, along with ex-Squad members and former Reps. Cori Bush (D-MO) and Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), who have ties to urban activism. Progressives close to Sanders privately agree that at 83, he likely won't be at the top of the ticket again and have begun whispering about who could realistically take up his economic populist message and potentially have his blessing. But many also believe they need to turn to their existing talent to find someone who could replace him. In the House, two young congresswomen, Reps. Summer Lee (D-Pa.), 36, and Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), 41, are being quietly discussed, along with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who also served as a top advisor for Sanders’s 2020 campaign, and the much better-recognized Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Meanwhile, Sens. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) have been critical of Democrats in the past few weeks, creating post-election buzz about their future aspirations. Murphy, who has worked with Sanders on anti-war initiatives, publicly agreed with some of the Vermont senator’s critiques of the corporate influence of the party, while Fetterman said he would consider voting for several of Trump’s Cabinet nominees. Both approaches went against the establishment Democratic ethos, which is to resist Trump wholeheartedly and not appear too critical of the centrist election playbook. Campaign operatives who have spent the past cycles getting progressive candidates ready for prime time, however, believe this is their chance to change up the Democratic blueprint and encourage fresh talent to step up. To get there, they’ll face several key tests, including the 2026 midterms, and before that, the race to lead the Democratic National Committee. Conversations about 2028 could be informed by that choice. While some believe the top DNC job is largely symbolic — it doesn’t have sway over legislation, for example — it will be the first tangible marker of the ideological direction of a party out of power in early January following the losses this fall. 'Progressives are weighing our options, but it’s clear the fight right now is for party leadership,' said one senior Democratic source directly familiar with current talks around the early list of names. Progressives are pushing for Ben Wikler and Ken Martin, the state party chairs of Wisconsin and Minnesota, respectively, but are already fearful that a bigger national figure, Rahm Emanuel, a staunch centrist who served as Chicago mayor and former President Obama’s chief of staff, is the front-runner. Martin has officially declared his candidacy, while Wikler has so far been quiet. 'If the DNC opts for Rahm Emanuel, good luck,' the source said. 'You will see a max exodus from the party.' Ocasio-Cortez, whose megaphone reverberates far beyond Congress, also shared her distress over Emanuel’s name being floated. 'There is a disease in Washington of Democrats who spend more time listening to the donor class than working people,' Ocasio-Cortez wrote on X. 'If you want to know the seed of the party’s political crisis, that’s it.' Another moderate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, has also tossed his name into the race. The ideological battle to helm the DNC is expected to foreshadow the ongoing fights that have centrists blaming progressives for their losses and vice versa. It’s also happening amid some smaller fights among progressives themselves, who are debating how much to prioritize things like personal identity over economic class. Governors are historically considered to be prime presidential candidates-in-training, and many statewide Democratic executives are expected to play a key role in the anti-Trump effort. But while traditional Democrats in the party eye up leaders like California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, progressives don’t see many names who meet their populist criteria. One exception, some note, is Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who was considered on Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate shortlist. By sheer geography alone, the 46-year-old presides over one of the top 10 rural states in the country. 'The guy who, I don't know, who is impressing me right now is Beshear,' said one former Sanders 2016 adviser who worked on issues affecting rural voters. 'He has a solid list of economic accomplishments. And did not shy away from the cultural stuff,' the former adviser said. 'He might be able to make the argument ‘I'm proof caring for these other things doesn’t mean you can't deliver for everyday people where it really matters. The pocketbook.’'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/progressives-begin-search-for-a-new-leader/	2024-11-24T10:23:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/progressives_trudo_AssociatedPress.jpeg?w=900
Auchincloss: Senate must reject ‘dangerous’ RFK Jr. as HHS head	Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.) urged the Senate to reject Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the Secretary of Health and Human Services in a Friday op-ed for the Boston Globe. 'Now Donald Trump is setting Kennedy up to 'go wild' as secretary of health and human services. Kennedy is not just unqualified, he is dangerous — particularly for children. The Senate must reject him,' said the Massuchusetts leader who now occupies the seat previously held by Joe Kennedy III, the great nephew of former president John F. Kennedy. Auchincloss’s remarks about RFK echo the concerns of other lawmakers and Kennedy family members alike as Carolina Kennedy also raised questions about her cousins' appointment. He called on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions to decide whether Kennedy should be confirmed based on qualifications rather than politics before citing his previous claims about vaccines. Trump rounds out health team with CDC, FDA picks 'Kennedy claims that ‘no vaccine is safe and effective. The evidence indicates that vaccines have saved the lives of 146 million young children in the past half-century,' Auchincloss wrote. 'Measles, smallpox, diphtheria, mumps, pertussis, rubella, and polio used to infect hundreds of thousands of American children every year.' RFK Jr. is currently on leave from his post as the Chairman of the Board of the Children’s Health Defense organization, which was founded to promote anti-vaccine efforts. He was heavily criticized for a documentary that spread false narratives about vaccines being linked to children with autism, among other things. 'If Kennedy is charged with overseeing the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he will fuse his personal brand with organs of state to pump out quackery and conspiracy,' Auchincloss stated. Trump taps Brooke Rollins to head USDA 'Kennedy won’t only attack vaccines. Other targets include fluoride, which he pledges to 'remove from public water' although it has drastically improved children’s dental health; new medicines for cancer and Alzheimer’s, which he impugns as pharmaceutical poison; and high-speed internet, which he speculates causes 'leaky brain.'' Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) also condemned RFK Jr.’s nomination, claiming his leadership would take the country back to the 1700s, while others have raised concerns with LGBTQ healthcare as Republicans remain open to his stance on abortion rights. Analysts say RFK Jr. would have a hard time taking vaccines completely off the market but he could repeal vaccine funding, legal protections and revoke recommendations. 'Chaos is what America will get unless Senate Republicans actually do speak truth to power,' Auchincloss concluded. 'They must tell Trump that Kennedy is dangerous, and reject his Cabinet nomination.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/auchincloss-rfk-jr-senate-confirmation/	2024-11-23T18:07:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/auchinclossjake_010423gn_w.jpg?w=900
Trump taps Brooke Rollins to head USDA	President-elect Trump announced that he will nominate Brooke Rollins to be the Secretary of Agriculture on Saturday, building upon a hefty list of Cabinet picks. 'Brooke’s commitment to support the American Farmer, defense of American Food Self-Sufficiency, and the restoration of Agriculture-dependent American Small Towns is second to none,' Trump wrote in a release, lauding her family’s background in farming and early involvement with Future Farmers of America in addition to 4H. Rollins joined the former president’s Economic Advisory Council in 2016 and currently serves as the president and CEO of America First Policy Institute, a think-tank for the former president manned by previous staffers. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? In 2021, she launched a $10 million campaign against Biden’s economic agenda and spoke out in favor of Trump’s second White House bid when he fell under scrutiny in the media as GOP members criticized the party’s ticket. 'For every one former Trump official or staffer that now says negative things, you have hundreds that worked for him, that worked in the White House and in the administration that would love the opportunity to go back and work for him again, and would do so in a heartbeat,' Rollins stated. Her selection comes just a day after Trump announced Scott Turner, another America First Policy Institute leader would join his administration as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Trump's pick of Rollins came as somewhat of a surprise — it was expected that the president-elect would select former Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) to serve as secretary of Agriculture. Loeffler will still serve as co-chair of Trump’s second inaugural committee along with real estate mogul Steve Witkoff.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-taps-brooke-rollins-to-head-usda/	2024-11-23T14:28:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24301715288890-e1732397691339.jpg?w=900
5 things to know about former NFL star Scott Turner, Trump's pick...	President-elect Trump announced his nomination of former NFL star Scott Turner for Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development on Friday. 'I am pleased to nominate Scott Turner, from the Great State of Texas, as the Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),' Trump wrote in a press release. Turner has a background in politics and unsuccessfully ran for a California Senate seat in 2006. A few years later he was elected to the Texas House where he served two terms from 2013 to 2017. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Here's what you need to know about the NFL star turned politician: HUD budget cuts Turner will follow in the steps of Ben Carson, who led HUD during Trump’s first administration. Carson helped put proposed budget cuts to the agency’s Community Development Block Grant program, the public housing capital fund and the HOME grant program for more affordable housing before Congress, according to NPR. Many of those measures failed but may be reintroduced when Trump takes office, especially since Republicans have a majority in both the House and Senate. Carson authored an approach to HUD in the controversial Project 2025 playbook, which Trump denies being connected to. The proposal suggests banning undocumented immigrants from living in federal housing and repealing parts of the Fair Housing Act which aims to prevent segregation as reported by NPR. NFL Career Turner spent 9 years in the NFL where he played as a defensive back for the Washington Redskins, San Diego Chargers and Denver Broncos. He also played in college for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he was drafted upon graduation in 1995 as a seventh round pick. Trump has a history of enlisting major NFL stars to bolster his campaign including Brett Favre in addition to receiving endorsements from Pittsburgh Steelers greats Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell. Turner served in Trump’s first administration During Trump’s first term, Turner led the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. The former president said that in the role he sparked 'an Unprecedented Effort that Transformed our Country's most distressed communities' in his Friday night announcement. Turner is the first Black appointee to Trump’s cabinet in his second administration. He still needs to be confirmed by the Senate. Turner heads a Trump think-tank Turner currently works as chair of the Center for Education Opportunity at America First Policy Institute. The organization works as a think tank for the former president and employs his trusted staffers like Linda McMahon, who will head the Department of Education. It was founded three years before the end of Trump’s first term in 2017. He serves as a pastor Prestonwood Baptist Church in Texas currently lists Turner as an associate pastor. In the past, he has also worked as a 'chief inspiration officer' for a software company according to Yahoo News. In that role he served as a professional mentor, pastor, and councilor for the employees and executive team.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/scott-turner-nfl-trump/	2024-11-23T14:13:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP19107714769162_7974ee-e1732384798456.jpg?w=900
Trump taps Rollins as agriculture chief, completing proposed slat...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he will nominate former White House aide Brooke Rollins to be his agriculture secretary, the last of his picks to lead executive agencies and another choice from within his established circle of advisers and allies. The nomination must be confirmed by the Senate, which will be controlled by Republicans when Trump takes office Jan. 20, 2025. Rollins would succeed Tom Vilsack, President Joe Biden’s agriculture secretary who oversees the sprawling agency that controls policies, regulations and aid programs related to farming, forestry, ranching, food quality and nutrition. Rollins, an attorney who graduated from Texas A&amp;M University with an undergraduate degree in agricultural development, is a longtime Trump associate who served as White House domestic policy chief during his first presidency. The 52-year-old is president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, a group helping to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration. Rollins previously served as an aide to former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and ran a think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation. She worked as a litigation attorney in Dallas and also clerked for a federal judge in the Northern District of Texas after earning her law degree from the University of Texas. The pick completes Trump’s selection of the heads of executive branch departments, just two and a half weeks after the former president won the White House once again. Several other picks that are traditionally Cabinet-level remain, including U.S. Trade Representative and head of the small business administration. Rollins, speaking on the Christian talk show 'Family Talk' earlier this year, said Trump was an 'amazing boss' and confessed that she thought in 2015, during his first presidential campaign that he would not last as a candidate in a crowded Republican primary field. 'I was the person that said, ‘Oh, Donald Trump is not going to go more than two or three weeks in the Republican primary. This is to up his TV show ratings. And then we’ll get back to normal,’' she said. 'Fast forward a couple of years, and I am running his domestic policy agenda.' Trump didn’t offer many specifics about his agriculture policies during the campaign, but farmers could be affected if he carries out his pledge to impose widespread tariffs. During the first Trump administration, countries like China responded to Trump’s tariffs by imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like the corn and soybeans routinely sold overseas. Trump countered by offering massive multibillion-dollar aid to farmers to help them weather the trade war. President Abraham Lincoln founded the USDA in 1862, when about half of all Americans lived on farms. The USDA oversees multiple support programs for farmers; animal and plant health; and the safety of meat, poultry and eggs that anchor the nation’s food supply. Its federal nutrition programs provide food to low-income people, pregnant women and young children. And the agency sets standards for school meals. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has vowed to strip ultraprocessed foods from school lunches and to stop allowing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program beneficiaries from using food stamps to buy soda, candy or other so-called junk foods. But it would be the USDA, not HHS, that would be responsible for enacting those changes. In addition, HHS and USDA will work together to finalize the 2025-2030 edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. They are due late next year, with guidance for healthy diets and standards for federal nutrition programs. ___ Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

White House mostly mum after defeat	The White House has taken its show largely behind closed doors after Vice President Harris’s stinging defeat to Donald Trump. Harris has all but disappeared from the public eye, jetting off to Hawaii after a few scarce appearances around Washington following her massive loss on Nov. 5. President Biden, meanwhile, managed to keep the press at arm’s length during a recent six-day foreign trip and held meetings and events at the White House upon his return that normally would have been at least briefly on camera. The lack of engagements give a window into what a lame duck White House may look like in its final months. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was pressed this week about Biden not taking questions from the media during his trip. She suggested that he could 'engage' more before the new year but the president is known for largely avoiding questions from the media. 'I get that you all want to hear from the president. I get that. I understand that,' she said. 'And I'm not saying that you won’t. You will. He will certainly continue to engage with all of you.' The lack of visibility for Biden could prove problematic for his legacy in the final months of his administration, Michael LaRosa, former special assistant to the president and press secretary to first lady Jill Biden said. 'I really wish he would start talking to the press, holding news conferences, and engaging with the media more frequently as I always believed he should be doing,' LaRosa said. 'But they appear to think they can shape his legacy by producing scripted or rehearsed events for the next few weeks.' 'Given his unceremonious and slapdash passing of the torch last July and the results of the election, one would think he would want to start framing his legacy on his terms, in his own words, and telling his story,' he added. Biden stunned the political world when during a June debate he gave such a poor performance that members of his own party ultimately convinced him to drop his reelection bid. He threw his support behind Harris, whose campaign skyrocketed out of the gate but resulted in another Democrat, and woman, losing to Trump’s brand of brash politics. Since the election, Harris has largely stayed out of public view aside from a concession speech she gave the day after, an appearance at Arlington National Cemetery on Veteran’s Day and a brief stop at the White House during a foreign leader visit. She left for Hawaii on Tuesday and hasn’t been seen or heard from since. As president of the Senate, Harris, who can cast tie-breaking votes in the upper chamber, was also missing earlier this week when Senate Democrats pushed through Biden’s judiciary nominees before Republicans take over. The White House was also faced with questions this week about Harris and the appearance of her being on vacation while hundreds of Democratic staffers braced for being jobless in January when the GOP will take over the House and Senate as well. 'The vice president has taken time off to go spend time with her family. I don’t think there's anything wrong with that. I think she deserves some time to be with her family and to have some downtime,' Jean-Pierre said. 'She has worked very hard… for the last four years, and her taking a couple of days to be with her family, good for her.' Back at the White House, Biden this week held a meeting with Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper to discuss hurricane relief efforts there. Such meetings typically come with a brief on-camera appearance but the White House did not make public that the meeting was occurring until later in the evening after it was over. It marked an unusual way to convey a closed-door meeting about a topic the president addressed multiple times publicly, including during a visit to Cooper’s state. That same day, Biden also held a private ceremony to give the Medal of Freedom to former Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards. Those ceremonies are typically public – and make for compelling photo opportunities – but Richards was diagnosed in 2023 with a glioblastoma, a rare and aggressive form of brain tumor that Beau Biden died from. Such ceremonies can be requested to be private by families of the recipient. Biden was back on camera on Thursday when he held an event for the Boston Celtics. But by Friday, the White House again went dark for much of the day. Biden and first Lady Jill Biden hosted a dinner on the South Lawn - but officials were silent about what the dinner is in honor of for days. The answer ultimately came in something else that White House should have touted in their favor, which was to thank longtime supporters. Despite Biden being on his way out, staying largely out of the spotlight will do little to tame increased scrutiny on his age and mental fitness, including questions being raised about his ability to serve out the remainder of his term. Some Republicans suggested Biden resign when he dropped out from the 2024 race in July but those calls are being renewed since Harris’s loss. Pollster Nate Silver publicly asked this week if Biden is competent enough to be the president. La Rosa said that Biden not being in the public eye doesn’t do him any favors. 'If we can't hear from him and if we don't see him actively making the case for himself in unscripted and unchoreographed situations, the age issue would never go away,' LaRosa said. LaRosa noted that when Biden wasn’t active with media during the Democratic primary in 2019, the first lady stepped in before the COVID-19 pandemic forced him into a 'bunker' during the general election. LaRosa suggested the first lady could push Biden to be accessible again before January. 'The bunker mentality did not serve him or the presidency well and I hope in these final weeks, the first lady steps in again, lets him off the leash, and let Biden be Biden at the end of his long career,' he said. 'He didn't come this far by being shy. Why now?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/white-house-mostly-mum-after-trump-defeat/	2024-11-23T14:11:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/biden-closed-doors_gangitano_illo_SamanthaWong-GregNash.jpg?w=900
House Oversight Democrats slam Trump for nominating Project 2025’...	Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, and committee member Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) condemned President-elect Trump for tapping Project 2025 co-author Russell Vought to serve as the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during his second administration. 'After vehemently denying his links to Project 2025 through the campaign, the President-elect just tapped its lead architect, Russell Vought, to run his coming all-of-government purge as Director of the Office of Management and Budget,' the lawmakers said in a joint statement. Vought served as Trump’s OMB deputy director during Trump's first term in the Oval Office. Vought penned the chapter on the Executive Office of the President of the United States — which largely references OMB — in The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, a 'governing agenda' filled with conservative priorities and insight from scholars and policy experts. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Trump on the campaign trail sought to distance himself from the playbook, previously saying he has 'nothing to do with it,' especially as it came under fire for some of its more controversial policies. Democrats launched a campaign earlier this year to push back on Project 2025, forming a task force to fight what they said is a threat to the institutions of American democracy and government. In their statement, Raskin and Stansbury hit Vought on decisions he made while serving Trump's first administration, like carrying out an executive order signed by Trump in 2020, which took aim at diversity training for government workers by prohibiting the teaching of 'divisive concepts.' 'As Democratic Members of the House Oversight Committee, the headquarters of resistance to this plan, we will fight Vought’s radical agenda, act to protect vital government services the American people depend on, and stand up to defend our fellow citizens who are honorable federal workers every step of the way,' they said in the statement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/house-oversight-democrats-slam-trump-for-nominating-project-2025s-lead-architect/	2024-11-23T14:10:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/raskinjamie_060324gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Neil deGrasse Tyson dismisses Musk’s Mars dreams: ‘I don’t see it...	(The Hill) — Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson said he doesn’t think Elon Musk’s vision for space travel to Mars is realistic during a Friday night episode of HBO's 'Real Time with Bill Maher'. 'I don't see it happening until governments judge that it's geopolitically in our interest,' he said in conversation with Donna Brazile and Andrew Young. 'But I believe President-elect Trump has some interest in Mars, so you might have another conversation in a couple of months,' the scientist added. 'At some point, somebody has to pay for it, and just being interested in something is not the same thing as paying for it.' Musk fired back suggesting that a trip to Mars would not just help respective countries but could solve age old problems for humanity. Trump watches as Musk’s SpaceX launches Starship rocket 'Wow, they really don’t get it. Mars is critical to the long-term survival of consciousness,' he wrote in response to the clip on X. 'Also, I’m not going to ask any venture capitalists for money. I realize that it makes no sense as an investment,' he said, responding to deGrasse Tyson's claims that venture capitalists would not invest in space travel to Mars. 'That’s why I’m gathering resources.' NASA has worked alongside Musk for years. His company SpaceX has a $3.6 billion contract with the agency and an $11.8 billion agreement with the Department of Defense over the past 10 years, according to the New York Times analysis. In a post earlier this year, the tech-giant said his starship to Mars would make life 'multiplanetary' and added that the Department of Government Efficiency which he now co-heads with Vivek Ramaswamy is the 'only path to extending life beyond Earth.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/neil-degrasse-tyson-musk-mars/	2024-11-23T13:42:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP20276676837937-e1732396937524.jpg?w=800
Bezos, Musk rivalry heats up ahead of Trump’s second term	A social media spat between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos this week underscored a sharpening rivalry between two of the world’s richest men at a time when both are trying to grow their sprawling businesses empires in President-elect Trump’s second term. 'Just learned tonight at Mar-a-Lago that Jeff Bezos was telling everyone that @realDonaldTrump would lose for sure, so they should sell all their Tesla and SpaceX stock,' Musk wrote Thursday of his fellow Tech mogul on X, the social platform he owns. 'Nope. 100% not true,' Bezos, who posts on social media less frequently, replied. Observers say the dynamic between Bezos and Musk could get more tense. Musk in particular has endeared himself to Trump, part of a larger rightward shift among Silicon Valley leaders. 'It goes to show the split between different approaches among the tech community,' GOP strategist Chris Johnson told The Hill. 'There are a lot of folks like Elon...who have sort of embraced the right as the ‘move fast and break things’ party for better or for worse.' Musk and Bezos have decidedly different personalities and political views. The Tesla founder is a bona fide social media influencer, who posts dozens of times a day on X, a platform he owns, and sits regularly for interviews with friendly hosts and media personalities. Bezos has kept a much lower profile since founding Amazon and purchasing the Washington Post, opting to communicate through corporate representatives and in polished remarks to investors and employees. Musk has been seen as a leading voice within Silicon Valley on the right in recent years and this month landed a government-adjacent role under Trump to co-lead an initiative tasked with slashing government spending and regulations. Leaders of major tech companies – including Bezos – are taking note of Musk’s growing prominence in Trump’s orbit. Many of these Silicon Valley leaders, reacting to sweeping changes to the economy Trump is promising, made a series of calls to the then GOP candidate in the days before the election, looking to shore up relations with his incoming administration. The social media tiff between Musk and Bezos this week shows Musk’s alliance with Trump, coupled with the success of his tech ventures, has gotten Bezos’ attention, observers say. 'Now that Democrats are out of power, I think he’s in a weird spot in his political leanings, his political relationship to D.C. and also his relationship with these new tech guys that have embraced the GOP,' Johnson said of Bezos. Representatives for Bezos and Musk declined to comment. Bezos has come under attack from Trump and the right more generally, for years. His ownership of the Washington Post, a publication that made a name for itself during Trump’s first term with aggressive coverage of the former president, has earned Bezos regular scorn from conservative critics. There are, however, signs of change at the Post, which earlier this month shocked the political and media world by not endorsing a candidate for president. Bezos personally made the decision to kill an editorial, which had been drafted and backed Vice President Harris, sparking concerns the billionaire was attempting to appease Trump. In an op-ed defending the move, Bezos brushed aside suggestions he was trying to curry favor with Trump or help his businesses. 'You can see my wealth and business interests as a bulwark against intimidation, or you can see them as a web of conflicting interests,' Bezos wrote. 'Only my own principles can tip the balance from one to the other.' The billionaire’s latest counter punch at Musk on social media and any future rebuffing of the eccentric conservative might get Trump’s attention and mend fences with the president-elect, Johnson suggested. 'It helps him [Bezos] to engage with Elon,' he said, adding, 'Ultimately, Trump likes people who fight and people who believe in themselves and people who embrace conflict as a way to solve problems and move forward.' This is far from the first time Musk and Bezos have clashed in the public eye, with several of their recent feuds centered around their competing aerospace companies. 'If I were Bezos, I’d be worried. It’s not just Elon Musk’s alliance with the incoming president, it’s the fact that his rocket development is years behind schedule of SpaceX,' said Mark Whittington, an author who studies space, politics and policy. Musk’s SpaceX leads the aerospace and rocket industry, hosting nearly 100 launches last year and deploying thousands of its Starlink internet satellites. It is reportedly on track to be valued at $255 billion if discussions to sell insider shares go through and holds a nearly billion-dollar contract to bring down the International Space Station. Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Bezos, has lagged behind SpaceX when it comes to rocket launches and has yet to reach orbit or fly a national security mission. It is in direct competition with SpaceX and United Launch Alliance for $5.6 billion worth of Pentagon contracts over the next five years. Bezos reignited the feud over the companies last June, when he filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration to limit Starship launches, citing environmental concerns. Musk at the time called the move an 'obviously disingenuous response,' nicknaming the company 'Sue Origin' at the time. And in 2021, Bezos sued NASA over awarding a lunar lander contract to SpaceX, but ultimately lost the suit. Musk meanwhile has made a regular habit of feuding with or needling leading business executives with more progressive politics. He famously challenged Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder whose company is known today as Meta, to a cage match last summer and shared social media jokes mocking billionaire Mark Cuban on social media as he voiced support for Harris. Personal jabs aside, those aware of the dynamic say the fight between Musk and Bezos is merely part of a larger, more consequential struggle for the unofficial title of the world’s top innovator and most powerful man. 'Musk’s SpaceX is still dominant right now,' said Whittington. 'Bezos is and in fact every other rocket company has been kind of following in SpaceX’s footsteps and Bezos is not happy about that.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/bezos-musk-rivalry-heats-up-ahead-of-trumps-second-term/	2024-11-23T04:45:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Billionaires_103124_AP_Sean-Simmers-and-Evan-Agostini.png?w=900
Trump selects former Florida Rep. Dave Weldon to lead CDC	President-elect Donald Trump tapped former Florida Rep. Dave Weldon (R) to serve as the director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during his upcoming administration. 'I am thrilled to announce that former Congressman, Dr. Dave Weldon, is nominated to serve as Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),' Trump said in a press release, which he posted on Truth Social on Friday evening. Weldon, a medical doctor and Army veteran, was a seven-term lawmaker until 2008. While in Congress, Weldon served on several committees, including Appropriations, Health and Human Services, Education and Labor, and Science. He returned to practicing medicine and working as a consultant after not seeking reelection. 'The current Health of America is critical, and CDC will play a big role in helping to ensure Americans have the tools and resources they need to understand the underlying causes of disease, and the solutions to cure these diseases,' Trump said in the release.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/trump-selects-former-florida-rep-dave-weldon-to-lead-cdc/	2024-11-22T18:00:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP05032103488.jpg?w=900
Fox News contributor Janette Nesheiwat tapped as Trump's surgeon ...	President-elect Trump named Janette Nesheiwat, a Fox News contributor and medical doctor in New York and New Jersey, as his nominee for surgeon general in his second administration. 'I am proud to announce that Dr. Janette Nesheiwat will be the Nation’s Doctor as the United States Surgeon General. Dr. Nesheiwat is a double board-certified Medical Doctor with an unwavering commitment to saving and treating thousands of American lives,' Trump said in a press release on Friday. She is listed as a contributor on Fox News's website, which says that she currently serves as a medical director at CityMD, a network of urgent care centers in New York and New Jersey.

Trump names Chavez-DeRemer for Labor secretary	President-elect Trump has tapped Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.), to serve as Labor secretary in his new administration. Chavez-DeRemer had the backing of the Teamsters before she was officially picked by Trump. She served for one term in the House and lost her reelection bid to Democrat Janelle Bynum in November. Trump’s pick for Labor is one of his last Cabinet picks. Trump’s victory over Vice President Harris was in part fueled by working-class Americans, who shifted back towards the Republican Party in 2024. Teamsters President Sean O’Brien addressed the Republican National Convention in July after big labor has historically backed Democrats. Teamsters then announced in September that it would skip its presidential endorsement last cycle and opted to not back Trump or Harris. Chavez-DeRemer is one of a few other Republican members of Congress to be named for Trump’s Cabinet, including Reps. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) for United Nations ambassador, Mike Waltz (Fla.) for national security adviser, and Matt Gaetz (Fla.) for attorney general. Chavez-DeRemer’s nomination though does not impact the GOP House majority for next Congress because she lost her reelection bid.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-names-chavez-deremer-for-labor-secretary/	2024-11-22T17:32:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/chavezderemerlori_090924gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Trump picks Project 2025 author Russell Vought to lead budget off...	President-elect Donald Trump tapped Project 2025 co-author Russell Vought to serve as the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during his second administration. Vought served as Trump's OMB deputy director during his first term in the Oval Office. 'I am very pleased to nominate Russell Thurlow Vought, from the Great State of Virginia, as the Director of the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB),' Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Friday. 'He did an excellent job serving in this role in my First Term - We cut four Regulations for every new Regulation, and it was a Great Success!' he added in the post. Vought penned the chapter on the Executive Office of the President of the United States — which largely references OMB — in The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a 'governing agenda' filled with conservative priorities and insight from scholars and policy experts. Trump on the campaign trail sought to distance himself from the playbook, previously saying he has 'nothing to do with it,' especially as it came under fire for some of its more controversial policies. Democrats launched a campaign earlier this year to push back on Project 2025, forming a task force to fight what they said is a threat to the institutions of American democracy and government. The project makes a wide range of policy proposals, perhaps most notably reshaping the powers of the executive branch. It also calls for striking various small government agencies and rolling back funding for abortions and approval of the abortion pill mifepristone. https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/russell-vought	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-picks-project-2025-author-russell-vought-to-lead-budget-office/	2024-11-22T17:28:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24214674180614.jpg?w=900
Trump expected to name investor Scott Bessent as Treasury secreta...	President-elect Trump is expected to tap hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to serve as Treasury secretary in his new administration, a source confirmed to NewsNation. Bessent, founder and CEO of hedge fund Key Square Group, served as an economic adviser to the Trump campaign, often appearing on financial talk shows to argue in favor of the president-elect's economic policies. He would be subject to confirmation in the GOP-controlled Senate, where he would need 51 votes to clear the upper chamber. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal after Trump's victory, he touted the markets’ response to Trump’s win, arguing it shows their 'unambiguous embrace of the Trump 2.0 economic vision.' 'Markets are signaling expectations of higher growth, lower volatility and inflation, and a revitalized economy for all Americans,' Bessent wrote. He emerged as a front-runner for Treasury secretary after billionaire investor John Paulson bowed out of contention and after Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, who was also angling for the job, was picked to be Commerce secretary. Bessent would lead the president-elect’s economic team, which will be tasked with imposing an aggressive tariff regime meant to shake up global trade while keeping financial markets calm amid the disruption. The president-elect ran on the notion of turning the economy around, a campaign promise that resonated with voters tired of inflation, and has proposed a general tariff of 10 to 20 percent on all imported goods in order to pull investment into the U.S. and bolster domestic industry.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-expected-to-name-investor-scott-bessent-as-treasury-secretary-pick/	2024-11-22T15:37:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24227790611973-e1731449683126.jpg?w=900
Meet the informant saving hundreds of cartel sex trafficking vict...	(NewsNation) — A man who says he’s rescued 200 sex trafficking victims has a message for the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels: He’s hunting them. The man, who goes by Sebastian, says he’s an unpaid confidential informant for federal agencies. Trafficking situations often start with a family south of the border trying to cross into the United States illegally and paying the cartels about $15,000 per person, he said. You can watch the full story TONIGHT during Elizabeth Vargas Reports at 5/4C. Find your channel here. 'If the young lady is pretty, woman or child is attractive, and they feel that they could sell that child or traffic that person … they'll just outright kidnap that person,' Sebastian said. Prolific Mexican cartel leader allegedly faked his own death to live ‘life of luxury’ 'And if they are with family members, they will either try to strategically say, ‘Well, she's going go into a separate car,’' he continued. 'And then when they keep the girl, they'll just tell the family member, ‘You know what? The cops pulled us over. They took her away. Immigration has her.’ And then that's it. They never hear from her.' None of the girls make any money, Sebastian said. Some are promised eventual release if they work enough to make $50,000 to $100,000. But those goalposts are always moving, he said. 'A lot of women die,' Sebastian said. 'A lot of women are murdered.' When traffickers are done with a person, they‘ve been known to take them to the outskirts of the city and kill them, he said. Trump’s border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes 'They knew the faces the names of the Johns, which were politicians, police officers, business owners, and obviously, the names and faces of the traffickers,' Sebastian said. Sebastian's services are a race against time and, although the gig doesn’t pay, it does afford him certain protection. That includes a network of intel and support that he said has been life-saving. One agency warned Sebastian they'd learned his identity had been compromised and to skip the job. As the director of rescue operations at New Hope Foundation International, his work is mostly funded by donations to the nonprofit. These are the methods he can disclose. 'Once they trust you, they start offering you girls,' Sebastian said. He befriends traffickers and poses as a so-called John or a client who pays for sexual services. Reaching the women and never touching them while remaining inconspicuous is a challenge. 'I tell them that I'm diabetic,' he said. 'Because we don't have Viagra, I cannot get an erection. So I don't want to touch a girl. I don't want them touching me. So that's the way we get ourselves, not into bad situations.' Sometimes, he gifts women and children cellphones. 'They say, ‘Oh, I like your phone.’ (and I say) ‘Oh, yeah, that's cool. I'm gonna get another one. Would you like to keep this one if I get the new one?’ And then say yeah,' Sebastian said. 'It's a $400 to $600 phone and they'll get it for free. Little do they know that (through) coordinated efforts with the government, that phone has tools in there to monitor everything.' Cellphones are often what crack the cases and give the government what it needs to bust trafficking operations. Diddy to appear in court, make case to be released on bail NewsNation spoke with Kevin Metcalf, a former federal agent and director of the human trafficking response unit at the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office. According to Metcalf, Sebastian has the trust, resources and network 'to do things we can’t.' 'When we tell him, for example, there's a 13-year-old girl and we don't know if we can keep her safe, he can reach out and make sure that happens,' Metcalf said. 'Even for government officials, we struggle to do things like that.' Leon Worthen is a former director of operations at Naval Special Warfare. He said he's worked 12 cases with Sebastian, using him in reconnaissance. 'He is definitely the real deal,' Worthen said. 'He has the ability, the fearlessness, the courage and the bravery to put himself in harm's way when it comes to rescuing a victim of trafficking or abuse, and every single time, the results are amazing.' What keeps him going? The little boy he was decades ago when no one came to save him. 'When I was a child, I was sexually assaulted multiple times on two different occasions and at that time, nothing was done to help me,' Sebastian said. 'It's hard to speak out. So I know that those kids find it hard to speak out once they fall in that trap.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/informant-cartel-sex-trafficking-victims-sinaloa-jalisco-new-generation/	2024-11-22T11:31:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Cartel.jpg?w=900
Sen. Mullin is lone lawmaker blocking general’s promotion: Source...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — A promotion for the general who was the last U.S. service member out of Afghanistan was put on hold by Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., NewsNation sources confirm. Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue, who oversaw the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2020 was nominated to lead the U.S. Army in Europe and Africa. A source familiar with the confirmation process said it’s their understanding that Mullin held up the promotion, with his objection directly related to Donahue’s role in Afghanistan. A NewsNation request for comment on Friday morning was not immediately returned. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved nearly 1,000 promotions, including Donahue’s, earlier this week. Who is Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue? A career special operations veteran, Donahue is known as the last U.S. service member out of Kabul, with his image captured in a hazy, night vision photo as he stepped on the last U.S. military aircraft out of Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 30, 2021. Donahue was in charge of the 82nd Airborne while it secured the airfield at the airport, an often chaotic scene as Americans and refugees raced to evacuate Afghanistan before an Aug 31, 2021, deadline to leave. What is the promotion process? Donahue, President Biden’s nominee to head the U.S. Army in Europe and up for promotion to four-star general, was one of nearly 1,000 military promotions the Senate Armed Services Committee approved on Tuesday. Donahue’s name, however, was ​​not included in the promotions approved Thursday by the Senate before it left Washington, D.C., not to return until after the Thanksgiving Day holiday. While his blocked military promotion is unusual, as officer promotions are typically uncontroversial and easily passed by the Senate, it’s not unheard of. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) last year blocked several hundred general and flag officer promotions for months over his objection to the Pentagon’s policy of reimbursing those for travel costs when seeking an abortion out of the state in which they are based. Though a hold can still be bypassed via a vote by the full Senate, it’s seen as unfavorable given that it can eat up floor time.

Gaetz says he will not return to Congress	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said Friday he will not return to Congress after resigning his House seat last week, despite having withdrawn from consideration to be President-elect Trump’s attorney general — but added he is 'not going anywhere.' 'I'm still going to be in the fight, but it's going to be from a new perch. I do not intend to join the 119th Congress,' Gaetz told conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, later adding it is a 'pretty poetic time' to allow Florida’s 1st District to have new representation. There were questions about whether Gaetz may try to return to Capitol Hill for the 119th Congress — and whether he would want to — given the careful wording used in his letter announcing his resignation from the 118th Congress last week. But he put an end to that speculation less than a day after it began. 'I've got other goals in life that I'm eager to pursue; my wife and my family. And so, I'm going to be fighting for President Trump. I'm going to be doing whatever he asks of me, as I always have,' Gaetz said. 'But I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress.' Gaetz’s decision to not return to Congress also keeps him out of the jurisdiction of the House Ethics Committee, which has been wrestling since his resignation with whether to release the report resulting from its years-long investigation of him on allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and more.He has vigorously denied any wrongdoing. The Ethics panel on Wednesday — before Gaetz had removed himself from attorney general consideration — declined to release its report, with the committee's Republicans voting against doing so, but left open the possibility of opting to release it at a later date. But Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.), the chair of the committee, said Thursday that Gaetz no longer being in the running for attorney general 'should end the discussion' of whether the panel should release the report. Two House Democrats have also made moves to try to force House votes requiring the Ethics panel to release its report, and they have vowed to continue with pushing for a vote when Congress returns from Thanksgiving. It is not clear what the Florida lawmaker does next, but Gaetz has plenty of options aside from returning to the House. Those include Trump appointing him to a position that does not require Senate confirmation, exploring a run for governor of Florida, or even launching a media career. What’s next for Matt Gaetz: 5 possibilities 'Don't worry — I'm not going anywhere. I'm not taking off for like, you know, tropical excursion for the rest of my life. I am here to help save this country,' he said Friday. 'We need a leadership structure under President Trump that's going to allow for durability of our movement and the ability to continue this great realignment of our politics. So, I'll play a part in that. I plan to be a big voice,' Gaetz added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/gaetz-says-he-will-not-return-to-congress-but-staying-in-the-fight/	2024-11-22T09:41:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_082624gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Who is Pam Bondi, Trump's nominee for Attorney General?	(NewsNation) — After Matt Gaetz withdrew from nomination as Donald Trump's attorney general, the president-elect named Pam Bondi as his next pick. 'I have known Pam for many years — She is smart and tough, and is an AMERICA FIRST Fighter, who will do a terrific job as Attorney General!' Trump wrote on Truth Social Thursday. Bondi, who used to serve as Florida's Attorney General, wasn't initially on anybody's short-list for the national position. However, Trump's announcement Thursday got a positive reaction from senators, such as Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who called Bondi a 'grand slam, touchdown, hole in one, ace, hat trick, slam dunk, Olympic gold medal pick' on X. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Pam Bondi's background Bondi was a prosecutor for nearly two decades in the Hillsborough County State Attorney’s Office before becoming Florida's first female attorney general in 2010. She served as Florida's Attorney General for eight years. She campaigned for the state's top legal office by challenging then-President Barack Obama’s signature health care law and calling for her state to adopt Arizona's controversial 'show me your papers' immigration law. As Attorney General in Florida from 2011-2019, Bondi was vocal on human trafficking issues and urged tightening state laws against traffickers. After that, she worked as a lobbyist for Ballard Partners. Trump's incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles was a partner at the Florida-based firm. While working at Ballard Partners, Bondi lobbied for a Kuwaiti firm, the Associated Press reported, citing Justice Department foreign agent filings and congressional lobbying documents. Bondi registered as a foreign agent for the government of Qatar because of her work related to anti-human-trafficking efforts leading up to the 2022 World Cup. In addition, Bondi represented the KGL Investment Company KSCC, a Kuwaiti firm also known as KGLI. She lobbied the White House, National Security Council, State Department and Congress on immigration policy, human rights and economic sanctions issues, the AP wrote. Trump and Bondi's relationship Sources tell NewsNation that Bondi is very trusted by Trump and that she spends a lot of time at his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago. Bondi was a senior adviser on Trump's first impeachment defense team when he was accused in 2020 of abuse of power for allegedly pressuring the president of Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals. Trump was ultimately not convicted. This year Bondi was among a group of Republicans who showed up in New York to support Trump at his hush money criminal trial. Family fears missing woman Hannah Kobayashi was trafficked People close to the president-elect tell us that Bondi is somebody very trusted by Trump. She spends a lot of time at Mar a Lago. She was a senior adviser on Trump's first impeachment defense team, and this year, she was also among a group of Republicans who showed up in New York to support Trump at his hush money criminal trial. 'I'm a prosecutor, former prosecutor, yet all the rights here go to the defendant, because it's his liberty at stake, and that has not been happening in this courtroom, this case should have never, ever been brought,' Bondi said at the time. Shortly after the second apparent assassination attempt on Trump, Bondi appeared on NewsNation's 'Dan Abrams Live' to discuss it. Her hope for the trial, Bondi said, is that the alleged attempt 'is going to be prosecuted wisely and smartly by the feds.' 'I can't imagine anyone in this country who wouldn't want this monster locked up forever,' she said, referring to suspect Ryan Wesley Routh.

Diddy to appear in court, make case to be released on bail	(NewsNation) — Music mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs will appear in court for a pretrial hearing, making another bid to be released from jail on bail. Combs has been detained for more than two months after being charged with racketeering, sex trafficking by force and transportation to engage in prostitution. He was denied bail in September when the indictment was unsealed, and again earlier in November as the judge deemed him a flight risk due to his money and connections. Diddy private eyes confront influencers about possible payments On Thursday, Combs argued that a video of him allegedly attacking his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2016 was edited and not an accurate portrayal of what happened at the Los Angeles Hotel. Prosecutors have pointed to the video as evidence of Combs trafficking Ventura and an example of the danger Combs could pose to women if released on bail. They alleged he was trafficking Ventura as part of a 'freak off,' alleged events detailed in the indictment where Combs reportedly forced women to engage in sex acts with male prostitutes for an audience with the events sometimes lasting for days. Combs' defense team argued that an edited video was not related to a 'freak off' but showed a domestic dispute between the couple. Lawyers for Combs offered to bring a forensic video analyst to court on Friday during arguments regarding Combs' release. Police warn of sophisticated holiday scam artists targeting consumers The judge has already rejected an effort to consider handwritten jailhouse notes from Combs which prosecutors wanted to use to argue against granting release. In addition to criminal charges, Combs is also facing multiple lawsuits from women who say he abused them and forced them to participate in sex acts against their will.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/diddy-court-friday/	2024-11-22T09:02:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1756336143.jpg?w=900
Thanksgiving travel: Which dishes are TSA-approved?	(NewsNation) — You can’t bring the carving knife, but if you’re traveling for Thanksgiving, your macaroni, meats and cookies can join you on a flight. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) released a list of approved dishes travelers can bring through airport security. Although most foods can be carried through TSA checkpoints, some dishes may need to be packed with checked baggage. Thanksgiving will cost less this year, here’s which items are cheaper Generally, solid food can go through checkpoints hassle-free, but 'if you can spill it, spread it, spray it, pump it or pour it' (and it’s larger than 3.4 ounces), it’ll need to go in a checked bag. Common Thanksgiving foods that can be carried through a TSA checkpoint include baked goods, meats, stuffing, casseroles, macaroni and cheese, fresh fruit, candy and spices. Items like cranberry sauce, gravy, canned fruits or vegetables, preserves, jams and jellies, and maple syrup, should be carefully stored with your checked bags. The TSA is projected to screen 18.3 million people from Tuesday, Nov. 26 to Monday, Dec. 2 — up 6% from this time last year. The Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving, and the following Sunday, are poised to be the busiest travel days.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/thanksgiving-travel-tsa-approved-dishes/	2024-11-22T08:54:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/655d0a484f1226.34582149.jpeg?w=900
New York judge delays Trump hush money sentencing	President-elect Trump’s sentencing in his New York criminal case will not go forward as planned next week as his attorneys push to dismiss the prosecution following his election victory. Judge Juan Merchan, who oversees the trial proceedings, announced the adjournment in a letter Friday. The judge halted the case to accept additional written briefing on Trump’s argument that his return to the White House compels the court to toss his 34-count felony conviction entirely. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) is opposing that request. Instead, Bragg floated that Merchan could freeze the proceedings while Trump is in office, meaning the conviction would remain on the books but sentencing wouldn’t occur until 2029, at the earliest. Merchan ordered Trump to file his formal motion asking for dismissal by Dec. 2 and Bragg to respond by Dec. 9. The judge will then decide how to proceed. Though both sides agreed to delay the sentencing, the new schedule aligns with Bragg’s request. Trump had asked for a slower timeline that would push the dismissal battle closer to his inauguration. The Hill has reached out to the district attorney's office for comment. Steven Cheung, Trump's campaign spokesperson and incoming White House communications director, called the ruling a 'decisive win' for the former and future president. 'President Trump won a landslide victory as the American People have issued a mandate to return him to office and dispose of all remnants of the Witch Hunt cases,' he said. 'All of the sham lawfare attacks against President Trump are now destroyed and we are focused on Making America Great Again.' The former president’s criminal defense strategy long rested on delaying until after the election. Trump successfully staved off trial in his other three criminal prosecutions, and in the only case that did reach a verdict, the New York hush money case, he successfully pushed the sentencing until after voters headed to the ballot box. The jury’s verdict made Trump the first former U.S. president convicted of a felony. When he returns to the White House, he would become the first person to assume the nation’s highest office with such a criminal record — if the conviction stands. With his White House victory secured, Trump’s team now believes his criminal cases must be tossed. They have moved most aggressively to pull the plug on the hush money case, given that Trump’s sentencing date of Nov. 26 was rapidly approaching on. '[D]ismissal of this case is necessary under the Constitution and federal law to facilitate the orderly transition of Executive power — and in the interests of justice — following President Trump's victory in the Electoral College and the popular vote in the 2024 Presidential election,' Trump attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, whom the president-elect recently nominated to senior Justice Department roles, wrote in a letter last week. The jury of 12 New Yorkers in May found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money deal his ex-fixer made with a porn actor ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Though Trump could face jail time, such a sentence is rare for first-time offenders on charges like his, and he is expected to seek a delay of any punishment pending a lengthy appeal. Before sentencing, Merchan was also set to rule on whether the verdict can stand following the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision. Merchan delayed his ruling — and the sentencing — until shortly after the election and then put it on hold upon Trump’s electoral win. Both will remain on hold at least until the judge decides how to proceed in the wake of Trump’s election. His imminent return to the White House has already pumped the brakes on his other criminal prosecutions. Courts agreed to special counsel Jack Smith’s requests to halt his federal election subversion case and his appeal seeking to revive his documents case as prosecutors assess how to wind down the cases. In Georgia, where Trump is accused of attempting to subvert the state’s 2020 presidential election results, an appeals court without explanation took a scheduled oral argument in a defense challenge off the calendar.

What will Mike Huckabee focus on if confirmed as Israel ambassado...	(NewsNation) — If confirmed by the Senate to be ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee said it would 'be an honor' to represent the continuation of the Abraham Accords. The Abraham Accords, which President-elect Donald Trump helped broker, aimed to normalize relations between Israel and Arab nations. On 'Morning in America,' Huckabee said the job is all about carrying out responsibilities assigned by the president. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'An ambassador doesn't get to make policy. He's there to represent the policy,' Huckabee said. 'An ambassador serves at the pleasure of the President.' Huckabee's nomination comes during the Israel-Hamas war. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed 44,056 people, according to local health authorities, who say more than half of those killed were women and children. Parts of Gaza have been decimated and more than 2.3 million people driven from their homes. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage. The world’s top war crimes court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity.

Putin says Russia attacked Ukraine with a new missile that he cla...	The Kremlin fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile at Ukraine on Thursday in response to Kyiv's use this week of American and British missiles capable of striking deeper into Russia, President Vladimir Putin said. In a televised address to the country, the Russian president warned that U.S. air defense systems would be powerless to stop the new missile, which he said flies at ten times the speed of sound and which he called the Oreshnik — Russian for hazelnut tree. He also said it could be used to attack any Ukrainian ally whose missiles are used to attack Russia. 'We believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,' Putin said in his first comments since President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the green light this month to use U.S. ATACMS missiles to strike at limited targets inside Russia. Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed that Russia’s missile was a new, experimental type of intermediate range missile based on it’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile. 'This was new type of lethal capability that was deployed on the battlefield, so that was certainly of concern,' Singh said, noting that the missile could carry either conventional or nuclear warheads. The U.S. was notified ahead of the launch through nuclear risk reduction channels, she said. The attack on the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro came in response to Kyiv's use of longer-range U.S. and British missiles in strikes Tuesday and Wednesday on southern Russia, Putin said. Those strikes caused a fire at an ammunition depot in Russia's Bryansk region and killed and wounded some security services personnel in the Kursk region, he said. 'In the event of an escalation of aggressive actions, we will respond decisively and in kind,' the Russian president said, adding that Western leaders who are hatching plans to use their forces against Moscow should 'seriously think about this.' Putin said the Oreshnik fired Thursday struck a well-known missile factory in Dnipro. He also said Russia would issue advance warnings if it launches more strikes with the Oreshnik against Ukraine to allow civilians to evacuate to safety — something Moscow hasn’t done before previous aerial attacks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov initially said Russia hadn’t warned the U.S. about the coming launch of the new missile, noting that it wasn't obligated to do so. But he later changed tack and said Moscow did issue a warning 30 minutes before the launch. Putin's announcement came hours after Ukraine claimed that Russia had used an intercontinental ballistic missile in the Dnipro attack, which wounded two people and damaged an industrial facility and rehabilitation center for people with disabilities, according to local officials. But American officials said an initial U.S. assessment indicated the strike was carried out with an intermediate-range ballistic missile. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that the use of the missile was an 'obvious and serious escalation in the scale and brutality of this war, a cynical violation of the UN Charter.' He also said there had been 'no strong global reaction' to the use of the missile, which he said could threaten other countries. 'Putin is very sensitive to this. He is testing you, dear partners,' Zelenskyy wrote. 'If there is no tough response to Russia’s actions, it means they see that such actions are possible.' The attack comes during a week of escalating tensions, as the U.S. eased restrictions on Ukraine's use of American-made longer-range missiles inside Russia and Putin lowered the threshold for launching nuclear weapons. The Ukrainian air force said in a statement that the Dnipro attack was launched from Russia’s Astrakhan region, on the Caspian Sea. 'Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is,' Zelenskyy said hours before Putin's address. 'And how afraid he is.' Russia was sending a message by attacking Ukraine with an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of releasing multiple warheads at extremely high speeds, even if they are less accurate than cruise missiles or short-range ballistic missiles, said Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. 'Why might you use it therefore?' Savill said. 'Signaling — signaling to the Ukrainians. We’ve got stuff that outrages you. But really signaling to the West ‘We’re happy to enter into a competition around intermediate range ballistic missiles. P.S.: These could be nuclear tipped. Do you really want to take that risk?’' Military experts say that modern ICBMs and IRBMs are extremely difficult to intercept, although Ukraine has previously claimed to have stopped some other weapons that Russia described as 'unstoppable,' including the air-launched Kinzhal hypersonic missile. David Albright, of the Washington-based think tank the Institute for Science and International Security, said he was 'skeptical' of Putin’s claim, adding that Russian technology sometimes 'falls short.' He suggested Putin was 'taunting the West to try to shoot it down ... like a braggart boasting, taunting his enemy.' Earlier this week, the Biden administration authorized Ukraine to use the U.S.-supplied, longer-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia — a move that drew an angry response from Moscow. Days later, Ukraine fired several of the missiles into Russia, according to the Kremlin. The same day, Putin signed a new doctrine that allows for a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. The doctrine is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons. In response, Western countries, including the U.S., said Russia has used irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behavior throughout the war to intimidate Ukraine and other nations. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday that Russia’s formal lowering of the threshold for nuclear weapons use did not prompt any changes in U.S. doctrine. She pushed back on concerns that the decision to allow Ukraine to use Western missiles to strike deeper inside Russia might escalate the war. ″They’re the ones who are escalating this,' she said of the Kremlin — in part because of a flood of North Korean troops sent to the region. More than 1,000 days into war, Russia has the upper hand, with its larger army advancing in Donetsk and Ukrainian civilians suffering from relentless drone and missile strikes. Analysts and observers say the loosening of restrictions on Ukraine's use of Western missiles is unlikely to change the the course of the war, but it puts the Russian army in a more vulnerable position and could complicate the logistics that are crucial in warfare. Putin has also warned that the move would mean that Russia and NATO are at war. 'It is an important move and it pulls against, undermines the narrative that Putin had been trying to establish that it was fine for Russia to rain down Iranian drones and North Korean missiles on Ukraine but a reckless escalation for Ukraine to use Western-supplied weapons at legitimate targets in Russia,' said Peter Ricketts, a former U.K. national security adviser who now sits in the House of Lords. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless and Emma Burrows in London, and Zeke Miller and Lolita C.

Trump picks Pam Bondi for next attorney general	President-elect Trump has named former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as his next nominee to the lead the Department of Justice (DOJ). Bondi was a swift pick just hours after former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) withdrew himself from consideration for the role. 'For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore. Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again. I have known Pam for many years — She is smart and tough, and is an AMERICA FIRST Fighter, who will do a terrific job as Attorney General!' Trump wrote on Truth Social. Bondi served as attorney general of Florida from 2011 to 2019 under then-Gov. Rick Scott. She is the chair of the Center for Litigation at the America First Policy Institute, a right-wing think tank working with the Trump transition team on the administration’s agenda. She is also a partner at Ballard Partners, the lobbying firm at which Trump’s incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles worked. Bondi was a senior adviser on Trump’s first impeachment defense team, a role for which she took a leave from Ballard Partners. She then rejoined the firm, which was founded by Florida lobbyist Brian Ballard, the former 2016 chair of Trump Victory. She steps in for Gaetz, who was named Trump’s pick for attorney general just a week ago and immediately became the president-elect’s most controversial Cabinet choice. Gaetz was previously investigated by the Justice Department as part of a broader sex trafficking probe, including allegations involving an underage woman. The department ultimately decided not to pursue charges, and Gaetz has strongly denied any wrongdoing. While he cited that his nomination was becoming a distraction to the Trump transition team, his withdrawal suggests he had realized he was unlikely to win the votes necessary to be confirmed in the Senate after meeting with members of the upper chamber this week. Updated 6:48 p.m. EST	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-picks-pam-bondi-for-next-attorney-general/	2024-11-21T15:47:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/pambondi_msg_.jpg?w=900
What's next for Matt Gaetz: 5 possibilities	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s (R-Fla.) political future is up in the air following his announcement that he is taking his name out of the running to be attorney general in the Trump administration. Gaetz was under intense scrutiny over past investigations by the Justice Department (DOJ) and the House Ethics Committee. The DOJ was investigating Gaetz as a part of a broad sex trafficking probe, including allegations involving underage women, though it declined to file charges. Gaetz has vigorously denied those accusations. The former congressman was also the subject of a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and drug use. 'While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,' Gaetz wrote on social platform X. Here are five possibilities for what could come next for Gaetz. Another role in Trump administration While Gaetz took himself out of the running to be attorney general, President-elect Trump still could appoint him to an administration post, in the White House or elsewhere, that would not require a Senate confirmation hearing. By choosing Gaetz, Trump would have a high-profile defender in his administration without having to go through a messy confirmation process. Senate Republicans were warning that confirmation hearings on Gaetz would be like 'Kavanaugh on steroids,' referring to the hearings in 2018 for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. If Gaetz were to take on another role in the Trump administration, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) would have to set a date for a special election for Gaetz’s seat in the state’s 1st Congressional District. DeSantis has already instructed the Florida secretary of state to set a schedule for the special election, but a date has not yet been determined. The 1st District is a red seat and would likely see a competitive Republican primary. A number of Republicans have already lined up to run in the special election for Gaetz’s seat. Gubernatorial run Gaetz has been among the Republicans floated to run for governor once DeSantis’s term ends in 2026. But a gubernatorial run for Gaetz would come with baggage. 'Gaetz is damaged goods and donors should line up behind someone else,' said Dan Eberhart, a Florida-based Republican donor. 'It’s time for Gaetz to practice law,' he added. A gubernatorial run, however, could still prompt problems for Gaetz up on Capitol Hill. One House Republican, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, said there would likely still be a push for more information regarding the allegations against Gaetz, including the Ethics Committee's report. 'If he puts himself out there to run for governor, which is kind of the one everyone seems to think he’s gonna run for, I do think that if not this report, at least some information needs to come out because people need to know who they’re electing,' the lawmaker said. Reps. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) and Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) were also floated for the position, but with Waltz being appointed to serve as Trump’s national security adviser, Gaetz would likely face off against Donalds in a primary. 'Right now, the best-positioned person to be the next governor of Florida is Byron Donalds,' said Ford O’Connell, a Florida-based GOP strategist. Return to House of Representatives Gaetz resigned his seat for the current 118th Congress, but his resignation letter left some wiggle room for Gaetz to return for the 119th Congress that starts on Jan. 3, 2025, since he was reelected to the seat. 'I do not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress to pursue the position of Attorney General in the Trump Administration,' Gaetz wrote in his letter. Now that he is no longer pursuing the attorney general position, his intentions may change. It is unclear whether Gaetz could return unilaterally, but some congressional sources believe he can. If not, Gaetz has easily won reelection, and he could likely win a special election. Of course, Gaetz may not even want to return to the House. His wife, Ginger Gaetz, reposted his statement on X about withdrawing from attorney general consideration with a photo of the two on the Capitol steps that was captioned: 'The end of an era.' Being in the House would also mean that the House Ethics Committee would again have jurisdiction over him — and nullifying thorny questions about whether it is appropriate to release a report on a former member. The panel investigated Gaetz on and off for years over allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and other matters. Gaetz has vigorously denied the allegations, and the Department of Justice declined to charge him after investigating related matters. Several House Republicans do not want to see Gaetz, who threw the House into chaos when he voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), back in the halls. 'No one wants him back,' one House Republican told The Hill with a chuckle. 'I think that he can get sworn in, I mean he was elected by his district, he has every right. So, I don’t think we could stop him. But he’s not loved, that’s for sure.' 'A collective good riddance from many right-of-center members!' another House Republican told The Hill in reaction to Gaetz’s withdrawal. Media career While there are several paths Gaetz could pursue in government and politics, the Florida Republican could also take a stab at a career in media — an industry in which he already has experience. Gaetz has been a regular presence on TV and other media for years, vigorously defending Trump. In 2021, Gaetz started his own show, the 'Firebrand with Matt Gaetz' podcast, where he gives a 'behind-the-scenes look into the Swamp of Washington without the spin of Fake News and Deep State influence,' according to the show’s description. According to YouTube, he just published his 173rd episode. Gaetz has also occasionally found himself sitting at the anchor desk at other conservative outlets. He has guest-hosted former Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s 'War Room' podcast, and been a fill-in host on Newsmax. When discussing his appointment to be attorney general, Newsmax host Greg Kelly referenced the Florida Republican’s time holding the fort for shows on the network. 'Matt Gaetz is a special guy. He's incredibly smart, eloquent, bold, unafraid. He's also the occasional fill-in host on this program. No kidding,' Kelly said, adding: 'I am so honored that we gave him his start, didn't we? No. Matt Gaetz flattered us with his services here at Newsmax, and he is unafraid. And he knows his stuff when he takes on the swamp.' One media watcher is predicting that Gaetz will land at a Newsmax anchor desk when all is said and done. 'I'm guessing Matt Gaetz ends up as a Newsmax host,' Aaron Rupar wrote on X. Appointment to Senate Shortly after Gaetz took his name out of the ring to be attorney general, some floated the possibility that Gaetz could fill Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) seat in the Senate after Rubio is confirmed as secretary of State. The two are former colleagues in the House, and Gaetz helped prepare DeSantis in debate preparation when he first ran for governor in 2018. But the two were on different sides in the 2024 primary. Gaetz backed Trump in the Republican presidential primary last year shortly before DeSantis challenged Trump. The decision on who will fill Rubio’s seat lies with DeSantis, and Gaetz has not been among the names floated for the position. DeSantis is said to be considering his chief of staff James Uthmeier, state Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez and state Attorney General Ashley Moody. Lara Trump, the president-elect’s daughter-in-law, has been floated by a number of prominent lawmakers and has expressed interest in the position. A scenario in which DeSantis appoints her to the Senate could be viewed as an olive branch to the president-elect. There would be another chance at the Senate in 2026 when the special election for Rubio’s seat is held, but that scenario seems like it would present the same challenges that a statewide run for governor would. 'He’s toxic for the same reasons,' Eberhart said when asked about the possibility of Gaetz going for the Senate seat. 'If he wants back in, he’s gonna need to run on his own.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/whats-next-for-matt-gaetz-5-possibilities/	2024-11-21T15:42:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_022924ar02_w_8ed45c.jpg?w=900
73% worry Social Security won't pay promised benefits: Survey	(NewsNation) — A majority of Americans expect to rely on Social Security benefits when they retire, but according to a new survey, most are worried they won't get them. A Bankrate survey found that more than half (53%) of nonretired U.S. adults expect to count on their Social Security checks to cover necessary expenses in retirement. At the same time, 73% are concerned they won't receive their promised benefits when they retire. Those fears are not unfounded: Social Security is facing a financial shortfall. In roughly a decade, Social Security recipients could see their benefits cut by hundreds of dollars a month if Congress doesn't take action. While it's highly unlikely federal lawmakers will let that happen, so far, they have opted to kick the can down the road, avoiding major changes that could be politically unpopular. Experts say the longer Congress waits, the more drastic the changes will have to be later on. 'There’s a vast divide between Americans’ concern about the looming Social Security funding shortfall and the lack of serious and thorough conversation among elected officials about what to do about it,' Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick said in a statement. 'The result is that the American public’s financial well-being is not being tended to.' Keep in mind: Even if Congress does nothing — and the trust funds that pay out Social Security benefits run out — retirees will still receive a monthly check, but it could be lower than what was promised. The Brookings Institution says today’s financing challenge is 'at least double' what it was in 1983, the last time Social Security was in dire straits. Back then, insolvency was just months away before Congress stepped in. How much do retirees rely on Social Security? Bankrate found that more than three-quarters (77%) of current retirees are reliant on Social Security to pay necessary expenses, including 62% who said they are 'very reliant.' The rising cost of living has hit seniors on fixed incomes especially hard in recent years. Among beneficiaries 65 and older, about 12% of men and 15% of women rely on Social Security to meet 90% of their needs, according to government data. Social Security is meant to replace about 40% of past earnings, but roughly 4 in 10 retirees receive more than 50% of their income from the program. A recent AARP survey suggests retirees could be even more reliant on Social Security in the years ahead, with 20% of adults 50-plus saying they have no retirement savings. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to ease the burden by ending taxes on retirees benefits, but experts say that would require bipartisan buy-in and is unlikely to happen. What is the average retirement check? In October, the average monthly benefit for a retired worker was $1,924, according to the Social Security Administration. Retirees will see a 2.5% bump in January thanks to the annual cost-of-living adjustment. The size of your monthly retirement check is based on several factors, including how long you worked, how much you made over your career and when you started collecting. You can calculate your estimated benefit here. There's no perfect age to start collecting benefits because everyone's circumstances are different, but research suggests it's typically better to wait until age 70. At that point, you can receive up to 124% of your full Social Security benefit.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/workers-worry-social-security/	2024-11-21T15:00:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6707efe6621806.04044092.jpeg?w=900
Police report reveals assault allegations against Hegseth, Trump'...	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) — A woman told police that she was sexually assaulted in 2017 by Pete Hegseth after he took her phone, blocked the door to a California hotel room and refused to let her leave, according to a detailed investigative report made public late Wednesday. Hegseth, a former Fox News personality and President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be defense secretary, told police at the time that the encounter had been consensual and denied any wrongdoing, the report said. News of the allegations surfaced last week when local officials released a brief statement confirming that a woman had accused Hegseth of sexual assault in October 2017 after he had spoken at a Republican women’s event in Monterey. 'The matter was fully investigated and I was completely cleared,' Hegseth told reporters Thursday at the Capitol, where he was meeting with senators to build support for his nomination. The report does not say that police found the allegations were false. Police recommended the case report be forwarded to the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office for review. Monterey County District Attorney Jeannine M. Pacioni said Thursday that her office declined to file charges in January of 2018 because they didn't have 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt.' Tim Palatore, Hegseth’s attorney, has said the woman who made the allegations was paid an undisclosed sum in 2023 as part of a confidential settlement to head off the threat of what he described as a baseless lawsuit. The 22-page police report was released in response to a public records request and offers the first detailed account of what the woman alleged to have transpired — one that is at odds with Hegseth’s version of events. The report cited police interviews with the alleged victim, a nurse who treated her, a hotel staffer, another woman at the event and Hegseth. The woman’s name was not released, and The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually assaulted. A spokeswoman for the Trump transition said Thursday that the 'report corroborates' what Hegseth’s legal team has been saying 'all along.' Investigators were first alerted to the alleged assault, the report said, by a nurse who called them after a patient requested a sexual assault exam. The patient told medical personnel she believed she was assaulted five days earlier but couldn’t remember much about what had happened. She reported something may have been slipped into her drink before ending up in the hotel room where she said the assault occurred. Police collected the unwashed dress and underwear she had worn that night, the report said. The woman’s partner, who was staying at the hotel with her, told police that he was worried about her that night after she didn’t come back to their room. At 2 a.m., he went to the hotel bar, but she wasn’t there. She made it back a few hours later, apologizing that she 'must have fallen asleep.' A few days later, she told him she had been sexually assaulted. The woman, who helped organize the California Federation of Republican Women gathering at which Hegseth spoke, told police that she had witnessed the TV anchor acting inappropriately throughout the night and saw him stroking multiple women’s thighs. She texted a friend that Hegseth was giving off a 'creeper' vibe, according to the report. After the event, the woman and others attended an after-party in a hotel suite where she said she confronted Hegseth, telling him that she 'did not appreciate how he treated women,' the report states. A group of people, including Hegseth and the woman, decamped for the hotel’s bar. That’s when 'things got fuzzy,' the woman told police. She remembered having a drink at the bar with Hegseth and others, the police report states. She also told police that she argued with Hegseth near the hotel pool, an account that is supported by a hotel staffer who was sent to handle the disturbance and spoke to police, according to the report. Soon, she told police, she was inside a hotel room with Hegseth, who took her phone and blocked the door with his body so that she could not leave, according to the report. She also told police she remembered 'saying ‘no’ a lot,' the report said. Her next memory was of lying on a couch or bed with a bare-chested Hegseth hovering over her, his dog tags dangling, the report states. Hegseth served in the National Guard, rising to the rank of major. After Hegseth finished, she recalled he threw a towel at her and asked if she was 'OK,' the report states. She told police she did not recall how she got back to her own hotel room and had since suffered from nightmares and memory loss. At the time of the alleged assault, Hegseth, now 44, was going through a divorce with his second wife, with whom he has three children. She filed for divorce after he had a child with a Fox News producer who is now his third wife, according to court records and social media posts by Hegseth. His first marriage ended in 2009, also after infidelity by Hegseth, according to court records. Hegseth, who joined Fox News as a contributor in 2014 before becoming co-host of 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend,' left the network after Trump announced his intention to nominate him. Hegseth said he attended an after party and drank beer but did not consume liquor, and acknowledged being 'buzzed' but not drunk. He said he met the woman at the hotel bar, and she led him by the arm back to his hotel room, which surprised him because he initially had no intention of having sex with her, the report said. Hegseth told investigators that the sexual encounter that followed was consensual, adding that he explicitly asked more than once if she was comfortable. Hegseth said in the morning the woman 'showed early signs of regret,' and he assured her that he wouldn’t tell anyone about the encounter. Hegseth’s attorney said a payment was made to the woman as part of a confidential settlement a few years after the police investigation because Hegseth was concerned that she was prepared to file a lawsuit that he feared could have resulted in him being fired from Fox News, where he was a popular host. The attorney would not reveal the amount of the payment. ___ Slodysko reported from Washington and Linderman from Baltimore.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-police-report-reveals-assault-allegations-against-hegseth/	2024-11-21T14:46:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673fb9786c66b5.78382331.jpeg?w=900
Family fears missing woman Hannah Kobayashi was trafficked	(NewsNation) — The family of a woman who has been missing for over a week says they fear she may have been trafficked. Hannah Kobayashi was on her way to New York from Hawaii but missed her connecting flight in Los Angeles on Nov. 8, 2024. Her family says they received suspicious texts from the missing 31-year-old and says she was spotted on surveillance video in downtown LA near a Metro stop about a block from where the Los Angeles Lakers play. She was accompanied by an unidentified person. 4-year-old Florida boy found dead after vanishing from park A rally is planned for Thursday afternoon outside the Crypto.com Arena as her family searches for Kobayashi. Her aunt, Larie Pidgeon, said the unreleased surveillance footage showed Kobayashi was not alone and that she did not look well in the video. Kobayashi was wearing the same clothing she had worn when she arrived from Maui. Earlier sightings included one at the Grove Shopping Center, where Kobayashi posted to Instagram from a Nike event on Nov. 10. In a video obtained by the family, Kobayashi is seen strolling through the event that day wearing headphones. Her relatives are especially concerned about text messages from Kobayashi's phone on Nov. 11. One stated, 'I got hacked, stripped of my identity, I can't fly.' Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator Another said, 'I got tricked pretty much into giving away my funds for someone I thought I loved. I've been on the streets.' According to Pidgeon, the wording in the text is suspicious, and the phone has been turned off since Nov. 11. 'Time is of the essence, and it's dwindling, so we are terrified,' Pidgeon said. 'We're thinking of things like, was she abducted? I hate to say it, but the word 'trafficked.'' Posters and flyers are plastered throughout the area. Another question focuses on the Metros top, which does not connect to LAX. You have to make a connection from another line, which has left the family wondering if someone brought her to the area by the stadium. Family pleads for help finding pregnant Indiana woman who vanished in October The family filed a formal missing persons report on Nov. 12, and police confirmed there is an investigation underway. Since there is no hard evidence of a crime or foul play, the family fears her case is not a priority to officers. Her family is focusing their search in the area around the arena and are hoping the rally, right before a Lakers game, will lead to new leads.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/family-fear-hannah-kobayashi-trafficked/	2024-11-21T14:04:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/HannahKobayashi.jpg?w=229
Veronica Butler autopsy released after judge’s ruling	(NewsNation) — The autopsy of a Kansas woman has been released after a judge denied a motion that would have kept it sealed. The report says Veronica Butler, 27, suffered about 30 cuts and stab wounds throughout her body. There was also one blunt force injury to the top of her head and possible stun gun marks to the lower neck. Investigators said her body was found in a freezer under a concrete slab buried up to 8 feet below ground and sealed with yellow ratchet straps. Investigators said they also found clothing, a stun gun, a roll of tape and a sheathed knife. Kansas moms killings: What we know Butler and Jilian Kelley, 39, were killed earlier this year after they traveled from Hugoton, Kansas, to pick up Butler’s children in Oklahoma. The women never made it to the children. They disappeared March 30, and their bodies were found about two weeks later. Five people have been arrested and charged in the case, including the children’s grandmother. Tifany Adams, 54; her boyfriend Tad Cullum, 43; Cora Twombly, 44; and her husband Cole Twombly, 50; and Paul Grice, 31, have each been charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder. Wrangler Rickman, the father of the two children, had legal custody but was in a rehabilitation facility, so the children were living with Adams at the time of the disappearance. Exclusive: Kansas moms murder suspects kept apart in jail Police have described the two women as more acquaintances than friends. NewsNation reported that Kelley was the supervisor of the childhood visits for Butler. Family members, who have been asked to postpone media interviews until the police tell them otherwise, say the two women were involved in their community and their churches.

Pentagon admits some UAP sightings still unexplained	(NewsNation) — The Pentagon recently said it solved one of the most high-profile videos of a UFO, revealing that the famed 'GOFAST' video was a trick of the eye. The unexplained anomalous phenomena (UAP) was spotted by a jet from the USS Theodore Roosevelt in 2016 off the East Coast, appearing to fly at high speeds. But in a Senate hearing, the director of the Pentagon testified the object was an ordinary one, appearing to be moving very fast and very close to water due to an optical illusion known as parallax. What UAP witnesses recommend for congressional action Nick Pope, who investigated UFOs for the British Ministry of Defense, said he believes it is a good thing for the Pentagon to resolve cases like that one. 'This is good news because then they can move on to the ones that, even by their own admission, they can't explain,' he told NewsNation. The Pentagon maintains that there is no evidence UAPs are connected to extraterrestrial life, though believers think otherwise.

Daniel Penny trial: Pathologist disputes chokehold death finding	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — A forensic pathologist testified Thursday in defense of the military-trained commuter charged with killing Jordan Neely. A New York City medical examiner determined that Daniel Penny’s chokehold killed Neely, an agitated, mentally ill man whom Penny and some other riders found threatening. But the defense's pathologist, Dr. Satish Chundru, told jurors that Neely's medical records and bystander video didn't show telltale signs of known types of fatal chokehold. Matt Gaetz withdraws from nomination as attorney general Among the discrepancies, he said: The location and extent of bruising on Neely's neck and the small amount of petechiae — small red spots caused by subsurface bleeding — on his eyelids. He said Neely died from 'the combined effects' of synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint, and a blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during exertion. Penny, 26, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. His defense says the Marine veteran and architecture student was defending himself and a car full of subway riders. Neely, 30, sometimes entertained subway riders as a Michael Jackson impersonator. But he also had a history of psychiatric and drug problems and a criminal record that included assaulting a woman at a subway station. Illinois Supreme Court reverses actor Jussie Smollett’s conviction When they crossed paths in a subway car on May 1, 2023, Neely was begging for money, shouting about being willing to die or go to jail, and making sudden movements, according to witnesses. Penny has said Neely lurched toward a woman with a small child and said, 'I will kill.' Penny put his arm around Neely's neck, took him to the floor and held Neely there, with Penny’s legs around him, for close to six minutes, bystander videos show. Neely had stopped moving at roughly the last minute.

Donald Trump could create first 'crypto czar'	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump is considering adding a new position to his administration: the nation’s first-ever 'crypto czar.' The role would oversee cryptocurrency policy and regulation and act as a liaison between Congress and the White House. Trump's top team is meeting with bitcoin and crypto experts to discuss the role. Matt Gaetz withdraws from nomination as attorney general Trump has several crypto businesses himself and, during his campaign, had promised to make the United States the crypto capital of the world by creating a bitcoin strategic reserve.

The idea is in its early stages. Bloomberg reports that many of the conversations are in their initial processes, and there are still discussions about whether the role would be a specific White House administrative role or more of a 'czar' position, which is more colloquial for someone being a point person to spearhead a certain topic. What’s clear is that Trump has spoken very positively about the issue of cryptocurrency on the campaign trail and even gave remarks at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, this summer. 'If crypto is going to define the future, I want to be mined, minted and made in the USA,' Trump said. 'It's not going to be made anywhere else. Bitcoin is going to the moon, as we say. It’s going to the moon. I want America to be the nation that leads the way, and that's what's going to happen. You’re going to be very happy with me.' The price of bitcoin in just the past month has skyrocketed since the election. That’s largely because there are a lot of cryptocurrency investors who remain optimistic that this administration will be favorable to bitcoin and to cryptocurrency in the future. Sanctuary cities plan to resist Trump’s mass deportation plans Sen. Debbie Stabenow from Michigan has been trying to push cryptocurrency legislation since this summer and has encountered some roadblocks — both from within her own party as well as from across the aisle. She’s looking for ways to offer regulations and consumer protections, trying to make a push, according to Politico, before the new session comes into effect and Republicans take the majority in the Senate.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-first-crypto-czar/	2024-11-21T11:30:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2182554552.jpg?w=900
Are athletes being targeted by transnational crime ring?	(NewsNation) — The FBI is investigating whether a recent spate of burglaries at the homes of high-profile professional athletes is connected to a transnational crime ring. Last month, the homes of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce were broken into within days of each other, according to law enforcement reports. Mahomes said he couldn’t provide many details because the investigation is ongoing. Kelce’s losses included $20,000 in cash, according to a police report. In November, the home of Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis was burglarized by at least two people. That incident was captured on Portis’ home surveillance system. Illinois Supreme Court reverses actor Jussie Smollett’s conviction In September, burglars broke into the home of Minnesota Timberwolves player Mike Conley, stealing jewelry. NBC News reports the FBI is working to figure out if a transnational crime ring — possibly one from South America — is responsible. 'Referring to them as gangs kind of brings up this vision of street gangs,' retired FBI agent Bobby Chacon told NewsNation. 'These are not gangs in that sense. They are more organized rings or cells of thieves that are very highly trained.' The gang’s modus operandi, however, may end up giving them away, according to Chacon. 'The more sophisticated some of these groups actually become easier to find ... because they leave a signature, some type of thing that either enables them to defeat a sophisticated security system or get into a house in a certain way,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/athletes-targeted-transnational-crime-ring/	2024-11-21T11:06:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24318678707600.jpg?w=900
Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua now in 16 states: Report	(NewsNation) — The Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua has spread to 16 U.S. states, according to a New York Post report citing an internal Department of Homeland Security memo. The gang has reportedly established a presence in Virginia, Montana, Wyoming, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.

The New York Post cited internal communication from the Department of Homeland Security and shared a partial image of a memo in its reporting. NewsNation has not reviewed the memo or independently verified the report. GOP senator: Using military for deportations would be ‘huge mistake’ The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to NewsNation’s request for comment. Earlier this week, House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., issued a statement warning that the gang was operating in Tennessee. Green blamed President Joe Biden’s administration, saying it 'intentionally threw our borders wide open' and 'gutted interior enforcement.' 'Tennesseans — and our entire country — shouldn’t be forced to live in fear of heinous gangs because of this administration’s inability to secure our borders,' Green said. The gang started in a prison in the Venezuelan state of Aragua nearly a decade ago. It’s since expanded into what the Justice Department calls a 'transnational criminal organization.' The U.S. Treasury sanctioned the group in July, freezing assets and blocking transactions in the U.S. Several high-profile cases, including the death of 12-year-old Texas girl Jocelyn Nungaray, have fueled speculation about alleged migrant gang crimes. As for confirmed instances of TdA crimes in the U.S., some local leaders say the issue has been blown out of proportion. Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman refuted Trump’s comments about the city being a 'war zone.' 'The reality is that the concerns about Venezuelan gang activity have been grossly exaggerated,' Coffman wrote in an Oct. 8 Facebook post. 'The incidents were limited to several apartment complexes in this city of more than 400,000 residents.' Illegal crossings down 70% along US-Mexico border Colorado Democratic Governor Jared Polis also pushed back on Trump’s rhetoric. In a statement to NewsNation local affiliate KDVR, he called Aurora an 'incredible city with two straight years of rapidly declining crime.' Aurora police have acknowledged that 'components of Tren de Aragua' are operating in the area and have identified at least 10 known members. Multiple studies analyzing crime data have shown that immigrants commit crimes at a much lower rate than U.S. citizens. That’s true for both violent and nonviolent crimes.

Matt Gaetz withdraws from nomination as attorney general	(NewsNation) — Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has withdrawn his name from the running for attorney general following controversy over his nomination. Gaetz announced on X he had made the decision to withdraw after meeting with Senators for feedback. 'While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1,' he said. Trump’s border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes Gaetz resigned from his seat in the current Congress once he was nominated and said at the time he would not be sworn into his seat in the upcoming Congress on Jan. 3, 2025. However, now that he has backed out of the nomination, it is technically possible he could choose to take up the seat again. If Gaetz does not return to the House, Florida will hold a special election to fill the vacant seat. Many had expressed doubts over Gaetz's nomination due to an ongoing investigation by the House Ethics Committee and the fact that he's faced allegations of sex trafficking and soliciting a minor. The Justice Department declined to charge Gaetz after investigating him for sexual conduct and illicit drug use. The Ethics Committee had been getting close to releasing the report on Gaetz when he resigned, halting the process because the committee doesn't typically release reports on former lawmakers. There has been mounting public pressure for the committee to break with that precedent, however, in the face of Gaetz's nomination. Speaker Johnson: Capitol bathrooms restricted by ‘biological sex’ On Wednesday, the committee met to discuss the issue but failed to reach a consensus. A hacker released documents purportedly from the investigation to The New York Times, which included testimony from a woman who said she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17 and he was an adult. Another document allegedly from the investigation appeared to show Gaetz paying money for sex. If Gaetz were to take his seat up again, the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction over him would resume along with the investigation and possible consequences based on the findings. This is a developing story.

Illinois Supreme Court reverses actor Jussie Smollett's convictio...	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — The Illinois Supreme Court has reversed the conviction of actor Jussie Smollett. The former 'Empire' actor took his case to the Illinois Supreme Court in September in a last-ditch effort to have his 2021 conviction overturned. The court cited Smollett's second prosecution after his charges were initially dropped as the main reason why his conviction was overturned. 'Today we resolve a question about the State’s responsibility to honor the agreements it makes with defendants. Specifically, we address whether a dismissal of a case by nolle prosequi allows the State to bring a second prosecution when the dismissal was entered as part of an agreement with the defendant and the defendant has performed his part of the bargain. We hold that a second prosecution under these circumstances is a due process violation, and we therefore reverse defendant’s conviction,' the Illinois Supreme Court wrote in its ruling. Smollett was convicted of falsely reporting a 2019 hate crime against him in 2021. Smollett, who is Black and gay, alleged his attackers shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him before putting a noose around his neck on a freezing night in Streeterville. He was found guilty of five counts of disorderly conduct for setting up the attack. Testimony at his trial indicated he paid two brothers, whom he knew from the set of the TV show, $3,500 to carry out the 'attack.' But prior to his conviction, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx initially dropped his 16 charges in Apr. 2019 — which is the basis of Thursday's Supreme Court ruling. Foxx, who recused herself from the case after she communicated with a Smollett relative during the probe, reiterated that she welcomed of an independent investigation into the way she and her office handled the case. That came in Aug. of 2019, when Cook County Judge Michael Toomin’s appointed former U.S. attorney Dan Webb as special prosecutor. Previous: Jussie Smollett found guilty on 5 of 6 counts of disorderly conduct Webb led the prosecution efforts the second time around and Smollett was found guilty of five of six disorderly conduct charges on Dec. 9, 2021. Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in jail, 30 months of probation, and ordered to pay more than $130,000 in restitution. So far, he has served six days of that sentence. According to the ruling's conclusion, the Illinois Supreme Court cited Bill Cosby's case as one that also generated 'significant public interest.' The court went on to allude to Smollett's original charges being dropped and said while 'many people' were dissatisfied with that — it 'would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the State was not bound to honor agreements upon which people detrimentally relied.' In addition to the aforementioned public interest, Cosby's case was cited from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania regarding enforcing a prosecutorial promise not to prosecute. 'It cannot be gainsaid that society holds a strong interest in the prosecution of crimes. It is also true that no such interest, however important, ever can eclipse society’s interest in ensuring that the constitutional rights of the people are vindicated. Society’s interest in prosecution does not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons,' the court wrote regarding Cosby. The Appellate Court of Illinois denied Smollett’s request to toss his conviction in December of last year. The Illinois Supreme Court noted that Chief Justice Theis and Justice Cunningham did not take part in the consideration or decision of Smollett's case. Special prosecutor Dan Webb sent the following lengthy statement, saying he disagreed with the decision. 'We are disappointed in the Illinois Supreme Court’s decision today to overturn Jussie Smollett’s convictions and sentence, including the award of over $120,000 in restitution to the City of Chicago for its overtime expenses in investigating Mr. Smollett’s fake hate crime. We respectfully disagree with the Court’s factual and legal reasoning which upends long-standing Illinois precedent. Indeed, the Special Prosecutor’s brief to the Illinois Supreme Court was replete with Illinois case law that would not preclude a second, new prosecution following a dismissal without prejudice via nolle prosequi. Even the Illinois Supreme Court agreed in its opinion that its holding today was not explicit in earlier Illinois decisions. Make no mistake—today’s ruling has nothing to do with Mr. Smollett’s innocence. The Illinois Supreme Court did not find any error with the overwhelming evidence presented at trial that Mr. Smollett orchestrated a fake hate crime and reported it to the Chicago Police Department as a real hate crime, or the jury’s unanimous verdict that Mr. Smollett was guilty of five counts of felony disorderly conduct. In fact, Mr. Smollett did not even challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against him in his appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. My office spent nearly two years developing evidence and working closely with the Chicago Police Department to prepare that case for trial. It is very important I point out that today’s decision is also not the result of any error or conduct by the Office of the Special Prosecutor, the trial court, or the Chicago Police Department. In fact, the events that led to the Illinois Supreme Court to reverse Mr. Smollett’s conviction occurred 5 months before I was appointed as Special Prosecutor. Rather, today’s decision is only possible because of the unprecedented resolution of Mr. Smollett’s initial case by the Cook County State’s Attorneys’ Office (CCSAO) in March 2019, which the Illinois Supreme Court determined barred Mr. Smollett from any further prosecution. The Illinois Supreme Court reached this decision notwithstanding the fact that the CCSAO dismissed the initial Smollett case via a nolle prosequi, which does not bar re-prosecution under Illinois law, and Mr. Smollett’s own lawyers told the public immediately following the dismissal of his initial case in March 2019 that there was 'no deal' with the CCSAO. As previously set forth in my 63-page, very detailed Special Prosecutor’s Public Summary Report, my office developed evidence of substantial abuses of discretion and operational failures by the CCSAO in prosecuting and resolving the initial 2019 Smollett case, and also found that State’s Attorney Kimberly Foxx and other CCSAO prosecutors made multiple false and/or misleading statements to the public. Those significant failures and false and/or misleading statements by State’s Attorney Foxx’s office led Cook County Judge Michael B. Toomin to appoint me as Special Prosecutor in order to restore the public’s faith in Illinois’ criminal justice system. In fact, there was a public clamor to have a well-respected trial lawyer and law firm agree to become a special prosecutor in order to help restore the public’s confidence in the Cook County judicial system. My law firm, Winston &amp; Strawn LLP, accepted the appointment pro bono with no compensation to the firm in order to give back to the City of Chicago. Our Winston &amp; Strawn lawyers fulfilled this mandate by devoting over 5 years and more than 15,000 hours in examining the original Smollett investigation and bringing new charges, which yielded a unanimous jury conviction of Mr. Smollett in 2021 on five felony counts of wrongful misconduct. Nothing about today’s decision upsets the work undertaken by the Special Prosecutor’s office, or the overwhelming evidence underlying the jury’s verdict that Mr. Smollett faked a hate crime and reported it as a real hate crime to the Chicago Police Department. Despite today’s ruling, the City of Chicago remains able to pursue its pending civil lawsuit against Mr. Smollett in order to recoup the over $120,000 in overtime expenses the Chicago Police Department incurred for investigating Mr. Smollett’s fake hate crime. I want to provide a special thanks to Deputy Special Prosecutors Sean G. Wieber, Samuel Mendenhall, and the entire team at Winston &amp; Strawn who assisted in this matter, for all of their dedication and efforts over the years. Today’s ruling does not change how deeply proud I am of the work my Special Prosecutor’s office accomplished; nor does it undermine the jury’s verdict, and most importantly, it does not clear Jussie Smollett’s name—he is not innocent.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/illinois-supreme-court-reverses-actor-jussie-smolletts-conviction/	2024-11-21T08:43:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Bookingphoto2-e1732203524508.jpg?w=900

The Republican from Ohio gained national prominence through his bestselling memoir, 'Hillbilly Elegy.' During his time in the Senate, Vance, who was once one of Trump's biggest critics, later became one of the fiercest defenders of Trump’s 'Make America Great Again' agenda, especially when it comes to foreign policy, trade and immigration. What Trump’s administration could mean for education In 2021, he secured Trump’s endorsement during the Senate primary to fill the vacancy left by retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman. Vance then won the general Senate race against Democratic candidate Tim Ryan and took office in January 2023.

A senior adviser in Trump's first term who crafted many of the president-elect's speeches, The Associated Press reports Miller's been a central figure in many of his policy decisions, including the move to separate thousands of immigrant families as a deterrence program in 2018. After Trump left office, Miller became president of America First Legal, which the AP says was fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union that challenged the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others. Tom Homan, 'border czar' Homan will be charged with overseeing the United States' borders.(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Homan, as 'border czar,' is expected to make deportation a top priority. At the Republican National Convention, he said that he had a message to the 'millions' of undocumented migrants in the country: 'You better start packing now.' As acting director of ICE from January 2017 through June 2018, Homan backed Trump's zero tolerance policy at the border in his first term, which resulted in thousands of families being separated at the southern border. He's previously said that workplace raids would resume in the Trump administration. Before joining ICE, Homan was a police officer in West Carthage, New York, and later had positions as a Border Patrol agent, investigator and supervisor. Former Democratic President Barack Obama appointed Homan to be the executive associate director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2013.

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., Trump's pick for ambassador to the United Nations, was elected to the House of Representatives at the age of 30 in 2014, making her the youngest woman elected to Congress in United States history at the time. She currently serves as chair of the House Republican Conference, a position she was chosen for when former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from the post after publicly criticizing Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election. 'I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,' Trump said in a statement. 'Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.' Stefanik said she had a conversation with Trump where she told him 'how deeply humbled' she was to accept the nomination. 'I stand ready to advance President Donald J. Trump’s restoration of America First peace through strength leadership on the world stage on Day One at the United Nations,' Stefanik said on X Monday.

From 2015 to 2023, he served New York’s 1st Congressional District as a U.S. representative, and he ran for governor of the state in 2022, losing to current Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. Zeldin was on active duty in the United States Army for four years and is currently a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve. 'Lee, with a very strong legal background, has been a true fighter for America First policies,' Trump said in a statement. 'He will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet.' What to know about Trump’s inauguration Zeldin said on X that 'it is an honor' to join the administration. 'We will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI,' Zeldin said. 'We will do so while protecting access to clean air and water.' Mike Waltz, national security adviser Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.) leaves a closed-door House Republican conference meeting on Tuesday, January 10, 2023. Trump has tapped Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., to be his national security adviser, according to multiple reports. Waltz, a Green Beret combat vet and longtime Trump surrogate, has held office in his native Florida since 2019, when he took over DeSantis' post in the state's 6th Congressional District. The 50-year-old has called for Europe to do more to support Ukraine and for the U.S. to be more stringent with its support, aligning with a key foreign policy goal of the president-elect. He has also been a staunch critic of the Biden administration’s 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. The position doesn't require Senate confirmation, meaning Waltz will assume his role as soon as Trump is inaugurated. Trump went through multiple national security advisers during his first term. Michael Flynn was in the role for just a few weeks before resigning amid controversy over his conversations with Russia. Others to hold the post included H.R. McMaster, John Bolton and Robert O’Brien. Marco Rubio, secretary of state FILE - Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., speaks with members of the media, Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2024, at the Capitol in Washington.

The longtime politician, 53, will serve as the 47th president's top diplomat. He's considered one of the most conservative senators in Congress despite his position on immigration reform having diverged from the party’s consensus at one point. In terms of foreign policy, Rubio supported U.S. interventions in Iraq and Libya and has been supportive of sanctions against Iran.

If confirmed, he would be the second youngest ever to hold the position. Sources told NewsNation's Kellie Meyer that Pentagon officials are 'shocked,' with one source referring to Hegseth as young and inexperienced. A Pentagon press corps member added that they 'didn't see this coming.' Trump administration picks may limit House majority Hegseth served as an infantry officer in the Army National Guard in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, according to his website.

Clayton, an attorney at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell who specializes in mergers and capital-raising, is a political independent who developed a reputation while at the SEC for trying to forge consensus with the agency's Democratic commissioners. Clayton is likely to be seen as a somewhat unconventional pick for the office known for high-profile financial crime prosecutions, as he does not have any criminal law experience.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) Trump has chosen North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to head the Interior Department. In 2016, Burgum ran for governor, his first campaign for elected office. He touted a message of 'reinventing' government as the state dealt with a massive revenue shortfall. In a major upset, Burgum defeated North Dakota’s longtime attorney general in the Republican gubernatorial primary. He handily won his first term in the strong Republican state, which has about 784,000 residents. He was easily reelected in 2020. Burgum ran for president from June to December 2023. He campaigned on priorities of energy, economy and national security, but dropped out after his bid failed to resonate. He appeared in two Republican debates — including the first, which he attended after hurting his Achilles tendon playing basketball. He drew attention for his campaign offering $20 gift cards to people who would donate $1 to his campaign so he would have enough individual donors to make the debate stage. In January, before the Iowa caucuses, he endorsed Trump. The same month, he declined to seek a third term as governor.

Wright will work alongside Doug Burgum, who was designated to head the Interior Department just days ago. 'As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,' Trump's statement says.

'There may be no Physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to Make America Healthy Again. He is an eminent Physician, Heart Surgeon, Inventor, and World-Class Communicator, who has been at the forefront of healthy living for decades,' Trump's statement reads in part.

'Matt will strengthen relationships with our NATO Allies, and stand firm in the face of threats to Peace and Stability,' Trump wrote. 'I have full confidence in Matt’s ability to represent the United States with Strength, Integrity, and unwavering Dedication.' Whitaker was the acting attorney general for about three months during the middle of Trump’s first term. Before, he served as chief of staff to Jeff Sessions for a bit more than a month before Sessions resigned as attorney general in November 2018, opening the role for him. He was previously a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa under President George W. Bush’s administration. Whitaker also served in private practice from 2009 to 2017 before rejoining the Department of Justice. He has been a political consultant for the past few years and has three degrees from the University of Iowa. Doug Collins, Veterans Affairs secretary Republican candidate for Senate Rep.

Sergio Gor, White House personnel Trump appointed Sergio Gor, an ally and business partner of his son, Donald Trump Jr., to run the White House’s personnel office in his new administration. Gor is slated to lead the Presidential Personnel Office, an important position given Trump’s desire to stock his administration with loyalists and root out any individuals who may not follow through with his agenda. The office helps identify and put forward appointees to fill thousands of jobs across the federal government. 'Awesome news. Sergio will be great!' Trump Jr. posted on the social platform X about news of Gor’s appointment. Gor is a former aide to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and co-founded a publishing company with Trump Jr. that has published books by the president-elect and conservative personalities such as Charlie Kirk and Peter Navarro. Gor also led the pro-Trump super PAC Right for America. During Trump’s first term, the office was led by Johnny McEntee, who reportedly sought out loyalists to serve in the administration. McEntee more recently worked on a Heritage Foundation effort to identify personnel and lay the foundation for the next Republican administration. Steven Cheung, White House communications director Steven Cheung, who has served as a top press aide on the Trump campaign for the past two years, will join the incoming administration as White House communications director.

Side hustles becoming a necessity for some Americans	(NewsNation) — Having a second job used to be associated with greater financial freedom but, for many Americans, side hustles have become a necessity. No longer just a means for spare cash, side gigs are an important contribution to many household incomes. Matthew Kallish is among those with a second full-time job. After working a graveyard shift at a New Jersey hotel, he then heads back for another eight hours of work as a mailman. Man wins $650K on lottery ticket using numbers tied to late wife 'It’s definitely a struggle,' Kallish said. 'Staying up all night, which is a struggle in itself, and then knowing that you’re coming to work another whole shift at another job.' More than one-third of people with a so-called side hustle need the work to afford living essentials like rent and groceries, according to a BankRate survey. 'It’s hard,' Kallish said. 'With the cost of gas and groceries. Sometimes, at the end of the week, all the big bills are paid but we’re waiting until Friday to go grocery shopping because there’s only so much money to go around — even with both jobs.' Financial expert Rachel Cruz says Americans struggling to make ends meet should pause investing while paying off debt and sell things they don’t use or need. Skipping a vacation or going one month on 'no spending' can help ease the burden. Burning the candle at both ends shouldn’t be a long-term solution, she said. 'It’s easy to wander into debt and really hard to get out,' she said. 'So those two to three extra jobs to keep you afloat to be able to get you out of debt are key. But once you're out of debt and you have an emergency fund in place, then my hope would be that your full-time job can take care of your living expenses and you can still live below your means.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/side-hustles-necessity-some-americans/	2024-11-21T05:51:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/fdf78e6255a04e2da5ca885c746999d3.jpg?w=900
Egregious patterns of abuse' in Florida migrant facility: ACLU	(NewsNation) — A migrant woman with a history of mental illness spent a month in solitary confinement at a Florida detention center and experienced abuse and neglect, a civil rights complaint filed last week alleges. The woman, named only as Ana, suffers from PTSD, anxiety and depression, yet her intake forms at the Baker County Detention Center in Macclenny, Florida, categorized her as having no 'major mental illness such as . . . major depressive (disorder),' the ACLU of Florida said in the complaint, co-filed with the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization. Still, she was placed in isolation in a 'filthy' and 'dark' cell without a mattress, according to the complaint, which was submitted to the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. Trump’s border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes Ana, a 33-year-old domestic violence and human trafficking survivor from an unspecified Spanish-speaking country, arrived at Baker in May 2023 under U.S. Immigrations and Enforcement custody. Her intake forms incorrectly identify English as her spoken language, the complaint says. The language barrier and lack of translation services exacerbated her abusive experience in the detention center. The jail operates in part as an immigration detention facility and has faced multiple civil rights suits since 2022. This year, a Baker officer was convicted of sexual battery on an inmate and sentenced to 25 years. 'Ana’s experiences at Baker illustrate many of the most egregious patterns of abuse at the facility, including sexual abuse in the form of voyeurism, abuse of solitary confinement,' the complaint says, 'the improper use of force and restraints, denial of mental health care, denial of access to counsel, failure to provide language access services and incomplete and falsified records.' Illegal crossings down 70% along US-Mexico border A Florida lawmaker wants the facility shut down. 'What I saw was horrible. I saw conditions that no human should have to live in,' said Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., in an Instagram video call with the ACLU of Florida on Monday. Frost said he visited the ICE facility before. 'We are talking about the medical unit. The problem here too is a lot of that medical unit is being used to house people, or being used as a solitary confinement,' Frost said. 'Do what’s right — shut down this facility.' Baker County Sheriff Scotty Rhoden praised the facility's staff in a Facebook post Monday from the Baker County Sheriff's Office page, saying, 'I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated Detention staff. They do an outstanding job, and I am incredibly proud of their unwavering commitment to the citizens of Baker County.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/florida-migrant-facility-aclu-complaint/	2024-11-21T05:29:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66fae40d3095e1.75671394.jpeg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Asheville, North Carolina, residents can safely drink from the tap now that the citywide boil water notice has been lifted, the city's water department announced Tuesday. The announcement came more than seven weeks after Helene, the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. since Katrina, swept through the Southeast. Officials had been flushing the water system for a week until Saturday when no raw or untreated water remained, according to city spokesperson Clay Chandler. They tested 120 samples over the weekend. 'Customers may resume normal usage of the water system. It is no longer advisable to use bottled water for consumption,' Chandler said at a news conference. National Weather Service releases Helene wind damage assessment The storm damaged water lines at the North Forth Reservoir, Asheville's water source, forcing residents to rely on bottled water for drinking, cooking and bathing for close to 55 days. The city expects a surge in water demand, so residents should avoid large-volume usage, including filling bathtubs, watering yards and taking long showers. Western North Carolina was hit hard when Helene struck Sept. 27, wiping out infrastructure and knocking out power for weeks. At least 42 people died in Buncombe County where Asheville is located. Schools remained closed for about a month due to undrinkable water and road repairs. 'We understand that an initial disruption in water service, followed by not having potable water out of the tap, was disruptive and frustrating, and we thank you for hanging in there with us,' Chandler said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/asheville-north-carolina-boil-water-notice-helene/	2024-11-21T05:06:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/helene_aid_093024ap01_w.jpg?w=900

People seeking help or experiencing a crisis can dial 988 to reach the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline or 800-799-7233 to contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline. (NewsNation) — David Smith, the ex-husband of Susan Smith and father of the two boys she murdered, expressed 'much relief' Wednesday upon learning that Susan had been denied parole. Susan Smith was convicted of two counts of murder in 1994 after allowing her car to roll into a South Carolina lake with her sons, Michael and Alex, inside. In the days leading up to the parole hearing, David shared that he had 'spoken' to his sons in his own way. 'We had a lot of discussions,' he revealed exclusively on Banfield. 'Time heals some wounds. But for me, personally, time does not heal the loss of a child,' Smith said. During 'Banfield's' one-hour exclusive episode, Smith shared never-before-seen images of Michael and Alex Smith.

Smith’s voice shook as she spoke to board members over a video call and expressed remorse for the boys’ deaths. She told the parole board that she’s a Christian and asked them to show her 'that same kind of mercy, as well.' 'I know that what I did was horrible,' she said, wiping her eyes. 'And I would give anything if I could go back and change it. I love Michael and Alex with all my heart.' Trump’s border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes Smith was sentenced to life in prison in 1994 for the deaths of her 3-year-old son Michael and 14-month-old Alex. She initially told police a carjacker took off with her children still inside the vehicle. The case drew international attention as Smith pleaded with the media and public to help locate her children for nine days. Eventually, Smith admitted she strapped her two sons into car seats and drove onto a boat ramp at a South Carolina lake, where she let the vehicle roll into the water with her sons still in the back seats. 'I didn’t lie to get away with it,' Smith said through tears. 'I really didn’t. I was just scared. I didn’t know how to tell the people who loved them that they’d never see them again. How could I tell David he couldn’t see his sons again?' 'I’m sorry,' she continued. 'I know that’s not enough. I know it’s not. I know they just sound like words, but they come from my heart.

Idaho college killings: Kohberger can face death penalty if convi...	(NewsNation) — Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students in 2022, can face the death penalty if convicted, a judge has ruled. Kohberger's defense team sought to remove the death penalty as a possible punishment, but Ada County Judge Steven Hippler denied its request. The trial for Kohberger is set to begin in August. Susan Smith up for parole 30 years after killing her sons Kohberger, 29, is charged in the deaths of four University of Idaho students who were found stabbed to death in an off-campus house in November of 2022. The deaths of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, shocked the small town of Moscow, Idaho. Initially, investigators had few leads and spent considerable time tracing the activities of the four students in the hours prior to their deaths. This journey for justice for Kaylee, Maddie, Xana, and Ethan has been filled with highs and lows. Some days, we are hopeful that justice will be served; other days, we are overwhelmed with hopelessness and sadness. Today is a day for hope! The past two years in front of Judge Judge have been marked by frustration and disappointment—whether it was failing to pronounce the victims' names correctly, laughing in the courtroom, or entertaining every absurd motion or argument the defense could muster. That has been our reality. But now, we feel hopeful once again. We finally have a judge who appears prepared, thoughtful, and well-versed in the legal process. There is a newfound level of seriousness that has been absent for far too long. So, when we learned today that the motions to challenge the death penalty were denied, we were overjoyed—not just for our family, but for our friends, supporters, and everyone who has shed a tear, made a donation, or listened to the story of these beautiful children who were so senselessly taken from us. Justice is moving forward, and we pray that one day, in the not-so-distant future, it will be served. Thank you once again to everyone for your unwavering support and prayers, and a special thank you to the people of Boise, who have welcomed us with open arms.

Trump's border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes	NewsNation) — Patrolling more than 1,900 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border falls under federal jurisdiction, but if President-elect Donald Trump bulks up manpower to go after immigrants who entered the country illegally as he has pledged, local law enforcement agencies could also be called into action. Trump has doubled down on plans for the largest domestic deportation in American history, focusing initially on immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes. As Trump’s inauguration draws closer, agencies on the front lines of border crimes and the entry of millions of immigrants expect a noticeable shift. Illegal crossings down 70% along US-Mexico border Republican Sheriff Mark Dannels in Arizona’s Cochise County says intensified federal attention to the border crisis will provide relief to his 100 deputized officers who patrol 6,200 square miles of rural desert that runs 83 miles along the U.S.-Mexico border. Cochise deputies have made 4,000 arrests in the past 35 months involving border crimes including human and drug smuggling. Dannels says officers are stressed and have risked serious injury and death in apprehending offenders. The incoming administration has created optimism, the sheriff said. 'You’ve got a president who has already made it very clear …and comes with a report card of border security being a priority – that he’s going to come in and do the federal government’s job. And that is, do what you’re supposed to do,' Dannels told NewsNation. Border sheriffs expect help from Trump administration Cochise County already partners with 100 federal and state agents and officers at a unique operations station to patrol 83 miles of the border. Border crossings aren’t the main issue for Cochise County deputies, as many of the migrants that come through the county head to urban areas. Instead, deputies are tasked with tackling crime at the border, such as drug smuggling. In almost three years, the department has arrested 4,000 people for border-related crimes, Dannels said most of them are Americans working with the cartels. Receiving more White House support will allow deputies to get back to 'doing what they do best,' Dannels said. 'We’ve covered the bill,' Dannels said. 'It’s time for them to reimburse us and cover their own debt and do their job.' Trump’s immigration grand strategy casts wide net Some agencies speculate that removing an estimated 11 million immigrants could cost the federal government nearly $970 billion over 10 years. Texas is prepared to offer up 1,400 acres of land to build a detention facility to aid Trump with his mass deportation efforts, according to a letter obtained by NewsNation. Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham sent the letter to Trump offering the land, which is located in the Rio Grande Valley sector near the U.S. Mexican border. Buckingham told Trump that her office is prepared to cooperate with ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Border Patrol for the facility.

He told NewsNation he’s ready for backup considering the fact his small department covers 2,300 square miles of territory and 54 miles along the border. Terrell County experienced a 417% jump in border apprehensions in fiscal year 2022, Cleveland said. The department already has existing relationships with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Texas Department of Public Safety. Cleveland knows that under Trump’s leadership, his department will benefit from increased support — even if it is asked to assist federal agents with locating and apprehension of illegal immigrants as is authorized under ICE’s 287 (g) Immigration and Nationality Act. 'We’re not afraid to be in the fight,' Cleveland said. Laredo police dismiss reports Guy Fieri, Sammy Hagar lost 4,000 cases of tequila in heist Joe Frank Martinez was recently elected for his fifth term as sheriff in Val Verde, Texas, which shares 150 border miles with Mexico along the Rio Grande River. His department includes four deputies to police the 3,200 square miles that make up the county. In 2021, roughly 3,000 mostly Haitian immigrants congregated under an international bridge for two weeks, creating an emergency in Del Rio and for Martinez’s small department. Although Val Verde County has seen immigrant encounters diminish since 2023, Martinez acknowledges more needs to be done. That’s especially true in a rural area of Texas where protective structures – like Trump’s unfinished border wall – have fallen into disrepair and include gaps. Martinez, a Democrat, says even though significant border encounters aren’t particularly problematic for his department these days, it doesn’t mean that’s the case everywhere. 'This shouldn’t be a red or blue issue,' Martinez said. 'I think that both sides need to come together and come up with a solution. If (a border wall) is the solution that is going to keep our community safe, I’m for it.' Where state laws prohibit local enforcement of immigration In California, which has been among the states affected most by illegal border crossings, local law enforcement officials are limited in their ability to make arrests of those entering the state. The CBP San Diego sector reported more than 9,500 migrant arrests in a single week in April of this year. It marked the first time since 1999 that the sector tallied the most arrests of any region, the Los Angeles Times reported. That number grew to 14,436 in August, according to CBP data cited by the Washington Office on Latin America. Despite the number of arrests made along the border by federal agents, California state law defines the role of agencies including the San Diego Sheriff’s Department. A department spokesman told NewsNation that local deputies are regularly used to assist immigrants who have already crossed the border and need humanitarian aid. However, the department’s involvement stops there, leaving any immigration enforecement work to the feds. The spokesman said any change in department policy would require a change to state law. Should that happen, the spokesman said the department would review the amendments and its current policies before considering any changes. The spokesman declined to speculate what could happen under Trump. 'We support the efforts of the United States Border Patrol, who have an extremely challenging and dangerous job,' the spokesman said.

Sanctuary cities plan to resist Trump's mass deportation plans	(NewsNation) — Ahead of a Donald Trump presidency, leaders in sanctuary cities insist they will not aid any mass deportation plans after Inauguration Day. In states like Colorado, Illinois and New York, where hundreds of thousands of migrants have been bused from the southern border by GOP Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, officials have doubled down on their promise to protect newcomers. Los Angeles became the latest city to approve sanctuary status after the City Council unanimously approved a measure this week. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The ordinance prohibits the use of city resources for federal immigration enforcement. It could also mean potential legal battles as the Trump administration prepares to use ICE and the military to carry out the campaign promise of mass deportations. An estimated 1.8 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally live in California, more than any other state, with nearly a million in Los Angeles County. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass expedited the sanctuary city ordinance as resistance to Trump's mass deportation plan. In Chicago, where more than 50,000 new arrivals have been sent since 2022, Mayor Brandon Johnson has characterized Trump as a tyrant and says the city’s police force has enough work to do without assisting in apprehending immigrants convicted of serious crimes. 'We’re not going to bend or break or cower to someone’s threat,' Johnson told reporters after the election. 'We’re going to stand up and unite around our shared values, and (residents) have my assurance that I’m going to protect the families of this city.'

(Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Johnson previously targeted his anger at Abbott, who threatened to keep sending busloads of immigrants to cities like Chicago until the White House committed to securing the southern border. But Trump and Tom Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Trump’s 'border czar,' are promising to withhold federal funding if Democrat-run cities don’t cooperate, leading some leaders in those places to push back even harder. Survey: Nearly half migrants experienced gun violence in home countries 'Our city’s police department is not going to (double) as ICE agents — we’re just not going to do that,' Chicago’s mayor said. 'It’s a dangerous precedent where members of communities begin to feel unsafe with their local police department.' Chicago police declined to make anyone available for an interview with NewsNation. In response to Democratic pushback in cities like Chicago, Homan has issued a warning. 'If you’re not going to help us, get the hell out of the way because we’re going to do it,' Homan told Fox News. The standoff has created some backlash in Chicago, where Johnson’s stand to remain a welcoming city for immigrants isn’t shared by some other city leaders. 'We need those funds like you wouldn’t believe,' Alderman Anthony Napolitano told NewsNation. 'The city is in so much disarray … it’s been catastrophic for the city of Chicago, and if you take away those federal funds, it’s only going to get worse for us here.' The pushback against Operation Aurora In Colorado, which Trump targeted during his presidential campaign over the presence of migrants and alleged migrant gang activity at an Aurora apartment complex, officials are also bracing for what could be coming. Trump told supporters that he would deport violent criminals by sending 'elite squads' of federal agents to 'hunt down, arrest and deport' every single illegal alien. He called the plan 'Operation Aurora,' referencing the Denver suburb. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis told Colorado Public Radio that while he welcomes federal assistance in tracking down and apprehending immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes or belong to gangs, the state’s support for Trump’s plans ended there.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) 'Obviously, it would devastate our economy and our society if someone were to come in and forcibly take our neighbors away from us,' Polis told the station. As far as local police involvement in Trump’s proposed crackdown on immigrant criminals, Aurora’s police department says it will remain focused on dealing with local law enforcement. 'As we always have, we will work with our federal partners and follow federal law and directives as they apply to our community,' an Aurora city spokesman said in a statement provided to NewsNation. Trump’s immigration grand strategy casts wide net Police in Denver, where around 45,000 migrants have been sent by Abbott since 2022, told NewsNation that it does not assist with the enforcement of federal immigration policy as part of city statutes. In addition, a department spokesperson said Denver police do not ask witnesses or victims of crime about immigration status, removing a potential barrier to reporting crimes and holding offenders accountable. Tom Homan targets New York City’s approach New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams has denounced Trump’s mass deportation plans for a city that has spent more than $5 billion in housing costs for the more than 200,000 migrants that have been sent there since 2022. The New York Times reported that Manuel Castro, New York’s commissioner of migrant affairs, has vowed not to follow 'the instructions of the federal government in cases of mass deportations.' Like other sanctuary cities, New York has provisions in place to limit its participation with federal immigration enforcement. That doesn’t prohibit ICE from apprehending immigrants who reside in New York City but who are not U.S. citizens, the report said. While ICE’s 287(g) Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes local police departments to deputize officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement efforts, the New York Police Department does not participate in those efforts, The New York Times reported. Since 2014, the city has declined to honor ICE detention orders that would involve the city’s police department holding immigrants in the U.S. illegally who have been charged with crimes in custody until they can be picked up. However, under New York law, criminals who have been convicted of 170 serious offenses — including murder and rape — are not protected. But Homan has pledged to send more federal agents to apprehend convicted immigrants in New York should city officials refuse to cooperate. 'We’re going to do the job,' Homan said in an interview with Fox News. 'We’re going to do the job with you or without you.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/sanctuary-cities-trump-deportation-plans/	2024-11-20T16:33:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/AP23212663498953.jpg?w=900
Musk, Ramaswamy lay out plans for 'mass' federal layoffs, rule ro...	(The Hill) — Tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy said Wednesday that their brand-new government efficiency panel will identify 'thousands' of regulations for President-elect Donald Trump to eliminate, which they argue will justify 'mass head-count reductions' across government. The pair, who were named co-chairs of the panel last week, laid out their plans for the 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. What is Elon Musk’s plan for DOGE? 'The two of us will advise DOGE at every step to pursue three major kinds of reform: regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions and cost savings,' they wrote. 'We will focus particularly on driving change through executive action based on existing legislation rather than by passing new laws.' Musk and Ramaswamy pointed to several recent Supreme Court decisions that have taken aim at the power of the administrative state, arguing that a 'plethora of current federal regulations' exceed agency authority and could be on the chopping block. Slashing regulations should allow for 'at least' proportional cuts to the government workforce, they argue. 'A drastic reduction in federal regulations provides sound industrial logic for mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy,' the pair wrote in the op-ed. 'Not only are fewer employees required to enforce fewer regulations, but the agency would produce fewer regulations once its scope of authority is properly limited,' they added. Musk and Ramaswamy preemptively addressed arguments about civil service protections that could potentially block Trump from firing federal workers. 'The purpose of these protections is to protect employees from political retaliation,' they wrote. 'But the statute allows for ‘reductions in force’ that don’t target specific employees. The statute further empowers the president to ‘prescribe rules governing the competitive service.’ That power is broad.' Elon Musk is hiring for DOGE. Here’s the type of people he wants to recruit 'With this authority, Mr. Trump can implement any number of ‘rules governing the competitive service’ that would curtail administrative overgrowth, from large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area,' they added. Government workers are already mobilizing in the face of potential mass cuts, reportedly hiring lawyers and preparing public campaigns while also hoping Congress will step in, according to Reuters. DOGE also hopes to take aim at 'unauthorized' federal funding, which could impact everything from veterans’ health care and opioid addiction treatment to NASA, The Washington Post reported. The op-ed seemingly seeks to address widespread skepticism about the ability of Musk and Ramaswamy’s panel to enact change. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

However, Musk’s close relationship with the president-elect could be influential. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO played a key role in Trump’s campaign, contributing millions of dollars to his own pro-Trump super PAC and getting out on the campaign trail. Trump said he can’t run in 2028 unless the GOP figures ‘something’ out: Could that happen? Since Trump’s decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this month, Musk has remained close at hand; the billionaire tech mogul joined the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago on election night to watch the results roll in and later received a shoutout in Trump’s victory speech. Musk has spent much of his time at the Palm Beach, Fla., resort over the past two weeks, reportedly weighing in on Trump’s Cabinet picks and attending meetings, including those with world leaders. He also hosted Trump in Texas to observe the launch of a SpaceX rocket Tuesday afternoon.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-musk-ramaswamy-mass-layoffs/	2024-11-20T15:50:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24291821306487_17af5f-e1732133362308.jpg?w=800
Thanksgiving will cost less this year, here's which items are che...	(NewsNation) — Thanksgiving dinner will cost less this year thanks to lower turkey prices, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s annual survey released Wednesday. The survey found that a classic feast for 10 will cost $58.08 this year, a 5% decrease from 2023 and down from a record high of $64.05 in 2022. It's the second year in a row that American families can expect to spend less on Thanksgiving dinner, but the cost is still almost 20% higher than before the pandemic in 2019. 'We are seeing modest improvements in the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for a second year, but America’s families, including farm families, are still being hurt by high inflation,' AFBF President Zippy Duvall said in a statement. This year's decline is partially due to lower turkey prices, which have dropped 6% from a year ago despite a bird flu outbreak. 'The American turkey flock is the smallest it’s been since 1985 because of avian influenza, but overall, demand has also fallen, resulting in lower prices at the grocery store for families planning a holiday meal,' AFBF economist Bernt Nelson said in a statement. How will Trump's tariffs impact everyday Americans? How much does Thanksgiving food cost in 2024? Thanksgiving staples, like pumpkin pie mix, vegetables and sweet potatoes, are less expensive than a year ago. The cost of whole milk has dropped more than other items, falling 14% from a year earlier because of favorable weather conditions for dairy farmers, AFBF said. Meanwhile, a pound of frozen peas is down to $1.73, an 8% decline from 2023. But it's not all good news. The survey found some prices, particularly processed food, have gone up. Corporate greed not the main driver of inflation: Fed study Items like dinner rolls and cubed stuffing saw an 8% increase due to higher labor costs. Cranberry prices have also shot up, almost 12% year over year, though that's still in line with historical averages, the AFBF said. There were also regional differences in the cost of a meal. Those celebrating in the West can expect to spend at least 15% more than the rest of the country: $67.81 for a party of 10. Southern dinners will cost the least at $56.81, followed closely by the Northeast at $57.36 and $58.90 in the Midwest, according to the survey. Grocery inflation has slowed down The AFBF's report is a promising sign that Americans are finally seeing some relief at the grocery store. Since Jan. 2021, grocery bills are up more than 22%, according to government inflation data. However, the rise in grocery prices has slowed significantly since the start of 2024, hovering around a 1% annual rate. The American Farm Bureau Federation’s 39th annual Thanksgiving dinner survey comes from Farm Bureau shoppers who checked store prices between Nov. 1 and 7 across all 50 states and Puerto Rico. The AFBF said the shoppers didn't take advantage of special promotions and collected the data before most grocery chains started discounting turkey prices. Here’s how Thanksgiving prices compare to a year ago, according to the AFBF: 16-pound turkey: $25.67 (-6.1%) 14 ounces of cubed stuffing mix: $4.08 (+8.2%) 2 frozen pie crusts: $3.40 (-2.9%) Half pint of whipping cream: $1.81 (+4.7%) 1 pound of frozen peas: $1.73 (-8.1%) 1 dozen dinner rolls: $4.16 (+8.4%) Misc. ingredients to prepare the meal: $3.75 (-5.1%) 30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix: $4.15 (-6.5%) 1 gallon of whole milk: $3.21 (-14.3%) 3 pounds of sweet potatoes: $2.93 (-26.2%) 1-pound veggie tray (carrots &amp; celery): $.84 (-6.4%) 12-ounce bag of fresh cranberries: $2.35 (+11.8%)	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/thanksgiving-dinner-costs-this-year/	2024-11-20T13:04:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/meal.jpg?w=900
Speaker Johnson: Capitol bathrooms restricted by 'biological sex'	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — House Speaker Mike Johnson signaled support Tuesday for a Republican effort to ban Democrat Sarah McBride — the first transgender person to be elected to Congress — from using women’s restrooms in the Capitol once she's sworn into office next year. 'All single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings — such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms — are reserved for individuals of that biological sex,' a statement from Johnson said in part. A resolution proposed Monday by GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina would prohibit any lawmakers and House employees from 'using single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex.' Mace said the bill is aimed specifically at McBride, who was elected to the House this month from Delaware. Nancy Mace: Capitol transgender bathroom rules protect women 'It’s the height of hypocrisy and gaslighting to tell women, you lose your rights, and then a man walks in the room. I don’t think so,' Mace said Tuesday on NewsNation’s 'On Balance.' 'I’m very socially sensible, but this is about women’s safety. It’s about women’s security, it’s about women’s privacy, and we have rights.' The debate over whether transgender people should be allowed to use the bathrooms that align with their gender identity has been prevalent across the U.S. and was a focal point of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign. At least 11 states have adopted laws barring transgender girls and women from girls and women’s bathrooms at public schools and in some cases other government facilities. McBride was elected to the House this month after building a national profile as an LGBTQ+ activist and raising more than $3 million in campaign contributions from around the country. She became the first openly transgender person to address a major party convention in the United States in 2016 when she spoke at the Democratic National Convention. 'We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care and child care, not manufacturing culture wars,' McBride said. 'Delawareans sent me here to make the American dream more affordable and accessible, and that’s what I’m focused on.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/mike-johnson-capitol-bathrooms-restricted-biological-sex/	2024-11-20T11:54:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2184995458.jpg?w=900
Gaetz meets with GOP senators as Dems ask FBI for more info	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's choice for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, has launched an effort to secure his embattled nomination, meeting behind closed doors Wednesday with GOP senators who have questions about sexual misconduct and other allegations against him. Gaetz’s move came as Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray asking for 'the complete evidentiary file' from the agency’s investigation into allegations of sex trafficking of minors against Gaetz. The Democratic senators, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, say the allegations against Gaetz are 'significant' in light of his associate, Joe Greenberg, having pleaded guilty to the sex trafficking charge for which the Florida Republican was also investigated. Republicans on Ethics Committee weigh ‘unenviable’ Gaetz report decision 'In order for the Senate to perform its constitutional duty in this instance, we must be able to thoroughly review all relevant materials that speak to the credibility of these serious allegations against Mr. Gaetz,' the senators wrote in their Wednesday letter to Wray. The senators wrote that 'the grave public allegations against Mr. Gaetz speak directly to his fitness to serve as the chief law enforcement officer for the federal government.' The letter was signed by Durbin and Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal, Conn.; Sheldon Whitehouse, R.I.; Amy Klobuchar, Minn.; Mazie Hirono, Hawaii; Laphonza Butler, Calif.; Chris Coons, Del.; Peter Welch, Vt.; Cory Booker, N.J.; and Alex Padilla, Calif. As Gaetz and senators holed up near the Senate, members of the House Ethics Committee were expected to be meeting to discuss the findings of a long-running investigation of their former colleague. Attorneys involved in a civil case brought by a Gaetz associate were notified this week that an unauthorized person accessed a file shared between lawyers that included unredacted depositions from a woman who said Gaetz had sex with her when she was 17 and a second woman who says she saw the encounter, according to attorney Joel Leppard. Trump interviewing candidates for FBI chief, Vance says in later-deleted social media post While House Speaker Mike Johnson has said the Ethics Committee should not release the report — since Gaetz swiftly resigned his congressional seat — several GOP senators have indicated they want all information before having to make a decision on how they would vote. Sen. Tommy Tuberville told NewsNation he’s waiting for more facts to come out. 'I'm fully supportive of (Gaetz). I just say, make sure you're transparent,' Tuberville said. 'We don't need things popping up. I'm not into rumors, because I know how this place is, they will ruin you in a heartbeat with rumors. But I'm all in with facts. And if it's all factual in terms of something that could be construed as criminal, then of course, I won't vote for it, but and (Gaetz) knows that.' As soon as the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3, when Republicans take majority control, senators are expected to begin holding hearings on Trump's nominees, with voting possible on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20.

Susan Smith denied parole after serving 30 years for sons' murder...	Editor's note: This article mentions suicide and domestic violence. People seeking help or experiencing a crisis can dial 988 to reach the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline or 1-800-799-7233 to contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline. (NewsNation) — A South Carolina parole board denied Susan Smith’s release Wednesday, nearly 30 years after she received a life sentence for murdering her 3-year-old and infant sons. Smith’s voice shook as she spoke to board members over a video call and expressed remorse for the boys’ deaths. She told the parole board that she’s a Christian and asked them to show her 'that same kind of mercy, as well.' 'I know that what I did was horrible,' she said, wiping her eyes. 'And I would give anything if I could go back and change it. I love Michael and Alex with all my heart.' Toys &amp; pics of Michael &amp; Alex Smith at John D.

Campbell/Getty Images) Smith was sentenced to life in prison in 1994 for the deaths of her 3-year-old son Michael and 14-month-old Alex. She initially told police a carjacker took off with her children still inside the vehicle. The case drew international attention as Smith pleaded with the media and public to help locate her children for nine days. Eventually, Smith admitted she strapped her two sons into car seats and drove onto a boat ramp at a South Carolina lake, where she let the vehicle roll into the water with her sons still in the back seats. 'I didn’t lie to get away with it,' Smith said through tears. 'I really didn’t. I was just scared. I didn’t know how to tell the people who loved them that they’d never see them again. How could I tell David he couldn’t see his sons again?' 'I’m sorry,' she continued. 'I know that’s not enough. I know it’s not. I know they just sound like words, but they come from my heart. They really do.' This story is developing.

Hannah Kobayashi: Family searches for woman who went missing in L...	(NewsNation) — Family members of Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi are in Los Angeles to search for her after the 31-year-old went missing on a trip to California earlier this month. According to the Los Angeles Police Department's Missing Persons Unit, Kobayashi is 5 feet, 10 inches tall, and weighs about 140 pounds. She has brown hair and eyes, and fair skin with freckles, as well as a tattoo that says 'knife' on her forearm. Kobayashi's family last heard from her on Nov. 11, when she started sending them 'alarming' text messages, NewsNation local affiliate KTLA reported. Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator What is known about Hannah Kobayashi's disappearance KTLA wrote that Kobayashi, on Nov. 8, missed a connecting flight from Los Angeles to New York City, where she was planning to visit family. The day after, Kobayashi decided to go to The Grove shopping center for a two-day Lebron James event, which she posted about on Instagram. While she was at The Grove on Nov. 9, Kobayashi was seen by employees at the Taschen bookstore, Larie Pidgeon, Kobayashi's aunt, told USA Today. New video, texts shows Laken Riley’s last moments On Nov. 11, according to the Los Angeles Times, Kobayashi went back to Los Angeles International Airport, though without getting onboard a flight. Family members confirmed to KTLA that they also saw footage of Kobayashi near the Pico Metro Station in downtown Los Angeles. 'I miss her,' Kobayashi's father Ryan said in an interview with KTLA. 'Just want her to know that, and just want her to reach out — anything.' Kobayashi sent 'strange' text messages, family says Pidgeon said it was when Kobayashi went back to the airport that she started sending the family 'alarming' text messages. 'She mentioned feeling scared, and that someone might be trying to steal her money and identity,' her aunt said to KTLA. 'Strange, cryptic messages — things about the matrix, it was so unlike her. And then all of a sudden, no more communication.' Kobayashi's sister started a GoFundMe to assist with search efforts.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/hannah-kobayashi-maui-woman-missing-los-angeles/	2024-11-20T07:00:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/HannahKobayashi.jpg?w=229
Republicans on Ethics Committee weigh 'unenviable' Gaetz report d...	Republicans on the House Ethics Committee are barreling into a no-win situation ahead of their expected meeting Wednesday to discuss their report into former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), weighing a high-stakes decision that will reverberate throughout Washington. The gathering for the panel — which is known for conducting its business in secrecy — comes as the debate over releasing their report into Gaetz, President-elect Trump’s pick for attorney general, has reached a fever pitch. One one side, Democrats on the committee — and several Republicans in Congress — say the report contains information that the public and senators should know as they consider whether to make Gaetz the head of an agency that once investigated him. On the other end is Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who is arguing that releasing the report — which is the culmination of a roughly three-year investigation — could damage the House since the panel would be in the rare, but not unprecedented, situation of publishing information on a former member. Caught in the center of that conversation are the Republicans on the panel, led by committee Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.), who have not yet disclosed where they stand despite incessant questions from reporters. Guest has only confirmed that the report exists and that all members of the committee have access to it. 'There’s not enough money in the world to pay me to serve on the Ethics Committee right now,' one House Republican said. 'Those members are definitely in an unenviable position.' With all Democrats expected to support releasing the report, just one Republican would be needed to achieve a majority vote and unleash the body of work. The committee is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, a structure intended to ensure that the panel — which polices its own members — does not act as a partisan weapon. Members of the panel have not confirmed that they will vote on the report's release Wednesday, but Democrats on the committee say they want to hold that referendum when they gather as a full group for the first time since Gaetz’s nomination and resignation. Members of each party have huddled separately since last week’s developments. Such a vote, however, would force the GOP lawmakers into a tough position: vote to release the report and risk being the target of Trump’s wrath, or side with Gaetz — whom many Republicans loathe — and keep the allegedly damaging information private as the former congressman moves forward in the confirmation process to become attorney general. Other Republicans are aware of those circumstances — and relieved they are not in the same position. A second House Republican said they do not envy the situation Republicans on the panel are in. 'I also wouldn’t want to be in a train wreck even if I survived,' they added. A third House Republican, however, said the predicament is not very complicated. They predicted that there is a good chance enough GOP members on the committee vote to release the report because several of the members clearly dislike Gaetz and will not be deterred by potential backlash. 'I don't think it's going to cause them a lot of heartache,' the member said, adding that the more moderate GOP members of the panel are used to taking tough votes, and can 'take that vote all day and still get reelected and walk around here.' Wednesday’s meeting comes as pressure is mounting on both sides of the disclosure debate. Rep. Susan Wild (Pa.), the top Democrat on the Ethics Committee, told reporters Monday that she had read the report and that she thinks it should be released. On Tuesday, 97 Democrats penned a letter to the panel asking that it 'immediately release' the report out of concern that concealing the information could 'jeopardize' the Senate’s confirmation process. And House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) responded with a succinct 'yes' when asked if the panel should release its report publicly. A number of Republicans have echoed the desire to release the report, at least to the senators considering his confirmation. 'I think we need to see it for confirmation purposes,' Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), who has harshly criticized Gaetz in the past, told reporters Tuesday. Mullin is close with former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who was ousted in a coup led by Gaetz. Mullin said he has talked to McCarthy multiple times over the last week but declined to share the former Speaker’s thoughts on Gaetz. Johnson, meanwhile, has consistently — and strongly — reiterated the Gaetz Ethics report should not see the light of day because the Florida Republican does not currently serve in the House. 'Matt Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress, and so we don’t issue Ethics reports on nonmembers,' Johnson reiterated on Tuesday. 'I think it’s an important guardrail for us to maintain for the interest of the institution.' Johnson said that he has spoken to Gaetz since his resignation but they have not discussed the reporting, contending that it would not be 'appropriate' to talk about the matter with him. 'This is my own opinion and I expressed the opinion before I talked with Matt,' Johnson said. The conversation surrounding Gaetz’s Ethics report broke out last week, after Trump shocked Washington and selected the Florida Republican to be attorney general. Gaetz resigned from Congress shortly after the pick. Johnson, who broke the news of Gaetz’s departure, told reporters that he was leaving early to quicken the process for filling his seat in the lower chamber. The development, however, came days before the House Ethics Committee was scheduled to vote on releasing the Gaetz report, raising questions about the true motive behind his resignation. The Ethics Committee investigated Gaetz for years over allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other claims. Gaetz, whom the Justice Department declined to charge after investigating similar matters, has vigorously denied wrongdoing. 'It’s very suspicious that he all of a sudden resigned because other members who are being nominated for posts have not resigned,' Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.) said last week, adding that 'most people' in the House GOP conference believe he departed to try to stop the report from coming out. Gaetz’s departure has muddied the path forward for the Ethics Committee, throwing the panel into a crisis as it debates the precedent that releasing the report may set. The Speaker has argued that such a move would break a long-standing 'rule' of the panel not publishing information on former members of Congress, even though there are previous examples of the current situation. In 1987, the panel released its report into former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House. And in 2011, the Senate Ethics Committee released its preliminary report into former Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) after he departed the chamber. Johnson, however, rejected past circumstances, arguing that they were aberrations of the norm. 'It’s a very important rule that should be maintained,' Johnson said last week. 'If it's been broken once or twice it should not have been because that would be a Pandora’s box. I think it’s a very important position to maintain regardless of what the circumstances [are].'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/republicans-on-ethics-committee-weigh-unenviable-gaetz-report-decision/	2024-11-20T04:48:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_043024gn03_w.jpg?w=900
Jose Ibarra trial Day 4: Defense expected to call final witnesses	(NewsNation) — Defense attorneys will call their last witnesses on the fourth day of the trial for Jose Ibarra, the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley earlier this year. Jose Ibarra, 26, will not be one of these witnesses. After being read his rights in both English and Spanish, Jose Ibarra chose not to testify on his own behalf. Diego Ibarra, Jose's brother, was called to the witness stand on Tuesday, but was rushed off after the court learned his lawyer did not want him to speak because of the fake green card case against him. It is possible Diego Ibarra will be called back to the stand Wednesday. Diddy hit with 5 new lawsuits, including alleged teen sexual assault On Feb. 22, Riley was reported missing when she didn’t return home from a run. Investigators later discovered her body in a forested area on the University of Georgia campus in Athens. UGA police arrested Jose Ibarra the next day. Before prosecutors wrapped up their case, attorneys revealed brand new video from the last time 22-year-old Riley was seen alive, showing her running on a trail on the University of Georgia's campus just minutes before she dialed 911. Another video, which the prosecution said showed Jose Ibarra on the morning Riley died, allegedly showed Ibarra lurking around the trail and trying to break into a young woman's apartment. Approximately one hour after this video was taken, prosecutors said, Jose Ibarra and Riley's cell phones pinged at identical locations near the scene of the crime. A minute-by-minute timeline of Riley's final moments was revealed through calls and texts from her phone. At 8:55 a.m. that morning, Riley texted her mother, 'Good morning, about to go for a run if you're free to talk.' Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security Then, at 9:03 a.m., Riley called her mom, who did not pick up. Riley's moms soon followed up with a number of calls and texts that her daughter did not answer. 'Please call me, I’m worried sick about you,' one of those texts by Riley's mother said. To close their case, the state asked a DNA specialist what she discovered when examining Laken Riley's fingernails. The DNA specialist said fingernail samples matched a profile of Jose Ibarra's blood found on a jacket found in a dumpster. The defense is questioning the prosecution's timeline by calling other witnesses — like a runner who says he saw someone like Jose Ibarra on the trail — although his timeline does not match up identically to the one that's been presented by prosecutors. Jose Ibarra, a Venezuelan national who Customs and Border Patrol sources tell NewsNation has ties to the Tren De Aragua gang, would spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty to murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, battery and tampering with evidence charges.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jose-ibarra-trial-day-4/	2024-11-20T04:25:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24323563549427.jpg?w=900
Nancy Mace: Capitol transgender bathroom rules protect women	(NewsNation) — Republican Rep. Nancy Mace said she's going to 'fight like hell' for a resolution that would keep Sarah McBride from using the women's bathroom. 'It's the height of hypocrisy and gaslighting to tell women, you lose your rights, and then a man walks in the room. I don't think so,' Mace said on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' 'I'm very socially sensible, but this is about women's safety. It's about women's security, it's about women's privacy, and we have rights.' On Monday, Mace introduced a resolution requiring all individuals in the Capitol complex to use bathrooms matching their sex assigned at birth, a move that has sparked controversy as McBride, the first openly transgender House member, prepares to take office. The measure charges the House sergeant-at-arms, William McFarland, with enforcing the ban, according to text previewed by The Hill, but it is unclear how the House’s chief law enforcement officer will determine who can and cannot use the Capitol’s facilities. House Republicans signal support for proposal to ban bathroom access for 1st transgender member State laws that bar transgender people from using public restrooms that match their gender identity often rely on anonymous complaints, a notoriously unreliable enforcement mechanism. LGBTQ+ rights activists in May flooded a tip line designed to alert officials in Utah to possible violations of the state’s bathroom ban with thousands of false complaints. Trump picks Sean Duffy to be transportation secretary Mace is pushing for the measure to be included in the rules package for the 119th Congress or for it to be brought to the floor and voted on as a standalone rule outside the package. If the bill, however, is not included in the 119th Congress rules package or brought to the floor as a standalone rule, Mace would force a vote on the legislation, the source said. The House is set to vote on a rules package for the next Congress in early January, which will require a majority vote for passage. Republicans are poised to have a razor-thin majority when the next session gavels in. McBride, who is set to assume her new position early next year, said on X that Mace’s resolution is 'a blatant attempt' to 'distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing.' This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing.

Diddy hit with 5 new lawsuits, including alleged teen sexual assa...	(NewsNation) — Five new lawsuits accusing Sean 'Diddy' Combs of sexual abuse were filed Tuesday by Texas lawyer Tony Buzbee, according to court documents obtained by NewsNation. One woman alleges that at 18 years old, she was drugged and coerced into performing oral sex on Combs and his bodyguard outside a Halloween party at a New York City nightclub in 2001. Another woman says that at 17 years old, she attended a Fourth of July party in 2004 where Combs sexually assaulted her while she was unconscious, according to the lawsuit. Combs and two of his bodyguards approached the victim after the assault and threatened her, telling her that she 'would be in danger if she spoke about what had occurred,' stating that he 'ran New York and would ruin her,' the lawsuit alleges. 'The Buzbee Law Firm, along with co-counsel AVA Law Group and New York local counsel Curis Law, is filing five more cases today alleging aggravated sexual assault, sexual abuse, and sexual exploitation against Sean 'Diddy' Combs and those entities with whom he has been affiliated,' Buzbee shared on Instagram. Diddy court witness says he saw 8 sex tapes with at least 2 celeb minors Buzbee added that 'several other individuals are referenced in the case filings but are not at this time formerly named as defendants. The cases are being brought for conduct that occurred as far back as the year 2001.' Buzbee said the conduct allegedly took place in New York and Miami, adding that three of the victims are male and two are female. 'We will let the allegations in the filed complaints speak for themselves, and will work to see that justice is done,' Buzbee said. 'We expect to be filing cases weekly naming Mr. Combs and others as defendants as we continue to gather evidence and prepare the filings.' In October, Buzbee, a lawyer from Houston, announced he was representing 120 people who plan on filing lawsuits saying they have experienced sexual misconduct from Combs, including 25 minors. Buzbee said the alleged victims are 60 men and 60 women, of whom 25 were minors at the time of the alleged misconduct. The youngest, Buzbee said, was 9. 'I imagine there’s a myriad of people who are nervous,' Buzbee said. 'You can’t hide skeletons in the closet forever.' Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he 'led a racketeering conspiracy that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice, among other crimes. ' Combs is currently seeking to be placed on house arrest through a $50 million bail package. Last week, prosecutors said Combs has been trying to dodge scrutiny of his jailhouse communications while orchestrating social media campaigns aimed at tainting the jury pool and trying to publicly leak materials he views are helpful to his case. They said he also has contacted witnesses through third parties.

Texas offers Trump 1,400 borderland acres for deportation plans	(NewsNation) — Texas officials have offered to lease more than 1,400 acres of state-owned borderland to President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration to construct deportation facilities, according to a letter from the Texas General Land Office (GLO) obtained Tuesday. Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham in a letter to Trump said, ' I am writing to formally offer 1,402 acres of land in Starr County, Texas, to be used to construct deportation facilities.' The property, located approximately 35 miles west of McAllen in Starr County, was recently acquired by the GLO. The letter reveals that within 24 hours of the Oct. 23 purchase, Buckingham approved a 7,681-foot border wall easement across the property. National Guard training for mass illegal crossings at border The letter details GLO's recent border security initiatives, including 'Operation Flat Top,' which secured a 170-acre island in the Rio Grande previously described by state authorities as 'the most dangerous part of the Texas border.' Buckingham stated the land could be used for 'processing, detention, and coordination of the largest deportation of violent criminals in the nation's history' in cooperation with federal agencies including the Department of Homeland Security and Border Patrol. The Texas GLO, which oversees 13 million acres of state lands, confirmed the offer through a spokesperson. This comes as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott plans to expand buoy barriers across the Rio Grande to stop migrants from crossing the southern border despite border crossings dropping in the state. Senate report claims Biden failures in protecting migrant children Abbott has maintained that Texas will have a proactive versus reactive stance at the border and will be prepared should a surge happen ahead of Trump’s inauguration. Border officials are now training for an expected surge in migrant crossings before President-elect Donald Trump takes the White House. The Texas National Guard is holding exercises in conjunction with the Texas Department of Public Safety along the Southern border in Eagle Pass on Tuesday. These proactive measures began last week with groups split to cover more ground across the vast Southern border.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/texas-trump-land-deportation/	2024-11-19T17:26:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66ecf60a2ec438.97773877.jpeg?w=900
Trump expected to name Linda McMahon as education secretary: Repo...	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Linda McMahon as education secretary, CNN reported on Tuesday, citing four sources familiar with the matter, putting the former pro-wrestling mogul at the helm of a department Trump has proposed abolishing. McMahon, who had been in the running for commerce secretary, headed up the Small Business Administration in Trump's first administration and was a major donor and early supporter of the Republican president-elect when he first ran for the White House almost a decade ago. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The co-founder and former CEO of the WWE professional wrestling franchise, she resigned from the SBA in 2019 to lead the pro-Trump spending group America First Action. She also chairs the America First Policy Institute, a Trump-friendly think tank. Trump tapped her to co-lead a transition team formed to help vet personnel and draft policy ahead of the Nov. 5 election. McMahon had been in the mix to head the Commerce Department, but Trump on Tuesday instead chose her transition team co-leader - Cantor Fitzgerald Chief Executive Howard Lutnick - for that post. Now she will lead an agency Trump said on the campaign trail that he would abolish, although he likely lacks authority to do it without congressional approval.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/linda-mcmahon-education-secretary/	2024-11-19T16:19:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2161971102.jpg?w=900
Floridians face slow recovery after back-to-back hurricanes	(NewsNation) — In Treasure Island, Florida, just west of Tampa, residents are still struggling to recover after being hit by back-to-back hurricanes. Areas off the Gulf of Mexico were hit first by Hurricane Helene, then, a few weeks later, by Hurricane Milton. Now, communities are struggling, with locals packed into hotel rooms that are usually filled with snowbirds this time of year. Floridians are frustrated with how slow the process has been. The two storms came 13 days apart, and almost two months after Hurricane Helene, damage is still visible. How to help Helene and Milton survivors In one apartment complex, sand is still pushed up in banks against the wall, and a couch that came through one of the windows thanks to a powerful storm surge is still visible. About 2,000 homes and businesses on Treasure Island alone were impacted by the storms. One resident told NewsNation she was frustrated by the struggle to get permits for repairs. She and her mother own a number of apartment complexes and have had annual renters back out and vacation bookings canceled all the way through January. The city of Treasure Island has had more than 700 requests for permits since the storms when it usually manages around 1,600 a year. For officials at all levels, local, state and federal, it's been difficult to keep up with demand, and they are asking people to be patient. 'We've never had to really do it on this large of a scale, and so the city is figuring out, the states' figuring it out,' said city spokesperson Jason Biesel. 'People are realizing what it means to live on a barrier island to have to go through all this rebuilding process, and so it's just been a learning experience for everybody.' Biesel said that it was terrible to see the damage to homes and businesses but asked for people to be patient. At another hotel, the general manager told NewsNation that 100% of the occupancy in the 96-room hotel is due to people who have been displaced in the community. Live: Congress questions FEMA about hurricane relief The Federal Emergency Management Agency is actually picking up the tab for those people through January if needed. The city has given a rough timeline of summer of 2025 for full recovery in a community that relies heavily on tourism, with an $11 billion dollar impact in Pinellas County alone. Anywhere from 11 to 15 million people come through, and this is usually the time of year when many people winter in the area. However, with bars, restaurants and hotels too damaged to operate or occupied by those who have been displaced, there are fewer options for snowbirds who would usually come to the area.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/florida-slow-recovery-hurricanes/	2024-11-19T14:14:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176610127.jpg?w=900
Susan Smith up for parole 30 years after killing her sons	(NewsNation) — Thirty years after she killed her two children, Susan Smith is now eligible for parole, raising the question of whether she will get out of prison. Susan Smith initially told law enforcement that a man carjacked her and took off with her two children still inside the car in 1994. Smith, who is white, identified the carjacker as Black when she described the alleged late-night carjacking near Union, South Carolina. RFK Jr.’s support of raw milk sheds light on debate Smith pleaded with the media and public for help locating three-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex, attracting international attention to the case. For nine days, she appeared on TV begging for help. But elements of her story didn't add up, including her description of the carjacking and why the carjacker would release her but keep her young children. Eventually, Smith admitted to strapping her two sons into car seats in the back of her car and driving it onto a boat ramp at a South Carolina lake, letting the vehicle roll into the water with her children inside, Smith said she was having an affair and the man that she was cheating with didn't want kids. Now, 30 years later, Smith is eligible for parole. That angers investigators like Union County Sheriff Jeff Bailey, who says Smith deserves to spend every day of her life behind bars, even if she's already been locked up for 30 years. 'Those kids didn't have a chance and I don't think she deserves one,' Bailey said. 'She still killed her kids, that is the bottom line That is [her] blood, [she] chose to let them go into the water and drown. That is a horrible death.' Smith's parole hearing is set for Wednesday morning, where she will make her case for release. Las Vegas home invasion suspect wanted police to kill her: Docs During the trial, Smith's lawyers said she was experiencing a mental breakdown and had intended to stay in the car with her sons but had exited at the last minute. Smith has also made claims that her then-husband abused her, something he has denied. During her time in prison, Smith has faced trouble multiple times, for everything from using drugs to having sex with prison guards.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/susan-smith-up-parole-30-years/	2024-11-19T13:04:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/05/gettyimages-525637762-594x594-2.jpg?w=594
40 inmates are on federal death row. Advocates want Biden to spar...	(NewsNation) — Hundreds of anti-capital punishment groups are calling on President Joe Biden to commute federal death row sentences during his remaining months in office fearing a renewed 'execution spree' under President-elect Donald Trump. 'Suddenly the whole world has changed and if Joe Biden doesn't commute these sentences, then Donald Trump is going to kill them,' Abraham Bonowitz, the executive director of anti-capital punishment group Death Penalty Action, said. The group has spearheaded a coalition of more than 350 groups that sent Biden a letter 24 hours after the election saying they have 'renewed concern and urgency' with Trump coming into office in less than two months. Which of Biden’s executive orders does Trump plan to undo? They ask Biden to commute death sentences to life in prison without the possibility of parole. 'We can't trust the government with the power to do this and to get it right, and not just in making sure that it's the right person who committed the crime, but also to be fair in the application of the death penalty,' Bonowitz said. There are currently 40 inmates on federal death row and the group includes Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Tree of Life mass shooter Robert Bowers and Dylan Roof, who murdered nine members of a Black South Carolina congregation in a racially motivated attack. Prior to the election, Trump signaled that his new administration would not shy away from the death penalty. 'We’ve never had (such) massive amounts of drugs pouring into our country,' he said during a campaign event in Arizona. 'And by the way, you’ll never solve the problem without the death penalty.' The Biden administration did not return requests for comment from NewsNation. Trump’s record on executions During the last six months of Trump’s first term, a record 13 federal inmates were put to death, with the last execution taking place days before Biden took office. The number far surpasses executions under any president for more than a century. Prior to July 2020, the federal government hadn’t executed anyone in 17 years. In the case of Brandon Bernard — who was convicted of killing an Iowa couple and executed in December 2020 — Trump himself agreed that there might be valid reasons not to proceed, reported the AP. Former President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2024, in Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) Trump’s administration also approved the use of pentobarbital in lethal injections despite evidence it might cause pulmonary edema, a painful condition akin to drowning. Fourteen states have also used pentobarbital in executions and five more are considering using it, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Trump will use ‘military assets’ to remove illegal migrants An autopsy report obtained by the AP for Corey Johnson, convicted of seven drug-related killings in 2021, concluded that during his execution he suffered pulmonary edema. The report showed that so much fluid rushed up his trachea that some exited his mouth. In his second term, Trump indicated he would expand the death penalty for migrants accused of killing U.S. citizens and law enforcement officers, as well as people convicted of drug and human trafficking. 'These are terrible, terrible, horrible people who are responsible for death, carnage and crime all over the country,' Trump said, referring to drug traffickers during an event kicking off his campaign. The Trump campaign did not return requests for comment by NewsNation. Is the death penalty right or wrong? Rev. Sharon Risher’s mother, two cousins and a childhood friend were killed in the Charleston Mother Emanuel Church shooting in 2015 by Roof, who sits on death row. She was the first to sign the letter asking Biden for the commutations. 'Killing Roof is not going to bring my family back. It's not going to erase all the grief and heartache that I have had, and all it's going to do is compound that feeling of wanting somebody to die,' Risher said. Risher has requested a meeting with Biden on behalf of the groups pushing for commutation. She believes the only way of forgetting Roof is to lock him up without any possibility of parole.

On Tuesday, May 25, 2021, Roof, on federal death row for the racist slayings of nine members of a Black South Carolina congregation, is making his appellate argument that his conviction and death sentence should be overturned. (Grace Beahm/The Post And Courier via AP, Pool, File) 'There will be no appeals, no more hearing from him again, he will be lost in obscurity when it comes to me and that's the best I can hope for, without wanting him to be killed or anybody to be killed,' she said. Trump has promised ‘concealed carry reciprocity.’ What would it do? While Risher is working with the groups pushing to commute death penalty sentences, other victims' family members argue the penalty serves justice. Michele Rosenthal, who lost her brothers in the 2018 Tree of Life massacre that left 11 dead, said she supported the Justice Department's decision to pursue the death penalty in a 2023 interview with Union Progress. 'This massacre was not just a mass murder of innocent citizens during a service in a house of worship,' she said. 'The death penalty must apply to vindicate justice and to offer some measure of deterrence from horrific hate crimes happening again and again.' Seven of the nine families who lost loved ones in the massacre sent a letter in July 2021 to Attorney General Merrick Garland reflecting their support of the death penalty. Can Biden commute all federal death sentences? Biden has the power to commute all the sentences under blanket clemency until his last day in office, said Corinna Barrett Lain, a law professor at the University of Richmond who’s written a forthcoming book on lethal injection. If he doesn’t, Trump 'can move very, very quickly' on executions if that is his priority, she said. There is still a legal process that needs to be followed prior to an execution which includes obtaining a death warrant and that will face expected legal challenges, but it’s not likely those challenges 'would get their due regard' as evidenced during the last Trump administration, she said. President Joe Biden speaks about Hurricane Milton from the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2024. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) The Supreme Court cleared all legal obstacles during Trump’s first term to greenlight executions, even in a case where the appellate court still hadn’t issued a ruling, deemed 'highly unusual' by SCOTUSblog. Across 13 executions the Supreme Court vacated 22 states of executions and injunctions, Lain said. 'The stays of execution were reversed without opinion, without resolution of the constitutional claims on the merits, without explanation, and the prisoners were promptly executed,' she said. While campaigning in 2020, Biden promised to abolish the federal death penalty but has done little to fulfill that pledge after stepping into office. His Justice Department announced a moratorium on federal executions in 2021, which halted executions but the department has since pushed for the death penalty against the suspects charged with mass shootings in Pittsburgh and Buffalo.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/death-row-inmates-trump-biden/	2024-11-19T11:16:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/01/AP22011097759203.jpg?w=900
Trump's hush money case should be paused, prosecutors say	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The case in which Donald Trump was convicted on criminal charges stemming from hush money paid to a porn star should be paused in light of his election victory to allow Trump to seek dismissal, New York prosecutors said on Tuesday. Trump, 78, is hoping to enter office for a second term unencumbered by any of the four criminal cases he has faced and which some said would derail his 2024 candidacy to return to the White House. Manhattan DA opposes Trump’s bid to dismiss hush money conviction Trump was convicted in May of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment his former lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump, who denies it. The case marked the first time a U.S. president - former or sitting - had been convicted of or charged with a criminal offense. Trump had been scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26, but Merchan last week put all proceedings in the case on pause at the request of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office. The prosecutors had asked for more time to consider next steps in the case, citing the need to balance the 'competing interests' between having the criminal case go forward and protecting the office of the president. Trump pleaded not guilty in the case, which he has long portrayed as a politically motivated attempt by Bragg, a Democrat, to interfere with his campaign. His defense lawyers urged Merchan to dismiss the case, arguing that having it loom over him while he was president would cause 'unconstitutional impediments' to his ability to govern. Trump's lawyers also argued his conviction should be vacated and the charges dismissed because of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in July that presidents cannot be prosecuted over their official acts, and that evidence of their official acts cannot be used in trials over personal behavior. Georgia appeals court cancels arguments in Trump’s bid to disqualify Fani Willis Bragg's office said that its case dealt with purely personal conduct. Falsification of business records is punishable by up to four years in prison. Before he was elected, experts said it was unlikely - but not impossible - that Trump would face time behind bars, with punishments such as a fine or probation seen as more likely. Trump's victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election made the prospect of imposing a sentence of jail or probation even more politically fraught and impractical, given that a sentence could have impeded his ability to conduct the duties of the presidency. Trump was indicted on three separate slates of state and federal charges in 2023, one involving classified documents he kept after leaving office and two others involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. A Florida-based federal judge in July dismissed the documents case. The Justice Department is now evaluating how to wind down the federal election-related case. Trump also faces state criminal charges in Georgia over his bid to reverse his 2020 loss in that state, but the case remains in limbo.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/trump-investigation/trump-hush-money-michael-cohen-stormy-daniels/	2024-11-19T10:03:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/Trump-Stormy_AP_Mary-Altaffer-Steven-Hirsch.png?w=900
Hacker gains access to testimony in Gaetz investigations: reports	A hacker gained access to witness testimony related to investigations into former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who resigned from Congress last week after President-elect Trump tapped him for attorney general, multiple news outlets reported Tuesday. The unidentified person, using the name 'Altam Beezley,' downloaded the information on Monday afternoon, according to The New York Times, which was the first to report on the breach. The file contained 24 exhibits and is said to include testimony from a woman who said she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17, and testimony from another woman who said she witnessed the encounter, according to The Times. The Times and CBS News reported that the file is part of a civil defamation case. The Times also reported it includes sealed files from the Justice Department and House Ethics Committee. The materials do not appear to have been made public. Interest in the files may be at an all-time high, given Gaetz's looming confirmation process. The Ethics Committee has been investigating Gaetz for years over allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other claims. Gaetz, whom the Justice Department declined to charge after investigating the same matters, has vigorously denied wrongdoing. The Florida Republican resigned from Congress as the release of the Ethics Committee’s report was imminent, a source familiar with the matter told The Hill last week. While the panel doesn't generally release information about former lawmakers, the committee is facing mounting pressure to make its findings public. Senators on both sides of the aisle have said they would like to see the report as they mull whether to confirm Gaetz as the nation's top prosecutor, and on Monday Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), the top Democrat on the Ethics Committee, said she thinks the report should be released.

RFK Jr.'s support of raw milk sheds light on debate	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, has long been a proponent of natural food choices. One includes raw milk, which has become mainstream in the health and wellness communities recently. Kennedy has admitted when he drinks milk it is solely the unpasteurized variety. Last month, he proclaimed on X the 'FDA's war on public health' would come to an end, including 'aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamins, clean foods, sunshine, exercise, nutraceuticals and anything else that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.' ‘I’m being framed’: Fired FEMA worker Marn’i Washington speaks out The FDA wrote about 'the dangers of raw milk' in May, suggesting it 'can harbor dangerous germs that can pose serious health risks to you and your family.' An April article from the CDC says pasteurization is 'crucial for milk safety, killing harmful germs that can cause illness.' The CDC adds raw milk 'can carry dangerous germs such as Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria, Campylobacter, and others that cause foodborne illness, often called 'food poisoning.' It adds that 2,645 illnesses and 228 hospitalizations occurred between 1998 and 2018 from drinking raw milk. Some champion positive health returns from drinking unpasteurized milk, including raw milk farmer Cliff McConville. 'I can tell you that I used to get sick like three times a year, like, you know, with colds or flu, and I almost never get sick anymore,' McConville said. Farmers and raw milk advocates argue that the dairy industry is against raw milk because it's bad for their bottom line. Conversely, health advocates argue that we have the tools to make milk safer now, and ignoring that is a step backward.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/rfk-support-raw-milk-debate/	2024-11-19T09:51:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2174504226.jpg?w=900
Should women serve in combat roles?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Fox News commentator Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense, sparking controversy over Hegseth's experience and his comments about women in combat. The Defense Secretary nominee has said he doesn't believe women should serve on the front lines in combat roles, raising the possibility he could try to roll back policies that allow women in those jobs. Former U.S. Army Sgt. Kayla Williams served on the front lines in Iraq as a linguist. She told NewsNation that at the time, women were limited in terms of combat roles, which made her work more challenging. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'We know that what really didn't work was to not have women directly assigned to these units, to have women like me just be attached so we hadn't trained as we fought,' she said. 'I didn't know their standard operating procedures. Those programs that had to be stood up like the cultural support teams to fill that gap were just inadequate.' Williams said it is essential that women be able to join the military in all aspects, especially when the service is facing a recruiting shortage. Former U.S. Army Maj. Chase Spears disagrees, saying that while women have proven they can meet the physical standards required for combat roles, they are built differently and still shouldn't be eligible to fill those positions. 'The question is, can women endure the standard day after day, week after week, month after month,' Spears said. Fear of mass deportations spreads in immigrant communities Spears claimed women do poorly in combat roles and said inclusion hasn't made the military more lethal. Williams noted that while women may not always be as strong as men, they bring different skills to the table that can also be critical, like agility. 'We know from examples like the woman recently completing the Appalachian Trail many, many hours faster than anyone else ever has, that women have real advantages when it comes to endurance,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/women-combat-roles/	2024-11-19T08:51:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/64e3ab600fe155.65196006.jpeg?w=900
Okla. Superintendent: I have 'freedom to express' religious belie...	(NewsNation) — Oklahoma Superintendent Ryan Walters defended a controversial video he required public school superintendents to play for students where he prays over Republican President-elect Donald Trump, saying Tuesday that he has 'religious beliefs as well that I get the freedom to express.' In a video to announce the creation of the Education Department's Office of Religious Freedom and Patriotism, Walters said he prays 'for President Donald Trump and his team as they continue to bring about change to the country.' According to a press release, the new office is meant to 'oversee the investigation of abuses to individual religious freedom or displays of patriotism.' ‘I’m being framed’: Fired FEMA worker Marn’i Washington speaks out Speaking on 'Morning in America,' Walters said he made it 'crystal clear' in the video that students don't have to pray if they don't want to. 'We all have the free exercise of our religious beliefs that was essential in the foundation of this country,' Walters said. 'We're going to protect that.' The office of state Attorney General Gentner Drummond issued a statement Friday saying Walters isn't able to issue a mandate that schools watch the video. 'Not only is this edict unenforceable, it is contrary to parents’ rights, local control and individual free-exercise rights,' the statement said. Some school districts, including two of the state's largest, said they do not plan to show the video to students. Walters already faces two lawsuits over his June mandate that schools incorporate the Bible into lesson plans for students in grades 5 through 12. 'Look, every county here voted for President Trump. We want to have prayer back in school,' Walters said. 'President Trump won an overwhelming election speaking unapologetically about getting our schools back on track. Protecting religious liberty is absolutely crucial in that.'

Live: Day 3 in trial of Jose Ibarra	(NewsNation) — The trial for Jose Ibarra, the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, could be ending soon. Prosecutors say they only need half a day more, and the defense says it only plans to call a few witnesses themselves — including Jose Ibarra's brothers, Diego and Argenis. Diego and Argenis Ibarra, who, like Jose are Venezuelan citizens, have been in federal custody since February on charges they had fake green cards. The defense was instructed to bring the brothers to Athens, Georgia one full day ahead of schedule. Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator Tuesday marks the third day of the trial. Over the previous two days, the prosecution has called 19 witnesses. Riley's roommates, police officers and FBI agents all testified. On Monday, police showed body camera footage of the moment they first made contact with Jose Ibarra. Police said they noticed scratches and cuts all over his arms. In video footage from the police, Jose Ibarra was not able to explain where those injuries came from. Prosecutors say these are clear defensive wounds from when Riley was fighting for her life. A technological analysis of Riley's watch revealed the exact moment the 22-year-old stopped dead in her tracks before launching an emergency call to police that was abruptly hung up. An FBI agent said in court Monday that GPS location data from Jose Ibarra's phone puts him in an identical spot as Riley at the exact moment she died. Rep. Nancy Mace introduces Capitol bathroom bill restrictions Defense attorneys for Jose Ibarra continue to say it's still possible someone else might be responsible for the crime. The defense team pointed to the fact that Jose Ibarra and his brothers, who lived together in a one-bedroom apartment near the crime scene, shared clothes like hats and jackets that have been seen on surveillance videos. Jose Ibarra is charged with murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, battery and tampering with evidence. If convicted, faces the possibility of life in prison without the possibility of parole. The 26-year-old has pleaded not guilty on all counts. Riley was reported missing on Feb. 22 when she didn't return home from a run. Investigators later discovered her body in a forested area on the University of Georgia campus. UGA police arrested Jose Ibarra the next day.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jose-ibarra-trial-day-three/	2024-11-19T04:52:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24323563549427.jpg?w=900
Congress to question FEMA about hurricane relief	(NewsNation) — Congress will hear from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Tuesday, following reports that the agency withheld hurricane recovery aid from supporters of President-elect Donald Trump. The Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management will hold a hearing at 10 a.m. ET with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. Questions will focus on the agency’s preparedness and response to recent disasters, including Hurricanes Helene and Milton. NewsNation will stream the event live here. Trump to attend SpaceX ‘Starship’ launch in Texas: Sources A FEMA worker was fired earlier this month after she directed others helping hurricane survivors not to go to homes with yard signs supporting President-elect Donald Trump, according to the agency’s leader. 'This is a clear violation of FEMA’s core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation,' Criswell said in a statement at the time. 'This was reprehensible.' The fired employee, Marn’i Washington, is accused of telling her survivor assistance team not to go to Florida homes with pro-Trump yard signs. Washington told NewsNation she believes she’s being used as a scapegoat for a common agency practice. The instruction to avoid certain houses with certain campaign signs came from her direct superior based on previous team encounters, Washington said, adding that 'safety precautions are not politically driven.' Several recent hostile encounters happened at homes with Trump campaign signs, she said. 'I’m being framed. There’s no violation of the Hatch Act,' Washington said. 'I was simply following orders.'

Top Democrat on House Ethics panel says Gaetz report should be re...	Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), the top Democrat on the House Ethics Committee, said she thinks the panel’s report on former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) should be released. Wild answered 'yes' when asked whether the panel should release its report on Gaetz, who President-elect Trump nominated to be attorney general last week. 'We have a scheduled meeting on Wednesday, and it remains to be seen what the chairman's agenda is for that, but I believe we should vote on whether we're to disclose it or not,' Wild said. Wild, who is leaving Congress at the end of the year after being defeated by Republican challenger Ryan Mackenzie, said that she expected all Democrats to vote in favor of releasing the report. On the evenly split panel with five Republicans and five Democrats, it would take at least one Republican to side with Democrats to vote to release the report. 'Everybody on the committee now has the report, so they've got the opportunity to be reviewing it,' Wild said. Asked about the possibility of releasing the report only to the Senate, Wild said: 'Either you are going to disclose it or you're not going to disclose it.' Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.), the chair of the Ethics Committee, declined to confirm details about the meeting scheduled for Wednesday. Guest did say that he has read the report on Gaetz, and that other members on the panel 'have the ability to read the report.' He declined to offer his thoughts on what the Gaetz report said. The Ethics Committee investigated Gaetz for years over allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other claims. Gaetz, whom the Justice Department declined to charge after investigating the same matters, has vigorously denied wrongdoing. Gaetz abruptly resigned from his seat the same day he was announced as Trump's attorney general pick. A source told The Hill that his resignation came just two days before the committee was scheduled to meet to vote to release the report, but that meeting was later canceled. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has publicly advocated against releasing the report, since Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress and the committee traditionally does not investigate former members. 'I think that would be a Pandora's box. I don't think we want the House Ethics Committee using all of its vast resources and powers to go after private citizens,' Johnson said Sunday on CNN’s 'State of the Union.' While such a move is very rare, there is precedent for the committee releasing a report after a member resigned. In 1987, the committee released its report on former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House. Senators on both sides of the aisle have said they want to see the report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/top-democrat-on-house-ethics-panel-says-gaetz-report-should-be-released/	2024-11-18T16:34:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/wildsusan_110424gn02_w.jpg?w=900
2 women tell Ethics panel Matt Gaetz paid them for sex, attorney ...	(The Hill) -- Two women testified before the House Ethics Committee that former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) paid them to have sex, according to the attorney representing them. Joel Leppard, a Florida-based attorney, made the disclosure in an interview with ABC News that was published Monday. The article does not include the identities of his clients, both of whom are older than 18. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Leppard said the House Ethics Committee and his clients went one by one through a series of Venmo transactions. 'That’s correct,' Leppard told ABC News's Juju Chang when asked if both his clients testified that they were paid by Gaetz to have sex. 'The House was very clear about that and went through each. They essentially put the Venmo payments on the screen and asked about them. And my clients repeatedly testified, ‘What was this payment for?’ ‘Well that was for sex.’' The revelation marks the latest piece of information Leppard has disclosed since President-elect Trump nominated Gaetz to serve as attorney general and the Florida Republican subsequently resigned from the House. Last week, Leppard told ABC News that one of his clients testified that she saw Gaetz having sex with a minor. 'She testified in July of 2017, at this house party, she was walking out to the pool area, and she looked to her right, and she saw Rep. Gaetz having sex with her friend, who was 17,' Leppard said. Leppard told ABC News that the client told the panel she believed Gaetz ended that sexual relationship when he learned the girl was a minor. The House Ethics Committee — which is known for conducting its business in secrecy — had been investigating Gaetz on and off for roughly three years, probing whether he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. The Hill reached out to Gaetz for comment on Leppard’s remarks. Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition, called the allegations 'baseless' in a statement. 'Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He’s the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration,' Pfeiffer said. 'The Biden Justice Department investigated Gaetz for years and cleared him of wrongdoing. The only people who went to prison over these allegations were those lying about Matt Gaetz.' Gaetz’s resignation from Congress has raised questions about whether the Ethics Committee’s highly anticipated report on the Florida Republican will become public. A number of lawmakers in both parties have called on the panel to release it — which would require a majority vote — but others, including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), have pushed for it to remain private. Leppard is one of the voices calling on the Ethics Committee to release its report on Gaetz. Last week he said, 'As the Senate considers former Rep. Gaetz's nomination for attorney general, several questions demand answers.' 'What if multiple credible witnesses provided evidence of behavior that would constitute serious criminal violations?' he added. Former primary challenger to Gaetz considering bid for now-open seat Johnson, meanwhile, has argued that because Gaetz is no longer in Congress, the Ethics Committee’s report is moot. He also warned that releasing the body of work would open a 'Pandora’s box' of the panel releasing reports on individuals who no longer serve in the lower chamber. 'What I have said with regard to the report is that it should not come out. And why? Because Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress. He is no longer a member,' Johnson told CNN’s 'State of the Union' in an interview Sunday. 'There's a very important protocol and tradition and rule that we maintain that the House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to nonmembers of Congress. I think that would be a Pandora's box.' The 9 GOP senators who could derail Trump’s Cabinet picks While releasing an Ethics report after a lawmaker has departed the House is rare, it is not unprecedented. In 1987, the panel published its report on former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he had left the chamber. The House Ethics Committee is slated to meet Wednesday, a source told The Hill, during which the Gaetz report is likely to be discussed. The focus around Gaetz’s Ethics investigation comes after the Department of Justice declined to charge the then-congressman with any crimes in 2017, after its probe had concluded. Investigators had questioned if witnesses at the center of the case would be seen as credible before a jury, according to multiple outlets.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/matt-gaetz-ethics-panel/	2024-11-18T16:06:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_043024gn01_w-e1731971603796.jpg?w=800
Trump picks Sean Duffy to be transportation secretary	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump said Monday he is naming former Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy as his nominee to be transportation secretary, as he continues to roll out picks for his Cabinet. Duffy is a former reality TV star who was one of Trump’s most visible defenders on cable news — a prime concern for the media-focused president-elect. Duffy served in the House for nearly nine years, was a member of the Financial Services Committee and was chairman of the subcommittee on insurance and housing. He left Congress in 2019, and is now co-host of a show on Fox Business, the 'Bottom Line.' Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? In his announcement Monday, Trump noted that Duffy is married to a Fox News host, calling him 'the husband of a wonderful woman, Rachel Campos-Duffy, a STAR on Fox News.' Trump said Duffy would use his experience and relationships built over the years in Congress 'to maintain and rebuild our Nation’s Infrastructure, and fulfill our Mission of ushering in The Golden Age of Travel, focusing on Safety, Efficiency, and Innovation. Importantly, he will greatly elevate the Travel Experience for all Americans!' Duffy in 2022 ruled out a run for Wisconsin governor, despite pleas from Trump to make a bid, saying he needed time to care for the needs of his family of nine children, posting on social media that his youngest child had a heart condition.

Trump to attend SpaceX 'Starship' launch in Texas: Sources	Sources have confirmed President-elect Donald J. Trump will be visiting Brownsville Tuesday to watch the sixth SpaceX launch. The team of U.S. Representative for District 34 Vicente Gonzalez confirmed to NewsNation local affiliate KVEO that Trump will be in attendance Tuesday as space enthusiasts, locals and out of towners watch SpaceX attempt to launch the Starship rocket. Two sources also confirmed his attendance to NewsNation's Libbey Dean. Musk’s bold plans for ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ face roadblocks Local flight restrictions read: 'The Federal Aviation Administration has issued temporary flight restrictions over Brownsville and Boca Chica, Texas area for a VIP visit that coincides with the SpaceX launch window for a test of its massive Starship rocket from its launch facility on the Gulf of Mexico. The flight restrictions put in place over Trump’s home in Palm Beach, Florida when he is there will be lifted briefly while the Texas security measures are in place.' Trump won the Rio Grande Valley, where the launch will take place. Leading up to the Nov. 5 election, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk showed support for Trump while on the campaign trail. He's since been tapped to to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) along Vivek Ramaswamy. This is SpaceX's sixth attempt at launching Starship, and this time around, it aims to expand the envelope on Starship and booster capabilities. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'Objectives include the booster once again returning to the launch site for catch, reigniting a ship Raptor engine while in space, and testing a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,' SpaceX stated. According to SpaceX.com, Starship is expected to launch on Nov. 19 with a 30-minute launch window beginning at 4 p.m.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-spacex-starship-launch-texas/	2024-11-18T13:54:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Collage-Maker-18-Nov-2022-09.58-PM.jpg?w=900
Diddy's lawyers say his jail cell was unlawfully raided	(NewsNation) — Sean 'Diddy' Combs’ attorneys have accused prosecutors of engaging in 'outrageous government conduct' alleging that they seized notes and other 'privileged attorney-client' material from the music mogul’s jail cell and are using it to keep him locked up. In a letter requesting an immediate hearing, his lawyers alleged Monday that prosecutors gathered 'privileged material, including the defendant’s own written notes' during a raid on Combs’ cell at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. They said those materials were cited in papers the government filed in Manhattan federal court on Friday in a bid to keep the music mogul locked up before his May 5 trial. What’s happened since Diddy was indicted? 'This search and seizure are in violation of Mr. Combs’ Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights,' the lawyers told Judge Arun Subramanian. 'The targeted seizure of a pre-trial detainee’s work product and privileged materials – created in preparation for trial – is outrageous government conduct amounting to a substantive due process violation,' they added. They demanded prosecutors answer who authorized the search of Combs’ cell, where personal effects and paperwork were seized. Subramanian gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. ET Monday to respond to Comb’s lawyers and set a hearing on the matter for Tuesday afternoon. Combs has been held in pre-trial detention while awaiting his trial since September. Diddy receiving privileges including more showers: Former inmate He has pleaded not guilty to charges that he 'led a racketeering conspiracy that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice, among other crimes. ' Combs is currently seeking to be placed on house arrest through a $50 million bail package. On Friday, prosecutors said Combs has been trying to dodge scrutiny of his jailhouse communications while orchestrating social media campaigns aimed at tainting the jury pool and trying to publicly leak materials he views are helpful to his case. They said he also has contacted witnesses through third parties.

White House rejects claim it's 'adding fuel' to Russia’s war on U...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The White House rejected the Kremlin’s claim Monday that it is adding 'fuel to the fire' by authorizing Ukrainian forces to use U.S.-supplied missiles inside Russia. 'The fire was lit by Russia's invasion of Ukraine,' deputy national security advisor Jon Finer, said. 'So, I think this notion of fuel on the fire is, frankly, a side issue to the main issue, which is Russia waging a war of aggression across a sovereign border, into Ukraine, and continuing to do so.' 'I would put the question back to Russia about who's actually putting fuel on the fire here, and I don’t think it’s the Ukrainians,' Finer said. President Joe Biden has given Kyiv the green light to use long-range weapons – known as Army Tactical Missile Systems or ATACMS – which would enable strikes deep inside Russian territory, easing previous restrictions on Western-made weapons. What does Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range US weapons mean? The announcement came Sunday after the U.S. had frequently said it would not lift its ban on Ukraine’s use of American weapons against Russia, citing fear of escalation. The United States has provided Ukraine with more than $56 billion in military aid since Russia’s invasion in Feb. 2022, according to the Department of Defense. With two months left in office, Biden’s shift in U.S. policy came in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin deploying more than 10,000 North Korean troops into Moscow’s fight. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov criticized the Biden administration for 'adding fuel to the conflict,' before recalling Putin’s statement in September in which he said that Ukraine’s use of U.S. weapons to attack Russia would put NATO at war with Moscow. 'If this decision is taken, it will mean nothing less than the direct involvement of NATO countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine,' Putin said at the time. 'This will be their direct participation, and this, of course, will significantly change the very essence, the very nature of the conflict.' President-elect Donald Trump has not commented on Biden’s decision, but his son, Donald Trump Jr., lambasted it. 'The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,' he wrote on X. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he could resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine within 24 hours without specifying how. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky seemingly agreed with this Friday, saying he is certain his country’s war with Russia would end 'faster' once Trump becomes U.S. president.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/white-house-russias-war-ukraine-missiles/	2024-11-18T12:30:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1680847188.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Prosecutors said in a court document last week that Sean 'Diddy' Combs tried to contact potential witnesses for his upcoming sex trafficking trial from jail. 'The defendant has continued to engage in a relentless course of obstructive conduct designed to subvert the integrity of these proceedings,' prosecutors said in a court filing asking the judge to reject Combs' $50 million bail request. 'The defendant has shown repeatedly — even while in custody — that he will flagrantly and repeatedly flout rules in order to improperly impact the outcome of his case.' Jail calls showed that Combs asked family members to reach out to potential victims and witnesses, prosecutors said in the filing. They also accused Combs of orchestrating social media campaigns 'aimed at tainting the jury pool' and trying to publicly leak materials that could help his case. Part of this campaign included having his children post a video to their social media accounts showing them gathered to celebrate Combs' birthday, the court filing said. Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator During a nationwide sweep of Bureau of Prison facilities, investigators found notes from Combs' cell phone that included communications with a woman identified in the court filing as Witness 2. 'It is clear that when the defendant reinitiated contact with Witness 2 in September 2024, his purpose was to ensure that Witness 2 was on his side,' prosecutors wrote. The strong inference to be drawn from Combs' communication with Witness 2 is that he paid her after she posted a statement denying allegations of violence by him. NewsNation reached out to Witness 2 for comment. In their own filing, Combs' lawyers argued that the prosecutors' search and seizure of their clients' notes violated his rights, according to Billboard. New ‘X’ terms and conditions leads to exodus of users 'The targeted seizure of a pre-trial detainee’s work product and privileged materials — created in preparation for trial — is outrageous government conduct amounting to a substantive due process violation,' Combs' lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, said in the filing.

House Ethics Committee to meet Wednesday amid debate over Gaetz r...	Members of the House Ethics Committee will meet Wednesday, a source confirmed to The Hill, as the panel weighs whether it should release its report into former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), whom President-elect Trump plans to nominate to serve as attorney general. The source, however, cautioned that the huddle may be delayed, since details about the meeting leaked early Monday morning. The panel scrapped plans to gather this past Friday for an unclear reason. House Ethics Committee Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.) told Politico the meeting had been postponed, not canceled. A spokesperson for the Ethics Committee declined to comment. The debate over whether the panel should publish its report on Gaetz is heating up in the Capitol. Lawmakers from both parties are calling for its release for the sake of transparency and ahead of confirmation hearings, while others — including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) — argue the final product should remain private because Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress. Johnson reaffirmed that position Sunday. 'What I have said with regard to the report is that it should not come out. And why? Because Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress. He is no longer a member,' Johnson told CNN’s 'State of the Union' in an interview. 'There's a very important protocol and tradition and rule that we maintain that the House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to nonmembers of Congress. I think that would be a Pandora's box.' The committee — which is known for conducting its business in secrecy — had been investigating for roughly three years whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. The probe came to an abrupt end when Gaetz left the House on Wednesday, since the panel does not have jurisdiction over former members of Congress. But the committee can still release its report into Gaetz if it wishes, a move that is rare but not unprecedented; in 1987, the panel released its report into former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he has resigned from Congress. Such a move would require a majority vote on the panel. Lawmakers who sit on the Ethics Committee have been mum about how they plan to handle the question of releasing the report. The panel was initially scheduled to meet Friday of last week and vote on releasing it, a plan that was set before Trump announced Gaetz as his attorney general pick and the Florida Republican immediately resigned from Congress on Wednesday. Some members have questioned whether Gaetz left the House early to stop the investigation from advancing. 'It’s very suspicious that he all of a sudden resigned, because other members who are being nominated for posts have not resigned,' Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.) said last week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/house-ethics-committee-to-meet-wednesday-amid-debate-over-gaetz-report/	2024-11-18T09:17:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_060524jg03_w.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr. faces resistance as Trump's pick to lead HHS	(NewsNation) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could face some resistance as he seeks Senate confirmation to be Republican President-elect Donald Trump's Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. When he announced Kennedy as his pick to lead the department, Trump said the former independent presidential candidate will 'play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives.' As part of his 'Make America Healthy Again' agenda, Kennedy is looking to do a complete system overhaul of the agencies that regulate health and food. He's called for stricter pesticide regulations and made a vow to get processed foods removed from school lunches. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? On vaccines, Kennedy has said he wants a re-examination of their safety data. Health and medical experts raised concerns to NewsNation partner The Hill about Kennedy's influence on the Trump administration, as he has spread misinformation about vaccines before. In an interview with NBC News, Kennedy denied being anti-vaccine and said that he wouldn't 'take them away' from those who want one. 'I’m going to make sure scientific safety studies and efficacy are out there, and people can make individual assessments about whether that product is going to be good for them,' Kennedy told the news outlet earlier this month. Kennedy will likely face political pushback from senators during his confirmation as HHS Secretary. Democratic senators such as Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Ed Markey of Massachusetts criticized Kennedy as Trump's choice to head the department. 'Dangerous. Unqualified. Unserious,' Markey wrote. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., posted on X that Kennedy potentially being in charge of Health and Human Services 'could not be more dangerous.' 'There's no telling how far an anti-vaxxer (and) fringe conspiracy theorist like RFK Jr. could set America back in terms of public health, reproductive rights, research, &amp; more,' she said. New ‘X’ terms and conditions leads to exodus of users On the other hand, some Republican lawmakers celebrated Kennedy's nomination. 'RFK Jr. has championed issues like healthy foods and the need for greater transparency in our public health infrastructure,' Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in a statement Thursday, The Hill reported. 'I look forward to learning more about his other policy positions and how they will support a conservative, pro-American agenda.' Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson said on X that he could not be happier with Kennedy. 'He’s a brilliant, courageous truth-teller whose unwavering commitment to transparency will make America a healthier nation,' Johnson wrote. Some lobbyists in the food and health industry are planning ways to stop the Senate from confirming Kennedy, Politico reported. Others are currying favor in case they aren't successful, the news outlet writes. According to Reuters, shortly after news of Kennedy's nomination came down, shares of vaccine makers including Pfizer and Moderna fell by as much as 2%. Processed food stocks decreased as well, CNBC wrote.

Live: Oxford shooting victims' families demand investigation	(NewsNation) — Almost three years after the Oxford High School shooting in Michigan, the parents of the victims say the fight for justice is far from over. The parents are pressuring the state to conduct and fund a new investigation, hoping to force some people to talk who didn't want to before. It's been nearly three years since Ethan Crumbley gunned down four students and injured several others using a gun gifted by his father. It's the first case in which the parents of a suspect have been held legally accountable. The families don't feel like a thorough investigation was ever done in this case. It was clear after the shooting who was responsible for it so from an investigative standpoint, the case was closed, they knew who did it. But these families want Michigan lawmakers to fund an investigation into the how and the why behind the tragedy. Read more: Crumbleys’ sentence ‘about accountability’: Father of victim The hope is that the answer will provide a sort of roadmap for legislation that will prevent this tragedy from repeating itself. This court case is not entirely over, despite the convictions. Ethan was 15 when he gunned down his fellow classmates with a semi-automatic weapon. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole and an additional 24 years. The now-18-year-old is asking the court to consider a lesser sentence. His appeal requests an expert witness to be able to testify to Ethan Crumbley's rough childhood, and suggests he may suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome. The deadline for prosecutors to respond to his request is Tuesday. Ethan Crumbley's parents are also serving time for involuntary manslaughter in the shooting.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/gun-violence/oxford-shooting-michigan-parents-demand-state-investigation/	2024-11-18T06:56:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/666387f314df88.15051825.jpeg?w=900
The 9 GOP senators who could derail Trump’s Cabinet picks	(The Hill) - Multiple Republican senators are looming as potential obstacles to President-elect Trump's controversial Cabinet picks, especially his two most polarizing choices: former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Trump has had a rocky relationship in the past with a handful of Republicans senators who won’t likely give him the same deference as loyal allies such as Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who last week called on his GOP colleagues to 'get out of the way' and approve Trump's nominees. Senators who could derail Trump's Cabinet nominations Trump can afford three defections within the Senate GOP conference and still get his picks confirmed. Federal workers brace for Trump overhaul of civil service But four Republican senators would be enough to sink any of his nominees, and two moderates — Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, — have already voiced deep reservations about Gaetz, who was embroiled in a federal sex trafficking investigation, of leading the Justice Department. Here are the senators that could stymie Trump’s nominees. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 11: Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) speaks during the Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on the Special Diabetes Program on July 11, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for JDRF) Murkowski signaled her likely opposition to Gaetz soon after he was announced as Trump’s pick to serve as attorney general. 'I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for attorney general. We need to have a serious attorney general,' she told reporters. Murkowski, who didn’t vote for either Trump or Vice President Harris, would likely be skeptical of Trump’s choice of Kennedy to head the Department of Health and Human Services. The Alaska senator, who serves on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, used social media to promote vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, but she also voted in December 2021 to overturn the vaccine mandate for private businesses. Trump will use ‘military assets’ to remove illegal migrants She expressed surprised over Trump’s choice of Pete Hegseth, a military veteran and Fox News host, to head the Department of Defense. 'Wow. … I’m just surprised. I'm not going to comment on whether it's good, bad or indifferent. I’m just surprised because the names that I’ve heard for secretary of Defense have not included him,' she said. Murkowski was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump of inciting insurrection during his 2021 Senate impeachment trial. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 04: Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) speaks during the 2024 Government Day Reception hosted by Breakthrough T1D at the Kennedy Caucus Room in the Russell Senate Office Building on June 04, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Breakthrough T1D) Collins is the only Republican senator up for reelection in 2026 in a state that Harris won, and she immediately expressed her skepticism about Gaetz serving as the nation’s next attorney general. 'I was shocked by the announcement,' she said of Gaetz’s nomination. 'I’m sure that there will be a lot of questions raised at his hearing. Obviously, the president has the right to nominate whomever he wishes, but I’m certain that there will be a lot of questions.' Collins will closely review Trump’s nomination of Kennedy, as she also sits on the HELP Committee. Collins told The New York times that she found some of Kennedy’s past statements 'alarming.' Cheryl Hines’ friends ‘concerned’ 'I’ve never even met with him or sat down with him or heard him speak at length,' she said before Trump formally announced his nomination of Kennedy. But she said that Kennedy 'would be a surprising choice' to head the nation’s health services, given his long track record of claiming that vaccines pose serious health concerns and his push to remove fluoride from public water, something that many lawmakers view as a fringe issue. Sen.-elect John Curtis, R-Utah WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 13: U.S. Senator-elect John Curtis (R-UT) arrives for the Senate Republican leadership elections at the U.S. Capitol on November 13, 2024 in Washington, DC. The Senate Republicans elected Sen. John Thune (R-SD) as Majority Leader, Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) as Assistant Majority Leader, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) as Republican Conference Chair, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) as Republican Policy Committee Chair, Sen. James Lankford as Republican Conference Vice Chair and Sen. Tim Scott (R-FL) as National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair for the 119th Congress. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Curtis will be filling the seat of retiring Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and he has the reputation of a practical centrist who is expected to approach his job in the same thoughtful and measured way that Romney did during his six years in the Senate. Curtis heads the Conservative Climate Caucus and has pushed back against climate skeptics, arguing that conservatives have a role to serve as 'good stewards' of the environment. He favored censuring Trump for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election, but he voted 'no' on impeachment during his tenure in the House, urging colleagues to 'tone down the rhetoric and calm the tensions.' Curtis doesn’t have a great relationship with Gaetz, who traveled to Utah in March to campaign against him in the Senate Republican primary. Pentagon fails 7th audit in a row but says progress made Gaetz accused Curtis on the campaign trail of 'weakness' and a 'willingness to prioritize foreign interests abroad' and 'special interests in the halls of Washington.' Curtis has already signaled he would not support putting the Senate into an extended recess to allow Trump to circumvent the confirmation process by making recess appointments. 'Senator-elect Curtis believes that every president is afforded a degree of deference to select his team and make nominations,' Curtis’s chief of staff, Corey Norman, told KSL TV in Salt Lake City. 'He also firmly believes in and is committed to the Senate’s critical role to confirm or reject nominations based on information and insight from confirmation hearings.' Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 08: U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), ranking Member on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, participates in a hearing on prescription drugs costs at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 08, 2024 in Washington, DC. The Committee heard testimony on drug pricing from the heads of several drug manufactures including Joaquin Duato, CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, Robert Davis, CEO of Merck, and Chris Boerner, CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Cassidy will be one of only three Republican senators still serving next year who voted to convict Trump on the impeachment charge of inciting insurrection. Cassidy is known as a principled politician who’s not afraid to buck Trump or tackle politically dangerous issues, such as reforming Social Security to extend its solvency. But the Louisiana lawmaker is up for reelection in 2026 and faces a potential primary challenge given his vote to convict Trump. He will likely serve as chair of the HELP Committee next year, giving him jurisdiction over Kennedy’s nomination to head Health and Human Services. Cassidy, a doctor, has disputed claims attempting to link vaccines and autism as 'fake news.' Trump taps FCC commissioner Brendan Carr to chair the agency 'As a doctor who has spent my life trying to bring health to the people of Louisiana, I strongly endorse immunizations,' he said in 2019. 'There is no linkage to autism that has ever been made by a credible scientist.' Cassidy's Health panel will hold a hearing on Kennedy but the Senate Finance Committee will handle Kennedy's paperwork and vote to advance him to the floor, according to a Republican source familiar with the process. Cassidy dodged questions about Gaetz’s nomination to head the Justice Department but did not appear to be impressed by Trump’s choice of Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense, given his career in television and lack of experience managing large organizations such as the Pentagon. 'Who?' Cassidy said when asked Tuesday about Hegseth becoming the next secretary of Defense, expressing the same bewilderment that several GOP senators voiced about Trump’ s unorthodox choice when news of it broke Tuesday. Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind. WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 04: U.S. Sen. Todd Young (R-IN) speaks on the economy during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on May 04, 2022 in Washington, DC. The group of Senators spoke out about Biden's economic agenda and blamed his administration for rising inflation. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Young is a serious legislator who doesn’t like to be asked about Trump’s latest provocative statements on Truth Social. But while Young doesn’t often talk about the controversies that constantly swirl around Trump, he’s made clear in the past that he’s not a fan. He did not endorse Trump for president in 2024 and has criticized him for refusing to call Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal. Manchin postelection: ‘There is a need for a third party’ He also faulted Trump for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol but did not vote to convict him. Young was one of several Republican senators, along with Collins, Murkowski and Cassidy, to vote for a 2022 bill to address gun violence. Gaetz said at the time that any Republican senator who supported the measure would be 'a traitor to the Constitution,' a statement that won’t endear him to the senators whose support he needs to win confirmation. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 14: Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) talks to reporters following the weekly Senate Republican policy luncheon in the U.S. Capitol on February 14, 2023 in Washington, DC. Republicans were critical of President Joe Biden's response to the U.S. Military's downing of four unidentified objects that entered North American airspace in the last eight days and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) re-emphasized that the country would not default on its debts by failing to raise the debt limit. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Ernst told The Hill that Gaetz has an 'uphill climb' to securing enough votes to win confirmation, and she’s taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump’s choices of Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, to serve as director of national intelligence and Hegseth to lead the Defense Department. Ernst said she wants to meet with Gabbard before forming any judgments about her nomination. 'I’ve had a relationship with her. It might be a little unconventional, but at the same time she might bring value to us too. So we’ll have to sort through all that,' she said. Asked about Gabbard’s past statements defending Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Putin, Ernst said, 'We’ll have to talk about that.' Pension, perks await retiring US presidents Ernst is also up for reelection in 2026. While Trump won Iowa in the 2016, 2020 and 2024 presidential elections, former President Obama carried it in 2008 and 2012. Democrats may target her seat simply because they don’t have many other promising options on the electoral map. Ernst lost her race to become Senate Republican Conference chair to Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and may be more inclined to break with her party now that she will no longer be a member of the elected leadership. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 19: Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) speaks at a news conference on the Supreme Court at the U.S. Capitol Building on July 19, 2023 in Washington, DC. Senators with the Senate Judiciary Committee held the press conference to discuss Senate Judiciary Chairman Richard Durbin's (D-IL) upcoming ethics bill. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Tillis is not afraid to play the role of Republican maverick if he feels strongly about a nominee or an issue, and he’s already suggesting that Gaetz might not have much support in the Senate. 'It'll just be interesting to see what his organic base is,' Tillis said of the nominee. 'At the end of the day, Congressman Gaetz, he'll have a hearing, but I'm all about counting votes and I would think that he's probably got some work cut out for him to get a good strong vote.' 'We're not going to get a single Democrat vote,' he said. Tillis will be one of the Senate Democrats’ top targets in 2026 if he decides to run for reelection in North Carolina, a battleground state that Trump won by 3.5 percentage points over Harris. Trump’s team drawing up list of Pentagon officers to fire: Report Tillis, who represents more than 90,000 active-duty service members in his home state, which is also home to Fort Liberty — formerly known as Fort Bragg — says Hegseth will need to answer some tough questions at his confirmation hearing. 'I think he’s just got to go through the vetting process and withstand what I’m sure is going to be an interesting murder board in the Senate Armed Services Committee,' he told reporters. Tillis acknowledged Hegseth’s lack of experience leading large organizations will be something he needs to address at his confirmation hearing. 'Those are all things you got to have good, sound answers for. It’s a large, complex, very, very important agency,' he said. 'We’ve got to see all the vetting. There’s a lot of work that’ll go into between now and the time he actually comes before the committee.' Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 05: Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) walks to the Senate Chambers for a nomination vote at the U.S. Capitol Building on December 05, 2022 in Washington, DC. Congress faces multiple legislative hurdles before their holiday recess including passage of the annual National Defense Authorization Act and government funding for 2023. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Cornyn pledged to get Trump’s nominees through the Senate quickly when he was running against Senate Republican Whip John Thune, S.D., and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to become the next Senate majority leader. Cornyn, however, lost that race, which could give him more freedom to criticize Trump’s picks, especially if he doesn’t think they’re qualified for the highest-profile Cabinet roles. He joked to reporters that he and Sen. Mitch McConnell, Ky., who will retire as Senate GOP leader, are now 'liberated' as they won’t have elected leadership positions in 2025, giving them more latitude to push back against flawed nominees. Cornyn, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has called for members of his panel to have full access to the findings of the House Ethics Committee’s investigation of Gaetz for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Elon Musk is hiring for DOGE. Here’s the type of people he wants to recruit He warned that if there’s evidence of wrongdoing, Gaetz could become 'an embarrassment to the president.' 'We need to get access to everything,' he said, breaking with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who said Friday that he will 'strongly request' that the House Ethics panel stick to its practice of not releasing a report about a member who has resigned from the House, as Gaetz did this past week. Cornyn also appeared surprised that Trump picked Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence, given her past statements disputing the U.S. government’s claim that Assad used chemical weapons against his own people and defending Putin’s stated rationale for invading Ukraine. Cornyn, however, is up for reelection in 2026 and is likely to face a conservative primary challenger. This might give him reason to be cautious in criticizing Trump’s nominees, but even so, he’s not likely to shy away from standing his ground on Trump’s most controversial picks, such as Gaetz. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 23: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) speaks during a press conference following the Republicans weekly policy luncheon on January 23, 2024 in Washington, DC. Negotiations over border security, military aid to Ukraine and Israel, and the government budget continue this week on Capitol Hill. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images) McConnell will be one of the most interesting Senate wild cards next year given his deep skepticism of Trump’s character and many of his policy positions. McConnell has served as Senate majority or minority leader for the past 18 years, which saddled him with the responsibility of preserving unity within the GOP conference. As majority leader during Trump’s first four years in office, he played a leading role in confirming Trump’s nominees to the executive and judicial branches. He counts his role in confirming three conservative justices to the Supreme Court under Trump among his greatest career accomplishments. Yet McConnell, an institutionalist and defense hawk, is not likely to rubber-stamp Trump’s nomination of Gaetz to head the Justice Department if he thinks it would undermine public confidence in the nation’s top law enforcement institution. Cruise line offers 4-year journey to ‘skip forward’ in wake of US presidential election 'Looking at his track record, he’s never cowed to Trump on things, especially as they relate to the Senate and the Senate’s role,' said a Senate Republican aide. McConnell rejected Trump’s call in 2018 for Senate Republicans to abolish the filibuster to improve the chances of passing his legislative agenda at the time. Given his role as a defender of Senate prerogatives, he will likely counsel against putting the Senate in an extended recess to allow Trump to make recess appointments. McConnell will carefully examine Gabbard’s statements about Russia, given the leading role he has played directing U.S. military aid to Ukraine. He said his priority over the final two years of his seventh Senate term will be to build up defense spending and the nation’s defense industrial base. If he views Hegseth as a Trump loyalist who might be at odds with that mission, he will likely speak out against him.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-cabinet-senator-obstacles/	2024-11-18T06:28:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/collinssusan_mcconnellmitch_murkoswkilisa_111524gn01_w-e1731929158765.jpg?w=900
US immigration judges ordered 7K Mexicans deported last month	McALLEN, Texas (Border Report) - Over 7,100 Mexican nationals were ordered deported from the United States in October - that's more than any other nationality group, according to new data. Head of renowned migrant center wants to work with new administration U.S. immigration judges ordered the deportations, which are the most in a decade and culminate a trend in rising number of Mexicans ordered removed from the country, according to data released Friday from Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC.) Guatemalans, Honduras, Nicaraguans and Ecuadorians were the next most foreign nationals ordered by judges deported from the United States in October, TRAC found. Over 7,100 Mexicans were deported from the United States in October. (TRAC Graphic) An analysis of immigration cases found two-thirds, or 66% of all Mexicans who applied for asylum in the United States were ordered deported - that's way above the 37% of Mexican nationals who were ordered sent back in October 2023, with the remainder allowed to stay in the United States while their immigration cases played out, TRAC says.

Laken Riley trial: Forensic, technology experts to testify	(NewsNation) — Jose Ibarra, the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, is scheduled to be in court Monday for the second day of his trial. Nine witnesses were called to testify on Friday in Athens-Clarke County Superior Court. The prosecution is expected to pick right back up where it left off Monday morning, with experts called to explain how fingerprints found on Riley's phone match Jose Ibarra's. They are also expected to talk about how Riley's watch data matches up to video evidence the prosecution has collected over the last nine months which points to Jose Ibarra. Prosecutors say Jose Ibarra's DNA was found under 22-year-old Riley's fingernails. Jose Ibarra's defense attorneys, meanwhile, argue all of the evidence the prosecution has is circumstantial. An investigation began after a friend reported Riley missing on Feb. 22 when she didn’t return home from a run. Investigators later discovered her body in a forested area on the University of Georgia campus. UGA Police arrested Jose Ibarra in connection to Riley’s death the following day. Jose Ibarra 26, who waived his right to a jury trial, is charged with murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, battery and tampering with evidence. He has pleaded not guilty on all counts. Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator Ibarra's brothers to testify NewsNation obtained copies of court documents showing Ibarra's attorneys plans to call two of his brothers, Diego and Argenis, to testify in court this week. Neighbors told NewsNation that the three brothers were living in a one-bedroom apartment not far from the crime scene. On Friday, the defense showed photographs that reveal Diego Ibarra was wearing the exact same baseball hat Jose Ibarra was said to have been wearing on the day Riley was killed, as well as similar clothes. Diego and Argenis Ibarra are charged with possessing fraudulent green cards and in federal custody. They are set to be taken to the courthouse on Wednesday. Authorities say all three brothers are Venezuelan citizens who are in the United States illegally. New ‘X’ terms and conditions leads to exodus of users First Day of Jose Ibarra's Trial Prosecutor Sheila Ross said on the first day of the trial that Jose Ibarra 'went hunting for females on the University of Georgia’s campus.' 'When Laken Riley refused to be his rape victim, he bashed her skull in with a rock repeatedly,' Ross said Friday. Defense attorney Dustin Kirby called the evidence in the case graphic and disturbing, but said none of it proves his client is a killer. 'People have used this case for their own personal gain — financial gain, political gain,' Kirby said.

Trump will use 'military assets' to remove illegal migrants	(NewsNation) President-elect Donald Trump confirmed Monday morning he plans to use 'military assets' to remove migrants accused of entering the U.S. illegally. In a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump shared a post by Judicial Watch president John Fitton which read, 'Reports are the incoming @RealDonaldTrump administration prepared to declare a national emergency and will use military assets to reverse the Biden invasion through a mass deportation program.' Trump commented 'True!' It's unclear what military assets Trump intends to use, but he's mentioned invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite migrant removal in the past. Critics argue the law is out of date and wince at its most recent use during World War II to hold Japanese-Americans in internment camps without due process. Immigration was a top issue in the 2024 presidential campaign, and Trump has promised to stabilize the southern border after more migrants crossed during the Biden administration than any other in history.

Baltimore mayor discusses winning strategy against violent crime	(NewsNation) — Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, who recently made history as the city's first mayor to win re-election in two decades, is highlighting significant progress in reducing violent crime through a comprehensive approach to public safety. One Baltimore neighborhood, Brooklyn, has marked more than 400 days without a homicide — a dramatic turnaround for an area that experienced a block party shooting in July 2023 that left two dead and nearly 30 injured, mostly teenagers and young adults. In the aftermath of the tragedy, the city’s flagship anti-violence program Safe Streets ramped up its work in the area. Scott's strategy includes a distinctive approach to violence prevention: sending personalized letters to individuals identified as at risk of becoming either victims or perpetrators of gun violence. The letters offer support for life changes while warning of consequences for continued criminal activity. Kohberger attorneys motion to suppress evidence including DNA 'We want them to be alive. We will help them change their life, but if they don't, we will extract them with law enforcement,' Scott said Sunday on 'NewsNation Prime.' The neighborhood has seen an 86% reduction in homicides and a 76% decrease in non-fatal shootings. These improvements are part of a broader trend, with Baltimore recording a 20% reduction in homicides last year and an additional 24% drop this year, alongside a 34% decrease in non-fatal shootings. The mayor emphasizes a collaborative approach involving multiple city agencies, from violence interrupters to recreation and parks staff. The program includes job training and education support, citing recent success stories including a participant who obtained their GED and found employment. Safe Streets focuses on de-escalating conflicts by employing mediators with credibility and knowledge of the streets. The program has 10 offices based in some of the city’s most dangerous neighborhoods. It was launched in 2007 and expanded in recent years under Scott’s administration, which has often pledged to treat violence as a public health crisis and address its root causes. Laken Riley trial: Jose Ibarra’s brothers subpoenaed A community survey conducted in the weeks after the Brooklyn mass shooting showed that many neighborhood residents placed more trust in Safe Streets than Baltimore police, local schools, nonprofits and other institutions, according to city officials. Only neighborhood churches ranked higher. Even still, having Safe Streets workers present during the block party wasn’t enough to prevent it from ultimately devolving into chaos and bloodshed. Scott also addressed the city's ongoing struggle with the opioid crisis, noting a recent settlement with pharmaceutical companies that will bring approximately $500 million to Baltimore for addiction response efforts. The city currently averages more than two overdose deaths per day, according to health department statistics. The mayor's efforts are featured in 'The Body Politic,' a documentary chronicling his first year in office, scheduled to air on PBS on Nov. 25 at 10 p.m. Eastern.

Laken Riley trial: Jose Ibarra's brothers subpoenaed	(NewsNation) — The criminal brothers of accused killer Jose Ibarra will testify on behalf of the defense this week in the murder trial of 22-year-old Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. New court documents obtained by NewsNation revealed that Diego and Argenis, who are both undocumented immigrants currently in custody for fake green cards, were subpoenaed by the defense team to appear. Agents rescue 4-year-old girl, baby from smugglers near border The Ibarra brothers were allegedly living together in an apartment not far from the University of Georgia campus at the time of Riley's murder. All three crossed over the border illegally from Venezuela. Diego was employed for a short time by the university, but was fired shortly before Riley's death for failing to produce proper documentation. In a rare move, Ibarra has waived his right to a jury trial, leaving his fate solely in the hands of a judge — a risky decision in a case that has garnered national attention. That move could prove strategically advantageous for the accused killer following a devastating start to court proceedings. Riley’s family sobbed as graphic details and images were revealed about the woman's terrifying final moments. Laken Riley's murder The investigation into Riley’s death began when a friend reported her missing on Feb. 22 after she didn’t return home from a run. Investigators soon after discovered her body in a forested area on the University of Georgia campus. Emergency responders tried to revive Riley but determined she died before officers discovered her body. The UGA Police Department arrested Ibarra in connection to Riley’s death the following day. Texas authorities on high alert for pre-Trump immigration ‘surge’ Prosecutors allege Ibarra beat Riley with an object and dragged her body to a secluded area off the jogging path to conceal her body. The prosecution is relying on hard forensic evidence — DNA, blood, fingerprints and video of Ibarra allegedly dumping bloody clothes 15 minutes after the murder — to make its case.

Manchin postelection: 'There is a need for a third party'	Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.) said the 2024 election shows there is a 'need for a third party.' Manchin joined NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt on Sunday for 'The Hill Sunday,' where he argued that the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have a duopoly, and both of their business models right now are 'spewing hatred and division.' Cole says Republicans should ‘be working with’ Trump ‘to try and achieve his objectives’ 'They attack the other and make you more concerned or more frightened of the other. You better join my side and vice versa. That does not fix our problems, it does not keep our country the United States of America,' Manchin continued. 'I know there’s a need for a third party.' Manchin, a lifelong conservative Democrat, announced in May he had become an independent. He’d long toyed with the idea of a possible third-party bid for the White House but ruled it out. He is leaving Congress at the end of his term and did not say what he plans to do next. On Sunday, he said he’s interested in participating in or helping a third party. Manchin said he believes a ticket with a former Democrat and former Republican would be strong. 'I thought that would be very attractive in [these] most divisive times that we have,' he said. As Democrats point fingers about their brutal loss in the election and try to understand where they went so wrong, many are left thinking reform is needed within both parties, Manchin included. Ron Johnson says his ‘bias would be to vote’ for Trump’s picks 'I don’t know what has to be one here but … the only way you’re going to change the Democrat and Republican Party is to challenge them,' he said.

Pension, perks await retiring US presidents	(NewsNation) — It’s nowhere near what the average corporate CEO earns, but the annual salary of the president of the United States may be the envy of most Americans: $400,000. That does not include lodging at the White House, travel on Air Force One, living allowances, entertainment, staff and much more. When a president leaves office, the checks and other benefits continue. Here’s a look at some of those benefits, and how they came about. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits What benefits do all former presidents get? The Former Presidents Acts of 1958 provides for a pension and several other benefits. All presidents receive money for office space, equipment, staff, travel, entertainment and supplies. If they were enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program for at least five years, former presidents get the same health benefits as other former government workers. Tom Cole: Republicans should ‘be working with’ Trump ‘to try and achieve his objectives’ Ironically, Jimmy Carter, America’s longest-living former president, was not eligible for that program since he was president for only four years and held no other federal government post. One-term president George H.W. Bush, who was vice president for eight years, as well as serving in Congress and as an ambassador, was eligible for health benefits but declined them. Former presidents are guaranteed a funeral with full honors and burial at Arlington National Cemetery. But only two presidents, John F. Kennedy and William Howard Taft, are buried there. Pollster Ann Selzer steps aside in wake of huge Iowa poll miss Biden’s big pension payday When Joe Biden leaves the White House he will be eligible for the standard annual pension that any cabinet secretary receives: $246,424. But Biden also served eight years as vice president and spent 36 years as a U.S. senator from Delaware. All three pensions will total $413,000 a year, more than he made as president. The federal government places very few limits on multiple pensions, and only a few states ban or limit 'double dipping,' in which a government employee retires, collects a pension, and then returns to work in another government job. For example, Burlington County, New Jersey, passed a law banning county departments from hiring anyone who is collecting a 'taxpayer-funded retirement pension.' Cruise line offers 4-year journey to ‘skip forward’ in wake of US presidential election A president's other post-White House benefits Donald Trump has received more than $3 million in pension, office, printing, travel, and other allowances since his first term ended. From 2016 to 2024, Bill Clinton has received nearly $13 million in pension and other benefits from 2016 to 2024. George W. Bush has been paid just over $12 million in those same eight years. Barack Obama has received about $10.5 million. And Jimmy Carter, famous for his frugality, has received just over $5 million in that same time. Clinton, Bush and Obama may also receive pensions from other government positions they held. Ron Johnson says his ‘bias would be to vote’ for Trump’s picks Has a president been denied or refused benefits? To date, no president has ever been denied a pension. The Former Presidents Act of 1958, which established the current pension and benefits system, denies benefits to a president who has been impeached and convicted by Congress. Richard Nixon avoided that fate by resigning. Bill Clinton and Donald Trump were impeached, but not convicted. Former presidents and their spouses may receive protection by the U.S. Secret Service for life. Eleven years after his resignation, Richard Nixon relinquished his protection – the only former president to do so. Progressive fault lines emerge after Harris’s loss Why do presidents receive pensions? A few years after leaving the White House in 1953, Harry S. Truman lobbied for financial support. Claiming dire financial straights, Truman wrote to House Speaker Sam Rayburn in 1957 saying he might have to turn to the private sector or some other source beneath the dignity of a former president. The upshot was the Former Presidents Act of 1958, which established the system of pension, allowances and office expenses in effect today. But in 2021, University of Colorado Law School professor Paul Campos debunked the Truman 'poverty' claim. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Campos claims that Truman misappropriated nearly all of the presidential expense account that Congress set up at the beginning of his second term. Truman also, according to Campos, did the thing he claimed that he wouldn’t do: exploit his status as a former president. 'By the time Congress passed the FPA in response to Truman’s various claims that he was at least teetering on the brink of potential financial distress, Truman’s net worth was, in relative economic terms, approximately $72 million in 2021 dollars,' Campos wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/president-pension-benefits/	2024-11-17T16:39:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-514952648.jpg?w=900
Biden authorizes Ukraine to use US-supplied long-range missiles f...	MANAUS, Brazil (AP) — President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter. The decision allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, for attacks farther inside Russia comes as President Vladimir Putin positions North Korean troops along Ukraine's northern border to try to reclaim hundreds of miles of territory seized by Ukrainian forces. Biden's move also follows the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war and raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the United States' vital military support for Ukraine. The official and the others knowledgeable about the matter were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's reaction Sunday was notably restrained. 'Strikes are not made with words,' he said during his nightly video address. 'Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves.' Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters have been pressing Biden for months to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles, saying the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids. Zelenskyy's statement came shortly after he posted a message of condolence on Telegram following a Russian attack on a nine-story building that killed at least eight people in the northern city of Sumy, 40 kilometres (24 miles) from the border with Russia. Russia also launched a massive drone and missile attack, described by officials as the largest in recent months, targeting energy infrastructure and killing civilians. The attack came as fears are mounting about Moscow’s intentions to devastate Ukraine’s power generation capacity before the winter. 'And this is the answer to everyone who tried to achieve something with Putin through talks, phone calls, hugs, and appeasement,' Zelenskyy said. Some supporters have argued that the limitation and other U.S. constraints could cost Ukraine the war. The debate has become a source of disagreement among Ukraine’s NATO allies. Biden had remained opposed, determined to hold the line against any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. News of Biden's decision followed meetings over the last two days with the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China. The addition of North Korean troops was central to the talks, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru. Biden did not mention the decision during a speech at a stop in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil on his way to the Group of 20 summit. Asked about the decision, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a press conference that the body’s position is 'to avoid a permanent deterioration of the war in Ukraine.' 'We want peace, we want fair peace,' Guterres said on Sunday before the summit in Rio de Janeiro. He didn't elaborate. The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to support Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to one of the people familiar with the development. The overall supply of ATACMS missiles is short, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference. Some supporters of Ukraine say that even a few long-range strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources. North Korea has provided thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year. The introduction of North Korean troops to the conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict. As many as 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian assessments. U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Trump, who takes office in January, spoke for months as a candidate about wanting Russia’s war in Ukraine to be over, but he mostly ducked questions about whether he wanted U.S. ally Ukraine to win. He also repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid. His victory has Ukraine’s international backers worrying that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Putin. America is Ukraine’s most valuable ally in the war, providing more than $56.2 billion in security assistance since Russian forces invaded in February 2022. Worried about Russia’s response, however, the Biden administration repeatedly has delayed providing some specific advanced weapons sought by Ukraine, agreeing only under pressure from Kyiv, its supporters and in consultation with allies. That includes initially refusing Zelenskyy’s pleas for advanced tanks, Patriot air defense systems and F-16 fighter jets, among other systems. The White House agreed in May to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weaponry for limited strikes just across the border with Russia. ___ Long, Miller, Knickmeyer and Lee reported from Washington.

Cole says Republicans should 'be working with' Trump 'to try and ...	Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said in an interview Sunday that Republicans should 'be working with' President-elect Trump 'to try and achieve his objectives.' 'As we record this, the Republican majority in the 119th Congress looks like it'll be about the same size as it is in the current Congress — 222, maybe 221 — but … in the same space,' NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt said on 'The Hill Sunday.' Ron Johnson says ‘bias would be to vote’ for Trump’s picks 'Narrow majorities make for hard work,' Stirewalt continued. 'What do you tell your fellow Republicans about navigating these spaces?' 'Well, first of all, I tell them, you have your majority because of President Trump,' Cole said. 'Look, he’s won the popular vote … for the first time in 20 years any Republican’s been able to do that. And so, we ought to be working with him to try and achieve his objectives.' Republicans will have control of both the House and Senate next year, as well as the presidency. The election results mirror those of around four years ago in which the party that won the presidency, the Democrats, also won the House and Senate. 'I think it will be a little bit different this Congress, simply because we've got a little bit of discipline,' Cole said in his NewsNation interview. 'You know, President Trump is not shy about expressing his opinions. I think all of my members have a very healthy respect for him.' Trump allies remain in legal peril despite his election victory The Republicans’ win in the House this year is a victory for House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who has led the House GOP through tumultuous times for a little more than a year. Johnson has overseen rough patches for the GOP conference in the lower chamber, including the period following former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s (R-Calif.) ouster and fierce debates over foreign aid. Trump’s return to the White House, as well as having a friendlier neighbor in a GOP-controlled Senate, may make things easier for House Republicans, who have recently been dealing with Democrats leading the Senate and President Biden.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/the-hill-sunday/tom-cole-republicans-trump-objectives/	2024-11-17T13:46:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP23292638592566-e1697741916519.jpg?w=900

'My bias would be to vote for the people that President Trump wants to serve [by in his] administration,' Johnson told NewsNation's Chris Stirewalt on 'The Hill Sunday.' 'Again, as a U.S. senator, I'm probably the minority view here; I don't particularly like being the human resource department of administration.'

Trump allies remain in legal peril despite his election victory President-elect Trump has selected a few controversial people for roles in his incoming administration, including right-wing firebrand and former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) for attorney general. While Gaetz had been a strong supporter of the president-elect during his time in Congress, he also had some rough relationships within his party, notably having an ongoing public feud with ex-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).

What has Project 2025 said since Trump’s win? The Florida Republican, who resigned from the House immediately after the announcement, has recently been the subject of a probe by the House Ethics Committee looking into whether he took part in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, alongside other allegations. He has denied allegations of wrongdoing, but Gaetz’s resignation essentially kills the probe by taking himself out of the panel’s jurisdiction.

Biden becomes the first sitting US president to visit the Amazon ...	MANAUS, Brazil (AP) — Joe Biden on Sunday became the first sitting American president to set foot in the Amazon rainforest, as the incoming Trump administration seems poised to scale back the U.S. commitment to combating climate change. The massive Amazon, which is about the size of Australia, stores huge amounts of the world’s carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that drives climate change when it's released into the atmosphere. But development is rapidly depleting the world's largest tropical rainforest. Joined by Carlos Nobre, a Nobel-Prize winning scientist and expert on how climate change is impacting the Amazon, and Biden climate adviser John Podesta, Biden lifted in his helicopter over a stretch of the rainforest, for a good view of the shallowing of waterways, fire damage and a wildlife refuge. He was also getting a peek at where the Rio Negro and Amazon rivers meet. Biden will then meet local and indigenous leaders and visit an Amazonian museum as he looks to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. His administration announced plans last year for a $500 million contribution to the Amazon Fund, the most significant international cooperation effort to preserve the rainforest, primarily financed by Norway. So far, the U.S. government said it has provided $50 million, and the White House announced Sunday an additional $50 million contribution to the fund. 'It’s significant for a sitting president to visit the Amazon. ... This shows a personal commitment from the president,' said Suely Araújo, former head of the Brazilian environmental protection agency and public policy coordinator with the nonprofit Climate Observatory. 'That said, we can’t expect concrete results from this visit.' She doubts that a 'single penny' will go to the Amazon Fund once Donald Trump is back in the White House. The incoming Trump administration is highly unlikely to prioritize the Amazon or anything related to climate change. The Republican president-elect already said he would again pull out of the Paris agreement, a global pact forged to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change, after Biden recommitted to the agreement. Trump has cast climate change as a 'hoax' and said he will eliminate energy efficiency regulations by the Biden administration. Still, the Biden White House on Sunday announced a series of new efforts aimed at bolstering the Amazon and stemming the impact of climate change. Among the actions is the launch of a finance coalition that looks to spur at least $10 billion in public and private investment for land restoration and eco-friendly economic projects by 2030, and a $37.5 million loan to the organization Mombak Gestora de Recursos Ltda. to support the large-scale planting of native tree species on degraded grasslands in Brazil. Biden is also set to sign a U.S. proclamation designating Nov. 17 as International Conservation Day, and will highlight in remarks during the visit that the U.S. is on track to reach $11 billion in spending on international climate financing in 2024, a six-fold increase from when he started his term. The Amazon is home to Indigenous communities and 10% of Earth’s biodiversity. It also regulates moisture across South America. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil, and scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet. The forest has been suffering two years of historic drought that have dried up waterways, isolated thousands of riverine communities and hindered riverine dwellers’ ability to fish. It's also made way for wildfires that have burned an area larger than Switzerland and choked cities near and far with smoke. When Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office last year, he signaled a shift in environmental policy from his predecessor, far-right Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro prioritized agribusiness expansion over forest protection and weakened environmental agencies, prompting deforestation to surge to a 15-year-high. Lula has pledged 'zero deforestation' by 2030, though his term runs through the end of 2026. Forest loss in Brazil’s Amazon dropped by 30.6% in the 12 months through July from a year earlier, bringing deforestation to its lowest level in nine years, according to official data released last week. In that 12-month span, the Amazon lost 6,288 square kilometers (2,428 square miles), roughly the size of the U.S. state of Delaware. But that data fails to capture the surge of destruction this year, which will only be included in next year’s reading. Despite the success in curbing Amazon deforestation, Lula’s government has been criticized by environmentalists for backing projects that could harm the region, such as paving a highway that cuts from an old-growth area and could encourage logging, oil drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River and building a railway to transport soy to Amazonian ports. Biden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. He traveled from Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. After his stop in Manaus, he was heading to Rio de Janeiro for this year's Group of 20 leaders summit. ___ Sa Pessoa reported from Sao Paulo, and Long from Washington.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-biden-will-become-the-first-sitting-us-president-to-visit-the-amazon-rainforest/	2024-11-17T09:11:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673a204ac3f8f4.34729729.jpeg?w=900
Democratic AGs rush to form line of defense against Trump	Democratic attorneys general across the country are readying their legal defenses against the incoming Trump administration, preparing to pounce on potential violations and even take the president-elect to court if he implements controversial policies. During his first term, state attorneys general brought a wave of lawsuits against the Trump administration as they worked to block moves like his travel ban and family separations at the border. Four years after he left office, as President-elect Trump touts plans for mass deportations and a rollback of environmental regulations, the top prosecutors are on high alert. They join Democratic governors, some of whom are already in the spotlight as possible 2028 contenders, as a critical line of defense for the party, with the GOP set to take a trifecta of control over the White House and Congress. 'This time, not just with the trifecta, but also a more conservative judiciary, the number of venues for Democrats to advance their policies has shrunk on the federal level,' said Paul Nolette, a Marquette University political scientist and the director of a database on state litigation and attorney general activity. 'Whenever that happens, what we’ve seen is that parties then really use the states as a way to advance their own policy. And when Democrats are still in control of states like California, New York, Illinois … the actions of governors, the actions of state AGs, they really can make a difference not only in their own states, but across the country, on national policy,' he said. The days since Trump’s win have seen a surge of Democratic attorneys general stepping up to signal they’re ready to counterbalance the GOP when it takes power in Washington next year. 'I don't wake up every morning dying to sue the president of the United States or his administration,' New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin (D) told The Hill. 'If he’s operating lawfully, we’re not going to challenge it. But when he violates the law, we're not going to hesitate to protect our residents,' Platkin said. Trump has said his Day 1 agenda would launch 'the largest deportation program in American history,' roll back Biden orders on equity and 'drill, baby, drill.' 'It’s not like the Democrats made it up or something,' said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, of the prospective threats posed by a second Trump term. 'It comes from the mouth, and social media, of Trump himself.' The president-elect has also stoked concerns with his picks for Cabinet positions, including Trump ally former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) for U.S. attorney general. Gaetz, who is being investigated by the House Ethics Committee, resigned from Congress after getting the nod. Platkin blasted the nomination on the social platform X as a sign that Trump 'would use the DOJ to punish political opponents and undermine the rule of law.' Attorneys general from coast to coast have been preparing for months amid the competitive White House race, California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta (D) told The Hill. They’ve monitored comments from Trump and his inner circle and scrutinized Project 2025, the conservative Heritage Foundation’s blueprint for a second Trump term. The prep is as specific as prewriting briefs so officials 'just need to cross the Ts, dot the Is and press print and file it,' Bonta said. California alone reportedly brought more than a hundred lawsuits against Trump in his first term. 'What we learned from the first Trump administration is that he can’t help but break the law. It’s part of his brand. It’s part of what he does,' Bonta said. During Trump’s first term, Democratic attorneys general led more than 130 multistate lawsuits against the administration, according to Nolette’s database, and boasted an 83 percent win rate. That was more than twice as many as Republican attorneys general led against the Obama administration, with a 63.5 percent win rate. Against President Biden’s administration so far, Republican AGs have seen a win rate of around 76 percent. The first Trump administration ushered in a 'world of heightened AG activism,' Nolette said, making the latest crop of state legal officers 'much more proactive in getting ready for challenges that currently don’t even exist.' The attorneys general are connecting with each other through the Democratic Attorneys General Association (DAGA), as well as coordinating with their governors, who are also gearing up to resist Republican policies. 'Nothing unites Democrats more than Donald Trump,' said James Tierney, a Harvard Law School lecturer, the director of StateAG.org and a former Democratic attorney general of Maine. After Trump’s win, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) called a special session of the state legislature to protect progressive policies, vowing the Golden State is 'ready to fight.' New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), who brought a major lawsuit against Trump in 2022, joined with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) to announce their offices would be convening regularly to 'coordinate legal actions' and develop responses to the incoming administration, according to a release. In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey (D) — herself a former state AG — has promised her state’s law enforcement would 'absolutely not' assist if the Trump administration asked for help with mass deportation plans. Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell (D) said she’s on alert for threats to reproductive health care, gun safety, consumer protections and other issues, and told The Hill that she has 'real concerns about the president-elect’s position when it comes to the rule of law.' 'The role of the Democratic AG is the most critical, I think, in this moment in time,' Campbell said, arguing they’re 'on the front line.' Several Democratic governors were in the running for the veepstakes to join Vice President Harris’s 2024 presidential bid, and they’re also making early lists of possible 2028 contenders. Some state AGs, too, may have higher political aspirations, adding a political subtext to their public defense of their party ideals. 'The old joke, of course, is that AGs are ‘aspiring governors.’ And I think at this point we've seen, certainly, plenty of evidence that AGs have leveraged their roles to become good candidates for higher office,' Nolette said. Harris herself is a prime example: She served as California AG before jumping to the Senate and then to the vice presidency. Along the 2024 campaign trail, she touted her work in the role. Washington state’s Attorney General Bob Ferguson (D) won his gubernatorial bid on Election Day. He told reporters after the results that his office feels 'prepared to defend' progressive policies in his state as both the White House and his seat changes hands. And that defense doesn’t always look like lawsuits, experts noted. State attorneys general often write letters to congressional leaders, participate in the notice-and-comment rule-making stage and speak out about certain policies. 'The wise attorney general understands that they're more than just a lawsuit machine,' Tierney said. DAGA president Sean Rankin told The Hill that state AGs will continue their work in the courtroom during a second Trump term, but also work to 'do a better job' of explaining the work of attorneys general to the public. Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach (R), the chair of the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), argued in a statement to The Hill that the Democratic AGs are 'making an empty gesture' with their responses to Trump's win, 'given that regulatory overreach has been a hallmark of the Biden Administration.' 'Unlike President Biden who lost dozens of times to Republican AGs for promulgating illegal and unconstitutional rules and regulations, President Trump will be focused on reducing excessive overreach,' Kobach said. A Trump White House 2.0. will also likely have a 'more sophisticated approach' both to reverse Biden-era regulations and advance their own policies, Nolette said. And Democrats are set to face new hurdles in the increasingly conservative court system — including at the U.S. Supreme Court level, thanks to Trump’s appointments. 'It's like the filibuster in the Senate. Both sides use it when it's to their advantage. Republicans had a huge amount of litigation against the Biden administration in these past four years, and there's more to come. And so this isn't specific about Trump,' Nolette said of using litigation to combat the administration. 'It's something that I think AGs of both parties have realized is a very good strategy to delay and to stop policies that they disagree with,' he said. 'This is part of the process that's now entrenched.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/democratic-ags-rush-to-form-line-of-defense-against-trump/	2024-11-17T09:01:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/State-AG_111724_AP_Minh-Connors.jpg?w=900
Trump allies remain in legal peril despite his election victory	President-elect Trump’s White House victory set his legal cases on a downward spiral, but his allies who have faced prosecution or other legal trouble are not yet in the clear. Dozens of Trump aides, associates and backers — including top officials in his first administration — have faced criminal charges tied to efforts to keep the former president in power after he lost the 2020 election. Many also faced disbarments, bankruptcy and civil litigation. While Trump’s criminal cases are winding down upon his imminent return to the nation’s highest office, those same protections he has as president don’t extend to his allies. In Georgia, more than a dozen people were charged alongside Trump with attempting to subvert the state’s election results. Biden won the state by 11,779 votes in 2020. Trump’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and Rudy Giuliani, the ex-New York City mayor who helped lead the 2020 push, are co-defendants in that case, in addition to several lawyers and aides. Trump supporters who signed false paperwork saying they were the state’s true electors are also charged. A Justice Department opinion on separation of powers makes it clear that state criminal prosecutions against Trump must, at the very least, be put on ice while he’s in office, said Gregory Germain, a law professor at Syracuse University, in a blog post after November’s election. 'In all likelihood, the state criminal cases will be put on hold during Trump’s presidency,' he wrote. 'If they try to continue with the prosecutions, or even to impose a stayed sentence, I suspect the decisions will be reversed on appeal.' But that’s not the case for the 14 other defendants with remaining charges. In fact, with Trump effectively out of the picture, any limitations the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision would have put on the prosecution — barring certain evidence and causing further delays — are gone now, said Anthony Michael Kreis, a Georgia State University law professor. It could make his allies' prosecutions more potent. 'They're kind of living on a hope and a prayer that something has changed in the world to their benefit,' Kreis said of Trump’s co-defendants, citing the former president’s election win. 'But when it comes down to the actual trial practice, they might be more sorry than glad.' Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis won her own reelection this fall, allowing her to maintain her place at the helm of the historic case. In an interview with Atlanta News First, she declined to nail down a plan forward but indicated that she doesn’t intend to let the case crumble – for any defendant. 'If someone has an indictment in this office, no matter who they are, we continue to pursue those charges,' Willis said. 'I’m here for eight more years, is my plan. So, if that’s what it takes for us to get justice in some cases, we come to work every day, we’ll come to work and look for justice.' Still, the immediate fate of the Georgia case is in the hands of a state appeals court, which is weighing whether to boot Willis from the prosecution over her previous romantic relationship with a top prosecutor on the case, who has since resigned. Arizona’s 2020 election case, in which Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator of 16 defendants still facing charges, is also expected to push forward, according to the state’s Democratic attorney general. 'I have no intention of dropping that case,' Mayes said last week. 'A grand jury in the state of Arizona decided that these individuals who engaged in an attempt to overthrow our democracy in 2020 should be held accountable.' The prosecution hit a roadblock earlier this week when the judge overseeing that case recused himself after urging colleagues to call out attacks against Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign in an email to other judges. A spokesperson for Giuliani said the judge’s remarks underlined 'the partisan and baseless nature of this whole case,' but Mayes’s office pushed back that the email represented a 'cry for decency and respect' and was 'not reflective of bias.' Mayes spokesperson Richie Taylor said the case has 'never been motivated by politics.' The Arizona case is set to go to trial in January 2026, though the judge’s recusal could cause delays. Trump's troubles in Arizona might not be over, either. The state’s statute of limitations on most felony offenses is seven years, meaning that it’s possible the former president could face charges there in the final year of his term and leave office with few mechanisms to stop them, Kreis said. Three Trump allies also face charges in Wisconsin, and 16 so-called 'fake electors' are charged in Michigan. In Nevada, charges were brought against six alternate electors, but a trial court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction; the state appealed. And in New Mexico and Pennsylvania, prosecutors have said legal standards were not met to bring charges. If there are convictions for Trump’s allies in the state cases, he won’t be able to issue pardons or other relief, as that power is exclusively reserved to federal offenses. Criminal prosecutions aside, Trump’s allies have faced a slew of other legal issues for their efforts to keep Trump in the White House. Giuliani has been disbarred and was forced to turn over most of his assets to two election workers he defamed. Two others involved, Jeff Clark and John Eastman, have also faced disciplinary proceedings. And attorneys Sidney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro and Jenna Ellis have pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from their post-2020 election work. Even as president, there’s little Trump can do to help. 'I think they're out on their own,' Kreis said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/trump-allies-remain-in-legal-peril-despite-his-election-victory/	2024-11-17T07:52:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24318581178921-e1731686648497.jpg?w=900
What has Project 2025 said since Trump's win?	(NewsNation) — The key figure behind Project 2025, a controversial conservative presidential blueprint, congratulated Donald Trump on his election victory. 'We look forward to this historic term, during which President Trump has an opportunity to make America great, healthy, safe, and prosperous once again,' said Kevin Roberts, president of The Heritage Foundation, in an online statement on Election Day. Project 2025 is a nearly 1,000-page handbook from conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, and the authors refer to it as a guide on what the next president needs to do to undo the 'damage' to America they claim has been caused by liberal politicians. How Project 2025’s rightward vision became a flashpoint in this year’s election It acts as a manual for the next Republican president, detailing ways to reshape and give the executive branch more power. 'The entire conservative movement stands united behind him,' Roberts said. Many of Trump's former aides have authored parts of the document, although Trump said during his campaign that he did not know about it. The Heritage Foundation has issued six statements on Trump's nominations for his second administration. Project 2025 mischaracterized by left: The Heritage Foundation president 'The creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is a welcome and long-overdue step toward addressing government waste and restoring fiscal discipline to the federal budget,' said David Ditch, senior policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, in a news release Wednesday. Trump appointed tech entrepreneurs and billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to head the inaugural Department of Energy. The organization also praised Trump's appointments of Tom Homan as 'Border Czar,' news anchor Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of state, and former national intelligence director John Ratcliffe as CIA chief. 'Pete Hegseth is a tremendous choice for Secretary of Defense,' Roberts said in a post on X, which was paired with a picture of a Jerusalem Cross. The Heritage Foundation also praised the selection of former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the secretary of Human and Health Services. 'This nomination sends a clear message to our failed public health establishment: Americans are sick and tired of being sick and tired,' Roberts said in a news release Thursday. 'Under President Trump and Secretary Kennedy, those Americans will be in control of their health, not the commissars of three-letter health agencies.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/what-has-project-2025-said-since-trumps-win/	2024-11-17T07:42:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670c9c6324b334.96284448.jpeg?w=900
Trump said he can't run in 2028 unless the GOP figures 'something...	(NEXSTAR) – President-elect Donald Trump, during a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday, made an apparent joke in which he remarked that the GOP might want to 'do something' that would somehow allow him to serve a third term in 2028. 'I suspect I won’t be running again, unless you do something,' Trump said, according to audio shared with NewsNation affiliate The Hill. 'Unless you say, ‘He’s so good, we have to just figure it out.’' Trump’s remarks garnered some laughs from the GOP lawmakers, a couple of whom dismissed them as a joke. But Trump has made similar comments in the past, having previously floated the ideas of 'extending' his term or somehow disregarding term limits. Trump taps fracking CEO Chris Wright for Energy secretary As it stands, however, the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution bars any president from serving more than two terms — regardless of whether those terms are consecutive or not. 'No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once,' reads the amendment, in part. The idea behind this amendment was introduced for consideration in 1947, in response to President Franklin D. Roosevelt winning four consecutive terms in office. Franklin, who died just months into his fourth term, was the only president to get elected more than twice (though other presidents before him had indeed attempted to secure third terms). There have also been dozens of attempts to repeal the amendment in the years since its introduction, though none made any significant progress. But could the 22nd Amendment be repealed under the coming Trump administration with GOP majorities in the Senate and the House? It’s not likely. Repealing an amendment would require a new amendment itself, the National Constitution Center, a non-profit dedicated to studying and educating about the U.S. Constitution, explains. But any new amendment must have the backing of two-thirds of the House and Senate — and the incoming GOP does not have enough seats to secure its passing. Two-thirds of state legislators could also call for a constitutional convention to propose the new amendment, but three-quarters of the states would have to approve it — another unlikely scenario. A Democratic lawmaker in New York isn’t taking any chances, though. Rep. Dan Goldman said last week he was filing to clarify the wording of the 22nd Amendment, to make it clearer that the terms described therein apply 'to two terms in the aggregate,' The New York Times reported. The resolution likely will never reach a vote under House Speaker Mike Johnson, the outlet noted. Trump has promised ‘concealed carry reciprocity.’ What would it do? Congress has previously acknowledged, however, that it may still be possible for a two-term president to once again become president, largely due to language in the 22nd and 12th Amendments that could be interpreted to suggest the possibility that a former president ascends to the presidency, in very specific situations. ' … [N]either Amendment addresses the eligibility of a former two-term President to serve as Speaker of the House or as one of the other officers who could serve as President through operation of the Succession Act,' according to an overview from the Congressional online database.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-said-he-cant-run-in-2028-unless-the-gop-figures-something-out-could-that-happen/	2024-11-17T07:35:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/TrumpGettyImages-2183887423.jpg?w=900
Big voter turnout this year benefited Republicans, contradicting ...	The 2024 presidential election featured sky-high turnout, approaching the historic levels of the 2020 contest and contradicting long-held conventional political wisdom that Republicans struggle to win races in which many people vote. According to Associated Press elections data, more than 152 million ballots were cast in this year's race between Republican Donald Trump, now the president-elect, and Democrat Kamala Harris, the vice president, with hundreds of thousands of more still being tallied in slower-counting states such as California. When those ballots are fully tabulated, the number of votes will come even closer to the 158 million in the 2020 presidential contest, which was the highest turnout election since women were given the right to vote more than a century ago. 'Trump is great for voter turnout in both parties,' said Eitan Hersh, a political scientist at Tufts University. The former president's victory in both the Electoral College and popular vote — Trump currently leads Harris by nearly 3 million votes nationwide — also contradicts the belief in politics that Democrats, not Republicans, benefit from high-turnout elections. Trump himself voiced it in 2020 when he warned that a Democratic bill to expand mail balloting would lead to 'levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.' That warning came as Trump began to sow conspiracy theories about using mail voting during the coronavirus pandemic, which he then used to falsely claim his 2020 loss was due to fraud. That claim led to a wave of new laws adding regulations and rolling back forms of voting in GOP-controlled states and an expansion of mail voting in Democratic-led ones, as the battle over turnout became a central part of political debate. Such laws usually have a miniscule impact on voting but inspired allegations of voter suppression from Democrats and cheating from Republicans. 'It's such an embarrassing story for proponents on both sides, because it's so obviously wrong,' Hersh said. Though both sides are likely to continue to battle over how elections are run, Trump's high-turnout victory may take some of the urgency out of that confrontation. 'Now I think, you just won the popular vote, I think it'll quiet down,' said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican data analyst and pollster who has long argued his party can succeed in a high-turnout election with a diverse electorate. Experts note that turnout in the seven swing states at the heart of the election was even higher than in the rest of the country. 'This was a campaign in seven states much more so than previous elections have felt like,' Ruffini said. While the rest the country shifted significantly from 2020, when Democrat Joe Biden won the popular vote by 7 million, or 4.5 percentage points, the outcome in the swing states was closer. The turnout story also was different. Turnout dropped from 2020 in noncompetitive states such as Illinois, which recorded more than 500,000 fewer votes than in the last presidential election, and Ohio, which reported more than 300,000 less. Meanwhile, the number of votes cast topped those in 2020 in the battleground states of Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which Trump won. Arizona's turnout was nearly even with four years ago, as the state continued to count ballots. Harris even met or topped Biden's vote totals in Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin, and turnout has far eclipsed that of the 2016 presidential election, when 135.6 million voters cast ballots in a race won by Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton. The problem for Democrats is that Trump did better in the battlegrounds than four years ago. 'The Harris campaign did a pretty good job getting voters out who wouldn't have come out,' said Tom Bonier, a Democratic data analyst. 'She did get her voters out. Trump got more.' Those Trump turnout victories included first-time voter Jasmine Perez, 26, who voted for Trump at the Las Vegas Raiders stadium. 'I’m a Christian and he really aligns with a lot of my values as a Christian in America, and I like that he openly promotes Christianity in America,' Perez said. Voting alongside her was Diego Zubek, 27, who voted for Trump in 2016 but didn’t vote in 2020 because he figured Trump would win easily. He voted for Trump this year. 'I wasn’t going to let that happen again,' Zubek said. A key part of the GOP strategy was reaching out to voters such as Perez and Zubek, encouraging early and mail voting after Republicans had largely abandoned them in the past two elections due to Trump's lies about vote fraud. Conservatives mounted extensive voter registration and get-out-the-vote operations targeting infrequent voters, a demographic that many operatives have long believed would not vote for the GOP. More than half the votes were cast before Election Day this year, according to AP tracking of the advanced vote. During the campaign, Andrew Kolvet, a spokesman for Turning Point Action, a conservative group that ran a get-out-the-vote campaign with more than 1,000 workers in multiple battleground states, cited Stacey Abrams, a onetime Democratic candidate for Georgia governor, as an inspiration in his group's effort. Abrams' success mobilizing Black voters and other groups in her home state that were less likely to vote helped pave the way for Biden's 2020 win there. 'We saw that Trump has this amazing reservoir of low-propensity conservatives who needed a little coaxing,' Kolvet said in an interview Friday. 'They didn't think their vote mattered, and their No. 1 pushback was they didn't understand, really, how to vote.' Kolvet acknowledged that conservatives long believed large turnout didn't help them but contended that's changed in the Trump era: 'Our ideas are more popular,' he said. Whether it continues is up to what happens next in Washington. 'It's going to be up to conservatives to make good on those campaign promises,' Kolvet said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-big-voter-turnout-this-year-benefited-republicans-contradicting-conventional-political-wisdom/	2024-11-17T07:04:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673a069e2d5c43.51697419.jpeg?w=900
Texas' officials signal border spending cut amid Trump return	(NewsNation) — With President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House, Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick have signaled openness to cutting the state’s spending on border security, the Texas Tribune reported. The former president has continuously hinted at several actions he plans to take when he returns to office, key among them being mass deportation. Abbott told reporters last week that Texas 'will have the opportunity to consider' repurposing the state money it has plowed into Operation Lone Star. Texas has allocated $11 billion to Operation Lone Star since it launched in 2021. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Abbott’s office had asked lawmakers to approve another $2.9 billion in the upcoming legislative session and now says OLS money could be used for things like property tax cuts or education, the Texas Tribune reports. 'President Trump will provide a more secure border than any president in the history of the United States of America,' Abbott said a day after the election. 'I’ve had private talks with the president, and he’s going to be stronger and better at securing the border than he was in his first term, which was very strong and effective.' Trump taps fracking CEO Chris Wright for Energy secretary Patrick, another top elected official in Texas, said that Trump’s victory could mean shifting spending priorities for the state. 'We had to do everything we could to protect our citizens,' Patrick said in an interview with WFAA-TV in Dallas. 'We’re going to be able to take a lot of that money now and put it back to our taxpayers, for roads, for water, for education, for health care, for all the things that we need that Joe Biden forced us to spend because he was letting millions of people cross the border.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/texas-border-spending-cut-trump-return/	2024-11-16T20:34:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670f11ae897139.98474181.jpeg?w=900
Ohio governor condemns reports of neo-Nazis marching in Columbus	COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and multiple Columbus city officials made their thoughts known Saturday after receiving earlier reports that a group of neo-Nazis marched in the Short North Arts District. NewsNation affiliate WCMH received multiple eyewitness accounts and video around 1:45 p.m. of the march, which showed at least eleven people wearing masks walking down the sidewalk. The group carried flags bearing swastikas near the intersection of 1st Avenue and North High Street, and also shouted obscenities into a megaphone. DeWine, who denounced the group’s actions, also confirmed more details of the incident. 'We will not tolerate hate in Ohio,' DeWine wrote. 'Neo-Nazis — their faces hidden behind red masks — roamed streets in Columbus today, carrying Nazi flags and spewing vile and racist speech against people of color and Jews. There were reports that they were also espousing white power sentiments.' Model charged in stabbing death in the Bronx City Council President Shannon Hardin rejected the group's 'pathetic efforts to promote fear and hate.' 'I’ve been in touch with law enforcement about Nazis marching through the city,' Hardin said. City Attorney Zach Klein also confirmed he was in contact with Columbus police regarding the march, and would 'continue to monitor this hate group's actions.' 'Displays of neo-Nazi hate have no home in Columbus,' Klein wrote. 'Take your flags and the masks you hide behind and go home and never come back.' Customers pour in after Whoopi Goldberg criticizes bakery NBC4 reached out to Columbus police and asked if any arrests were made as a result of the march. They have not said if anyone was detained as of 5:30 p.m. Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther also shared a statement regarding the march. 'We will not allow any of our neighbors to be intimidated, threated or harmed because of who they are, how they worship or whom they love,' Ginther said. 'We reject the cowardly display reported in the Short North earlier today.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/ohio-governor-condemns-reports-of-neo-nazis-marching-in-columbus/	2024-11-16T20:01:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Zach-Klein-and-Andrew-Ginther.jpg?w=900
Texas Republican to propose House committee targeting cartels	(NewsNation) — Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, plans to introduce legislation establishing a House select committee aimed at combating Mexican drug cartels when the Trump administration takes office in January. The proposed bill would authorize the use of military force specifically against the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels, though not against Mexico itself. The legislation would expand presidential powers to target cartel operations through intelligence, surveillance and cyber capabilities. 'The cartels are the greatest near-term threat. Full stop. President Trump agrees,' Crenshaw stated on social media. The Texas congressman, who leads the House Cartel Task Force, emphasized that a select committee would improve chances of moving anti-cartel legislation to the House floor. Homan outlines enforcement priorities as Trump’s ‘border czar’ The push for expanded powers comes after recent high-profile arrests of cartel leaders. U.S. authorities have apprehended Sinaloa Cartel co-founder Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, son of notorious kingpin El Chapo. Both men allegedly oversaw drug trafficking operations, including fentanyl distribution to the United States. 'I lead the House Cartel Task Force. We have solutions. But we don’t have any authority. A select committee will have a better chance of moving these bills to the House floor and to a president who will sign them,' Crenshaw wrote in a post on X. However, the initiative faces significant diplomatic hurdles. Mexican officials maintain their long-standing position against allowing U.S. military or special forces to operate on Mexican soil in anti-cartel operations. The lack of Mexican cooperation could complicate enforcement efforts if the legislation passes. Texas authorities on high alert for pre-Trump immigration ‘surge’ Crenshaw argues the measure would align House Republicans with Trump's aggressive anti-cartel agenda. The congressman cited concerns about cartel influence in Mexican politics and their expanding operational reach. The proposal comes amid a heightened focus on border security and drug trafficking as primary issues for the incoming administration.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/dan-crenshaw-committee-cartels/	2024-11-16T17:34:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/cartel.jpg?w=370
Gobsmacked' woman receives anti-gay text amid federal investigat...	The FBI is looking into a series of racist and offensive text messages and emails and encouraging any recipient to report details to the agency. The agency released a statement about the series of emails and texts Friday. 'The FBI is aware of the offensive and racist text messages sent to African American and Black communities around the country and is in contact with the Justice Department and other federal authorities on the matter. The reports are not identical and vary in their specific language, but many say the recipient has been selected to pick cotton on a plantation,' according to the statement. 'The text message recipients have now expanded to high school students, as well as both the Hispanic and LGBTQIA+ communities. Some recipients reported being told they were selected for deportation or to report to a re-education camp. The messages have also been reported as being received via e-mail communication.' Which of Biden’s executive orders does Trump plan to undo? The FBI had not received reports of violent acts stemming from the offensive messages and was evaluating all reported incidents, according to the statement. The department said it is working with the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and sharing information with law enforcement partners, and community, academia, and faith leaders. Diana Brier said she received an anti-gay text on Sunday. 'I'm not surprised that my information is publicly available and that it's known that I'm a member of the gay community,' she said. The text message referred to an executive order, and stated the recipient was required to check in at Nellis Airforce Air Force Base in Las Vegas on Jan. 20, which is Inauguration Day. 'Following check-in, you will be transported to an undisclosed location for LGB re-education camp for a period of no less than 8 weeks,' the text stated. 'Your new president, Donald J. Trump, looks forward to assisting you in becoming a mentally and emotionally stable member of society by eliminating lifestyles that have been detrimental to our American way of life through re-education.' 'At first, I was sort of gobsmacked,' Brier told the 8 News Now Investigators. The text also referred to Jesus Christ, an 'obligation to reproduce, birthing healthy white Christian children,' and language against 'transgenders.' There is also a threat included in the text that those unwilling to participate will be put away in a work camp for two years to life. Pentagon UFO office open to meeting with whistleblowers: Director 'Someone put a lot of thought and effort into this message. It was very detailed. It was very specific and very targeted towards the LGBT community,' Brier said. 'It was just something that, that I think I was just absolutely shocked and frankly repulsed and disgusted that this sort of rhetoric, this hateful speech is being propagated so quickly, so rapidly, and so, so for no reason.' The 8 News Now Investigators looked up the phone number and did not find results for a user or owner. It has a 301 area code, which covers Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. Brier said she was sharing her story to encourage others to come forward. 'This is something we need to really get eyes on and really raise awareness and let my community know it's safe to let somebody know that you're receiving this,' Brier told the 8 News Now Investigators. 'If you've been on the receiving end of a hateful targeted message, tell someone. We need to be in a see something, say something kind of era.' In addition to encouraging recipients of the messages to report them, the FBI encouraged the public to remain vigilant and report threats of violence or anything considered suspicious. The 8 News Now Investigators also reached out to the Nevada Attorney General's office. Spokesperson John Sadler said the office has not received any complaints regarding offensive messages targeting the LGBTQ community but did receive several complaints regarding similar messages with racist language. Sadler said anyone who has received one of the messages is encouraged to file a complaint. 'This type of hate has no place in Nevada,' the Attorney General's office said in a statement. 'True Nevadans defend their neighbor, regardless of race, sexual orientation, political beliefs, or gender expression. They do not spread messages of hate.'

Pete Hegseth to face 'a lot of questions': Retired Army Gen.	(NewsNation) — Retired four-star Army Gen. Wesley Clark believes much is to play out before, and during, President-elect Donald Trump's appointment of Pete Hegseth as the next secretary of defense. Clark joined 'Morning in America' to discuss Hegseth's elevation, which has been criticized by the media. In an interview on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' last week, Hegseth unequivocally said 'We should not have women in combat roles. 'It hasn’t made us more effective, it hasn’t made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated,' he added. Clark believes women are more than capable of serving in combat. He noted that Hegseth will have to answer questions regarding the topic and more. Pete Hegseth: What to know about Trump’s pick for Defense Secretary 'He's got to have a degree of open-mindedness,' Clark told NewsNation. 'Things look different when you're a captain looking up at a big organization, especially when you're in counterinsurgency operations, and when you're looking through the organization, you may find that your opinions are different, and if you hang on to them and try to enforce those prejudices, yeah, it could be some difficulties.' Hegseth was part of an investigation into a sexual assault in 2017, according to the Monterey Police Department. Few details about the case have been released. 'You know, if he's got these incidents behind him, does he represent the kind of ethics that we demand of our leaders in the military? And if he doesn't, that's a problem,' Clark added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/pete-hegseth-to-face-questions/	2024-11-16T14:17:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1167012751.jpg?w=900
Which of Biden's executive orders does Trump plan to undo?	(NewsNation) — After President Joe Biden leaves the White House in January, Trump could leverage the newly Republican-controlled Congress to take aim at several Biden executive orders he no longer wants in place. Which ones could be in the most jeopardy? Immigration In June, Biden announced a series of executive actions that would limit the flow of illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border. The changes allowed his administration to close the border between legal ports of entry, meaning border agents could turn away asylum-seekers if crossings surpassed a certain number per day. Trump tests GOP with controversial Cabinet picks Biden also implemented a policy that aimed to ease the path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants who are married to U.S. citizens, but a federal judge struck it down earlier this month. The program allowed undocumented spouses and stepchildren of U.S. citizens to apply for a green card without first having to leave the country. One of Trump's campaign issues is to 'carry out the largest deportation operation in American history,' according to his campaign website. He will likely push for a complete overhaul to implement immigration policies of his own. Police: Trump cabinet pick Hegseth involved in 2017 sexual assault investigation LGBTQ+ rights In 2022, Biden signed an executive order on 'Advancing Equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Individuals.' The policy made unlawful any discrimination against people in the LGBTQ community. It was consistent with another of his executive orders that year on addressing discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. Trump's platform has promoted banning transgender women from participating in women's sports and mandating teachers to report students who tell them they are transgender. What does the Department of Education do? Reproductive health care Roe v. Wade, which protected the federal right to abortion, was overturned in 2022. However, a majority of voters in seven states this election cycle passed ballot measures to protect the right to abortion in their respective state constitutions. During Trump's presidential campaign, he said he would not sign a federal abortion ban and instead supported states deciding their own policies. Yet Vice President-elect JD Vance said on the campaign trail that he would support a nation law limiting rights. Biden issued an order that ensured women's access to reproductive health care across state lines. Last month, he proposed a rule that would cover the cost of over-the-counter birth control. What are recess appointments, and can Donald Trump use them? Tax policies Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act removed the requirement for taxpayers to buy a health insurance plan, raised the standard deduction on tax returns, raised the child tax credit, suspended the personal exemption and more. Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act was passed to 'meet its climate goals and strengthen energy security, investing in America to create good-paying jobs, reducing energy and health care costs for families, and making the tax code fairer.' For taxpayers, the IRA provides a $7,500 credit to those who buy certain electric vehicles and home energy efficiency credits. Some Republicans have already said they plan to review the IRA.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/trump-executive-order-biden-plans/	2024-11-16T14:02:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2183892286_e9dad3.jpg?w=900
Trump taps fracking CEO Chris Wright for Energy secretary	(The Hill) — President-elect Trump on Saturday announced he would nominate Chris Wright, a donor and fracking company leader, to serve as his Energy secretary. 'Chris has been a leading technologist and entrepreneur in Energy. He has worked in Nuclear, Solar, Geothermal, and Oil and Gas,' Trump said in a statement announcing the pick. 'Most significantly, Chris was one of the pioneers who helped launch the American Shale Revolution that fueled American Energy Independence, and transformed the Global Energy Markets and Geopolitics.' Wright, a Trump donor, is the CEO of Liberty Energy, a fracking and oilfield services company. Wright will require Senate confirmation to lead the Department of Energy. In addition to that role, Trump said Wright would serve on a newly formed Council of National Energy being led by his nominee for Interior secretary, Doug Burgum. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? That council will focus on cutting regulations and increasing investments to ramp up oil and gas production. Trump has pledged to increase drilling upon taking office, even as the U.S. set records for oil production under the Biden administration, and he has signaled support for the fracking industry. The Energy Department oversees oil and gas production and exports, as well as the nation’s nuclear weapons program. Fracking, which is short for hydraulic fracturing, is an oil and gas extraction technique that kicked off the 'shale revolution' greatly boosting companies’ energy production potential and helping to make the U.S. the world’s top producer of oil and gas. The technology is controversial however, because of oil and gas’s contribution to climate change, as well as fracking’s links to earthquakes and childhood cancers. Trump ally and donor Harold Hamm, an energy executive, recently told publication Hart Energy that Wright was his top choice for energy secretary.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-taps-fracking-ceo-chris-wright-for-energy-secretary/	2024-11-16T14:01:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/trump_townhall_foxnews_101624-e1731794005406.jpg?w=800
Trump names attorney Will Scharf to key White House job	President-elect Trump on Saturday announced he was appointing Will Scharf, one of his personal attorneys, as White House staff secretary in his incoming administration. Scharf represented Trump as one of his lawyers during a hearing on presidential immunity before the Supreme Court and was a regular on television defending Trump amid his hush money trial in Manhattan. Staff secretary is a lower-profile position that carries significant importance within the White House. The staff secretary manages paper flow to the president and typically is in close proximity to the commander-in-chief. Rob Porter and Derek Lyons held the role during Trump’s first term. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'Will is a highly skilled attorney who will be a crucial part of my White House team,' Trump said in a statement. 'He has played a key role in defeating the Election Interference and Lawfare waged against me, including by winning the Historic Immunity Decision in the Supreme Court.' Scharf made an unsuccessful run for Missouri attorney general earlier this year, losing in a primary to incumbent Andrew Bailey. Trump endorsed both men in the primary. Scharf is the latest Trump attorney to get rewarded with an administration job. Trump earlier this week announced Todd Blanche, Emil Bove and John Sauer, all of whom represented him in the past year, were being tapped for senior roles in the Justice Department.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-will-scharf-lawyer/	2024-11-16T13:23:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/white-house_12152023_AP_AP23348831720567-1.jpg?w=900
California slated to rename places to remove Native American slur	The California Natural Resources Agency on Friday said that a racist term for a Native American woman will be removed from more than 30 locations in 15 counties, according to a press release issued Friday. The press release noted that Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) in 2022 signed a bill that bans the term 'squaw.' The agency was ordered to rename streets, bridges, public buildings, cemeteries and other places that use the slur. 'The 'sq_' is a word that denigrates Native American women and dehumanizes them,' California Assemblymember James Ramos (D), who spearheaded the bill, said in the release. The release stated the California Advisory Committee on Geographic Names is set to implement the new names, which were selected in consultation with the state's Native American tribes, by Jan. 1. First known case of mpox reported in Bay Area county The announcement comes on the heels of a ski resort in California changing its name after facing criticism over its original name, which used the slur. The new name, Palisades Tahoe, was announced in September after the resort acknowledged its former name was a racist and sexist slur following an internal investigation from August 2020 into the term and its etymology. The Interior Department had also announced in September that it removed the slur from federal place names after announcing a review in November. The department said the federal Board on Geographic Names has voted on replacement names for more than 600 places that included the term. The department also issued a full map of places where names were replaced.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/california-slated-to-rename-places-to-remove-native-american-slur/	2024-11-16T11:50:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/ca._squaw_valley_gettyimages-1212449999.jpg?w=900

Rick Scott (R) said he hopes Trump picks his daughter-in-law, echoing his colleagues Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Katie Britt (R-Ala.). Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R) has also publicly backed her. Appointing Lara Trump would ensure that the incoming president has a loyalist in the Senate, but it would most definitely come with criticism from Democrats. But DeSantis, who has been on a trade mission in Italy this week, will ultimately make the final call. The governor himself and a number of figures from his orbit have been floated as well, including his own chief of staff, as well as the state’s lieutenant governor and attorney general. 'There are a lot of good names in the mix for the Senate seat, Lara Trump being one of them,' Republican Party of Florida Chair Evan Power said. 'I think she would be a capable voice if that’s the direction the governor decided to go in.' Lara Trump herself expressed interest in the position during an interview with Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo on Thursday. 'If this is something I am asked to do, I would seriously consider it, but I have yet to hear from Gov. DeSantis. So we’ll see what happens,' Lara Trump said. Lara Trump has received praise from Republicans across the board for her role as Republican National Committee (RNC) co-chair, given the party’s massive wins last week. 'She worked incredibly hard at the RNC and helped deliver a huge win for Trump and Republicans across the country,' said one Florida House Republican. 'She is articulate and would be a reliable MAGA vote for Trump.' The speculation over the seat’s future comes as the state has become the epicenter of Republican Party politics. In addition to nominating Rubio, Trump also tapped Florida's Rep. Mike Waltz (R) for national security adviser and former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R) for attorney general. Additionally, Trump is carrying out his transition operation from his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Fla., with his incoming chief of staff and veteran Florida political operative Susie Wiles. The dynamic could put Trump and DeSantis, who put their Republican primary rivalry aside ahead of the general election, on a potential collision course. The two famously engaged in a highly personal presidential primary battle. Another added element is Wiles’s central role in Trump’s political world. Wiles worked on DeSantis’s successful 2018 gubernatorial campaign, but the two developed a rift. She responded to news of DeSantis dropping out of the GOP primary in a post on social platform X, writing 'Bye, bye.' To be clear, the president-elect has not publicly pushed for Lara Trump to fill the position. Meanwhile, DeSantis endorsed the then-Republican candidate after exiting the primary, part of an effort at burying the hatchet. In April, Trump and DeSantis met for three hours in South Florida in a meeting that was arranged by businessman Steve Witkoff. Witkoff was appointed to be Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East earlier this week. Trump touted the meeting as 'great' and confirmed he had the 'full and enthusiastic support' of DeSantis. The governor was given a speaking role at the Republican National Convention months later and has played a central role in pushing for an investigation into the second assassination attempt against Trump in Palm Beach. 'DeSantis endorsed Trump, so by all accounts the relationship between the two of them is fine,' said Justin Sayfie, a Florida-based strategist. 'He endorsed him a lot earlier than Nikki Haley did.' 'There’s much more significant dynamics at play when you’re appointing a U.S. senator,' he added. But others say the relationship between the two men is not what it was before DeSantis challenged Trump for the nomination last year. 'Sure,' said the Florida House Republican when asked if the idea of appointing Lara Trump offers a good opportunity to repair the relationship between the president-elect and the governor. 'But does anyone actually believe that those two will ever trust each other again? Cordial, but unlikely to ever be fully repaired.' If DeSantis decides to move in a different direction than Lara Trump, he still has a significant pool of applicants. Other names floated to replace Rubio include DeSantis’s chief of staff James Uthmeier, Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez and state Attorney General Ashley Moody. 'All great people,' the Florida House Republican said. 'Also heard there are some congressional names being batted about. This is the [governor’s] call and only he and Casey are going to be in the know,' they said, referring to Florida first lady Casey DeSantis. The timing of any appointment is unclear given questions surrounding the president-elect’s push to use recess appointments. And any convention confirmation process would take place after Trump is inaugurated next year. However, Rubio, unlike a number of Trump’s other appointments, will likely face an easier confirmation process. 'This is not imminent,' Sayfie said.

Nicholas Begich projected to win Alaska US House-at-large race	(NewsNation) — NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ has called the race for Alaska’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in favor of Nicholas Begich. See the results of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate races across the country here. Democratic incumbent Rep. Mary Peltola and Republican challenger Nick Begich were the two leading vote-getters coming out of the primary election, from which the top four candidates advanced to the November general election regardless of political party. Peltola was first elected to the House in 2022 via special election to replace longtime GOP Rep. Don Young, who died in March 2022. She was later elected to a full term that same year. Begich, a businessman who lost twice to Peltola in 2022, received an endorsement from former President Donald Trump. Two other candidates, John Wayne Howe of the Alaskan Independence Party and Democrat Eric Hafner, also appeared on Tuesday’s general election ballot due to Alaska’s ranked-choice general election system. See NewsNation’s election live blog with real-time analysis from our political experts and the latest race calls nationwide powered by Decision Desk HQ. Watch live results from the presidential election, important swing states and the balance of power in Congress. NewsNation will also be tracking your local state elections and impactful ballot initiatives around the country. Despite finishing outside of the top four in the August primary, Howe and Hafner appeared on the ballot after Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom and Republican Matthew Salisbury both withdrew from consideration for the seat. Hafner will appear on the ballot despite being incarcerated in the Otisville Federal Correctional Institution in New York. He’s serving a 20-year prison sentence for threatening public officials in New Jersey. An Anchorage Superior Court judge ruled that Hafner — who received less than 1% of the primary vote along with Howe — was eligible to remain on the ballot for Tuesday’s election. Heading into Tuesday’s election, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives were up for election. Republicans control the chamber with a narrow majority of 220 seats, while the Democrats occupy 212 with three vacancies.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/nicholas-begich-projected-to-win-alaska-us-house-at-large-race/	2024-11-16T11:07:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Thumb-Alaska-Nick-Begich.jpg?w=900
Kamala Harris raised $1 billion-plus in defeat. She's still sendi...	ATLANTA (AP) — Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party's prodigious fundraising operation raised more than $1 billion in her loss to Donald Trump, but the vice president is still pushing donors for more money after the election. Democrats are sending persistent appeals to Harris supporters without expressly asking them to cover any potential debts, enticing would-be donors instead with other matters: the Republican president-elect's picks for his upcoming administration and a handful of pending congressional contests where ballots are still being tallied. 'The Harris campaign certainly spent more than they raised and is now busy trying to fundraise,' said Adrian Hemond, a Democratic strategist from Michigan. He said he was been asked by the campaign after its loss to Trump to help with fundraising. The party is flooding Harris’ lucrative email donor list with near-daily appeals aimed at small-dollar donors — those whose contributions are measured in the hundreds of dollars or less. But Hemond said the postelection effort also includes individual calls to larger donors. One person familiar with the effort and the Democratic National Committee's finances said the Harris campaign's expected shortfall is a relatively small sum compared to the breadth of the campaign, which reported having $119 million cash on hand in mid-October before the Nov. 5 election. That person was not authorized to publicly discuss the campaign's finances and spoke on condition of anonymity. But the scramble now underscores the expense involved in a losing effort and the immediate challenges facing Democrats as they try to maintain a baseline political operation to counter the Trump administration and prepare for the 2026 midterm elections. It also calls into question how Democrats used their resources, including hosting events with musicians and other celebrities as well as running ads in a variety of nontraditional spaces such as Las Vegas' domed Sphere. Patrick Stauffer, chief financial officer for the Harris campaign, said in a statement that 'there were no outstanding debts or bills overdue' on Election Day and there 'will be no debt' listed for either the campaign or the DNC on their next financial disclosures, which are due to the Federal Election Commission in December. The person familiar with the campaign and DNC's finances said it was impossible to know just where Harris’ balance sheet stands currently. The campaign still is getting invoices from vendors for events and other services from near the end of the race. The campaign also has outstanding receipts; for example, from media organizations that must pay for their employees’ spots on Air Force Two as it traveled for the vice president’s campaign activities. Within hours of Trump picking Florida Republican Matt Gaetz for attorney general on Wednesday, Harris' supporters got an appeal for more money for 'the Harris Fight Fund,' citing the emerging Trump team and its agenda. Gaetz, who resigned his House seat after the announcement, 'will weaponize the Justice Department to protect themselves,' the email said. It said Democrats 'must stop them from executing Trump’s plans for revenge and retribution' and noted that 'even his Republican allies are shocked by this' Cabinet choice. Another appeal followed Friday in Harris' name. 'The light of America's promise will burn bright as long as we keep fighting,' the email said, adding that 'there are still a number of critical races across the country that are either too close to call or with the margin of recounts or certain legal challenges.' The emails do not mention Harris' campaign or its finances. The 'Harris Fight Fund' is a postelection label for the 'Harris Victory Fund,' which is the joint fundraising operation of Harris’ campaign, the DNC and state Democratic parties. Despite the language in the recent appeals, most rank-and-file donors' contributions would be routed to the national party, unless a donor took the time to contact DNC directly and have the money go directly to Harris or a state party. The fine print at the bottom of the solicitation explains that the first $41,300 from a person and first $15,000 from a political action committee would be allocated to the DNC. The next $3,300 from a person or $5,000 from a PAC would go to the Harris for President 'Recount Account.' Anything beyond that threshold, up to maximum contribution limits that can reach into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, would be spread across state parties. Officials at the DNC, which is set to undergo a leadership change early next year, indicated the party has no plans to cover any shortfall for Harris but could not explicitly rule out the party shifting any money to the campaign. ___ Cappelletti reported from Lansing, Michigan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-politics/ap-kamala-harris-raised-1-billion-plus-in-defeat-shes-still-sending-persistent-appeals-to-donors/	2024-11-16T08:09:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6738c448c4f191.09734884.jpeg?w=900
Vaccine makers' shares drop after Trump chooses RFK Jr. for HHS	(NewsNation) — Shares in some pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including those that manufacture vaccines, fell this week after President-elect Donald Trump announced he chose Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. On Friday, Moderna, which produced COVID-19 vaccines, shares fell almost 7% after hitting their lowest level since April 2020, Reuters reports. Since Trump was announced the winner of the 2024 election, shares of Moderna went down about 30%. Pfizer, which also makes vaccines saw a 4.5% decrease on Friday as well, after the Wall Street Journal reported they dropped by 2.5% on Thursday. As of noon EST Friday, NewsNation partner The Hill reported Eli Lilly fell 4.2% percent, Amgen 4.9 percent and Novo Nordisk more than 3.1 percent. Noravak,which Reuters said only has one product, the COVID-19 vaccine, lost almost 2% Friday, Reuters wrote. Kennedy has made false claims about vaccines and spread debunked conspiracy theories about them, such as the false idea that they can cause autism. However, he still insists that he's not anti-vaccine, but that he wants them to be vigorously tested. Doctors and researchers have proven that risks from disease are generally far greater than the risks from vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in protecting people from hospitalization and death in multiple studies and trials. An estimated 154 million lives have been saved in the past 50 years because of vaccines, according to the The World Health Organization. Stephen Ubl, president of The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement to The Hill Thursday that the trade association wants to 'work with the Trump administration to further strengthen our innovation ecosystem and improve health care for patients.' Speaking to NBC right after the election, Kennedy said he wouldn't 'take away anybody's vaccines' if given a role in a second Trump administration. 'If vaccines are working for somebody, I’m not going to take them away. People ought to have choice, and that choice ought to be informed by the best information,' he told the news outlet. 'So I’m going to make sure scientific safety studies and efficacy are out there, and people can make individual assessments about whether that product is going to be good for them.' The Senate still needs to confirm Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

UAP whistleblower says they need greater protections	(NewsNation) — An unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) whistleblower is calling for greater protection for fellow whistleblowers so that there can be greater transparency on the issue. Former Navy pilot Ryan Graves, the first active-duty pilot to come forward publicly about regular sightings of UAPs, joined 'Morning in America' on Saturday to discuss the latest Congressional hearing. Several whistleblowers testified at a House of Representatives committee this week regarding the existence of UAPs or UAP-related government programs. '[They made] another major step forward in this conversation,' Graves said of the whistleblowers. UFO House hearing witness: Pentagon ‘clearly covering something up’ 'It's no longer just the last three witnesses that gave testimony last year. It's a continuing story that I think is prime for further conversation with the new administration coming in.' For a greater breadth of information, more security is needed according to Graves. 'I think we need to look to the Department of Justice, Congress, and the executive branch, to be able to provide those protections, so that these people that are willing to come forward have the ability to do so without fear of repercussions,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/uap-whistleblower-greater-protections/	2024-11-16T07:56:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2184177259.jpg?w=900
Progressive fault lines emerge after Harris's loss	Progressives are at odds with one another over how to hone their message to voters after losing the White House again to President-elect Trump. There’s little disagreement that things need to change. Democrats’ most recent electoral strategy has been rendered ineffective, delivering Trump back to Washington with his party’s full control of Congress. But there’s no consensus about what the left should do next. One camp says the future is with economic populists, a group that puts financially disadvantaged voters of all demographics at the forefront. They believe that if Democrats prioritize class struggles over culture wars on the national stage, they will alienate fewer people and have a shot at winning again. The other group of progressives sees room for several top-tier priorities, with shifting orders of importance. They believe their wing can emphasize all aspects of identity politics, while also standing up for democracy, the rule of law and a brighter economic future all at once. 'The idea of economic populism being the actual patriotic lane is really good,' said Pete D’Alessandro, a former senior campaign aide to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) from Iowa. The distinction, some argue, is very subtle. The progressive wing is in agreement that class and identity are intersectional and there’s a deep belief that no group should be sacrificed at the expense of another. However, fault lines are emerging within progressive circles over the order and magnitude of each topic, foreshadowing a debate that’s likely to play out as Trump is sworn into office and as Democrats prepare to govern and reshape their party in the minority. Progressives who came of age in the Sanders wing have started conducting their own autopsies post-Nov. 5, hoping to get out ahead of various narratives that place economic realities low on the list of reasons why Vice President Harris lost to Trump. A grassroots group formed after Sanders’s first presidential campaign, Our Revolution, polled 12,000 progressives and found that 91 percent said 'the party has long neglected the multiracial working class.' 'The neglect of working people, the failure of the Democratic Party, the late switch from Biden to Harris and the campaign’s misguided focus on Cheney Republicans and celebrities' were key reasons for defeat, according to their poll of progressive respondents. Sanders has been on his own path after Harris’s campaign loss, trying to steer the conversation among progressives back to economic strife that played out in exit polls explaining part of Trump’s victory. He’s taken to legacy media, from cable news to The New York Times, to explain why a working-class agenda should be core to Democrats’ DNA. In recent discussions, the senator has emphasized that identity is inherently tied to struggles of different diverse working-class segments. 'You can say, ‘We are going to fight for a bigotry-free America' — that’s an ongoing struggle. We made progress, got a long way to go,' Sanders told the Times’s podcast 'The Daily' this week. 'But at the same time we can stand up for the working class in this country, which by the way, happens to be significantly African American and Latino and women, who are the bulk of the working class,' he stressed. 'It’s going forward in both directions. That is a winner.' The ascendant Sanders wing — which progressives agree is in the talent search phase for new, younger leadership — is also sharply critical of the notion that the composition of voters who supported Trump are inherently prejudiced. 'Some of the Democrat pundits say, ‘Well the problem is all of these Trump people are racist and they’re sexist and they’re homophobes.' Well no doubt that some of them are, and that’s true. Most of them are not,' Sanders said. 'They are, in large numbers, working class people, and we’ve got to speak to them in an economic perspective that is clear and straightforward.' Stevie O'Hanlon, communications director for the Sunrise Movement, said a key problem is that 'most Democrats have failed to present themselves as a credible voice for working people.' 'For the first time in years, the Democratic nominee lost the votes of households making less than $100,000 and won those making more than that. This is the cost of decades of policy and rhetoric from Democratic leadership that has allowed Trump claim to be the champion for working class and middle-class people,' O'Hanlon told The Hill. While Sanders is making that case outwardly, others on the left who share his world view are tailoring the message to fit their personal brands. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a staunch Sanders ally and member of the 'squad,' removed her pronouns from her bio on the social platform X this week. 'I think it’s a small thing,' said one source familiar with Ocasio-Cortez’s messaging. Still, the use of pronouns as personal descriptors has been widely adopted among Capitol Hill progressives, who see issues of gender identity as critical to the Democratic Party’s bid for inclusiveness. Liberals have created space for communities that have faced disproportionate discrimination, including the LGBTQ population, to strike a contrast with the GOP. While losses for Democrats were widespread, progressives added their first openly transgender member of Congress to their slate with Rep.-elect Sarah McBride (D-Del.), who offered a unique perspective in a press briefing with Congressional Progressive Caucus leadership. 'What I was hearing was that the American dream is increasingly unaffordable and inaccessible,' McBride said about running in Delaware’s only congressional district, which spans throughout major urban and suburban as well as rural areas and crosses into the Philadelphia media market. McBride said that being in that market exposed voters to Trump and Republicans’ attempt to divide over gender and identity, an approach that ultimately didn’t work. 'I didn’t run on my identity, but my identity was not a secret,' she said. The millennial congresswoman’s X bio simply reads: 'Delaware's Congresswoman-elect. Working to deliver for ALL Delawareans.' 'When people can't afford rent or food, they look for people to blame,' O’Hanlon said. 'Trump and far-right politicians have told people to blame immigrants or trans people or people of color. That was a core part of Trump's closing message: ‘Kamala Harris cares more about X group than you.’ Democrats need to stand up forcefully against these attacks and work overtime to show they are fighting to deliver for people.' As a growing group focuses on economic populism, others in the progressive movement are interested more immediately in issues that may arise under Trump. They see threats to the judicial branch on the horizon that some believe can be minimized before the president-elect reclaims the Oval Office. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who many college-educated and affluent liberals credit for emphasizing cultural issues, outlined her vision for Democrats rooted in bulletproofing democracy. 'While still in charge of the Senate and the White House, we must do all we can to safeguard our democracy,' Warren wrote in a new op-ed in Time. 'Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer must use every minute of the end-of-year legislative session to confirm federal judges and key regulators — none of whom can be removed by the next President.' The Warren-aligned Progressive Change Campaign Committee circulated a petition titled: 'Protect Democracy while you can,' asking for support for key legal structures. Warren is poised to take on an elevated role within the Senate minority, where she’s pledged to uplift 'working families' as the Banking Committee’s leading Democrat. While the Massachusetts senator also promotes an agenda for low-income Americans, her use of 'families' is another slight distinction from Sanders’s rhetoric about working class people, which does not necessarily specify a family unit. Some populist progressives say it’s an easy bridge between the two camps, which are already in agreement that the drivers of income inequality are mass concentration among the country’s wealthiest individuals and the dominance of corporate influence to keep the status quo intact. 'I’m not as worried about them,' D’Alessandro said about the two approaches. 'I’m more worried that the pendulum swings too far the other way and we get more of the Buttigieg, Ritchie Torres '70s Republican kind of politicians.' 'I think with the Warren folks it’s an easier discussion because it’s tactics. Nobody is saying don’t stand for those things,' he said. 'It’s more of what to lead with. If we fight each over tactics the corporate Dems like the guys I mentioned will just zip through the opening.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/progressive-fault-lines-emerge-after-harriss-loss/	2024-11-16T07:51:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Progressive-Battle_111624_AP_Brynn-Anderson.jpg?w=900
Iranian official met with Musk in a possible step to ease tension...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Iran successfully sought a meeting with Elon Musk, according to a U.S. official, one in a series of steps that appeared aimed at easing tensions with President-elect Donald Trump. Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani met with Musk — a Trump ally named this week to advise his administration on ways to cut the federal government — on Monday in New York, according to a U.S. official briefed on the meeting by a foreign colleague. The official said he had been informed that the discussion covered a variety of topics, most notably Iran’s nuclear program, its support for anti-Israel groups throughout the Middle East and prospects for improved relations with the United States. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a non-U.S. governmental meeting, said no immediate decisions were taken by either side. The official said the Iranians sought the meeting with Musk, the world's richest man, and that it did not take place at the Iranian mission to the U.N. The Trump transition team would not confirm or deny the meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times. 'The American people re-elected President Trump because they trust him to lead our country and restore peace through strength around the world. When he returns to the White House, he will take the necessary action to do just that,' Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump transition, said in a statement. However, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported on Saturday that Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei denied the country’s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani met with Musk in New York and expressed surprise at the extensive media coverage by American outlets on this matter. Iran's outreach comes as Trump has been announcing picks for key foreign policy posts — including Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Rep. Mike Waltz for national security adviser — who are expected to be tough on Iran. Intelligence officials have said Iran opposed Trump's second term, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Trump’s administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge. The Justice Department this month revealed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Trump, charging a man who said he had been tasked by an Iranian government official in September with planning Trump's assassination. The Iranian foreign ministry rejected the report. The plot was part of what federal officials have described as ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. government officials, including Trump, on U.S. soil. Last summer, for instance, the Justice Department charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in a murder-for-hire plot targeting American officials. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials, that Iran told the Biden administration in a written message delivered on Oct. 14 that it would not try to kill Trump. It was a response to an earlier warning from the U.S. that an attempt on Trump's life would be considered an act of war, the Journal reported. In response to inquiries about reports in the Journal and other outlets, Iran's U.N. mission said it does not issue public statements about 'official messages exchanged between the two countries.' 'The Islamic Republic of Iran has long declared its commitment to pursuing Martyr Soleimani’s assassination through legal and judicial avenues, while adhering fully to the recognized principles of international law,' its statement said. While Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, has repeatedly expressed his own disgust with Trump, Iran’s new reformist president has kept the door open to talks with Trump to seek relief from international sanctions. The Trump transition team did not respond to messages seeking comment on the Iranian mission's statement Friday. ___ Lederer reported from the United Nations. AP reporter Michelle L.

Israel's warfare in Gaza 'consistent with genocide:' UN special c...	(NewsNation) — Israeli actions in Gaza are 'consistent with the characteristics of genocide,' a United Nations Special Committee wrote in a report published this week that cited 'mass civilian casualties and life-threatening conditions intentionally imposed on Palestinians.' 'Since the beginning of the war, Israeli officials have publicly supported policies that strip Palestinians of the very necessities required to sustain life — food, water, and fuel,' the committee said. 'These statements along with the systematic and unlawful interference of humanitarian aid make clear Israel’s intent to instrumentalize life-saving supplies for political and military gains.' Israel's attacks on Gaza have killed over 43,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to The Associated Press. The war started after Hamas militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage, the AP wrote. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The report covers the period from October 2023 to July 2024. Israel's 'indiscriminate bombing campaign,' the UN special committee wrote in it, resulted in the widespread killing of civilians and 'mass destruction of civilian infrastructure, raising grave concerns of violations under international humanitarian law.' Attacks on civilians the report brought up include those on schools currently acting as shelters. Targeting systems enhanced with artificial intelligence that are being used by Israel to direct military operations have exacerbated the problem, the report states. Israeli soldiers, because they were relying on AI-assisted targeting, accelerated their decision-making and authorized strikes in a matter of seconds, the report said. Home-tracking of targets and night strikes also have disproportionately increased civilian casualties, report authors added. 'The committee is profoundly concerned about the indiscriminate loss of life apparently caused by these artificial intelligence-enhanced targeting systems, especially when combined with the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects,' the report said. In addition, Israel's destruction of vital water, sanitation and food systems have created a 'lethal mix of crises that will inflict severe harm on generations to come,' the committee said. A Palestinian youth mourns nine people killed in an Israeli strike in Bureij refugee camp, Gaza Strip, Friday, Nov. 15, 2024. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana) Earlier this week, the AP reported that the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians is at its lowest level of the 13-month war. Aid groups say the Israeli military has hindered or even blocked aid shipments to Gaza even amid food security experts warning that a famine may already be underway. The situation in the West Bank, which the committee said is an 'apartheid system,' has also dramatically worsened since Oct. 7, per the report. Report authors said there has been escalating violence there, including a dramatic rise in child casualties, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. The report is scheduled to be presented to the UN General Assembly on Monday. The United Nations’ top court in January demanded Israel try to contain death and damage as it continues its military offensive in Gaza, calling on the country to 'take all measures' to prevent a genocide of the Palestinians. South Africa brought the case accusing Israel of genocide to the International Court of Justice last year. Israel has denied allegations it is committing genocide.

Trump has promised 'concealed carry reciprocity.' What would it d...	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's promises to sign a nationwide 'concealed carry reciprocity' law could soon become reality, and gun violence prevention groups are concerned. Donald Trump Jr. posted a video of his father on Instagram with the caption: 'BOOM! My father just announced full concealed carry reciprocity! The 2nd Amendment will stay and remain protected.' In the 2023 video, the president-elect outlines his plans to end crime, saying: 'I will protect the right of self-defense everywhere it is under siege. And I will sign concealed carry reciprocity. Your Second Amendment does not end at the state line.' RFK Jr. ‘not open to rationality’: Infectious disease expert What is concealed carry reciprocity? Reciprocity would make it legal for gun owners with concealed carry permits to carry weapons across the nation, even in states that don't honor out-of-state concealed carry permits. It's important to note that current law does permit a law-abiding gun owner to transport guns through states, just not carry or conceal the weapons under their clothing in some states. Gun safety group Everytown for Gun Safety is concerned that a blanket rule would pose a threat to public safety. 'States set their own standards for having guns and for carrying concealed handguns in public. These standards vary dramatically state-by-state,' the group said. 'States also decide which out-of-staters may carry concealed handguns within their borders.' Resident of senior living facility shoots employees: Police The group pointed out how reciprocity would hinder law enforcement's ability to know who is lawfully carrying a gun, with Everytown’s senior vice president of government affairs Monisha Henley telling ABC News, 'Gutting state gun laws just makes it easier for dangerous people to carry a hidden weapon with no training, with no questions asked.' Trump's Republican-controlled House passed the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act during his first term in the White House, though it was later scrapped by the Democratic-controlled Senate. This time around, Republicans control all of Congress, and could likely pass a sweeping reciprocity law.

RFK will clean up FDA ‘corruption’: ‘The Food Babe’	(NewsNation) —Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will face tough questions from Congress about his controversial opinions regarding vaccines and drugs. But the work already done to make food safer by the nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services is what the country needs, according to one food industry observer. 'Half of the FDA budget is funded by industry. This is the type of corruption that he is going to remove when he is in Washington,' said influencer and author Vani Hari, aka 'The Food Babe.' She is especially focused on improving the quality of children’s breakfast cereals. 'There are 92 million boxes of Froot Loops sold every year in this country. 18% of American children have had at least one bowl of Froot Loops this week, because it’s served in schools,' Hari told NewsNation’s 'The Hill.' RFK Jr. ‘not open to rationality’: Infectious disease expert 'Our American companies cannot use ingredients that are banned and heavily regulated in other countries in the same exact products that they sell overseas. They’re using better, safer ingredients in Canada, in all of Europe, in Australia, in India. 'It’s extremely un-American to continue to do this. This is something that’s unethical and hypocritical and needs to stop immediately.' Hari also noted Kennedy’s lead in the longstanding battles with Monsanto over its weedkiller Roundup. The firm has paid more than $2 billion in compensatory and punitive damages to people who blamed the pesticide for their cancer diagnoses. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? When it comes to how Kennedy may shake up all of HHS, Peter Pitts, a former associate commissioner of the FDA, is all for it. Pitts told NewsNation's 'On Balance' that, though he doesn’t agree with many of Kennedy’s stands, 'but he is against the status quo. And I think giving the status quo a swift kick in the ass is a good thing. It keeps people on their toes. It’s creative destruction.' 'If we can get some positive outcomes where people are actually thinking about doing something different, that’s all to the good,' Pitts added. Trump tests GOP with controversial Cabinet picks Hari said that Kennedy is a strong advocate for regenerative agriculture, 'which would dramatically reduce the pesticides being used on our food that are decimating our American health at enormous rates.' Hari has written 'The Food Babe' blog for 13 years and has also written two books about food safety and ingredients. She has also been the target of criticism over the accuracy of some of her claims about the dangers of some food.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/rfk-fda-corruption-the-food-babe/	2024-11-15T18:34:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-151296637.jpg?w=900
Trump should share Prince Harry immigration docs: Heritage Founda...	(NewsNation) — The Heritage Foundation will be calling on President-elect Donald Trump's administration to release Prince Harry's immigration records, Nile Gardiner, director of the think tank's Margaret Thatcher Center, said on 'The Hill' Friday. 'Prince Harry is one of the most public figures in the world,' Gardiner said. 'I do hope that the new Trump presidency will release Prince Harry's immigration records for the American people to see for themselves — what is exactly in those records?' Since 2020, Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, have lived in California. After the couple left their full-time positions in the monarchy, Harry criticized and alleged racism and other mistreatments from the royal family. How will new Trump administration staff picks reshape the US? Harry, the son of King Charles III and fifth in line to the British throne, formally confirmed he was a U.S. resident in April. The Heritage Foundation sued the Department of Homeland Security to release Harry's immigration records. They say Harry lied on his visa documents regarding a history of drug use. Harry wrote in his memoir 'Spare' that he experimented with cocaine and psychedelic mushrooms. In September, the Heritage Foundation lost that lawsuit, with the Biden administration saying Harry is entitled to his privacy. Speaking to GB News ahead of the election, Trump said he would ensure 'appropriate action' is taken if Harry is found to have lied on his visa documentation about the use of illegal drugs.

RFK Jr. ‘not open to rationality’: Infectious disease expert	(NewsNation) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s potential leadership of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) presents clear risks to the country’s overall health, according to an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. 'I think this is an irresponsible pick,' said Dr. Amesh Adalja. 'RFK Jr. can only be seen as a destroyer of health — not somebody who is going to promote health.' Adalja pointed to Kennedy’s views on vaccines in particular while criticizing his resume in public health. 'If he can be someone who questions vaccines, who smears vaccines, who lies about vaccines — that tells you that he's really trying to go after one of humankind's greatest achievements. And to me, that's not somebody that you want to be in power to be able to wield the force of government,' Adalja said. Florida doctor accused of deadly hit-and-run of man in wheelchair Kennedy has pushed back against critics who say he has anti-vaccine views. During a June 23 town hall hosted by WMUR-TV, Kennedy said if he were president, he would mandate prelicensing safety trials for vaccines and 'allow parents to make of their minds about whether they want to use vaccines for their children.' For Adalja, however, that’s mostly empty rhetoric. 'Whatever (RFK Jr.) may say about other things, his cognitive approach to vaccines colors everything else. This is how this man thinks — or doesn't think,' he said. RFK Jr. became fixated on a belief that many vaccines were not safe about 15 years ago. He’s since emerged as one of the leading voices in the anti-vaccine movement, and his work has been described by public health experts and even members of his own family as misleading and dangerous. How will Trump’s tariffs impact everyday Americans? '(RFK Jr.) is not open to rationality,' Adalja said. 'This is a fixed idea in his mind, and I don't think that someone susceptible to that style of nonthinking is someone you want making decisions about any kind of anything regarding health.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/rfk-jr-irrational-says-infectious-disease-expert/	2024-11-15T15:25:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2170581633.jpg?w=900
Police: Trump cabinet pick Hegseth involved in 2017 sexual assaul...	MONTEREY, Calif. (KRON) -- Pete Hegseth, who Donald Trump recently tapped to lead the Department of Defense, was part of an investigation into sexual assault in 2017, the Monterey Police Department said. Police shared few details about the case but confirmed that an investigation. The alleged assault happened at 1 Old Golf Course Road, near the Del Monte Golf Course in Monterey between midnight and 7 a.m. on Oct. 8, 2017. It was reported to police four days later. Hegseth is not specifically named as an alleged assailant in the department's press release. Disgraced San Jose councilman Omar Torres denied bail There were no weapons or property involved, and the victim had contusions on their right thigh. Police did not reveal what came of the investigation. MPD said it is not releasing any more information because it is not required to under the California Public Records Act. Here are a few things to know about Hegseth: He called to 'clean house' at the Pentagon Hegseth complains in his latest book that 'woke' generals and the leaders of the elite service academies have left the military dangerously weak and 'effeminate' by promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. He says rank and file soldiers are undermined by 'feckless civilian leaders and foolish brass,' adding that 'the next commander in chief will need to clean house.' He mocks and misgenders transgender servicemembers and says the military is turning off recruits. 'America’s white sons and daughters are walking away, and who can blame them,' he writes in 'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.' Trump’s defense choice stuns the Pentagon and raises questions about the Fox News host’s experience Like Trump, he espouses a traditional view of masculinity, writing that men are innately drawn to fight, compete and prove their strength. Also like Trump, he is sharply critical of NATO allies that he says are not spending enough on their own defense, calling them 'self-righteous and impotent nations asking us to honor outdated and one-sided defense arrangements they no longer live up to.' He calls the political left, 'America’s domestic enemies' and 'America-wreckers.' Hegseth’s writing is contemptuous of the policies, laws and treaties that constrain warfighters on the battlefield, from restrictive rules of engagement to the Geneva Conventions, which he suggests are outdated against enemies who don’t abide by them. He has little patience for the moral questions surrounding war. Of the Americans who dropped nuclear bombs on Japan to end World War II, he writes, 'They won. Who cares.' He calls to rename Defense Department back to its original moniker, the War Department, and implement a 10-year ban on generals working for defense contractors after retiring from the military. He's gone viral — with an ax Hegseth went viral and was later sued after he struck a U.S. Army master sergeant in the arm with an errant ax throw during a 2015 'Fox &amp; Friends' segment. Video of the incident shows the ax flying over a target and hitting Jeffrey Prosperie, a drummer in West Point’s Hellcats field band, who had been invited to the show for the 240th anniversary of the Army’s founding. Records show that the lawsuit was discontinued in 2019, and Brandon Cotter, Prosperie's attorney, said in an email Wednesday that 'The parties have resolved the matter and will make no further comment.' Prosperie did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Fox News, which was also named in the lawsuit, called the incident 'unfortunate and completely unintentional,' said it immediately apologized to him and offered medical assistance, which he declined. Prosperie has since returned to the network to perform with the West Point band. He’s questioned the role of women in combat Hegseth has pushed for making the military more lethal and said that allowing women to serve in combat roles hurts that effort. 'Everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat, means casualties are worse,' Hegseth said during an interview last week on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' podcast to promote his new book. 'I’m straight up just saying that we should not have women in combat roles — it hasn’t made us more effective, hasn’t made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.' While he said that diversity in the military is a strength, Hegseth also said it was because minority and white men can perform similarly, something he said isn’t true for women. By opening combat slots to women, 'we’ve changed the standards in putting them there, which means you’ve changed the capability of that unit,' Hegseth said in the podcast interview. Since then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter opened all combat roles to women in 2016, women have successfully passed the military’s grueling tests to become Green Berets and Army Rangers, and the Naval Special Warfare’s test to serve as a combatant-craft crewman — the boat operators who transport Navy SEALs and conduct their own classified missions at sea. He’s defended service members accused of war crimes In 2019, Hegseth urged Trump to pardon U.S. service members who had been accused of war crimes. He advocated for the servicemen’s cases on his show and online, interviewing relatives on Fox News. He posted on social media that pardons from Trump 'would be amazing,' and added hashtags with the names of those accused to reporting mentioning his private lobbying of the then-president. The effort was successful, with Trump that year pardoning a former U.S. Army commando set to stand trial in the killing of a suspected Afghan bomb-maker, as well as a former Army lieutenant convicted of murder for ordering his men to fire upon three Afghans, killing two. Trump also ordered a promotion for a decorated Navy SEAL convicted of posing with a dead Islamic State captive in Iraq. He’s a military veteran Hegseth has served in the military, although he lacks senior military or national security experience. After graduating from Princeton University in 2003, Hegseth was commissioned as an infantry officer in the Army National Guard, serving overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as at Guantanamo Bay. He was formerly head of the Concerned Veterans for America, a group backed by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, and also unsuccessfully ran for the Senate in Minnesota in 2012. According to his Fox News bio, he has a master’s degree in public policy from Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. As Trump formulated his first Cabinet following his 2016 win, he reportedly considered Hegseth to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. He again considered Hegseth when Secretary David Shulkin faced criticism before his ouster in 2018. He's a Fox News personality and author Co-host of Fox News Channel's 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend,' Hegseth has been a contributor to the network for a decade. He developed a friendship with Trump through the president-elect's regular appearances on the show. In a statement, a Fox News spokesperson complimented Hegseth's military knowledge, saying his 'insights and analysis especially about the military resonated deeply with our viewers.' He's also written a number of books, several for the network's publishing imprint, including 'The War on Warriors.' In announcing Hegseth's nomination, Trump complimented that book, noting its 'nine weeks on the New York Times best-sellers list, including two weeks at NUMBER ONE.' He would come to the job during a series of global crises Hegseth would lead the Pentagon with burgeoning conflicts on multiple fronts, including Russia’s war in Ukraine, the ongoing attacks in the Middle East by Iranian proxies, the push for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah, and escalating worries about the growing alliance between Russia and North Korea. While the Pentagon is considered a key job in any administration, defense secretary was a tumultuous post during Trump’s first term. Five men held the job during Trump's four years. Trump’s relationship with his civilian and military leaders during those years was fraught with tension, confusion and frustration, as they struggled to temper or even simply interpret presidential tweets and pronouncements that blindsided them with abrupt policy decisions they weren’t prepared to explain or defend. Many of the generals who worked in his first administration — both on active duty and retired — have slammed him as unfit to serve in the Oval Office. He has condemned them in return.

Sylvester Stallone calls Trump 'the second George Washington'	(The Hill) — Sylvester Stallone says President-elect Trump is as legendary as America's first commander in chief, praising him as the 'second George Washington.' 'When George Washington defended this country, he had no idea that he was gonna change the world,' the 'Rocky' star said while speaking at the America First Policy Insititute gala on Thursday at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort home in Florida. 'Because without him, you could imagine what the world would look like,' Stallone told the crowd. 'Guess what? We got the second George Washington,' Stallone said to applause. The 78-year-old actor also compared Trump to the title character in his 1976 film.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) 'When I did 'Rocky,' remember the first image was a picture of Jesus,' Stallone said. In the opening scene of the movie, Stallone recalled, 'the image pans out from Jesus onto Rocky being hit.' 'And at that moment, he was a chosen person. And that's how I began the journey. Something was going to happen. This man was going to go through a metamorphosis and change lives — just like President Trump,' Stallone said. 'We're in the presence of a really mythical character. I love mythology. And this individual does not exist on this planet. Nobody in the world could've pulled off what he pulled off — so I'm in awe,' Stallone said as he introduced Trump at the right-wing think tank's gala event. Stallone has been spotted several times at Mar-a-Lago over the years. In 2018, Trump said he pardoned late heavyweight boxing great Jack Johnson at the urging of Stallone.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/sylvester-stallone-calls-trump-the-second-george-washington/	2024-11-15T15:14:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Trump-Stallone-e1731686113166.jpg?w=900
Trump's stance on China looms over Biden's meeting with Xi	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at an economic summit in Peru on Saturday. NewsNation Washington correspondent Kellie Meyer says the trip will likely be overshadowed by Donald Trump's hard-line stance on China. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called competition with China a top concern as President Biden hands the reins to President-elect Trump. He said the meeting takes place during a 'critical moment between the US and China' and will 'ensure that we don't run into any problems in the next two months in this transition of power.' Live: Jose Ibarra stands trial in Georgia student Laken Riley’s death Sullivan was opaque about how Biden and administration officials will answer expected questions from Xi and his aides about the incoming Trump administration. 'Transitions are uniquely consequential moments in geopolitics. They’re a time when competitors and adversaries can see possibly opportunity,' Sullivan said. 'And so part of what President Biden will communicate is that we need to maintain stability, clarity, predictability through this transition between the United States and China.' During his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump promised to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S., a move that would jolt the already tumultuous relationship between Beijing and Washington.

Why votes are still being counted after the election was called	(NewsNation) — More than a week after Election Day, officials are still making their way through votes in several races that remain uncalled. Voters are waiting in the lurch on House races in California and Alaska, and Pennsylvania's Senate race has gone into an automatic recount due to the slim margin between the contenders. Each state has its own rules on ballot counting, which affects the speed of tabulations and release of results, leading to different lag times. And even though most races have been called, these are unofficial results projected by media outlets and not certified by election officials. That process could take several more weeks depending on state deadlines. Track your state’s election results What’s the difference between called and certified races? The election results reported on election night are never the final, certified result. Instead, those are unofficial projections called by media outlets or local election officials after polls close. Decision Desk HQ, used by NewsNation, uses forecasting models to provide the probabilities of each candidate winning each state in the presidential election and accurate estimates of the probability of Republican and Democratic victories in individual House and Senate elections. Local election officials will also aggregate data and report unofficial results for state and federal offices. However, these numbers are not officially certified, which means they are not final. Election certification refers to the process of 'election officials attesting that the election results are a true and accurate accounting of all votes cast in a particular election,' according to the Elections Assistance Commission. Presidential appointments: How do they work? Certification of election results varies between states and sometimes even between local jurisdictions within a state depending on the contest being certified, according to the EAC. After every valid vote has been included in the final results and all required processes have been completed, the election results will be certified. States have different timelines for the certification. What races still haven’t been called? Three House races in California and the single House seat that represents Alaska are still pending calls by Decision Desk HQ. In California’s 45th Congressional District, Republican incumbent Michelle Steel leads Democratic challenger Derek Tran by just 236 votes out of more than 300,000 votes cast as of Friday afternoon, when 93% of votes were in. In Central California, Republican incumbent John Duarte holds a two-point lead over Democrat Adam Gray in the 13th District with 84% of votes in. The state’s 21st Congressional District is also yet to be called. Democratic incumbent Jim Costa is leading against Republican Michael Maher, a former FBI agent, by 3% — or 4,739 votes — according to Decision Desk HQ, with 78% of the vote in. California is known for taking its time to count ballots. The state allows mail ballots to be counted if they are received up to seven days after Election Day, and it also sends mail ballots to all registered, active voters, which means its volume of mail ballots is much higher than other states, reported The New York Times. What to know about Trump’s inauguration Mail-in ballots require additional verification steps where each must be opened individually, validated and processed. The state’s deadline to certify and submit election results is December 13. Alaska’s ranked-choice voting system has contributed to the time it takes to tabulate results, which may still be a few more days. Ranked-choice voting allows voters to rank candidates by preference on their ballots. As of Friday, Republican challenger Nick Begich has a three-point lead over Democratic incumbent Mary Peltola. Two other candidates account for about 5% of the vote in the race for Alaska’s single congressional district. Alaska’s deadline for certification is November 30th. The U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania between Democratic incumbent Bob Casey and Republican David McCormick is headed for a statewide recount, which will take days for results as the process starts over. NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ called the race in favor of McCormick. Who is Matt Gaetz, Trump’s pick for AG? As of Friday, Casey received 48.54% of the vote with 3,364,650 votes, and McCormick had 48.8% with 3,388,453, according to the Department of State. Under state law, a 0.5% margin between opponents triggers a statewide recount. A noon deadline passed Wednesday for Casey to waive his right to a statewide recount, and Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s top election official, Secretary of State Al Schmidt, a Republican, announced that preliminary results had triggered a legally required statewide recount. By law, counties must begin the recount no later than Nov. 20 and must finish by noon on Nov. 26. The recount process largely involves running paper ballots through high-speed scanners, a process that former election officials say might not change the outcome by more than a few hundred votes.

What does the Department of Education do?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump pledged to eliminate the Department of Education and to return school choice to the states. Under new proposed policies for his second term, Trump said he would remove 'the radicals who have infiltrated the federal Department of Education, and get to Congress reaffirm the president’s ability to remove recalcitrant employees from the job.' What is the Department of Education? The federal agency, established in 1979, primarily oversees funding for K-12 public schools while also supporting college students. The majority of Department of Education funding goes to student financial aid. Federal Student Aid, an office of the U.S. Department of Education, is the largest provider of student financial aid in the nation. FSA makes postsecondary education possible for more than 9.7 million students each year. How elementary schools use DOE Funding for elementary schools and secondary schools supports economically disadvantaged school systems, USA Facts reports. Title I provides funding for children from low-income families. This funding is allocated to state and local education agencies based on Census poverty estimates. Annual funding to state and local governments supports special education programs to meet the needs of children with disabilities at no cost to parents. School improvement programs, which amount to nearly $6 billion each year, award grants to schools for initiatives to improve educational outcomes. How higher education uses DOE The DOE administers two programs to support low-income students attend college: Pell Grants and the federal student loan program, USA Facts reports. Pell Grants provide assistance to college students based on their family’s ability to pay. The maximum amount for a student in the 2024-25 school year is $7,395. In a typical year, Pell Grant funding totals around $30 billion. The federal student loan program subsidizes students by offering more generous loan terms than they would receive in the private loan market, including income-driven repayment plans, scheduled debt forgiveness, lower interest rates, and deferred payments. Why does Trump want to abolish it? Trump has accused the department of 'indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material.' 'Our schools must be totally refocused to prepare our children to succeed in the world of work,' Trump said in a September 2023 address. In the early stages of the presidential race, Trump laid out 10 principles for his education policy plan. What will happen to Title IX and transgender athletes? Keeping men out of women's sports has been a pillar of Trump's and some other Republican lawmakers' education policies. Transgender athletes are in jeopardy of being able to play sports that are in line with their gender identity. For example, a transgender girl who wants to play on a girl's softball team would be required to play boys' baseball under Trump's policies, which violates Title IX under its current directions. Title IX is a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in educational settings that receive federal funding. Will student loans be forgiven under Trump? Student loan forgiveness was not a focus of the Trump campaign, unlike Biden's promise to cancel student loan repayment during his run for president. Trump largely has not addressed this topic, but it's possible that eliminating DOE may impact student loans. Will Trump fully dismantle the department? According to an American Enterprise Institute senior fellow, Trump is unlikely to fully dismantle the entire Department of Education. Michelle Dimino, the director of Third Way’s Education program, says the repercussions of dismantling the Department of Education would be far-reaching and very alarming.

(NewsNation) — Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters emailed school districts Thursday, demanding they show students a video of him promoting Christianity in schools and leading a prayer for President-elect Donald Trump. The email, obtained by Oklahoma NPR collaborator StateImpact, included a link to a video of Walters blaming 'woke teachers’ unions' for pushing 'a hatred for this country.' He also invited students to join him in prayer, nothing that they didn’t have to participate. American farmers brace for new tariffs under Trump 'I pray for our leaders to make the right decisions,' Walters said, according to StateImpact. 'I pray in particular for President Donald Trump and his team as they continue to bring about change to the country.' Walters went on tout his new Office of Religious Liberty and Patriotism. He created the office 'in line with one of President Trump’s top education priorities, ‘Freedom to Pray,’' Walters said in a news release. The Office of Religious Liberty and Patriotism will oversee 'the investigation of abuses to individual religious freedom or displays of patriotism,' according to the release. It’s unclear what specific actions that might entail. Walters also announced Thursday the purchase of more than 500 Bibles for use in advanced placement government classes.

Malcolm X's family alleges FBI, CIA played role in his death	(The Hill) -- The estate of Malcolm X is suing the federal government, accusing it of playing a role in the 1965 assassination of the civil rights leader. In a lawsuit filed against the Department of Justice (DOJ), the FBI, the CIA and the New York Police Department (NYPD), the estate alleges the agencies all played a significant role in the events leading to Malcolm X's slaying and then engaged in a decades-long cover-up of their involvement. The complaint says the DOJ, FBI, CIA and NYPD were aware of credible threats against Malcolm X’s life but failed to intervene. 'As a direct result of the Defendants' intentional, bad faith, willful, wanton, reckless, unreasonable and/or deliberately indifferent acts and omissions, Malcolm X was deprived of his federal constitutional rights, was robbed of his life and freedom, and sustained severe physical, emotional, and monetary damages, including conscious physical pain and suffering,' the lawsuit states. LAPD Chief says police aren’t called on enough Malcom X, who was born Malcolm Little, was gunned down at age 39 by three men on Feb. 21, 1965, at the Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan, where he was set to deliver a speech. His pregnant wife, Betty Shabazz, and four daughters were in the front row. He was shot 21 times in the attack. The suit, brought by Malcolm X's daughter Ilyasah Shabazz and other family members, calls for $100 million in restitution. It also demands answers to questions still surrounding the assassination. Though three men were initially convicted for the killing, two were exonerated in 2021. That same year, a letter written by a former NYPD officer alleged that the NYPD and FBI covered up details of the assassination. Longest-waiting child in Arkansas foster care system finds forever family The officer, Raymond Wood, wrote that he was ordered to coerce members of Malcolm X's security team to commit felonious federal crimes 'so that they could be arrested by the FBI and kept away from managing Malcolm X's door security on Feb. 21, 1965.' The lawsuit alleges that under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover, then-head of the FBI, the entities 'went beyond mere allegedly illegal surveillance of Malcolm X, actively conspiring to reduce his protection and leaving him vulnerable to an attack they knew was imminent.' 'For decades, these agencies viewed Black activism as a threat to national security, resulting in the unchecked targeting of prominent leaders, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Marcus Garvey,' the family said in a press release. 'This lawsuit seeks accountability for the systemic negligence and intentional actions that deprived Malcolm X's family and the world of his life and legacy.' In total, the lawsuit lists nine causes of action, including excessive use of force against Malcolm X, deliberate creation of danger, failure to protect and the denial of access to the courts for his family. The suit also charges the defendants with conspiracy, fraudulent concealment and wrongful death. 'This cover-up spanned decades, blocking the Shabazz family's access to the truth and their right to pursue justice,' said civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the family in the suit. 'We are making history by standing here to confront those wrongs and seeking accountability in the courts.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/malcolm-x-federal-government-assassination-lawsuit/	2024-11-15T10:58:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/malcolmx_05161963ap-e1731695895630.jpg?w=800
Steven Chueng to serve as White House communications director	Steven Cheung, who has served as a top press aide on the Trump campaign for the past two years, will join the incoming administration as White House communications director, President-elect Trump announced Friday. While Cheung was not a regular presence on television like some of Trump's other aides, he has worked with the former president in a communications role for years, having served on Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns. Cheung also did a stint as a top communications official for The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a league headed up by Trump ally Dana White. The campaign spokesman is known for his combative presence on social media. How will Trump’s tariffs impact everyday Americans? The president-elect has yet to name a press secretary, which is a more forward-facing role in the White House. Campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt is widely viewed as the front-runner for that position. Politico first reported on Cheung's expected role. Cheung becomes the latest long-time campaign aide to secure a role in Trump's White House. Trump announced earlier this week that Dan Scavino, Stephen Miller, James Blair and Taylor Budowich would all take senior staff roles in the White House after playing prominent roles on the campaign trail.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/steven-chueng-white-house-communications-director/	2024-11-15T10:43:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/CheungSteve_052824_APPhotoSethWenig.jpg?w=900
What are recess appointments, and can Donald Trump use them?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Senate to allow him to use recess appointments to install his picks for high-level positions as he has already tapped some controversial nominees. How do recess appointments work? Using recess appointments as part of the general nomination process for an incoming administration is a break with tradition. The idea behind recess appointments is one of necessity if a position is vacated while the Senate is not in session, allowing the president to fill a role rather than leaving it open. In a recess appointment, presidents can bypass the usual confirmation process and unilaterally appoint whoever they like to fill the role. Gaetz nomination to head Justice Dept. in serious trouble: GOP senators However, partisan fights have prompted presidents to use recess appointments to skirt efforts by the minority party to block nominees. President Bill Clinton made 139 recess appointments, President George W. Bush made 171, and President Barack Obama made 32 recess appointments. Neither Trump nor President Joe Biden made any recess appointments during their time in the White House. A 2004 Supreme Court ruling put some limits on recess appointments, ruling that the Senate must be recessed for 10 days before a president can make unilateral appointments. What is the usual confirmation process for nominees? For high-level positions, including Cabinet members, judges and ambassadors, nominees must be confirmed by the Senate. The process includes vetting nominees with background checks, questionnaires and financial disclosures. Nominees also appear in a hearing before Senate members, where they face grilling from both majority and minority members. Here’s how much White House Cabinet members make The nominee is voted on by the committee and then by the full Senate, where a simple majority is required to confirm the role. Senate confirmations can become a lengthy process, especially when it comes to controversial nominees, and there are roughly 1,200 roles that an incoming administration will need approval for. Why does Trump want to use recess appointments? Trump has stated that recess appointments are needed so roles can be filled immediately. However, it's also likely the demand has to do with the nature of some of his nominees who will face a tough battle winning over Democrats and even some Republicans. Trump announced Wednesday that he was nominating Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to lead the Department of Justice, a pick that shocked some considering Gaetz was under review by the House Ethics Committee and has faced allegations of illicit drug use, sex trafficking and sexual activity with a minor. He has denied all of those allegations. Trump has also nominated former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, something not all Republicans have been on board with. American farmers brace for new tariffs under Trump Fox News commentator Pete Hegseth has been nominated for secretary of defense. While Hegseth served in the National Guard, he would be the least experienced person to hold the post in all of history. Trump has also chosen former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has also stirred controversy for his anti-vaccine arguments and promotion of conspiracy theories around health that have no scientific backing. Will Trump be able to use recess appointments for his nominees? Recess appointments have never been used prior to seating a new Senate, and it's not clear that Trump would legally be able to do so. His next option would be allowing the new Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-seat majority, to be sworn in and then making appointments when the Senate goes into recess. Newly-elected Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has said he is open to the idea of recess appointments, but not all Republicans may be on board with the idea of circumventing one of the key checks and balances on the executive branch. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The House can also prohibit the Senate from recessing in order to prevent such appointments. Should the Senate refuse to recess or the House block the Senate from doing so, Trump could use his presidential power to adjourn Congress in order to make his appointments without facing any opposition from Democrats or within his own party over nominees that may be considered unqualified.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/what-are-recess-appointments-trump/	2024-11-15T10:41:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2183887390_476145.jpg?w=900
Speaker Johnson urges Ethics panel not to release Gaetz report	Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is urging the House Ethics Committee to not release its investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), as pressure mounts on the panel to publish its findings about the Florida Republican who resigned from Congress immediately after President-elect Trump selected him to be attorney general. 'I do not, no,' Johnson told CNN and Politico reporters when asked if the panel should release its findings about Gaetz. 'I think it’s a terrible breach of protocol and tradition and the spirit of the rule.' 'I’m going to strongly request the Ethics Committee not issue the report because that is not how we do things in the House and I think that would be a terrible precedent to set.' The Speaker said he planned to talk to House Ethics Committee Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.) about the matter. Johnson later warned that issuing the report after Gaetz resigned Wednesday — and thus removed himself from the committee's jurisdiction — would 'open a Pandora's box.' Johnson’s lobbying for Gaetz is a striking break from the hands-off way House leaders have typically approached issues before the Ethics Committee in the past — and from what Johnson had said about the issues just two days prior. Gaetz nomination to head Justice Dept. in serious trouble: GOP senators 'As far as the timing of a release report or something, I don't know. The Speaker of the House is not involved in that — can’t be involved in that,' Johnson said Wednesday, shortly after he announced Gaetz had resigned from the House. The Speaker argued Friday that the 'House's tradition' on the matter is the panel not issuing reports after members leave the chamber. That move, however, is not entirely unprecedented; in 1987, the panel released its report into former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House. Asked about that example, Johnson said it reflected precedent being broken. 'I believe it is very important to maintain the House's tradition of not issuing Ethics reports on people who are no longer members of Congress,' the Speaker said. 'I think it would open a Pandora's box. It's a very important rule that should be maintained — if it's been broken once or twice, it should not have been.' 'If someone is no longer a member of Congress, we're not in the business of investigating and publishing a report of people who are not in this institution,' he later added. Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has repeatedly said Gaetz forced a vote to oust him because he refused to get involved in the Ethics Committee investigation. Gaetz denied that, citing strategy and policy disagreements as why he led the charge to remove the Californian. The Ethics panel has for years been investigating Gaetz, exploring whether he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. He has vigorously denied allegations of wrongdoing, and the Department of Justice, which previously investigated whether he had sex with a 17-year-old, declined to charge him with a crime. That Ethics Committee investigation, however, came to an abrupt end Wednesday, when Gaetz resigned from the House shortly after Trump nominated him to serve as attorney general. The Ethics panel does not have jurisdiction over former members of Congress. Pressure mounts on Ethics Committee to release Gaetz report Johnson declined to say if he has spoken with Trump about his stance on the release of the report. 'I'm not talking to anybody about what I said to Trump,' the Speaker said. It remains unknown what path the panel will follow with its Gaetz report. The committee was initially scheduled to meet Friday to vote on whether to publish its findings — a vote that had been on the calendar before Wednesday's developments — but the huddle was later canceled, two sources told The Hill. It remains unclear when the panel will meet next. 'It’s very fluid,' one of the sources said. Johnson said Gaetz abruptly resigned his seat in order to quickly start the process of electing a replacement and lessen his departure's impacts of the slim majority. Lawmakers have speculated Gaetz resigned his seat in an attempt to keep the report from coming out. Senators in both parties have said they want to see the Ethics panel’s findings before voting on his confirmation to the Cabinet position.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/johnson-panel-not-release-gaetz-findings/	2024-11-15T10:29:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/johnsonmike_111224gn17_w.jpg?w=900
American farmers brace for new tariffs under Trump	(NewsNation) — With President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House, his promise of increased tariffs is becoming closer to reality. On the campaign trail, Trump proposed at least a 10% tariff on all goods entering the U.S., with a 60% tariff on all imports from China. While these costs are attached to goods being imported to the country, they will likely also affect exports. During Trump's first term, a trade war over tariffs with China impacted key American crops, like soybeans and corn. The USDA said the dispute led to more than $27 billion in U.S. agricultural losses. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Farmers Ted Winter and John Fleming joined NewsNation's 'Morning in America' on Friday to share how these tariffs could impact the farming community and agriculture in the U.S. Winter, a Minnesota farmer and member of the Minnesota Farmers Union Executive Committee, said the tariff would impact farmers by reducing the amount of export sales they have to China and other parts of the world. 'That will impact our income and our bottom line for our farmers and our families,' Winter said. 'We need all the income we can right now because we're still suffering from the tariffs that were put on in his last term. Fleming, a North Carolina farmer and director of the American Soybean Association, agreed with Winter, saying farmers could lose about 14 to 16 million metric tons of soy export to China if the retaliatory tariffs were reinstated. 'We can look for other markets but there are no buyers in the marketplace big enough to absorb that volume,' Fleming said. Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security During the first Trump administration, Fleming said the American Soybean Association did recognize that soybean farmers were impacted by the tariffs and issued some tariff offsets to farmers that were helpful. However, Fleming said they are hoping they don't have to go down that road again. President Joe Biden kept most of Trump's China tariffs in place and increased them on China's electric cars and solar panels. Last year, U.S. soybean exports to China fell to around 26.4 million metric tons, which was down from 36.1 million in 2016. Winter said they haven't been able to regain the market and have lost more in the process since. 'China went to other places to buy their needs,' Winter said. He continued, 'If we can be in good trade relationships with China, and they buy our products, that gives us a market to move our crops into the marketplace. We don't need to have tariffs put on or increased by anyone.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/american-farmers-tariffs-trump/	2024-11-15T07:07:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2166486728.jpg?w=900
Here's how much White House Cabinet members make	(NewsNation) — A president's Cabinet is an advisory group of people who make up the heads of the 15 executive departments. Each is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. President-elect Donald Trump has announced some of his Cabinet picks, which include Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as the proposed secretary of state and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as the proposed Homeland Security secretary. If they pass the Senate's confirmation, their Cabinet salaries will be more than their previous compensations. Presidential appointments: How do they work? Average salaries for Cabinet members As of January, the annual rate of pay for Level I Executive positions is $246,400, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. These positions include all 15 Cabinet roles. Departments with leaders in the Cabinet include: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, Veterans Affairs and the Attorney General. In comparison, the salary for most U.S. senators and representatives is $174,000, which has remained unchanged since 2009. Exceptions include speaker of the House, president pro tempore of the Senate and the majority and minority leaders of both chambers, all of which are paid more. What is the net worth of Trump’s administration picks? Federal employee benefits As a federal employee, Cabinet members receive a generous employee compensation package beyond salary. Although many of Trump's picks are financially established and well off already, they can receive student loan forgiveness as a person in public service. They get 11 paid holidays, child care and commuter subsidies, paid parental leave up to 12 weeks, health and life insurance, retirement benefits and more.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/white-house-cabinet-members-salary/	2024-11-15T06:23:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1237563607.jpg?w=900
What is the net worth of Trump's administration picks?	(NewsNation) — Donald Trump’s proposed advisers for his second presidential administration comprises politicians, a TV news host, tech entrepreneurs – and billionaires. A billionaire himself, Trump is the richest American president in history, accounting for inflation, with a $5.2 billion estimated net worth as of Nov. 15, which is down from $6.7 billion on Oct. 31. His proposed Department of Government Efficiency would be led by billionaire friend Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump's Cabinet during his first term was considered to be the wealthiest Cabinet in previous administrations. While the DOGE position is not technically a Cabinet post, Trump's picks so far include plenty of wealthy individuals. But first, the president-elect needs the Senate to confirm his appointments, or he needs to arrange to install them via a temporary process known as recess appointments. Here is the net worth of the wealthiest members of Trump's proposed second-term administration. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far?

Live: Murder trial underway in Laken Riley's death	(NewsNation) — Opening statements will begin Friday in the trial of the man prosecutors say killed 22-year-old Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. Jose Ibarra, a Venezuelan national, is charged with murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, battery and tampering with evidence. If convicted, he could face life in prison without the possibility of parole. Prosecutors have said they won’t pursue the death penalty. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial earlier this week and instead opted for a trial by judge. Cigarette leads to man’s arrest in 1981 Indiana cold case: Documents The case became fodder for the national debate over immigration, but Riley’s family has said they don’t want her death exploited as a political wedge. The trial is expected to continue into next week. What we know about the case The investigation into Riley’s death began when a friend reported her missing on Feb. 22 after she didn’t return home from a run. Soon after, officers discovered her body on the University of Georgia campus in a forested area. The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Ibarra in connection to Riley’s death the following day. Prosecutors allege he beat the Augusta University student with an object and dragged her body to a secluded area off the jogging path. Police say the attack was random. People gather to mourn the loss of Laken Riley during a vigil for the Augusta University College of Nursing student at the Tate Plaza on the University of Georgia campus in Athens, Ga., Monday, Feb. 26, 2024. Riley, a nursing student at Augusta University's Athens campus, was found dead Thursday, Feb. 22, after a roommate reported she didn't return from a morning run in a wooded area of the UGA campus near its intramural fields. Students also gathered to pay tribute to a UGA student who committed suicide last week. (Joshua L. Jones/Athens Banner-Herald via AP) Fueling immigration concerns Riley’s death sparked widespread outrage over immigration policies in the United States. Immigration and customs enforcement quickly revealed that Ibarra and his brother were living in the country without proper documentation. Politicians and media outlets used Riley’s death to bolster false claims of a 'migrant crime wave' — an alleged phenomenon that statistics don’t support. 'I’d rather her not be such a political, how you say — it started a storm in our country,' Riley’s father Jason Riley told NBC News in March. 'And it’s incited a lot of people.' Multiple studies, including one published by the National Academy of Sciences, suggest U.S. citizens are more than twice as likely to be arrested for violent crimes, compared to the arrest rate of people in the country illegally. 'It makes me angry,' Jason Riley said. 'I feel like they’re just using my daughter’s name for that. And she was much better than that, and she should be raised up for the person that she is. She was an angel.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jose-ibarra-trial-opening-statements-laken-riley/	2024-11-15T04:51:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/snapshot-2024-08-02T091926.846.jpg?w=900
Gaetz nomination to head Justice Dept. in serious trouble: GOP se...	(The Hill) - Republican senators are warning that Rep. Matt Gaetz’s (R-Fla.) nomination to serve President-elect Trump’s attorney general is in serious trouble, even though Republicans will control 53 seats next year. Gaetz will get a chance to make his case for why he should lead the Justice Department, but Republican senators warn he faces an 'uphill' path to confirmation. In addition, Republican senators are supporting the call made Thursday by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) for the House Ethics Committee to release the findings of its investigation of Gaetz for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) questions Attorney General Merrick Garland during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on the Department of Justice, June 4, 2024, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Jacquelyn Martin, Associated Press) Two moderate Republican senators, Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), have already expressed strong reservations about Gaetz’s nomination to serve as attorney general. Four Republicans would need to vote against Gaetz to sink his nomination, and GOP members warn he is likely to encounter resistance from other members of their conference. 'He’s got an uphill climb,' Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said when asked about Gaetz’s nomination. Other GOP sources say Gaetz’s nomination is in serious trouble. Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who has a number of friends in the Senate GOP conference, told Bloomberg Television that Gaetz won’t secure the 50 votes he needs to become attorney general. 'Look, Gaetz won’t get confirmed,' he told the outlet. 'Everybody knows that.' Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told The Hill that McCarthy’s dire prediction is probably spot on. 'I think he’s pretty right, actually,' he said. But he said Trump’s decision to nominate Gaetz may have a strategic value that his GOP colleagues in the Senate — and political pundits — can’t understand at the moment. 'Donald Trump is a savvy guy. You never know his motivations,' he said. Cramer said, 'Gaetz is more than capable of litigating the case for why the [Department of Justice] should be turned on its head' but he added that Gaetz 'just doesn’t have the moral authority' to shake up the department after being embroiled in a federal sex trafficking investigation. 'I’m glad I'm not on Judiciary, put it that way,' he said, alluding to what is expected to be a fierce fight on the committee level over Gaetz. Some Senate Republican sources are speculating that Trump’s choice of Gaetz to head the Justice Department may be intended to draw scrutiny and opposition away from other controversial nominations. Two other controversial nominees are Pete Hegseth, the Fox News anchor Trump picked to head the Pentagon, and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), Trump’s choice to serve as Director of National Intelligence despite her past statements defending Syrian President Bashar Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Another bombshell dropped on Senate Republicans on Thursday afternoon, when Trump said he would nominate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has raised concerns about the safety of vaccines as well as fluoride in tap water. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Thursday that his panel should have access to the findings of the House Ethics Committee investigation of Gaetz. Cornyn said if the House panel found evidence of a crime, 'it would certainly be relevant.' 'I’m not going to speculate what the report shows, but that would certainly be a concern,' he said of evidence of sexual misconduct or illicit drug use.' Murkowski said Wednesday that Gaetz doesn’t pass muster with her. 'I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for attorney general. We need to have a serious attorney general,' she said. Collins said she was 'shocked' to learn of Gaetz’s nomination. 'I'm sure that there will be many, many questions raised at Mr. Gaetz's hearing, if in fact the nomination goes forward,' she said. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who was elected to take over as Senate majority leader next year, told reporters Wednesday that he won’t know whether Gaetz has the votes for confirmation until the Senate formally receives and begins to review his nomination. 'I don't know until we start the process, and that's what we intend to do with him and all the other potential nominees,' he said. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Gaetz has 'got some work cut out for him' to get enough votes to pass the Senate. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said his Republican colleagues' jaws dropped 'to the floor' when they learned of Gaetz's nomination. 'They're going to be faced with a very difficult decision. Many of them know Matt Gaetz. They know the investigations he's been under,' he told CNN in an interview. 'Matt Gaetz is being nominated because he will be and is today a political agent of Donald Trump. The ramifications of this pick, this particular pick, are stunning.' Trump’s controversial choices to head the Department of Justice, the Pentagon, the nation’s intelligence agencies, and the Department of Health and Human Services are already causing tension among Senate Republicans. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a loyal Trump ally, warned fellow Republican senators that they should get in line and vote for Trump’s nominees or face political consequences. 'Republicans if you’re not on the team, get out of the way,' Tuberville told Fox Business Network in an interview. And he suggested that Republican colleagues who vote against Trump nominees would face primary challengers. 'If you want to get in the way, fine. But we’re gonna try to get you out of the Senate too if you try to do that,' he said. He urged his GOP colleagues to let Trump fill his Cabinet with the people he wants and not to interfere, even though the Constitution provides the Senate with the role of providing advice and consent on executive and judicial branch nominees. 'Everybody’s got an opinion up here, but at the end of the day President Trump was elected by an enormous vote and he deserves the team around him that he wants,' he argued. 'It’s not us to determine that.' Those statements didn’t sit well with Murkowski, who as a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, will vote on Kennedy’s nomination to head the Department of Health and Human Services. She said senators have a duty to carefully evaluate nominees and judge their fitness to serve in key positions and not let worries about potential political reverberations drive their decisions. 'There is a process; it’s not discretionary,' she said of the Senate’s duty to provide advice and consent on nominees. She disagreed with Tuberville’s claim that 'it’s not us to determine' whether Trump’s nominees should serve in his Cabinet. 'It’s in the Constitution. It says, ‘This is the role of the Senate,’' she said. 'So I feel pretty strongly as a member of the Senate that we have our job to do just as the president has his authorities. 'I will not accept that the United States Senate should just be an extension of the White House. We are our own separate but equal institution,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/gaetz-nomination-gop-senators-reaction/	2024-11-15T04:45:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24156540230773-e1731668801536.jpg?w=900
Trump meets with Argentina's president, the first foreign leader ...	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Donald Trump met Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago club with Argentine President Javier Milei, the first foreign leader to meet with the president-elect since his victory in last week's election. The meeting was confirmed by a person who insisted on anonymity to discuss an event that hadn't yet been announced publicly. The person said the meeting went well and said Milei also met with investors. A short time later, Milei, a self-described 'anarcho-capitalist' and frequent recipient of Trump praise, addressed the America First Policy Institute gala at Mar-a-Lago. He spoke briefly in English, then gave a longer speech in Spanish, pausing to allow an interpreter to translate, in which he slammed left-wing ideologies and saluted Elon Musk, the owner of X, saying his social media site is helping to 'save humanity.' Milei criticized a political ruling class that he said was responsible for a system that used unfair tax systems to force 'the redistribution of wealth at gunpoint.' The president of Argentina also congratulated Trump on his 'resounding victory' in the election, saying, 'Today the winds of freedom are blowing much stronger' and calling the victory 'proof positive that the forces of heaven are on our side.' Trump also spoke to the gala crowd, congratulating Milei 'for the job you've done for Argentina' and saying it was an 'honor' to have Argentina's president at his club. 'The job you've done is incredible. Make Argentina Great Again, you know, MAGA. He's a MAGA person,' Trump said to applause. 'And you know, he's doing that.' Shortly after Milei’s election in November 2023, Trump posted on social media, 'You will turn your country around and truly Make Argentina Great Again!' Milei first met Trump in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in the Washington area. He has openly declared his admiration for Trump and when he saw him, he rushed to him screaming 'president!' and gave him a close hug before they posed for pictures. The Argentine president is known for his eccentric personality and first made a name for himself by shouting against Argentina’s 'political caste' on television. The right-wing populist campaigned with a chainsaw as his prop to symbolize his plans to slash public spending and scrap government ministries. ___ Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-trump-meets-with-argentinas-president-the-first-foreign-leader-hes-met-with-since-election/	2024-11-14T19:56:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6736c682523ce9.82994179.jpeg?w=900
RFK Jr. ‘has no vaccine denialism’: Dr. Drew Pinsky	(NewsNation) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is fully vaccinated, so is his family, and he is not a vaccine denier, according to Dr. Drew Pinsky. 'He wants vaccines subjected to the same scientific rigor as all the other medication … that are allowed by the FDA to bring to market,' Pinsky said Thursday on NewsNation’s 'On Balance.' 'There may be real significant problems with these vaccines. At least we should be able to ask the question,' he added. RFK Jr. wants to battle processed foods Pinsky says that in numerous conversations with President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, he learned of Kennedy’s plans to hold the scientific community accountable on several levels. '’I know how to dig into corrupt organizations,’' Pinsky quoted Kennedy. 'He said, ‘The first thing I’m going to do is I’m going to bring in the major (medical) journal editors and publishers, and I’m going to threaten them with a RICO action if they don’t disclose everything about their relationships with big pharma and straighten that out.’' Pinsky also said Kennedy will have success in his 'Make America Healthy Again' effort. Presidential appointments: How do they work? 'It is increasingly clear that at least part of the problem is the way we eat and the food we get,' said Pinsky, who blames the same system that gave us decades of denial about the addictive properties of tobacco. 'The very same lobbyists, scientists and marketing professionals moved over tobacco to food. So, no surprise (that) yummy, addictive food, heavy lobbying, and we have unhealthy populations.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-has-no-vaccine-denialism-dr-drew-pinsky/	2024-11-14T19:05:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/RFK-HHS_090624_AP_Evan-Vucci_f7cd5d.jpg?w=900
Trump’s criminal defense attorneys offered DOJ roles	President-elect Trump announced Thursday he will nominate three of his personal criminal defense attorneys to serve in senior Justice Department roles.Todd Blanche will serve as deputy attorney general, and Emil Bove will serve as principal associate deputy attorney general, the department's No. 3 official, Trump announced in a statement.Both men serve as Trump’s trial attorneys in his New York hush money case, which culminated in the first criminal conviction of a former president this spring, and Trump’s two federal criminal prosecutions brought by special counsel Jack Smith.Trump also announced Thursday he will nominate D. John Sauer, an appellate attorney who argued Trump’s presidential immunity case at the Supreme Court earlier this year, as solicitor general. That position is the fourth highest-ranking Justice Department role and decides which cases the government will appeal, including representing the administration before the nation’s highest court.The three attorneys will presumably serve under former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), whom Trump announced as his attorney general nominee one day prior, sending political shock waves through Washington.Unlike Gaetz, both Blanche and Bove previously worked as prosecutors in the Southern District of New York.Trump in his announcement highlighted that experience, making no mention of the duo’s work as his defense attorneys.'Todd is an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department, fixing what has been a broken System of Justice for far too long,' Trump said of Blanche.The president-elect similarly wrote of Bove, 'Emil is a tough and strong attorney, who will be a crucial part of the Justice Department, rooting out corruption and crime.'Both entered private practice before ultimately joining Trump’s criminal defense team last year.Blanche started representing the former president when he was indicted in New York on 34 counts of falsifying business records in April 2023, his first set of criminal charges. To do so, Blanche was forced to leave his partnership at a prominent law firm, and he created his own firm instead.Bove began working for Blanche’s new firm later in the year as Smith moved to indict Trump in Washington, D.C., on accusations of conspiring to subvert the 2020 election results and in Florida on charges of mishandling classified documents.Sauer, Trump’s solicitor general nominee, served as Missouri’s solicitor general for six years. He worked under Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) during their stints as state attorney general. Sauer also clerked for Antonin Scalia, the late conservative Supreme Court justice. In announcing Sauer, Trump did highlight the attorney’s work on his criminal defense: 'Most recently, John was the lead counsel representing me in the Supreme Court in Trump v. United States, winning a Historic Victory on Presidential Immunity, which was key to defeating the unConstitutional campaign of Lawfare against me and the entire MAGA Movement,' Trump wrote.Sauer also represents Trump in his appeal of a jury’s verdict in a civil suit finding the former president liable for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s.

Trump tests GOP with controversial Cabinet picks	President-elect Trump is quickly testing the will of Senate Republicans, asking them to back controversial picks to his Cabinet such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), while at the same time demanding they give him more power by easing recess appointments. His dual calls essentially demand loyalty from GOP senators to not only back his most divisive appointments, but to give up their power in general over the vetting process. And he's doing it at a moment where his own political power is at a high point. 'There are going to be a few tests in there,' said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), who is leaving the Senate to become the Indiana governor in January. 'I think that, in general, the slate of nominees has been sending that message that we’re going to shake the system up.' Republicans could be forgiven for feeling a bit of whiplash, particularly as Trump has offered a series of nominations with one more controversial than the next. On Tuesday evening, he said he would nominate Fox News host Pete Hegseth to lead the Pentagon, a choice few saw coming given his relative lack of experience. The next day, Trump formally announced his pick of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to be secretary of State, a much less controversial pick that might have left some GOP senators breathing a sigh of relief. Before they could complete those sighs, Trump tapped former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who has raised eyebrows in the past for remarks that seemed to echo Russian state media reports, to lead the office of the director of national intelligence. Minutes later, he outdid himself, announcing that he’d nominate Gaetz, who had been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other issues, to be attorney general. The Florida congressman, who was instrumental in getting former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) tossed from his position, is controversial with members of both parties. Not to be outdone, Trump on Thursday picked antivaccine skeptic Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. This was also a surprise, as many observers thought that RFK Jr. would get a position in the Trump administration that did not require Senate confirmation. The choices are rankling segments of Senate Republicans to varying degrees. However, they are also a sign that Trump is hellbent on delivering on what he sees as a mandate from voters — and some members acknowledge that he is following through on that promise. 'The president campaigned on being a disruptor. We’re not going to do things the way they’ve been done, and I think what happened in [2017] with some of his nominees is I think he found himself in a position where he had to make decisions more quickly, he didn’t have time to think about it,' said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of GOP leadership. 'Now, I think he’s making some quick decisions, but he knows what he wants from these people.' 'If you’re asking me if I think it’s a power play, I don’t think so,' she continued. 'I think it’s following through with what he said he’s going to do.' Heaping pressure on these tests of will among Senate Republicans is Trump’s out-of-the-blue call for the ability to ram through nominees via recess appointments, which caught them off guard on Sunday. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) signaled he was open to the idea but did not fully commit to it, even though he has loudly backed a swift and expeditious confirmation process for the president-elect’s Cabinet choices. But a number of Republicans are also pouring cold water on that idea. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), an ardent Trump backer, told reporters that senators should be especially wary of the idea of a nominee without the support of 51 senators, as opposed to being subject to an effort to bring confirmations to a crawl by Democrats. Senators are also generally displeased by the idea of going around the advise and consent role for nominations — a major role that members take pride in, especially as legislative fights on bills that are not must-pass items become few and far between. But some lawmakers still see merit in what Trump’s attempting, especially on that Cabinet appointment side. 'Donald Trump is the world’s greatest trial balloon flier,' Cramer said, pointing to Trump’s first presidency when he allowed Cabinet members to disagree with one another in public. 'That always kind of baffled people. I’ve always kind of loved it because he was testing, and [the nominations] may be something like that.' 'For the most part, I think Donald Trump is serious as a heart attack about all of these people,' he added. 'He wants disruptors. He’s said that. He ran as a disruptor. He was elected as a disruptor.' But among the major questions remains how Thune will handle some of these nominations, especially if they follow in the manner Gaetz’s has in little more than 24 hours, as multiple Republicans have effectively already deemed his choice dead on arrival. Although Thune has promised a speedy push to confirm Trump's Cabinet nominees, his inaugural test as leader may already have him between a rock and a hard place as he looks to placate not only his members, but the incoming president, who helped deliver major wins for the party. 'Anytime you’re a leader … there’s going to be a learning experience for it but he’s going to handle it,' said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). 'He does a good job and he speaks it well. 'He’s going to have to work his way through this threading the needle, so to speak,' he said. 'We all know that.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tests-gop-with-controversial-cabinet-picks/	2024-11-14T16:37:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24298067176719-e1731365319908.jpg?w=900
Pressure mounts on Ethics Committee to release Gaetz report	Pressure is building on the House Ethics Committee to release its findings on former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who President-elect Trump said he will nominate to be attorney general. Such a move would be highly unusual, since the committee has no jurisdiction to investigate a former lawmaker, and does not typically release information on investigations after members depart the House. But with Gaetz nominated to be the country’s attorney general, Democrats and some Republicans want to see what the committee found. 'I think there should not be any limitation on the House Judiciary Committee’s investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,' Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that would assess Gaetz’s nomination, told reporters on Wednesday. Cornyn added that he 'absolutely' wanted to see the Ethics panel’s findings. Gaetz’s abrupt resignation from the House on Wednesday came as the release of the Ethics Committee’s report was imminent, a source familiar with the matter told The Hill. The panel was scheduled to meet on Friday to vote on whether or not to release the report about Gaetz, the source said, as first reported by Punchbowl News. While such a move is very rare, there is precedent for the committee releasing a report after a member resigned. In 1987, the committee released its report on former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House. Some senators are expecting that the upper chamber will get the report. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said that the report will 'clearly become part of the record, even if it’s a secure record,' as the Senate Judiciary Committee considers the Gaetz nomination. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in a statement on Thursday called on the House Ethics panel to preserve and share its findings on Gaetz. 'The sequence and timing of Mr. Gaetz’s resignation from the House raises serious questions about the contents of the House Ethics Committee report. We cannot allow this valuable information from a bipartisan investigation to be hidden from the American people,' Durbin said in the statement. The committee has already broken from its normal posture once in the 118th Congress, when it released a report on former Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) even though federal charges against him were unresolved. The Ethics Committee typically waits to take action until any ongoing legal proceedings have concluded, deferring to the Department of Justice. Santos later pleaded guilty to fraud charges. The committee is comprised of five Republicans and five Democrats, and makes most of its decisions on simple majority votes. If Republicans on the panel do want to release the report on Gaetz, they must weigh their distaste for Gaetz against the risk of Trump’s wrath. The committee was investigating whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. The congressional probe into Gaetz was opened in 2021, shortly after news reports emerged that the Department of Justice (DOJ) was reportedly investigating whether he had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl. Gaetz has vigorously denied allegations of wrongdoing, and the DOJ declined to charge him with a crime. In September, Gaetz said he would 'no longer voluntarily participate' in the 'nosy' Ethics probe and would not comply with its subpoena, accusing the panel of asking him for a list of adult women with whom he’d had sex over the last seven years. John Clune, a lawyer reportedly representing the 17-year-old victim at the center of the most serious allegations, also called on the Ethics Committee to release its findings. 'Mr. Gaetz's likely nomination as Attorney General is a perverse development in a truly dark series of events. We would support the House Ethics Committee immediately releasing their report. She was a high school student and there were witnesses,' Clune said in a post on the social platform X. Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.) said the general opinion among GOP members is that Gaetz resigned in order to try to block the report from coming out. 'It’s very suspicious that he all of a sudden resigned because other members who are being nominated for posts have not resigned,' Murphy said. 'I do know that if he continues to persist with this appointment, it will all come out.' Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), when announcing Gaetz’s resignation on Wednesday evening, said that Gaetz resigned in order to kick-start the process of replacing him, to lessen the impact of a slim House GOP majority. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) has also been selected to be national security adviser, and Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) was tapped to be U.N. ambassador. Some of Gaetz’s former GOP House colleagues, though, think the report should come out, or at least be shared with the Senate. 'Senators have an important decision to make, and I think they should have all the information necessary to make the right decisions,' said Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), adding if there is nothing that says the Ethics Committee can’t release the report, 'it would be a good thing for them to know the facts.' 'If he’s gonna continue through that process [of becoming attorney general], I think the Ethics report needs to come out,' Rep. John Duarte (R-Calif.) said. 'I just don’t want an attorney general who’s compromised with that kind of a report hanging out there that could be used to compromise him.' But the idea of the Ethics Committee releasing findings on a nonmember is getting some pushback in the House, where members could be personally affected by that kind of precedent. House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) said the Ethics Committee should not release its findings. 'He’s no longer a member. It’s moot to me,' Rogers said. Asked if he think Gaetz is qualified to be attorney general, he said: 'It's the president's decision.' House Ethics Committee Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.) declined to comment on any potential Ethics Committee meetings, or to comment further on the Gaetz situation. 'With the confidentiality that surrounds the committee, I can't publicly address any potential meeting dates the committee might be taking up,' Guest told The Hill. 'I can’t give you any information of any significance.' House GOP leaders are staying out of the debate. 'I don't know if there is a report that's coming out. Obviously, there are reports about it, but the Ethics Committee doesn't share that information with the rest of the membership,' House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) told The Hill.

Former primary challenger to Gaetz considering bid for now-open s...	Aaron Dimmock, who unsuccessfully challenged former Rep. Matt Gaetz in this year’s Republican primary for Florida’s 1st Congressional District, is considering a run for the seat again now that President-elect Trump’s shock pick for attorney general has resigned. 'I am taking a serious look at it and have already received numerous calls from constituents imploring me to run,' Dimmock told The Hill. Dimmock, a retired naval officer and leadership consultant, was boosted in his challenge to Gaetz by a PAC with reported ties to former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Gaetz led the charge to oust McCarthy from the Speakership. But Gaetz, who had ample support from his hard-line conservative allies in Congress, handily defeated Dimmock with 72.6 percent support to 27.4 percent. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) announced Wednesday that Gaetz had resigned in order to kick-start the process of filling the seat to lessen the complications of a razor-thin majority. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said on the social platform X on Thursday that he instructed the secretary of state to 'immediately' start the process of formulating a schedule for the special election. But Gaetz’s resignation has also put focus on a House Ethics Committee probe that has stretched for years. The Ethics panel has no jurisdiction to investigate a former member, but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling for it to release its findings on Gaetz. The committee was probing whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. The congressional probe into Gaetz was opened in 2021, shortly after news reports emerged that the Department of Justice (DOJ) was reportedly investigating whether he had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl. Gaetz has vigorously denied allegations of wrongdoing, and the DOJ declined to charge him with a crime. In September, Gaetz said he would 'no longer voluntarily participate' in the probe. The ethics probe was an issue in the August primary, as well. The PAC with connections to McCarthy allies spent more $3 million in the race — including on brutal ads that highlight the misconduct allegations against Gaetz. 'Your daughters are never safe with the real Matt Gaetz,' a narrator says in one ad from the Florida Patriots PAC, referencing the allegations against him. In an interview with The Hill in August, Dimmock said that voters in Florida 'are embarrassed by our incumbents. They can’t understand the chaos that he caused to the Republican Party over the last several years.' Gaetz, meanwhile, attacked Dimmock for working for the state of Missouri and called him a 'BLM supporting DEI instructor.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/former-primary-challenger-to-gaetz-considering-bid-for-now-open-seat/	2024-11-14T16:36:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Gaetz-Dimmock-AP.jpg?w=900
3 House races still too close to call: Decision Desk HQ	(NewsNation) — Decision Desk HQ is watching two House races in California and the single House seat that represents Alaska. As of Thursday afternoon, Republican incumbent Michelle Steel leads Democratic challenger Derek Tran by just 349 votes out of more than 300,000 votes cast in California’s 45th Congressional District, which is in Orange County. 'We still think there are tens of thousands of votes to be counted,' said Scott Tranter of Decision Desk HQ. He expects a lot of those votes to be counted Thursday night, but it still could be a couple of days before DDHQ can call that race. Dave McCormick projected to win Pennsylvania US Senate seat In Central California, Republican incumbent John Duarte holds a two-point lead over Democrat Adam Gray in the 13th District. Tranter expects to make a call on that race in a day or so. Alaska is a very different story, according to Tranter. 'This is ranked-choice voting. They count it a little differently. So, we get to do some very fancy math and wait for the state of Alaska to tell us exactly where this is going to shake out,' he said. As of Thursday, Republican challenger Nick Begich has a three-point lead over Democratic incumbent Mary Peltola. Two other candidates account for about 5% of the vote in the race for Alaska’s single congressional district.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/three-house-races-not-called/	2024-11-14T16:21:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/tranter.png?w=449
House Republicans probe allegations of FEMA discrimination in Flo...	(The Hill) — House Republicans are probing allegations of discrimination by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in Florida following the termination of an agency employee who advised a survivor assistance team to skip homes with President-elect Trump campaign signs. The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is calling on FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to brief the panel by Dec. 2 about the incident, what the agency is doing to help unaided families and what policies are being implemented to 'prevent future political discrimination.' ‘Carolina Blue’ song raises money for Helene victims in North Carolina The committee also asked FEMA to provide documents and information about the agency’s effort to reach and aid homes that were skipped because of the incident, along with other communications. 'As the FEMA Administrator, you are responsible for leading the Nation’s efforts to prepare for, protect against, and respond to natural disasters. The Committee is troubled that under your leadership FEMA failed to aid all Americans, regardless of party affiliation,' Republican House lawmakers said in a letter that was shared with The Hill. FEMA confirmed last week that it terminated an employee, Marni Washington, for telling workers canvassing in Lake Placid, Fla., in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton to 'avoid homes advertising Trump.' More than 20 homes were bypassed. 'This is a clear violation of FEMA’s core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation. This was reprehensible,' Criswell said last week regarding the employee’s termination. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) shortly after said that state officials were kicking off a probe into the incident. Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the chair of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, said Saturday that he sent a letter to Criswell demanding that she testify in front of the committee regarding FEMA’s response to hurricanes Helene and Milton and the recent incident regarding the terminated employee. 'Your inability to ensure that FEMA provide relief to all Americans affected by disasters, free of discrimination, represents a substantial failure of leadership,' GOP House lawmakers said in the letter. All 35 Republican members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee signed on to it. Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., is the chair of the committee. 'The blatant disregard of President-elect Trump supporters directly contradicts FEMA’s core mission and values,' Graves said in a press release. Close Thank you for signing up!

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Florida’s attorney general, Ashley Moody (R), sued the FEMA chief on Wednesday, saying that she 'agreed' to deny aid to Trump supporters in Florida alongside Washington. 'While the facts will continue to come out over the weeks and months, it is already clear that Defendant Washington conspired with senior FEMA officials, as well as those carrying out her orders, to violate the civil rights of Florida citizens,' the complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Pierce, Fla., said. Washington said in a Monday interview with journalist Roland S. Martin that the federal agency was scapegoating her and that homes were skipped because of 'verbal abuse' by those Trump supporters. 'They all alleged that these actions were made on my own recognizance and that it was from my own political advances. However, if you look at the record, there is what we call a community trend,' Washington said. 'And unfortunately, it just so happened that the political hostility that was encountered by my team — and I was on two different teams during this deployment — they just so happened to have the Trump campaign signage.' The committee said it is 'continuing its oversight of FEMA’s ability to adequately respond to natural disasters.' 'It is clear that, under the Biden-Harris Administration, FEMA has been ill-prepared to provide assistance and relief to many Americans in need,' the GOP lawmakers said in the letter.

Trump rewards legal defense team, picks lawyer Todd Blanche as No...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Todd Blanche, an attorney who led the legal team that defended the Republican at his hush money criminal trial, to serve as the second-highest ranking Justice Department official. A former federal prosecutor, Blanche has been a key figure on Trump's defense team both in the New York case that ended in a conviction in May, and the federal cases brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith. 'Todd is an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department, fixing what has been a broken System of Justice for far too long,' Trump said in a statement Thursday announcing his pick. If confirmed as deputy attorney general by the Republican-led Senate, Blanche would manage the day-to-day operations of the sprawling Justice Department, which Trump has vowed to radically overhaul. The announcement comes a day after the president-elect said he had chosen as attorney general Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, a Trump loyalist who once faced a Justice Department sex trafficking investigation that ended in no charges. Trump is appointing two other members of his defense team to high-ranking Justice Department positions. Emil Bove, an ex-federal prosecutor, will be the principal associate deputy attorney general and will serve as acting deputy attorney general until Blanche is confirmed, Trump said. Trump tabbed D. John Sauer, who successfully argued his presidential immunity case before the U.S. Supreme Court, to be the solicitor general, representing his administration before the high court. Sauer, who was previously Missouri’s solicitor general, was a Rhodes scholar and served as a Supreme Court clerk for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Blanche represented Trump in both the 2020 election interference case in Washington and the Florida case accusing the former president of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. In both cases, the defense team successfully mounted a legal strategy focused heavily on delaying the cases until after the election. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon last summer threw out the classified documents case, finding that Smith’s appointment by Attorney General Merrick Garland was illegal. The 2020 election case was stalled amid wrangling over Trump's claims of immunity from prosecution that went up to the Supreme Court. The Justice Department is now evaluating how to wind down the two prosecutions to comply with longstanding department policy that says sitting presidents cannot be indicted or prosecuted while in office. Blanche has also represented Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and succeeded in getting a mortgage fraud case against him dismissed in the same New York court where Trump was convicted. Blanche argued that case, brought by the Manhattan district attorney's office, was too similar to one that landed Manafort in federal prison and therefore amounted to double jeopardy. Blanche joined Trump’s defense team just prior to his April 2023 arraignment in the New York case. Trump was accused in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex. Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts, though his attorneys are urging the judge to overturn the guilty verdict. Blanche left the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft LLP, where he was a partner in the White Collar Defense and Investigations practice, to form his own practice. Blanche told colleagues at Cadwalader that he was resigning to represent Trump. He'd joined the firm in September 2017. In an email announcing his departure, he wrote: 'I have been asked to represent Trump in the recently charged DA case, and after much thought/consideration, I have decided it is the best thing for me to do and an opportunity I should not pass up.' Originally from the Denver suburbs, Blanche graduated from American University in Washington, D.C., and Brooklyn Law School. Blanche first joined the Justice Department as a paralegal in the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, while in law school. He was later a law clerk for federal judges and then a prosecutor in the same U.S. attorney’s office, which covers Manhattan, the Bronx, and northern suburbs, for about eight years and spent two years as co-chief of the office’s violent crimes unit. Bove, a star lacrosse player in college, joined Blanche’s law firm last year and handled many key arguments in Trump’s legal cases, including pending efforts to get the hush money conviction thrown out in light of his election victory. As a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, Bove was involved in multiple high-profile prosecutions, including a drug-trafficking case against the former Honduran president’s brother, a man who set off a pressure cooker device in Manhattan and a man who sent dozens of mail bombs to prominent targets across the country. ___ Sisak reported from New York.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-trump-rewards-legal-defense-team-picks-lawyer-todd-blanche-as-no-2-justice-official/	2024-11-14T15:41:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/67368aaedabd99.66971773.jpeg?w=900
Texas authorities on high alert for pre-Trump immigration ‘surge’	(NewsNation) — The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) is preparing for surges at the southern border as people try to enter the U.S. before Donald Trump returns to the White House. 'We still want to maintain a proactive posture. We don’t want to be reactive,' said Lieutenant Chris Olivarez of the Texas DPS. 'We want to be ready for anything, for any possible surge.' To that end, Texas DPS officers have been conducting 'mass migration response' exercises along the border. Among the strategies is stationing DPS officers in their vehicles, with flashing red and blue lights, every few hundred feet along the border. Agents rescue 4-year-old girl, baby from smugglers near border DPS said that strategy is in place in the Rio Grande Valley, Del Rio and El Paso Border Patrol sectors. Officers have also placed loudspeakers along the border that play back a short, pointed message that can be heard across the Rio Grande in Mexico. 'Atención, atención. Es ilegal cruzar aquí. Hay una cerca aquí. Este no es un puerto de entrada,' the message says in Spanish, translated as, 'Attention, attention. It is illegal to cross here. There is fencing here. This is not a port of entry.' While the Texas DPS and the U.S. Border Patrol prepare for a possible surge ahead of President Trump’s January 20 inauguration, it’s possible the surge might not happen thanks to Biden administration policies that have significantly slowed illegal crossings. 'We’ve seen a significant decrease in illegal border crossings, especially in Texas, where numbers are down nearly 86%,' said Olivarez. Homan outlines enforcement priorities as Trump’s ‘border czar’ The Biden policies include denying the right to asylum to anyone who arrives at the border away from an official port of entry and without an asylum appointment with Customs and Border Protection. But while individuals may think twice about illegally entering the U.S., the cartels are working harder than ever to smuggle people across. Two recent examples of the cartels’ desperation were the discovery of someone hiding inside the gas tank of a semi-tractor and people 'welded' into the body of a pickup truck. Border Patrol agents had to pry the sides of the truck to reveal people inside the body.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/texas-pre-trump-immigration-surge/	2024-11-14T15:30:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Horse-patrol-wall-arrest-101024.jpg?w=900
Trump taps ex-SEC chair to serve as US attorney for Southern Dist...	President-elect Trump announced Thursday that Jay Clayton, former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), will serve as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. The role is considered by legal experts to be one of the most powerful positions in the Justice Department. 'Jay is a highly respected business leader, counsel, and public servant,' Trump wrote on Truth Social, listing off Clayton's educational and professional accolades. 'Jay is going to be a strong Fighter for the Truth as we, Make America Great Again,' he said. A registered independent, Clayton began leading the SEC in May 2017, following his nomination to the post in January when Trump first took office. He was a partner at the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in New York, specializing in major corporate mergers and acquisitions, before his time at the SEC and returned to the firm in 2021. His SEC tenure focused largely on forging bipartisan compromises around financial market structure updates, establishing the commission's approach to cryptocurrency-related investment offerings and cementing rules for investment advisers. The former SEC chair was previously nominated to serve as the top prosecutor in the federal district covering Manhattan, after Trump fired then-U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in 2020 for refusing to step aside. But he faced stark opposition from Democrats, who portrayed the selection as an attempt by Trump to politicize the Justice Department, since that office had investigated his ex-fixer, Michael Cohen, and Rudy Giuliani, his then-personal attorney. 'Forty seven years ago, Elliott Richardson had the courage to say no to a gross abuse of presidential power. Jay Clayton has a similar choice today: He can allow himself to be used in the brazen Trump-Barr scheme to interfere in investigations by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, or he can stand up to this corruption, withdraw his name from consideration, and save his own reputation from overnight ruin,' then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement at the time. The scandal effectively snuffed out his chance at confirmation. Clayton announced soon after the 2020 election that he would step down from the SEC at the end of the year and was succeeded by Gary Gensler, President Biden's appointment to the role. The Southern District of New York at one point also investigated Trump himself but did not bring charges over hush money payments that would later underpin his future conviction in New York state court.

Proud Boys leader convicted of sedition intends to ask Trump for ...	A leader of the Proud Boys convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack intends to seek a pardon from President-elect Trump. Joe Biggs, a Florida Proud Boy and onetime correspondent for the far-right website 'InfoWars,' is serving a 17-year prison term after a jury last year found him guilty of sedition and other serious felonies. His lawyer, Norm Pattis, has written a letter requesting clemency from the former and future president but said it has not yet been sent. 'Congratulations on your re-election to the Presidency. You are now in a position to close a painful chapter in American history involving the prosecution and imprisonment of protesters at the Capitol on January 6, 2021,' Pattis wrote in the letter. 'On behalf of Joseph Biggs, I am urging you to do so by granting Mr. Biggs' request for a complete pardon for his actions on that day.' Biggs joins the ranks of other Jan. 6 rioters who have signaled they plan to seek pardons, including former Proud Boys national Chair Enrique Tarrio and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes. Both Tarrio and Rhodes were convicted of sedition and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to 'rapidly review' the cases of Jan. 6 defendants and 'sign their pardons on Day 1' if reelected. It remains to be seen whether he will pardon or commute the sentences of all 1,500-plus rioters charged for participating in the mob, some of them or none of them at all. In the letter, Pattis described Trump as 'no stranger to prosecutions warped by partisan vendetta' and claimed that Biggs is a victim of the same misuse of the law. He pointed to the Civil War, suggesting that wiping Biggs’s slate clean would 'close the book' on Jan. 6 and allow the nation to move forward, as it did when clemency was granted to thousands of Confederate supporters. 'These are divisive times,' Pattis wrote. 'The divisions were acute in 2020, when millions believed the election was stolen and turned out to make sure electoral integrity was preserved. Suspicions and bitterness about the election lingers to this day. 'A pardon of Mr. Biggs will help close that wound and inspires confidence in the future,' he said. Prosecutors said at trial that Biggs led members of the Proud Boys to the Capitol on Jan. 6 and spoke with the first rioter to breach police barricades just minutes before he acted. They requested a sentence of 33 years in prison. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who oversaw the Proud Boys sedition case, declined to hand down that lengthy of a sentence but did apply a terrorism enhancement to Biggs’s sentencing guidelines. Pattis represented Biggs at trial and has remained his attorney on appeal. He said in the letter that his office also intends to request pardons or amnesty for two of Biggs's co-defendants in that case, Proud Boys members Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/proud-boys-leader-convicted-of-sedition-intends-to-ask-trump-for-pardon/	2024-11-14T14:54:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/ProudBoys_081719_AP_Noah-Berger.jpg?w=900
What did Pete Hegseth say about women in combat roles?	(NewsNation) — Comments on women in the military made by President-elect Donald Trump's choice to head the Department of Defense, Pete Hegseth, have garnered criticism. 'I’m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles,' Hegseth said during an appearance on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' last week. 'It hasn’t made us more effective, it hasn’t made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.' While Hegseth said he’s served with women, and they’ve been 'great,' institutions shouldn’t have to 'incentivize' that in positions where 'men are more capable.' Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? While Hegseth cited a 2015 U.S. Marines Corps report that stated all-male units were faster and more lethal than mixed-gender units, critics said it was biased. Newsweek notes that the lobby group Women in International Security called its research methods 'fundamentally flawed.' After it came out, then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said he had problems with the study: namely, that 'it started out with a fairly large component of the men thinking this is not a good idea.' 'When you start out with that mindset, you're almost presupposing the outcome,' Mabus said. The 44-year-old current co-host of Fox News Channel’s 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend' served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and did tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois took Hegseth to task over his remarks on women in combat roles. 'We can't go to war today without our women military members,' Duckworth said. Duckworth is an Iraq war veteran and Purple Heart recipient who was one of the first women to fly combat missions as a U.S. Army helicopter pilot. When her helicopter was hit by a grenade in 2004, she lost both legs and some mobility in her right arm, NewsNation partner The Hill reports. If she could talk to Hegseth, 'I would ask him, 'Where do you think I lost my legs, in a bar fight?'' Duckworth said in an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday. Homan outlines enforcement priorities as Trump’s ‘border czar’ Women in the military Overall, the number of service numbers dropped 2.7% in 2022, though the percentage of women in the military inched upward, according to a Department of Defense report from 2023. Women, the Defense Department says, make up about 17.5% of the active-duty force. The number of uniformed women serving in special operations, including those in operator and support roles ― has increased significantly in recent years. The overall proportion of women in special operations forces went up from 7.9% in 2016 to 12% in 2023. More than 2 million of the veterans currently living in the United States are women. They are the fastest growing group of veterans as well — by 2040, women are projected to make up 18% of all veterans, the Department of Veterans Affairs said. NewsNation's The Hill and The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/pete-hegseth-women-combat-roles/	2024-11-14T14:14:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1127594195.jpg?w=900
Rudy Giuliani’s lawyers quit over ‘fundamental disagreement’	(The Hill) -- Rudy Giuliani’s attorneys on Wednesday asked to quit representing the former New York City mayor as he battles with two Georgia election workers over their efforts to collect a $146 million defamation judgment. Attorneys Kenneth Caruso and David Labkowski cited New York’s rules that allow attorneys to withdraw when they have a 'fundamental disagreement' with their client. A guide to key figures in Donald Trump’s orbit They also cited provisions allowing withdrawal when a client insists upon presenting a claim that can’t be supported in good faith and when a client 'fails to cooperate in the representation.' The attorneys had asked to seal their written requests entirely. U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman declined to do so but did agree to redact certain details, saying it involved privileged information. Liman still must accept their ask to withdraw. The Hill has reached out to Giuliani’s spokesperson for comment. The twist comes as Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, whom Giuliani defamed by spreading a baseless conspiracy that they were involved in mass election fraud in 2020, appear on the cusp of collecting their massive jury award after months of litigation. Liman had ordered Giuliani to turn over most of his assets — including his New York City apartment, Mercedes-Benz, luxury watches and signed Yankees memorabilia — to the mother-daughter duo, but their attorneys have repeatedly accused the former mayor of stonewalling the efforts. Giuliani was ordered to hand over his car by Nov. 11 after he was spotted driving it to a Florida polling place on Election Day. Rudy Giuliani bankruptcy shows Trump ally drowning in debt Though the election workers won a $146 million judgment, they are expected to collect far less. Giuliani, in previous court filings, estimated his assets amounted to roughly $10 million. The judge has yet to resolve whether the former mayor must hand over his Florida condo, or whether he can exempt it by declaring it his homestead. If that is denied, Giuliani has alternatively asked to keep his New York apartment. 'Wilkie Farr Law Firm is filled with a distorted left wing hate and vitriol,' Giuliani wrote Tuesday on X, referring to the election workers’ attorneys. 'Judge Liman doesn't seem to know the exemptions. They have seized all my money which wasn't much. I need legal representation against these evil people. I can't buy food.' Defiant Giuliani says he’s a victim of ‘political persecution’ On Wednesday, the election workers made a new ask to gain access to a storage facility Giuliani uses in New York, raising 'serious concerns' about property he purportedly moved out of the apartment. One of the election workers’ attorneys, John Langford, last week also asked to withdraw from the case, saying he was changing jobs.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/rudy-giuliani-lawyers-quit/	2024-11-14T13:57:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP23349813711702-e1731589557475.jpg?w=800
Musk's bold plans for 'Department of Government Efficiency' face ...	Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are set to take the reins of the brand new 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) under President-elect Trump — a panel with bold ambitions of slashing government costs and restructuring federal agencies. However, it is likely to face numerous roadblocks in its efforts to effect change in the next administration given its seemingly advisory role, experts said. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'There's the executive branch that might be in their way. The Congress might be in their way. The Constitution is a bit of an obstacle,' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of American Action Forum. 'Other than that, clear sailing,' he told The Hill. Trump announced Tuesday evening that the pair of tech entrepreneurs would jointly lead the panel, which will 'provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.' It will partner with the White House and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to 'drive large scale structural reform,' with its work set to conclude by July 4, 2026, Trump said in a statement. 'It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time. Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of ‘DOGE’ for a very long time,' the president-elect said. The panel created an official government account Wednesday on the social platform X — which is owned by Musk — writing, 'Working overtime to ensure your tax dollars will be spent wisely!' Examples of government waste, inefficiency as Trump announces DOGE Musk and Trump previously discussed the prospect of a cost-cutting panel during the campaign, as the tech titan threw his support behind the Republican candidate with multimillion-dollar contributions to his own pro-Trump super PAC and amplifications of Trump’s message on X. While DOGE is now set to become a reality, experts are skeptical about what it will actually be able to accomplish. 'It sounds to me like an outside commission that will give OMB recommendations on what they think should be done to improve government efficiency, and as such its powers are entirely advisory,' Holtz-Eakin said. 'They don't have any authority to do anything other than say, ‘We think this will be good,’' he said. 'Evidently, Mr. Musk has a lot of free time, and if he wants to waste it, that's fine.' Government commissions such as DOGE typically have a large staff and budget and produce a formal report with recommendations for Congress, explained Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution. What is Elon Musk’s plan for DOGE? 'But since this was not created by Congress, we don't know what its authority is and what status it has,' West said. 'I mean, any American can make suggestions on ways to cut the government budget, but the question — is anybody going to pay serious attention to this?' Any major budget cuts would have to be approved by Congress, he noted. While Republicans have secured control of both chambers, they are likely to have a narrow majority in the House and lack a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. 'It's not clear that any draconian measure is going to see the light of day,' West said. However, Musk’s close relationship with Trump is notable. The billionaire spent election night with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago, watching the results roll in, and Trump thanked the Tesla and SpaceX CEO in his victory speech, calling him a 'star.' In the days since the election, Musk has reportedly remained at Mar-a-Lago with the president-elect, sitting in on meetings and phone calls, including with world leaders, according to The New York Times. Trump aide Corey Lewandowski reacts to Elon Musk’s DOGE logo Musk also joined Trump at a Wednesday meeting with House Republicans on Capitol Hill, where the president-elect joked, 'Elon won’t go home. I can’t get rid of him. Until I don’t like him.' Trump met with Biden later that day, marking his first visit to the Oval Office since leaving the presidency in 2021. 'Musk has the ear of the president, so people have to take it seriously just for that reason,' West told The Hill. Republicans will also have two shots at passing major legislation through budget reconciliation, which could give Trump and the GOP several chances to enact sweeping changes without having to clear a Senate filibuster. Musk had said much of DOGE's focus will be on what the panel considers egregious misuses of federal spending. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know!' Musk posted Tuesday night. 'We will also have a leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars. This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining,' Musk continued. Shortly after the idea was floated earlier this year, ethics experts and former government officials raised concerns that Musk holding dual roles in his tech companies and the Trump administration could be a conflict of interest. Tesla and SpaceX have contracts worth billions of dollars with the same federal agencies he is likely to work with in his advisory role. This could risk the panel’s objectivity and fairness, some experts argued. Even the panel's name, DOGE, is a nod to a cryptocurrency often touted by Musk: Dogecoin, which riffs off a mid-2010's meme featuring a Shiba Inu. Dogecoin's value was up more than 90 percent over the past week as of Wednesday afternoon. 'Handing the keys of government to those looking to profit from our government is extremely dangerous and a massive conflict of interest,' Zach Moller, economic program director at Third Way, a center-left think tank, said in a statement. 'The idea of a Musk-run government efficiency commission is a farce and will lead to more waste, fraud, and rampant abuse of political power.' 'Americans would be right to suspect that Musk would use his newfound government powers to throw a lifeline to his teetering companies,' he added. Experts further pointed to Musk’s controversies and legal challenges at his other companies and how this could be a hint of his leadership style. 'Musk not only knows nothing about government efficiency and regulation, his own businesses have regularly run afoul of the very rules he will be in position to attack in his new 'czar' position,' Lisa Gilbert, the co-president of progressive consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen, wrote Wednesday. Musk has faced a number of legal challenges over his companies' conduct, including their hiring and termination practices, pay structure and product performance. While calling Musk a 'brilliant entrepreneur and a tech visionary,' Moller said the billionaire’s companies are 'deeply troubled and mismanaged.' Musk has not fully laid out whether his roles in his other companies will change with the new position, though he reposted one user who said Tesla investors should be 'reassured' by the group’s position outside of government and that it is limited to 21 months. 'Typically, with a government-created commission, members have to respect conflict of interest rules, and it's not clear how Musk is going to comply with that, or what the requirements would be, since this seems to be an ad hoc operation,' West noted. 'It allows him to avoid ethics rules, but it doesn't put him in a strong position to change public policy,' he added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musks-doge-roadblocks/	2024-11-14T13:54:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24318569633728-e1731532012925.jpg?w=900
Schools, colleges brace for 'a much more threatening political en...	(The Hill) - Educators and university leaders are on the edge of their seats as President-elect Trump makes his return to office with an aggressive posture toward K-12 and higher education. Trump has threatened multiple times to take away funding from schools if they do not align with his views on subjects such as diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and transgender rights. Texas school choice plans could indicate what to expect under Trump That threat has left institutions holding their breath as they try to prepare with how to deal the hostility they could face for the next four years. Trump has threatened to 'tax endowments, impose budget reconciliation, and fine institutions 'up to the entire amount of their endowment' if they are perceived as having promoted 'wokeism,' [which] risks eroding academic freedom, institutional autonomy and the democratic purposes of higher education,' said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities. The federal government gives billions of dollars to colleges and universities every year, from grants to research funding to direct financial aid. K-12 institutions receive a majority of their funding from state and local governments, while 7.6 percent came from the federal government in the 2019-2020 school year. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at PPG Paints Arena, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, in Pittsburgh, Pa. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Congress controls the power of the purse, and next year's GOP-majority House and Senate could be amenable to Trump's goals. 'The first Trump administration failed in its repeated attempts to cut student aid and academic research, largely because they were disorganized and poorly educated in the workings of the federal government, but also because of resistance from Congress,' said John Aubrey Douglass, senior research fellow and research professor at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley. Who will be the next — and potentially last — secretary of Education? 'Trump and his allies are exploring various ways to withhold federal funding for individual colleges and universities that would be punitive. That could come from a much expanded concept of presidential authority and bills passed by Congress, like the Stop Woke Act already passed by the House,' Douglass added. At a campaign rally this cycle, Trump went after multiple elite universities he accused of stifling free speech on campus, saying he would 'take away their endowments, and they will pay us billions and billions of dollars for the terror they have unleashed into our once-great country.' The president-elect has also said he would tax the endowments of schools that spend money on racial equity, and a 'portion of the seized funds will then be used as restitution for victims of these illegal and unjust policies, policies that hurt our country so badly.' He said K-12 schools that teach 'critical race theory, gender ideology or other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children' would also see a cut in federal funding. What Trump’s administration could mean for education With a GOP trifecta in Washington, 'there will be a much more accommodating Congress, at least until the midterms,' Douglass said. 'Democrats can muster filibusters in the Senate, but fights over the budget and bills and procedures meant to accommodate Trump, along with the assumption of unprecedented executive authority, provide a much more threatening political environment for America’s colleges and universities.' And there are some ways to get around Congress when restricting federal money. Trump’s Department of Education is likely to change the definition of Title IX as it stands under President Biden and remove language regarding discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. If the department creates rules against allowing transgender students in certain locker rooms or sports teams and schools refuse to comply, one of the punishments for violating the rule could be a restriction in federal funds. 'I think you'll see an effort to define sex in Title IX as binary and biological,' said Bob Eitel, co-founder and president at the Defense of Freedom Institute, adding there could be efforts by the Trump administration 'to investigate those school districts and colleges and universities that' go against the mandate. And there are specific threats to research funding under the second Trump White House, too. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to Texas universities: Freeze tuition 'Although it is speculative, the 'unitary executive theory' offers a path for withholding or impounding federal funds for research in areas thought by the Trump administrators to be antithetical to their political agenda, like climate change. That would likely be a nationwide restriction that, along with threats to drastically reduce funding for infrastructure costs of doing federal research, would create a huge hole in the financial model for research universities.' Douglass said. The fluid situation leaves schools in a position of trying to figure out how to prepare without fully knowing what comes next. 'Institutional leaders are holding their breath but are also doubling down on seeking protections for DACA students, international students, and those most impacted by the removal of DEI offices and programs designed to ensure that campuses are places of welcome and belonging for all students — from first-generation students, LGBTQ students and students of color to veterans and students with disabilities,' said Pasquerella.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/schools-colleges-political-environment/	2024-11-14T13:51:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24310037862899-e1731443933262_4c0b6a-e1731583886104.jpg?w=900

(The Hill) -- Dick Van Dyke, the 98-year-old legendary actor, says he's fortunate that he 'won't be around' for President-elect Donald Trump's four-year term in the White House. Asked by DailyMail.com this week if Trump is 'capable of making America great again,' Van Dyke replied, 'Fortunately, I won't be around to experience the four years.'

Eva Longoria says she and family have moved out of 'dystopian' US	(The Hill) -- Eva Longoria says she's anxious and nervous for Americans who can't 'escape' their 'dystopian country' following President-elect Donald Trump's White House win. 'The shocking part is not that he won,' Longoria told Marie Claire in an interview for its November cover story conducted two days after Trump triumphed in the presidential race. Alex Soros, Jared Kushner reportedly obsessed with Albania 'It’s that a convicted criminal who spews so much hate could hold the highest office,' said Longoria, who campaigned for Vice President Kamala Harris and spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August. 'I would like to think our fight continues,' the former 'Desperate Housewives' star said. But, 'If he keeps his promises,' she said of Trump, 'it's going to be a scary place.' The 'Flamin' Hot' director, who was born in Texas, has long split her time, living in both Spain and Mexico, according to the publication. Before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Longoria said, the U.S. 'was changing' and the 'vibe was different.' Dick Van Dyke on Trump: ‘Fortunately, I won’t be around to experience the 4 years’ 'And then Covid happened, and it pushed it over the edge. Whether it’s the homelessness or the taxes, not that I want to s--- on California — it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now,' she said. 'I’m privileged,' Longoria, 49, said.

Senate Judiciary Republican 'absolutely' wants to see Ethics repo...	Republican Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he 'absolutely' wants to see the House Ethics Committee’s report on former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) after his nomination for attorney general. 'I think that there should not be any limitations on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,' Cornyn told reporters Thursday. ABC’s Rachel Scott asked the senator if he wants to see the report created by the House Ethics Committee, which was investigating whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. 'Absolutely,' Cornyn responded. President-elect Trump's surprise announcement Wednesday left Capitol Hill reeling. Gaetz resigned from his position in Congress following the announcement. Since the announcement, calls to see the report have been growing. Although the committee’s investigation ended since Gaetz resigned from Congress, the panel could still vote to release its report. Before the announcement and Gaetz’s resignation, the committee was set to meet Friday to vote on whether to release its findings. Cornyn argued Thursday the Senate Judiciary Committee deserves to see the report. Trump’s pick of Gaetz sent shock waves through Washington, both for Republican and Democratic lawmakers. A source in the room where House Republicans were waiting to start leadership elections said there were audible gasps when the announcement was made, and a number of GOP senators expressed bewilderment. Some Republicans have said they will not support Gaetz's nomination, while Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) urged Republicans to 'give Matt a chance.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/senate-judiciary-republican-absolutely-wants-to-see-ethics-report-on-gaetz/	2024-11-14T12:30:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/cornynjohn_091624gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Dave McCormick projected to win Pennsylvania US Senate seat	(NewsNation) — NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ has called the race for the U.S. Senate seat for Pennsylvania in favor of Republican Dave McCormick. See all Pennsylvania race results here. He won over Democrat incumbent Sen. Bob Casey Jr. However, the Associated Press writes that the race is headed for a statewide recount, as counties continued Wednesday to sort through outstanding ballots and the campaigns jousted over which ones should count. Casey still hasn't conceded. During a brief exchange with reporters this week Casey said votes are still being counted 'and will be for days.' His campaign manager said in a statement Wednesday that 'McCormick and his allies are trying to disenfranchise Pennsylvania voters.' A lawyer representing Casey's campaign said Republicans were challenging the provisional ballots of registered Democrats, delaying the vote counting process. 'What we are seeing this year is more organized, more disciplined, more directed and more comprehensive than what we saw in 2020,' attorney Adam Bonin said. However, McCormick's campaign consultant said it was Democratic-controlled counties that were dragging out the process by not adding the results of processed ballots to vote totals. Casey sought a fourth term as the senior senator from Pennsylvania, making him the longest-serving Democratic U.S. senator in state history. Casey is the son of former Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey Sr. and won his most recent election in 2018 by 13 points. He announced he would seek another term after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2023 and underwent successful surgery. Before he was elected to the Senate, Casey, who is an attorney, served as Pennsylvania’s state treasurer and auditor general. Throughout his political career, Casey has focused on issues of public health care, children’s welfare and public infrastructure. He centered his 2024 reelection campaign around protecting LGBTQ and workers' rights, preventing the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, fighting fentanyl and securing the border, among other issues.

Meanwhile, McCormick made an unsuccessful bid for Pennsylvania’s other Senate seat in 2022, losing in the Republican primary by 950 votes to Dr. Mehmet Oz. In the general election, Oz was defeated by now-Sen. John Fetterman. McCormick is a former hedge fund executive and CEO of Bridgewater Associates who worked previously for the U.S. Treasury Department under President George W. Bush. He was endorsed in 2024 by Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump. McCormick is a West Point graduate and former U.S. Army captain who returned to his alma mater, where he taught economics. He also holds a doctorate from Princeton University. During his campaign, McCormick pushed to align Casey with Vice President Kamala Harris’ political stances on issues such as immigration, energy and the economy. The Republican candidate built his 2024 Senate bid on issues that largely mirror the GOP’s platform — advocating for tighter border security measures, ending drug and human trafficking, 'restoring America’s military might,' growing Pennsylvania’s energy sector with an 'all of the above' energy strategy, among other issues. Pennsylvania has remained a battleground state where Democratic presidential candidates won the state in seven straight elections before Trump won the state in 2016 against Hillary Clinton. Trump won the state by 0.7 percentage points in 2016 before the state returned to the Democrats in 2020 when Biden won over Trump by 1.2 points. Less than a month before the election, The Hill/ Decision Desk HQ Election Center forecast that Casey had a 72% chance of winning his reelection bid in November. Casey also far outraised and outspent McCormick, raising $31.2 million and spending $23.3 million to the Republican’s $17.7 million raised and $9.4 million spent, according to Open Secrets.

Presidential appointments: How do they work?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump has until his Jan. 20 Inauguration Day to build out his administration and fill thousands of roles. That means assigning leaders to oversee every executive department, including national security, public health, labor, and the Justice Department among others. A president typically appoints about 4,000 positions across the federal government. Of those, about 1,200 appointments require Senate approval, according to Partnership for Public Service’s Center for Presidential Transition estimates. Examples of government waste, inefficiency as Trump announces DOGE Common appointments that require Senate approval include cabinet secretaries, agency heads and ambassadors. Other roles, like advisors, aids, and senior officials in various agencies, are also filled by presidential appointees but don’t require Senate approval. Trump has announced the names of several people he hopes to appoint to serve in his administration. You can track his selections here. How does a nominee get appointed? The president-elect's transition team is busy identifying possible candidates for each role and making recommendations to the incoming president. For roles that require approval, the incoming president's formal written nomination for an appointment will trigger Senate scrutiny. The vetting process varies by position. Cabinet nominees are generally subject to FBI background checks, financial disclosure reviews and pre-Senate hearings. Trump has pressured lawmakers in the Senate to allow him to appoint some nominees without a Senate vote while the chamber is on recess. That would be considered a recess appointment — something the Senate hasn’t allowed presidents to make since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling made it more challenging. Which positions does Trump need to fill? Trump will need to appoint people to leadership roles within his Cabinet and elsewhere in his administration. The heads of 15 executive departments make up the Cabinet and are often considered the president’s closest advisors. Departments with leaders in the Cabinet include: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, and the Attorney General. What are Trump’s plans for Medicaid? The Cabinet also includes the White House Chief of Staff, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, the Director of National Intelligence, and the US Trade Representative, and the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Management and Budget, Council of Economic Advisers, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Small Business Administration. Cabinet members guide the president and keep him informed about each respective office. They also play a role in the line of succession, should the president no longer be able to serve. The president also appoints the heads of more than 50 independent federal commissions. Those include the Federal Reserve Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, federal judges, ambassadors and other officials.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/presidential-appointments-work/	2024-11-14T11:28:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2182353743.jpg?w=900
How will Trump's tariffs impact everyday Americans?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump plans to impose sweeping tariffs in his second term, but following through on that promise could come at a high cost for everyday Americans. 'If we were to see the full panoply of tariffs that candidate Trump proposed, you would see a substantial increase in the price of almost everything we buy every day,' said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes Trump hasn't been shy about his love for tariffs — which are a tax on goods imported from other countries — calling them 'the greatest thing ever invented' on the campaign trail. But economists warn those taxes, which are almost always paid by the importer, largely get passed onto consumers. As a candidate, Trump proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China as well as a 10% to 20% 'universal' tariff on all imports, arguing his plan would reduce the trade deficit and protect American jobs. Frustrated Americans await the economic changes they voted for with Trump The president-elect has also threatened a 25% tariff on Mexico, the United States' top trading partner, if the country doesn't do more to stop what he described as an 'onslaught of criminals and drugs' coming into the U.S. If that happens, shoppers can expect to pay more at the grocery store, particularly for items like fresh produce, much of which gets imported from abroad, Lincicome pointed out. The Tax Foundation — a nonpartisan tax policy nonprofit — recently looked at a dozen estimates analyzing Trump's proposed tariffs, and every study consistently found his proposals would negatively impact the U.S. economy. Other commentators are less worried, arguing that Trump's tariff threats are merely a negotiating tactic to gain leverage. 'He has talked about using those as a negotiating tool to keep China from stealing our technology, to get China to allow our goods and services to go into China … we need to have more pressure on China to have them accept American goods and services, which they’re not doing now,' Grover Norquist, the Republican founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform, told 'NewsNation Prime' this month. During a recent NewsNation town hall, now Vice President-elect JD Vance defended his running mate's tariff policies, pointing out that inflation was low during Trump's first term despite aggressive tariffs. How would tariffs be different in a second Trump term? Trump's new tariffs are expected to have far greater consequences than his previous ones because of the sheer magnitude of the proposals. 'Because we're talking about a wider range of products and a higher level of tariffs and consumer-facing goods, the direct price pain would be more obvious and significant this time around,' Lincicome said. Items like smartphones and laptops, which weren't subject to previous tariffs, could be hit especially hard. Under Trump's proposed tariffs, consumers could see laptop and tablet prices rise 46%, and smartphone prices jump 26%, according to a Consumer Technology Association report. The 60% tariff on Chinese goods alone would represent a near tripling of the current tariffs on imports from China, economist Pierre Lemieux noted in a report. 'Trump claims the tariffs would boost the economy and working-class families. In fact, they would hit hard the American economy and lower-income families,' Lemieux wrote. Retaliation is also a concern. China and Mexico would likely respond with tariffs of their own, which could hurt American exports. 'What we saw during the first Trump term was a lot of actual tariffs imposed, and almost no governments backing down in response to those tariffs,' Lincicome said. Mexico's government has already signaled it could hit back with its own trade restrictions — a move that would have serious consequences for American farmers, chemical manufacturers and other sectors. Altogether, U.S. exports to Mexico were $362 billion in 2022 and accounted for almost 16% of all American exports that year, according to the most recent figures from the Office of the United States Trade Representative. How much could Trump's tariffs push prices up? An analysis by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates Trump's proposed tariffs would cost a typical U.S. household more than $2,600 a year. 'High tariffs also imply a massive shifting of the tax burden from richer taxpayers toward lower-income Americans,' the report said. A separate estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale estimates Trump's tariffs could raise consumer prices by 1.4% to 5.1%. That's the equivalent of $1,900 to $7,600 per household. The uptick in prices would likely show up at the grocery store. That's because much of the food consumed in the United States — about 60% of fresh fruit and 38% of vegetables — is imported, according to Department of Agriculture data. Consumer products like apparel, toys, furniture and footwear, are also expected to get more expensive with new tariffs, the National Retail Federation (NRF) said earlier this month. The NRF warned the proposed tariffs would have a 'significant' and 'detrimental' impact on a wide range of items and reduce Americans' spending power by $46 billion to $78 billion each year they're in place. A $90 pair of athletic shoes is expected to jump to $106-$116, the NRF estimated. Meanwhile, an $80 pair of men's jeans would cost $90 to $96. It's also worth mentioning: Trump's first-term tariffs didn't send prices skyrocketing across the board, but they did come at a cost. After accounting for direct costs and efficiency losses, economists estimate the tariffs increased costs for average American households by about $830 per year. For example, Trump imposed a tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018. Researchers estimate the price of washing machines increased by around 12%, about $86 per unit. Do tariffs protect jobs? One of Trump's main arguments in favor of tariffs is that they prevent American businesses from offshoring jobs, but it's not that simple. Workers who produce the specific goods covered by tariffs often benefit, but tariffs can also hurt workers in other industries that rely on those imports. 'You can protect the steel industry with tariffs, but higher steel prices are going to harm manufacturers that need steel in the United States and are going to harm all those workers,' Lincicome said. In other words, a government tariff may be trading jobs in one industry at the expense of jobs in another. Going back to the washing machine example, researchers determined the policy created about 1,800 new jobs, but at a steep cost of as much as $817,000 per job. The Tax Foundation estimates Trump's proposed tariffs would bring down total employment by 684,000 jobs — an estimate that doesn't include the effects of retaliation. A 2024 paper by a group of top economists looked at Trump's 2018 tariffs and found that 'import tariffs on foreign goods neither raised nor lowered US employment in newly-protected sectors.' However, retaliatory tariffs had 'clear negative impacts,' primarily in agriculture.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/trumps-tariffs-prices/	2024-11-14T10:45:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/6550cf841f1d47.44211312.jpeg?w=900
Examples of government waste, inefficiency as Trump announces DOG...	(NewsNation) — Tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut federal spending and 'wasteful expenditures.' NewsNation compiled a list of existing wasteful and inefficient government spending examples. What is Elon Musk’s plan for DOGE? Congressional funding for expired programs The Congressional Budget Office recently found that Congress provided $516 billion in appropriations this fiscal year to programs that had expired under federal law. The funds were associated with nearly 500 expired authorizations, according to the CBO's July report. 'Nearly two-thirds ($320 billion) of that $516 billion was provided for activities whose authorizations expired more than a decade ago,' the report said. According to CBO's estimates, about half of the authorized appropriations in the report expired at least 10 years ago, and the oldest expired in 1980. In 2023, the amount of funding for expired authorizations was $519 billion. What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes Payment errors The federal government made $247 billion worth of payment errors in fiscal year 2022 and $236 billion in 2023, according to the Government Accountability Office. These errors, also known as improper payments, include overpayments or payments that should not have been made, such as to someone who died or someone no longer eligible for government programs. Estimates show the federal government spent $2.7 trillion in payment errors since 2003. In 2022, the majority of improper payments spanned across 82 programs, a majority coming from Medicaid ($81 billion) and Medicare ($47 billion). 'Improper payments and fraud are long-standing and significant problems in the federal government,' said House testimony from GAO in September. What Kristi Noem’s DHS appointment could mean for the border Maintaining empty buildings Federal government agencies are using just 12% of the space in their headquarters buildings on average, according to the Public Buildings Reform Board, which is an independent federal agency focused on recommending the disposal of underutilized federal properties. 'Even before the pandemic, of the federal properties analyzed, federal occupancy was low, particularly in Washington D.C.,' the board's report to Congress in March said. These spaces must be furnished, which also costs money. The House Oversight Committee spent $3.3 billion on furniture over the past few years. Apparently, to furnish office spaces left mostly empty under maximum telework. Some agencies spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on updating empty conference rooms 'Hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer funds are spent annually just to maintain government-owned properties that should be sold off,' said Chairman Rep. James Comer of the House Oversight Committee in a hearing last year. 'A billion dollars or more could be saved annually by terminating unneeded federal office space leases. Unused federal space was an issue prior to the pandemic — federal property management has long been on GAO’s High-Risk List — but it’s now become one that is simply too big — and too costly — to ignore.' Kamala Harris campaign now millions in debt Producing pennies A penny may cost one cent for people using it to pay for goods and services, but it costs triple that for the government to produce it. For 19 years, the cost of producing pennies has surpassed the value of the coin. The same is true for nickels. Though valued at five cents, a nickel costs 11.5 cents for the government to produce one. Producing these two coins last year cost the U.S. Mint $179 million. Federal agency recommendations The Government Accountability Office reports more than 5,300 open recommendations for federal agencies to make the government work better. In July, GAO estimated taxpayers could save between $106 billion and $208 billion if the recommendations were implemented.

Trump's Rubio pick divides Republicans	Tensions are brewing over President-elect Trump’s move to tap Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to serve as secretary of State, with some of the president-elect’s allies voicing concerns about the pick. The choice has already set into motion the process of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) choosing a replacement for Rubio in the Senate, and some senators have already said they would vote to confirm Rubio. But while Trump’s choice of Rubio received praise from various Republicans and Democrats, those in the so-called MAGA wing of the GOP have expressed a mix of surprise and disappointment about the pick, with many hoping Trump would choose former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell. 'I’ve been most surprised with the Rubio pick,' said one source close to the transition, who described the Florida senator as 'not that MAGA.' The delay in formally announcing Rubio raised questions about whether Trump was navigating how to move forward amid the internal disagreement, but Trump’s announcement came shortly after Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) was elected Senate majority leader. 'To me what that looks more towards was making sure that Rubio was being able to be a part of the Senate majority leader elections,' said Alex Stroman, Trump’s 2017 inaugural spokesperson and a personal friend of Grenell’s. Stroman said Rubio is someone Republicans are happy about and the kind of person Trump wanted from the outset. 'Anytime that you have nominations for a president’s Cabinet, there are discussions that play out both publicly and privately,' he said. The source who expressed surprise about Rubio suggested the pick may have been influenced by Susie Wiles, Trump’s incoming chief of staff who has worked for decades in Florida politics. The New York Times first reported late Monday that Trump was expected to name Rubio as his secretary of State nominee, and Trump on Wednesday confirmed the choice in a statement. 'He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,' Trump said. On Monday, following reports that Trump would pick Rubio, conservative activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk warned his followers to not 'jump to conclusions.' 'If Trump hasn’t confirmed it on Truth, don’t jump to conclusions and don’t believe everything you see,' Kirk wrote. And earlier this week, a source familiar with the matter told The Hill that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had expressed opposition to the prospect of Rubio being nominated for the position. The decision to make Rubio secretary of State is far from the most controversial choice Trump has made during his transition so far. Shortly after announcing his intention to nominate the senator, Trump also announced he had picked another Florida Republican, Rep. Matt Gaetz, to be attorney general, a move that drew stunned responses from many Republicans on Capitol Hill. While many in MAGA world have expressed displeasure at the idea of Trump appointing Rubio, others seem to be on board with the scenario if it means Lara Trump, the president-elect’s daughter-in-law, will fill his Senate seat. On Tuesday, Maye Musk posted on the social platform X that Lara Trump should be Rubio’s replacement and called the upper chamber 'an old man’s club.' Elon Musk reposted his mother’s post, writing that 'Lara Trump is genuinely great.' Elon Musk’s approval of Lara Trump in the position is notable given his recent close proximity to President-elect Trump. Musk has been a constant presence around Mar-a-Lago and even appeared in Trump’s family photo following his election win. Several other Trump allies have weighed in to support the idea of Lara Trump being the pick, including Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who argued in a post on X that appointing the president-elect’s daughter-in-law would help avoid a 'messy primary' in 2026. With the president-elect's decision to nominate Rubio, the choice of his replacement in the Senate will fall to DeSantis. A source familiar with the matter told The Hill that DeSantis’s chief of staff was favored for the position and that the other candidates include Florida’s lieutenant governor and attorney general. The source said that the president-elect may push for his daughter-in-law, but later added 'our governor has not gotten a call about appointing Lara.' Sources have been reluctant to openly discuss the dynamics surrounding the nomination and the subsequent domino effect on Florida politics and in MAGA world. Rubio has had something of a winding journey to become one of Trump’s closer allies. He and Trump were fierce rivals during the 2016 GOP primary, with the two exchanging insults about their manhood. But the senator became an informal adviser to Trump during his first term, and Rubio was one of three finalists considered to be Trump’s running mate this year before Vice President-elect JD Vance got the nod. To be sure, the Rubio pick has gotten a warm reception from members of both parties. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) said he would vote to confirm Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) praised the choice. But Rubio has also faced criticism from some Trump allies for being too much of a foreign policy hawk, a term Trump has used disparagingly to talk about rivals like former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). However, his tough approach to China and Iran largely aligns with Trump’s talk on the campaign trail, and Rubio has in recent weeks argued the Ukraine-Russia conflict will need to end through a negotiated agreement, something that also echoes what Trump has said on the topic. Grenell, comparatively, has been one of Trump’s staunchest allies dating back to the start of his first term, and he had been something of an envoy for the president-elect while he was out of office. Grenell previously served as ambassador to Germany and acting director of intelligence during Trump’s first term. He joined Trump during a recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and he was an active presence on the campaign trail. In what could be seen as a tacit acknowledgment of the divisions over Trump's choice, Grenell congratulated Rubio on X on Wednesday night. The Florida senator promptly responded. 'Thank you! Kind words from a great American who will be a vital part of protecting America and Americans in the years to come!' Rubio tweeted.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-rubio-pick-divides-republicans/	2024-11-14T03:31:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/rubiomarco_011824gn02_w.jpg?w=900
Trump 'border czar': Cartels need terrorist label due to death co...	(NewsNation) — Former ICE Director Tom Homan, tapped to lead border enforcement in President-elect Donald Trump's administration, says he will prioritize deporting criminals and national security threats while pushing to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations. 'There's more than one priority,' Homan said Wednesday on NewsNation's 'CUOMO,' revealing that authorities have identified more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions and final deportation orders who remain in the United States. The incoming border chief outlined three major policy changes he believes Congress should implement: Reform the Flores Settlement Agreement to allow longer detention of migrant families Modify the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to enable faster processing of unaccompanied minors Overhaul asylum laws and reinstate the 'Remain in Mexico' program Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Homan defended Trump-era policies, saying border crossings dropped to historic lows under the previous administration's approach. He criticized the policies of President Joe Biden’s administration, saying they led to record-high encounters and overwhelmed Border Patrol resources. 'If we don't secure the border, more migrants are going to die. More women are going to be raped. There's no downside in securing the border,' he told NewsNation. 'Congress needs to fix this. Immigration enforcement is very controversial, is very emotional. I get it, but we have to secure the border because a secure border is going to save lives,' Homan said. Tom Homan: Cartels should be labeled as terrorist organizations Homan, who served under six presidents and faced recent death threats from cartels, strongly backed Trump's plan to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations, noting they have 'killed more Americans than every terrorist organization in the world combined.' Democratic Party has 'lost touch': Rep. Seth Moulton 'The criminal cartels in Mexico is like a Fortune 500 company,' Homan said, describing their expansion into 42 countries and growing control of drug distribution networks within the U.S. Tom Homan pledges to find missing migrant children Homan revealed plans to launch a major initiative to locate approximately 300,000 unaccompanied migrant children who entered the U.S. but cannot be accounted for by authorities. 'Some are going to be in forced labor. We already found some in forced labor ... Some are gonna be sex trafficking. Some are living with pedophiles,' Homan said, pledging to make finding these children a top priority. 'Border czar' Tom Homan: All we want to do is enforce the law When pressed about the potential economic impact of mass deportations, particularly on industries heavily reliant on immigrant labor, Homan said that enforcement would focus on criminals and security threats rather than indiscriminate roundups. Trump accused of avoiding press after controversial admin appointments 'If you're in the country illegally, you're in violation of law, so you're not off the table, but we're going to prioritize what we do,' Homan said. Homan pushes for asylum system reforms Homan cited data showing about 85% of asylum claims at the southern border are ultimately rejected, arguing the system needs significant reform. He said the current process allows too many migrants to enter the U.S. based on an initial screening with a 'very low' threshold of proof. 'They learned a few key phrases from the cartels of what to say to make yourself pass that first interview,' Homan said. He advocated for raising the standard of proof in initial screenings to match the higher burden required in court hearings.

Democratic Party has 'lost touch': Rep. Seth Moulton	(NewsNation) — Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., is critical of his party and the role it played in losing the 2024 election. 'We need to look ourselves in the mirror as Democrats and ask, 'How do we reconnect with the majority of American voters?'' Moulton said Wednesday on 'CUOMO.' 'We've clearly lost touch.' Democrats’ election reckoning pits liberals against centrists Moulton was recently quoted in a story from The New York Times about Democratic finger-pointing after Vice President Harris lost the 2024 election, saying his party had leaned too heavily into identity politics, forging a path for President-elect Trump and Republicans to a decisive victory. He has faced backlash from his party, with Massachusetts Democratic Party Chair Steve Kerrigan, for example, telling the Boston Globe that Moulton’s comments 'do not represent the broad view of our party.' Moulton responded to backlash about his transgender athlete comments, saying the response to them proves his point. 'I was just speaking authentically as a dad about one of many issues where I think we’re just out of touch with the majority of voters, and I stand by my position,' Moulton said during an MSNBC appearance. 'The backlash I’ve received proves my point that we can’t even have these discussions as a party.' Moulton told 'CUOMO' that if his party doesn’t 'come up with a new strategy, a winning strategy going forward, then we're never gonna be able to stop Trump.' Matt Gaetz is Trump’s pick for attorney general Moulton doesn’t oppose transgender rights, but says the party has been too focused on that cause and similar social issues. He was first elected to Congress in 2015 and is a member of the Congressional Equality Caucus. The caucus promotes LGBTQ equality in the House and has strongly opposed efforts to bar trans athletes from sports teams that best align with their gender identity. His 2024 reelection campaign was endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ advocacy group. Twice in the past, Moulton co-sponsored House Democrats’ Transgender Bill of Rights, which included protections for transgender athletes to participate on sports teams that match their gender identity. Even last spring, Moulton voted against passing a Republican-backed bill to bar transgender student-athletes from sports.

UFO House hearing witness: Pentagon 'clearly covering something u...	(NewsNation) — Independent journalist Michael Shellenberger testified Wednesday at a House of Representatives committee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP. 'The Pentagon is clearly covering something up,' Shellenberger said Wednesday on 'Vargas Reports.' 'The Pentagon is treating us like children. It's a very paternalistic attitude. They just need to release the information, obviously make sure that nothing gets out to our enemies. But we're long overdue for this sort of disclosure and transparency.' What is Donald Trump’s position on UFOs? Shellenberger, who has written extensively about a program called 'Immaculate Constellation,' testified during Wednesday’s hearing that members of Congress have expressed growing frustration since 2021 over the military and intelligence community’s refusal to reveal 'concrete' information. What is Immaculate Constellation? Shellenberger detailed his reporting on the alleged 'Immaculate Constellation' secret government program. A whistleblower revealed the alleged UFO program, in which the Pentagon collects and quarantines information on UFO sightings, Shellenberger says. Department of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough has previously denied the existence of records regarding the program. Shellenberger highlighted the need for Congress and the White House to address UFOs. Michael Gold, a former NASA administrator, outlined new ways for the space agency to be helpful on the UAP issue. Currently chief growth officer at Redwire Space, Gold stressed in his testimony that he is speaking on his own behalf and not for any other organization. 'Agencies such as NASA have much to offer when it comes to understanding UAP,' Gold's prepared testimony read.

Trump accused of avoiding press after controversial admin appoint...	(NewsNation) — Unlike his most recent predecessors, President-elect Donald Trump has not answered questions explaining his key and at times controversial appointments or explaining his priorities now that he has been elected. Trump transition officials are not providing details about when he will have a general news conference. Trump has had two limited exchanges with reporters — one-on-ones with NBC and the New York Post. 'President Trump was the most press-accessible candidate in the race, by far,' Trump spokesman Steve Cheung told NewsNation. 'He will continue to engage with the press regularly and his team will remain committed to providing timely answers on a wide range of inquiries. Stay tuned!' Trump, Biden meet to discuss peaceful transfer of power Political analyst Chris Cillizza calls the decision not to hold forth before the cameras 'UnTrumpy.' In 1992, Bill Clinton held his first formal news conference eight days after being elected. In that event, Clinton announced some of his first appointments, but his Cabinet picks came later in a series of news conferences. Clinton did answer some questions two days after the election as he was leaving the Arkansas State Capitol. And Clinton held a news conference three days after defeating Robert Dole in 1996, in which he announced a change in his chiefs of staff. FBI should probe Gabbard, Gaetz before confirmation: John Bolton The election of 2000 was different because both Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush answered many media questions in various forums as the election outcome and the various court fights dragged on until Dec. 12. When he was reelected in 2004, Bush held a formal news conference with White House reporters two days later — Nov. 4. Barack Obama was quicker to face the press after he won in 2008. He talked to reporters three days after the election and announced his chief of staff selection. After his reelection, Obama waited eight days later before holding a news conference to talk about his second term. Joe Biden held his first news conference as president-elect a week after his 2020 election. While Trump held news conferences during the 2016 and 2020 campaigns and criticized both of his general election opponents for the lack of media accessibility, he also did not face reporters for six weeks (Dec. 19) after winning in 2016. What Kristi Noem’s DHS appointment could mean for the border? Since his victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, all of Trump’s personnel announcements have been made through prepared statements released in his name. Cillizza argues that 'providing statements is the not the same as taking questions at a press conference.' Also: the Trump transition team is not holding regular briefings to discuss appointments or what policies the new administration will pursue.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-media-appointments/	2024-11-13T18:34:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66e356c4c660d2.57860006.jpeg?w=900
FBI should probe Gabbard, Gaetz before confirmation: John Bolton	(NewsNation) — John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under George W. Bush and a former national security adviser in the first Trump administration, said President-elect Donald Trump’s intention to nominate former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Rep. Matt Gaetz to his Cabinet shows Trump is not serious about intelligence gathering. 'With his (Trump) announcement of Tulsi Gabbard to be the director of national intelligence, he’s sending a signal that we’ve lost our mind when it comes to collecting intelligence,' Bolton told NewsNation’s 'The Hill.' But Bolton says Gabbard isn’t the worst pick Trump has made. Trump names top campaign aides as senior White House staff 'Up until a few hours ago, I would have said that (Gabbard) was the worst Cabinet appointment in recent American history. Since Matt Gaetz’s nomination (to be attorney general), he clearly has taken the lead on that score,' Bolton said. Gaetz, who said Wednesday he is immediately resigning from Congress after being nominated to be attorney general, faced a yearslong Justice Department investigation into allegations of sex trafficking and obstruction of justice. Last year, the department said it would not bring charges. Gaetz is still the subject of a House Ethics Committee investigation as well as a civil lawsuit involving allegations of a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. Republicans win control of the US House of Representatives 'I don’t think either she (Gabbard) or Matt Gaetz ought to have a confirmation hearing until they have both had full-field FBI investigations,' said Bolton. 'Given the Russian propaganda that she (Gabbard) has espoused … I think she’s a serious threat to our national security. I think Republican senators should reject both of them.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/gabbard-gaetz-need-fbi-probes-bolton/	2024-11-13T17:20:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/image_a7cc50.png?w=900
House Republicans strike deal to make it harder to oust Speaker	Hard-line conservatives have struck a tentative deal with House Republicans concerned about chaos in the chamber, agreeing to raise the threshold to force a vote to oust the Speaker in exchange for concessions on rule changes — potentially putting Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on a glide path to keep the gavel come January. The deal — which multiple sources confirmed to The Hill — would significantly weaken the House 'motion to vacate' rule, eliminating the threat of any one member triggering the kind of snap vote that resulted in the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). That historic ouster has loomed over Johnson’s tenure in the top job. Under the agreement, hard-line conservatives would agree to raising the threshold to force a vote on ousting the Speaker from one member to nine members. The mechanism has been a key point of contention within the House GOP conference since McCarthy’s ouster. Hard-line conservatives were adamant about keeping it to one lawmaker before Wednesday. In exchange for that concession, other members would drop the proposed rules changes — spearheaded by those in the Main Street Caucus — that aimed to punish members for rebelling against the majority of the party in ways that risked grinding legislative activity to a halt. Proposed penalties included removing members from committees if they support a motion to vacate against a Republican Speaker. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who has been a vocal opponent of the rule changes, called them a 'nonstarter.' 'All of the targeting amendments and stuff, those are all gone. And that was, as I tweeted out earlier, those were a nonstarter,' he said. 'Those were a deal-killer.' The deal was hatched shortly before Republicans voted on a nominee for Speaker, and after President-elect Trump threw his support behind the Louisiana Republican. Johnson, members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and those in the self-described pragmatic Main Street Caucus were involved in the discussions. Johnson met members and allies of the Freedom Caucus minutes before Wednesday’s internal election, two sources told The Hill. Conservatives who balked at the proposed changes — many of whom are members of the Freedom Caucus — had plotted to oppose Johnson’s nomination to the Speakership in Wednesday’s internal GOP elections as a form of protest. First they planned to nominate a last-minute protest candidate, then they planned to force a recorded vote on Johnson’s nomination to showcase opposition. But after the agreement, Johnson was nominated to remain Speaker by unanimous voice vote. No member voiced opposition, according to multiple sources in the room. That is good news to the Speaker, who will have another slim majority and will need near unanimity to be elected Speaker on the House floor when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3. Speaker Johnson appeared with Main Street Caucus Chair Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) and Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) to confirm the deal later on Wednesday. Dusty Johnson said that Harris had reached out to him earlier in the day to strike the deal. 'That motion to vacate will be set at nine in return for getting rid of some amendments that probably would have divided this conference,' Dusty Johnson said. 'Andy did a good job of explaining to Main Street leadership why those amendments would have divided the republican conference.' Harris noted that Trump had visited the conference earlier in the day and asked for Republican unity. 'We've been able to work across the conference to eliminate the controversial issues that could have divided us and move forward together to deliver on the President's agenda,' Harris said. Some lawmakers, however, are warning that the situation is tenuous. Roy, a leading voice on the Speakership talks, wrote on the social platform X that there is 'much more work to be done' when discussing the agreement. 'For now - those offering the retaliation amendments agreed to set aside ALL of them while conversations continue about organization, so @SpeakerJohnson was chosen as Speaker,' he wrote. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), meanwhile, told reporters 'they are still going to be negotiating that as we get to January.' Proponents of the 'accountability amendments' in question were bitter about the chaos that plagued the House GOP over the last two years, not only from the weeks of standstill after McCarthy’s ouster, but from legislation that hard-liners blocked by tanking procedural votes. They worried such actions could impede President-elect Trump’s agenda as he takes office, and pointed to the rebellions as a reason why Republicans did not win more House seats. But the hard-line conservatives balked at the proposals, which were antithetical to their goals of further democratizing power. Such punishments for breaking from the party would prevent members from representing their constituents, they argued. An internal memo circulated among conservatives before the deal was struck Wednesday said that the amendments would be 'sowing seeds of division' when Republicans will have 'no room for error in the next Congress,' and argued the rules would 'punish those who fought for President Trump and his agenda for years and provide excuses for those who will likely obstruct it.' One proposed amendment from Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.) would have consequences for members who support a 'motion to vacate' the Speaker, removing them from committees. 'We need to have cohesion and unity. We need to have parameters set,' Van Orden told The Hill in an interview on Wednesday morning, before the deal was struck. Van Orden said that if unified Republican control of government does not change how the House GOP operates, 'then Republicans don’t deserve the majority.' 'If we don't act boldly and decisively, then we have no business governing. And that is a flag that I'm planting in the ground. So we've got the House, we've got the Senate, got the White House, and if we don't act on the mandates that were given by the American people, we don't deserve it.' Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) proposed two rules changes, the first of which would remove members from committees if they voted against the 'rule' — procedural votes that govern debate and consideration of legislation on the House floor that are considered tests of party loyalty. His second proposal would have imposed similar consequences for those who vote for the party’s 'Speaker Designate' on the House floor, a scenario that led to the House taking days to officially elect McCarthy as Speaker in January 2023, preventing the House from conducting any legislative activity. Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.), too, had an amendment to remove members from committees if they defy the party on a procedural vote. Johnson told Politico on Tuesday that he was not in favor of those rule changes, saying he was 'not in favor of punitive measures and rules.' But the hard-liners had wanted to see him explicitly advocate against the proposed rule changes. 'He can say he opposes them, but he's not going to try and stop them or whip against them,' Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) said. Johnson, according to Crane, told House Republicans that he would not put his thumb on the scale and that it would be up to the House GOP to decide on the rules. That fueled the risk of a formal show of opposition to Johnson. But the brokering of a deal, which caused a slight delay to the start of leadership elections as it was negotiated on Wednesday, ended with unanimous approval for the Speaker in a massive win for him.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/house-republicans-strike-deal-to-make-it-harder-to-oust-speaker/	2024-11-13T16:44:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/johnsonmike_091824gn19_w.jpg?w=900
Gaetz resigns from Congress after AG nod	Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) will resign from Congress 'effective immediately' after being nominated to serve as attorney general by President-elect Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) announced on Wednesday. The news came hours after Trump sent shockwaves throughout Washington with his pick of Gaetz — a staunch ally of the president-elect — for attorney general. Gaetz still faces Senate confirmation. Johnson postulated that the Florida Republican decided to leave the House early to speed up the process to replace him, with hopes that his successor can be decided by the time the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. 'I think, out of deference to us, he issued his resignation letter effective immediately, of Congress. That caught us by surprise a little bit, but I asked him what the reasoning was and he said, well, you can’t have too many absences, so under Florida state law there’s about an eight-week period to select and fill a vacant seat. And so by doing so today that allows me, I’ve already placed a call to Gov. DeSantis in Florida and said let’s start the clock,' Johnson said.

Are UAPs a threat to national security and US airspace?	(NewsNation) — Experts and former military officials who testified before a U.S. House of Representatives committee exploring unidentified anomalous phenomena Wednesday admit that there is a heightened sense of awareness about the possible existence of unidentified technology, which some people fear could be threatening American airspace. Former Pentagon official Luis Elizondo, retired U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Timothy Gallaudet, independent journalist Michael Shellenberger and former NASA official Michael Gold all testified before the committee. The experts were questioned by committee members on a number of topics surrounding UAPs and what many lawmakers consider a lack of transparency by the federal government on the subject. What is the Langley AFB Incident? Security around Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia was increased after a Wall Street Journal report detailed more than a dozen cases of drones flying over the military installation in late 2023. What UAP witnesses recommend for congressional action The report suggested that the cases took place over a 17-day period when unidentified drones flew over the base where F-22 Raptor stealth fighters are based. The report indicated that at this time, it remains unknown whether the drone presence equates to a threat to the nation’s security. That led committee members to ask experts Wednesday to link the presence of UAPs and military installation sites like Langley. 'There’s definitely enough data out there to suggest that there is certainly some sort of relations between sensitive U.S. military installations and also our nuclear equities and also some of our Department of Energy sites,' Elizondo testified when asked about the 2023 incident. 'There is a long historical record … that demonstrates this. This is not a new trend. This has been going on for decades, and this information has been obfuscated, unfortunately, from (lawmakers). 'I think that’s problematic because ultimately, at the end of the day, we have a significant situation here. We have something that can enter into U.S. airspace completely with no attribution.' Gallaudet said there were other instances of drones over Langley before the Wall Street Journal brought the details of the 2023 activity to light. In addition, he said there is evidence to suggest other incidents took place in and around other U.S. military installations over the past 50 years. Elizondo added that he believes that while UAPs may be targeting U.S. military installations, it is possible there is also greater technology being used to monitor the presence of UAPs. He said that there is a program within the Department of Defense and intelligence committee called IPB (Initial Preparations of the Battlespace) and that specific technologies are being used to prepare those locations. Elizondo added that there is a calculus of capabilities versus the intent of whether something rises to the level of a threat to national security that must be figured out. 'Certainly, if I were wearing my national security hat, even if there were a 2% chance that there was some sort of hostile intent here, that’s 2% higher than we can really accept,' Elizondo told committee members. Why was the 'Tic Tac' video not released? House committee members also questioned experts about the 'Tic Tac' incident that took place in 2004. On Nov. 14 of that year, U.S. Navy aviators were sent to intercept a UAP that resembled the popular breath mint due to its shape and color. Pentagon officials have since struggled to explain what happened. What is the Pentagon’s alleged ‘Immaculate Constellation’ program? When asked why video of the incident was not released, Gallaudet testified he does not believe there is 'any good reason' for the Department of Defense to withhold important information and data from Congress. He said that is especially the case when matters of national security are involved. 'I will speculate that they don’t want to share that kind of information because it reveals weaknesses in our ability to monitor and protect our airspace,' Gallaudet said. Gallaudet testified Wednesday that earlier this year, he met with the Department of Defense’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office in what he said turned out to be an hourslong influence operation on the retired U.S. Navy rear admiral. Gallaudet said the committee attempted to convince him of the validity of the 'very flawed and error-ridden' historical records report. The group also attempted, he said, to have the former Navy officer question incidents like 'Tic Tac' and to get him to admit 'Tic Tac' was American technology. What are the threats UAPs could pose? As the House committee exploring UAP continues to push for transparency and answers, the biggest question surrounding the phenomena is what kind of threat they pose to national security and if foreign countries could be behind them. Gallaudet said during his testimony that he believes Wednesday’s hearing should be used as a catalyst 'to improve and bolster' the country’s air defense capabilities as well as its maritime awareness capabilities. He said that between 2020 and 2022, a government task force that investigated UAPs in the Department of Defense was active, but it is now inactive. During their testimony, the group of experts all called for more whole-of-government efforts that could provide answers about the origins of UAPs and the threat they may pose to national security. 'Obviously, there’s holes in it,' Gallaudet said. 'Whether it be UAP of nonhuman (intelligence) direction or China or any other adversary.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/uap-threat-national-security-airspace/	2024-11-13T14:24:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/AARO-UAPS-sighting-Nexstar-4212023.png?w=900
Pete Hegseth: What to know about Trump's pick for Defense Secreta...	(NewsNation) — Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Pete Hegseth as the next Secretary of Defense has gotten a lot of attention. While some praised the 44-year-old current co-host of Fox News Channel’s 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend,' others criticized Hegseth as lacking experience. If confirmed by the Senate, Hegseth would be the second youngest Secretary of Defense, after Donald Rumsfeld, who was confirmed in 1975 at the age of 43. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First,' Trump said in a statement Tuesday. 'With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice — Our military will be great again, and America will Never back down.' Pete Hegseth’s time in the military, Fox News Hegseth served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and did tours in Afghanistan and Iraq after graduating from Princeton University in 2003. He earned two Bronze stars. Formerly head of the Concerned Veterans for America, which the Associated Press writes is backed by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, Hegseth ran for U.S. Senate in Minnesota in 2012, but lost his race. Hegseth has been contributing to the Fox News Channel for a decade. A Fox News spokesperson. to the AP, said Hegseth's 'insights and analysis especially about the military resonated deeply with our viewers.' DNC staffers resign with Kamala Harris campaign $20M in debt He is an author of books including, 'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.' Pete and his wife Jenny live in Middle Tennessee and have seven children, according to his website. Pete Hegseth on women in military Comments Hegseth made on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' about women in combat are getting a lot of attention. 'I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles,' Hegseth said. 'It hasn't made us more effective, it hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.' While Hegseth said he's served with women and they've been 'great,' institutions shouldn't have to 'incentivize' that in positions where 'men are more capable.' Pete Hegseth walks to an elevator for a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York, Dec. 15, 2016. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) Pete Hegseth criticizes 'woke' military In his book, Hegseth wrote that the next president of the United States needs to radically overhaul Pentagon senior leadership to make us ready to defend our nation and defeat our enemies. 'Lots of people need to be fired,' Hegseth wrote, according to Reuters. Trump in June told Fox News he would fire generals he called 'woke.' Hegseth has decried so-called programs that promote equity and inclusion, and previously accused the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General C.Q. Brown, of 'pursuing the radical positions of left-wing politicians.' Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump When Trump was creating his first cabinet, he reportedly considered Hegseth to be head of the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2016, the AP wrote, and then again in 2018 when Secretary David Shulkin faced criticism before being ousted. Hegseth confirmed on a podcast last week that he was interviewed multiple times for the VA position in 2016. 'Ultimately I think (Trump) thought I was a little young,' Hegseth said during his appearance on 'The Shawn Ryan Show.' In 2019, Hegseth encouraged Trump to pardon U.S. service members accused of war crimes on his Fox News show, and said on social media that the President-elect doing so 'would be amazing.' This was despite warnings from U.S. officials and organizations that it would damage the military justice system's integrity. Trump ultimately pardoned a former U.S. Army commando set to stand trial in the killing of a suspected Afghan bomb-maker and a former Army lieutenant convicted of murder for ordering his men to fire upon three Afghans, killing two. Years before that, on a 2015 'Fox &amp; Friends' segment on the 240th anniversary of the Army’s founding, Hegseth went viral when he struck a master sergeant in the arm with an ax. Both he and Fox News were named in a lawsuit that was discontinued in 2019, according to the AP. UFOs ‘enigmatic and frustrating:’ witness says in House hearing Reactions to Hegseth’s appointment Sources NewsNation has spoken to are shocked at his being tapped by Trump to lead the Department of Defense, echoing criticisms that he is inexperienced. Retired Army Major General William Enyart told NewsNation that if Hegseth is confirmed, U.S. adversaries will view Hegseth as a 'pretty boy from TV.' 'Trump picking Pete Hegseth is the most hilariously predictably stupid thing,' Former U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., said on X. Speaking on CNN’s Anderson Cooper, though, Kingziner called Hegseth 'very smart when it comes to things like defense policy.' Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he's concerned Hegseth won't be able to tackle Pentagon bureaucracy. Report names ‘Immaculate Constellation’ UAP program: Journalist 'I confess I didn’t know who he was until 20 minutes ago,' Smith told reporters, according to POLITICO. 'And he certainly doesn’t seem to have any background whatsoever in DOD policy.' Speaking to The Hill, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass, a former Marine Corps officer said he believes Hegseth is 'going to try very hard to politicize the military.' 'That’s been his MO at Fox News and in his variety of positions since he got out of the National Guard as well, and so that’s not going to be a good influence,' Moulton said in an interview with The Hill. However, Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla, who will also become a new member of Trump's administration as national security adviser, said Hegseth is going to be a leader who has the grit to bring 'real reform' to the Pentagon. 'Congratulations to my friend @PeteHegseth — a combat decorated veteran — and let’s re-establish deterrence through America’s strength,' Waltz said. NewsNation reached out to Trump's team for comment on the backlash Hegseth has gotten. In response, they sent back Trump's initial statement announcing the pick, in which the President-elect says Hegseth will be a 'courageous and patriotic champion' of his 'Peace through Strength' policy.

What is Elon Musk's plan for DOGE?	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk has been tapped to lead a new advisory group on government spending in Donald Trump’s second administration, and the tech entrepreneur has been dropping breadcrumbs on what he plans to do. President-elect Trump announced Tuesday that Musk, along with Vivek Ramaswamy, would lead his 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE), an initiative meant to 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? There is still little known about DOGE, but in a statement shared by Trump, Musk said it will 'send shockwaves through the system and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!' What is DOGE or Department of Government Efficiency? The Department of Government Efficiency is a new initiative put forth by Trump once he takes office in January. Trump said that DOGE would 'provide advice and guidance from outside of government' and partner with the White House Office of Budget and Management (OMB) to drive large-scale structural reform. 'It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time. Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of 'DOGE' for a very long time,' the president-elect added. The Manhattan Project was a secret World War II government program to develop and deploy the world’s first atomic weapons. The idea appeared to have come from Musk, who discussed the need for a 'government efficiency commission' while campaigning alongside Trump. The president-elect said DOGE’s work will 'conclude' no later than July 4, 2026, in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. What are Elon Musk’s plans for DOGE? Musk has provided some tidbits on what could be in store for DOGE since Trump’s announcement on the agency. 'Incentives matter. There should be rewards for wise spending, but those who waste taxpayer funds cannot be allowed to keep doing so without consequences,' Musk posted on X of DOGE on Wednesday, hinting that cuts will be imminent under his guidance. Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security He also said the department would provide 'maximum transparency' and that all of DOGE’s actions will be posted online. 'Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know!' Musk posted. Musk also said that DOGE would create a 'leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending' of tax dollars, which he said would be 'extremely tragic and extremely entertaining.' While Trump has given DOGE less than 18 months to complete its work, Musk said Wednesday that it 'will be done much faster.' One item that might be on Musk’s chopping block is the defense budget, which the billionaire called 'pretty gigantic' in a video posted on the X account of a PAC founded by Musk that he reshared on Tuesday.

This is not sustainable. That's why we need the Department of Government Efficiency,' he said in the video. Musk had floated the idea of a government efficiency department before Trump’s win while on the campaign trail, telling voters it was time to 'drain the swamp.' During an October Trump rally in Pennsylvania, Musk said, 'We're going to bankrupt the country' without lowering government spending, adding that it would take 'some pretty big moves.' What Trump’s administration could mean for education Musk also spoke at the controversial Madison Square Garden rally in New York leading up to the election and told crowds there that he wants to cut at least $2 trillion in federal spending. 'All government spending is taxation ... your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that,' Musk said What is Vivek Ramaswamy's role in DOGE? Pharmaceutical entrepreneur Ramaswamy, who was one of Trump's most vocal supporters, was tasked to run DOGE alongside Musk. 'DOGE is ready to help the U.S. government conform to the U.S. Constitution once again. @elonmusk and I are ready to serve,' he posted. He added, 'We will not go gently @elonmusk.'

Scott Applewhite) During his own unsuccessful bid for the presidential nomination, Ramaswamy campaigned on eliminating federal agencies, including the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Education Department; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and the Food and Nutrition Service within the Agriculture Department. What to know about Trump’s inauguration On Wednesday, he posted on X that 'DOGE will soon begin crowdsourcing examples of government waste, fraud, &amp; and abuse. Americans voted for drastic government reform &amp; they deserve to be part of fixing it,' on X. Is there a connection between DOGE and Dogecoin? Cryptocurrency dogecoin has been surging in value since Trump named Musk as one of the heads of DOGE, as the acronym plays on the same word usage as the memecoin and is also the ticker symbol under which dogecoin trades. The close word association has generated increased excitement around the cryptocurrency, which Musk has promoted in the past. Dogecoin was trading at $0.4006 on Wednesday, an increase of more than 15% in the past 24 hours and 121% over the last week, reported Quartz. The cryptocurrency became associated with Musk after he played a character on 'Saturday Night Live' who went by the nickname the 'Dogefather.' He has also called it his favorite cryptocurrency. In 2022, Musk became more closely associated with dogecoin after he suggested Twitter should perhaps accept it as payment for subscriptions. He continued promoting dogecoin on various platforms, leading to its inclusion in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, the outlet reported.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musks-trump-doge-ramaswamy/	2024-11-13T11:24:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2176138679.jpg?w=900
What UAP witnesses recommend for congressional action	Join Ross Coulthart for a LIVE Q&amp;A on NewsNation’s YouTube, X and Facebook pages at 4p/3C today following a House hearing on UAPs. Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and Retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. Shellenberger will join Elizabeth Vargas Reports at 5p/4C to recap today’s hearing. Find out how to watch at JoinNN.com. (NewsNation) — The four witnesses who testified before a U.S. House of Representatives committee on unidentified anomalous phenomena, aka UFOs, all presented possible solutions as federal lawmakers search for answers about the government’s role in providing more transparency in the possible existence of UAPs. The witnesses took part in a hearing entitled 'Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,' which is part of the committee’s ongoing efforts to provide more information about what the government knew or didn’t know about UAPs. Lue Elizondo Elizondo, a former Pentagon insider, testified during the hearing that the following recommendations need to be made moving forward. Scientists hunt for signs of life beyond earth The former Pentagon official said that America’s greatness depends on three elements: a watchful Congress, a responsive executive branch and an informed public. He proposed the three principal actions: Congress and the president should create a single point of contact responsible for a whole-of-government approach to the UAP issue. He said that the White House, CIA, NASA, the Pentagon, the U.S. Department of Energy and others currently play a role, but no one seems to be in charge. This, he said, has led to unchecked power and corruption. A national UAP strategy needs to be developed to promote transparency and help restore the American public’s trust at a time when trust is at an all-time low, he said. He said the strategy should include a whole-of-government approach, including the academic and scientific communities, the private sector and international partners and allies. Congress should create a protected environment so that whistleblowers, who he said are desperate to do the right thing, can come forward without fear. Elizondo said that whistleblowers suffer because of stigma, a code of silence and concerns over forms of retaliation. He said policies and procedures should ensure protection for whistleblowers. For those who refuse to cooperate, lawmakers should wield subpoena power against hostile witnesses and prevent additional funding to those UAP efforts that remain hidden from congressional oversight. Timothy Gallaudet The retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and former acting undersecretary and assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere testified in the hearing that he wants Congress to take the following action: Establish proper oversight of the executive branch’s management of UAP programs, information and materials Pass provisions of the UAP Disclosure Act involving the UAP Records Review Board into law After the UAP Disclosure Act is passed, Congress should consider strengthening it in a future reauthorization with additional provisions to establish a whole-of-government approach to UAP. Michael Shellenberger The independent journalist, who has written extensively about 'Immaculate Constellation,' testified during Wednesday's hearing that members of Congress have expressed growing frustration since 2021 over the military and intelligence community’s refusal to reveal 'concrete' information. The ‘tic tac’ incident: Inside one of the most consequential UFO encounters of all time Congressional leaders are seeking to expand upon the UAP transparency legislation that was passed in 2023. The UAP Disclosure Act would force the military, intelligence community and any private entity to turn over recovered 'technologies of unknown origin' and associated 'biological materials' and provide all UAP records to an independent review board for potential public disclosure, he said. The legislation would also expand protections for whistleblowers and require the Government Accountability Office to review the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office's work. He added that while it is clear UAPs remain mysterious, it’s clear that the U.S. government is not being straight with the American people. He also called on Congress to work with President-elect Donald Trump to make government more transparent and release long-held secrets on everything from COVID origins to files associated with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and UAPs. Michael Gold The former NASA official testified that his former organization could assist in the process of providing more information about UAPs by doing the following: Review archival data Combat the stigmatization of UAP Reach out to international partners Solicit, archive, review and release civil and commercial UAP data 'In much as the same way that AARO is responsible for collecting UAP data for the national security community, NASA could serve a similar role for civilian and commercial operators,' Gold testified Wednesday. 'Of course, a dramatic difference would be the data collected by NASA would be open to all, and the agency would continue its historic dedication to transparency and sharing scientific discoveries with the nation and world.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/uap-witnesses-congressional-action/	2024-11-13T10:52:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/01/snapshot-2024-01-09T183232.833.jpg?w=900
