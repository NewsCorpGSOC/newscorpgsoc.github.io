Trump to target critical race theory, promote school choice	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Wednesday that would defund K-12 schools that teach radical gender ideology or critical race theory (CRT), according to White House documents obtained by NewsNation. According to the documents, the goal is to shift focus back to 'excellence and patriotism,' preparing students to become 'patriotic citizens ready for the workforce, not political activists.' The order mandates that within 90 days, the secretary of education must present a strategy to eliminate CRT and radical gender ideology in school lessons, the documents said.

Former President Joe Biden ended the commission within his first 100 days in office. The order also directs the U.S. attorney general to work with state attorneys general and local district attorneys to pursue action against teachers and school officials involved in sexual exploitation of minors or practicing 'social transition' without a license. Federal judge temporarily blocks Trump’s funding freeze Trump is also expected to sign an executive order empowering parents and students through school choice. 'The school choice executive order comes as new data shows our school system is failing,' a senior White House official told NewsNation. The order emphasizes parental authority in directing children's education and 'not the government.' It also instructs the Department of Education to provide guidance on using federal funds to support state-based K-12 scholarship programs, helping students attend schools that best meet their needs.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/trump-target-critical-race-theory-promote-school-choice/	2025-01-29T07:43:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195559727.jpg?w=900
Homan: Chicago ICE operation was 'outstanding'	(NewsNation) — 'Border czar' Tom Homan says recently executed operations in big cities were 'outstanding' and that agents arrested 'numerous' Tren de Aragua gang members. 'These are bad guys,' Homan told NewsNation's 'Morning in America' on Wednesday. 'Six hours in Chicago, and we made the city a lot safer.

RFK Jr. faces first confirmation hearing for health secretary	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, will face senators Wednesday for the first of two confirmation hearings. The hearing, set to take place before the Senate Finance Committee, is expected to focus on Kennedy's stances on vaccines and abortion. If confirmed, Kennedy will control a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees food and hospital inspections, hundreds of health clinics, vaccine recommendations and health insurance for roughly half the country. Wednesday's confirmation hearing is set to begin at 10 a.m. ET. Kennedy's second hearing is set for Thursday before the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee. What are RFK Jr.'s views on vaccines and abortion? Kennedy, a former 2024 Democratic presidential candidate who dropped out and endorsed Trump, has sparked concerns about his record of spreading misinformation regarding vaccines. He has made claims linking vaccines to autism and has said that 'no vaccine is safe and effective.' Federal judge temporarily blocks Trump’s funding freeze However, more recently, Kennedy has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, asserting he is not anti-vaccine and promising not to 'take away' shots if confirmed. Additionally, some Republicans are worried about Kennedy's past support of abortion rights. Former Vice President Mike Pence has suggested the Senate reject Kennedy based on his position. Caroline Kennedy slams RFK Jr. as a 'predator' Meanwhile, a searing letter to senators from Caroline Kennedy, daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, could bring fireworks. In the letter, Caroline Kennedy, former ambassador to Australia and Japan, called Kennedy a 'predator,' urging lawmakers to block his confirmation. She also made claims that he 'preys on the desperation of parents of sick children' and highlighted allegations of drug use and animal mutilation, warning he is addicted to power and thus disqualified from leading HHS. 'Unlike Bobby, I try not to speak for my father — but I am certain that he and my uncle Bobby, whogave their lives in public service, and my uncle Teddy, who devoted his Senate career to improvinghealth care, would be disgusted,' Caroline Kennedy wrote. Lara Trump: Caroline Kennedy’s comments on RFK Jr. ‘disgusting’ What are RJK Jr.'s chances of getting confirmed? Kennedy's confirmation remains uncertain, with some Republicans on both committees still not committing to a vote. He has received some support among Democrats for his stances on food regulations and removing dyes and additives.Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a physician and chair of the Senate Health Committee, has voiced concerns about Kennedy's past vaccine comments. He's said he's spoken with Kennedy but remains undecided. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who will participate in Wednesday's hearing, has raised concerns over Kennedy's abortion views. Other senators, including Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., have shown a willingness to support him. 'We don't agree on everything, but what we both agree is that America has some health problems, and we believe that the key to fixing that is nutrition, as well as decreasing their chronic exposure to toxins. So, I look forward to working with him,' Marshall said. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a polio survivor who has emphasized the importance of the vaccine, could be another key figure to watch.

Trump to Musk: 'Go get' Starliner astronauts from ISS	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump says he's told Elon Musk to retrieve two astronauts who have been stuck on the International Space Station for months longer than expected. It's unclear precisely what the plan is, since SpaceX was already slated to bring them home in March. Neither Trump nor Musk have clarified if the timing or mission have changed. 'I have just asked Elon Musk and @SpaceX to 'go get' the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration,' Trump posted on Truth Social on Tuesday night. 'They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!' Astronauts Sunita 'Suni' Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore rode a Boeing Starliner to the station in June 2024 for what was supposed to be an eight-day mission. But NASA had concerns about the Starliner after years of delays, plus leaks and thruster problems during its trip to the station, so it came back to Earth without them in September. SpaceX was planning to retrieve the pair in February aboard its Crew-9 capsule, but that was pushed back a month when NASA announced that crew's replacement would not make it to the station until March. 'This is my happy place. I love being up here in space,' Williams said when the vehicle left without them. 'This is not easy. NASA does a great job, the people at NASA do a great job making things look easy,' Wilmore said. 'It’s a very risky business, and things don’t always turn out the way you want.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/trump-musk-spacex-iss-starliner-astronauts/	2025-01-29T03:24:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/67522bf144c298.44822484.jpeg?w=900
Does bird flu make eggs unsafe to eat?	(NEXSTAR) — Eggs are expensive, if you can even find them at your local grocery store, and prices are only expected to climb this year. The main factor that has sent egg prices rising is the bird flu, which may draw a whole new concern to your mind: are eggs even safe to eat right now? Generally, yes. Are eggs cheaper under Trump? TikToker intends to hold administration accountable The U.S. Department of Agriculture also reports that the chances of eggs or poultry infected by the bird flu entering the food chain are 'extremely low.' A quick onset of symptoms in infected poultry, as well as flock testing and inspections, are able to reduce the likelihood of contaminated products reaching store shelves. Further, eggs, like poultry, that are prepared correctly and cooked properly are safe to consume, the USDA notes. That applies regardless of whether there's a bird flu outbreak or not. A sign asks customers to consider limiting their purchases of eggs at a PCC Community Markets grocery store due to shortages caused by avian flu on Jan. 27 in Seattle. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) When it comes to cooking, eggs and poultry should reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. This will kill bacteria and viruses, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains, including avian influenza A viruses. Storing eggs properly — aka, in the refrigerator — is also important. While eggs in the U.S. are pasteurized in the shell, killing bacteria on the shell, the process can make the porous shells more vulnerable to bacteria. Food prices increase 2.4% annually: Bureau Labor Statistics Eggs can be frozen, but not in their shells, the Food and Drug Administration warns. Instead, the egg yokes and whites should be beaten and stored together. Egg whites can also be frozen on their own. Uncooked or undercooked eggs (or meat) can put you at risk of being infected with other diseases. Eggs, in particular, can carry salmonella. Still, proper storage and cooking can help protect you, officials explain. So far, most of the U.S.'s 67 confirmed cases of bird flu in humans have been linked to exposure from infected dairy cows. About two dozen were linked to infected poultry and one to a backyard flock, NewsNation affiliate The Hill previously reported. Earlier this month, the CDC confirmed the first human death linked to the virus. The CDC has recommended hospitals speed up testing patients seeking care for the flu for H5N1 bird flu while insisting the risk of humans becoming ill is low.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/bird-flu-eggs-expensive-unsafe/	2025-01-29T02:49:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25027861626893-e1738100231551.jpg?w=800
Lara Trump: Caroline Kennedy's comments on RFK Jr. 'disgusting'	(NewsNation) — Caroline Kennedy's attack on cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is 'part of that political game,' Lara Trump said during a Tuesday appearance on 'CUOMO.' Caroline Kennedy posted a video reading a scathing letter to senators about her family member, in which she called the Trump administration nominee a 'predator' who is distorting his father's legacy to 'advance his own failed presidential campaign.' Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law and former co-chair of the Republican National Committee, believes the letter is just 'sour grapes' from a family of longtime Democrats. ‘He’ll go down’: RFK nomination won’t pass Senate, O’Reilly says 'There is no doubt that the reason Caroline Kennedy came out with this video in the time frame that she did was because she was probably encouraged by the Democrats to do it,' she said. The comments come ahead of RFK Jr.'s appearance before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee this week, part of the path to confirmation as President Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Lara Trump told NewsNation she doesn't think Caroline Kennedy's comments will change his confirmation chances. 'I think that everybody should watch the confirmation hearing, listen to the answers that he delivers, and take them at face value ... So, I don't think it will be any different,' she said. Public confidence in US health agencies declines, survey says Caroline Kennedy calls RFK Jr. a 'predator' In a video posted to X, Kennedy said that her cousin 'lacks any relevant government, financial, management or medical experience' to qualify him to lead the nation’s health agencies — but added that his 'personal qualities' pose 'even greater concern.' 'I have known Bobby my whole life; we grew up together. It’s no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator,' she wrote in a letter to the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Finance and HELP committees. Pence group uses Trump’s criticism against RFK Jr. in new ad 'I watched his younger brothers and cousins follow him down the path of drug addiction. His basement, his garage, and his dorm room were the centers where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks. It was often a perverse sense of despair and violence,' she wrote. Kennedy said she hadn’t previously denounced her cousin’s nomination because she had been U.S. ambassador to Australia and was also reluctant to publicly criticize a family member.

Public confidence in US health agencies declines, survey says	(NewsNation) — Public confidence in U.S. health agencies has dropped over the past 18 months, according to a new survey that also indicates some skepticism about President Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary. Fifty-three percent of the public said they trust the Food and Drug Administration to make accurate recommendations about health matters at least 'a fair amount' of the time, the Kaiser Family Foundation poll said. That’s down from 65% in June 2023 as the pandemic was ending, the organization said. Similarly, the share of people who said they trust their state and local public health officials fell from 64% in 2023 to 54% now, the survey said. Trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped from 66% to 61% over the same time frame. ‘He’ll go down’: RFK nomination won’t pass Senate, O’Reilly says The catch: The survey compilers found that people’s trust in health institutions tended to fall along party lines, with Democrats showing greater support for them, Republicans showing less and independents in the middle. Partisanship also factors into responses about President Trump, whose first term coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, and Kennedy, who has faced criticisms for his stances on vaccines and other health issues. Caroline Kennedy tells senators: RFK Jr. is a ‘predator’ The overall public trust in Trump and Kennedy to make the right recommendations on health issues was a little over 40%. The level of trust for both of them, however, was more than 80% among Republicans, the survey said. Kennedy faces his first confirmation hearings in the Senate beginning Wednesday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/public-confidence-drop-health-agencies/	2025-01-28T17:44:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/676df134764ef6.96609821.jpeg?w=900
Border officials anticipate escalation in cartel threats	(NewsNation) — The region of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas where suspected members of Mexican drug cartels exchanged gunfire with U.S. border officials Monday has been targeted by organized criminal organizations for drug and human smuggling for decades. But after no one was injured in an incident Monday when cartel members shot at Border Patrol agents, Lt. Christopher Olivarez, spokesperson for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said he only expects more incidents to follow. Olivarez told NewsNation on Tuesday that Fronton, Texas, the area where the gunfire exchange took place, is one of the 'most active, violent' border regions that agents patrol. Was there an ICE raid at Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego? 'For decades, the Mexican drug cartels have used that area to facilitate drug smuggling, human smuggling,' Olivarez said. Olivarez said that in 2023, the state acquired a 123-acre parcel of land that was being used by cartels to seek refuge for criminal operations. Now, he said the state is investigating whether it can obtain the area where Monday’s gunfire exchange took place to keep incidents like Monday’s from taking place. 'We have seen encounters with the cartels where they do engage law enforcement. They shoot toward them,' he said. However, Olivarez said that as the crackdown on the U.S-Mexico border under President Donald Trump continues, he expects conditions could worsen. He said that as illegal border crossings drop under Trump, the cartels will have their bottom line impacted. 'With that, we expect to see an escalation in threats,' Olivarez told NewsNation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/border-escalation-cartel-threats/	2025-01-28T14:18:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GiWjQD4XEAALF34.jpg?w=360
Medicaid portals down in all 50 states: US senator	(NewsNation) — Medicaid portals are reportedly down in all 50 states after the Trump administration ordered a pause on federal grants, loans and other programs beginning on Tuesday as the administration begins a review of federal spending. U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, posted on social media that his staff confirmed that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states. 'NEW: My staff has confirmed reports that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states following last night's federal funding freeze. This is a blatant attempt to rip away health insurance from millions of Americans overnight and will get people killed,' Wyden wrote on X. Drones sighted in Northeast ‘not a threat’: White House When asked specifically if Medicaid would be affected by the pause, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt replied, 'I'll check back on that and get back to you.' A short time later, Leavitt posted on social media that the White House is aware of the Medicaid website portal outage. 'We have confirmed no payments have been affected,' Leavitt wrote on X. 'They are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly.' What is Medicaid? Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that helps cover medical costs for some people with limited income and resources, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency said that Medicaid offers benefits that Medicare does not normally cover such as nursing home care and personal care services. Medicaid recipients typically do not pay anything for covered medical expenses but may owe a small co-payment for some items or services. As of October, more than 72 million Americans were enrolled in Medicaid, according to data. What is the difference between Medicaid and Medicare? Medicare is federal health insurance for Americans who are ages 65 and older as well as for some people who are under 65 but suffer from certain disabilities or conditions, the Department of Health and Human Services said. Medicare is run by a federal agency known as the Centers for Medical and Medicaid Services. Medicare, because it is a federal program, has set standards for costs and coverage. This guarantees that a person's Medicare coverage will be the same regardless of where they live. White House press briefing discusses federal assistance, deportation Medicare-related bills are paid from two trust funds that are held by the U.S. Treasury, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The trust funds are sourced with payroll taxes and other funds that are authorized by Congress. Medicare recipients pay a portion of the costs through monthly premiums for medical and drug coverage, deductibles and co-insurance. As of March 2023, nearly 66 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare, according to data. Who qualifies for Medicaid? According to Medicaid.gov, federal law requires that states cover certain groups of individuals. This includes low-income families, qualified women who are preganant and children as well as Americans who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Individual states also have additional options for Medicaid coverage and may choose to extend coverage to other groups such as residents who receive home and community-based services or children who are in foster care who otherwise are not eligible for coverage, the website said. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 provided the option for states to expand Medicaid to include nearly all low-income Americans who are under the age of 65. The website said that eligiblity for children was extended to at least 133% of the fedreal poverty level in every state. The Affordable Care Act also established new methods for determining Medicaid eligibility, which is based on Modified Adjusted Gross Income. This is a developing story.

Trump federal grant pause: Who could be affected?	(NewsNation) — The Trump administration is temporarily pausing grants, loans and other federal financial assistance starting Tuesday, an order that's set off confusion among the many groups that depend on federal funds. The directive from the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Matthew Vaeth, was sent out Monday instructing federal agencies to temporarily pause 'all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.' Vaeth's memo was light on specifics but clarified that federal assistance to individuals, like Social Security and Medicare, would not be impacted. Instead, the order is intended to make sure federal funding is aligned with Trump's recent executive orders. Trump administration freezes nearly all federal loans and grants 'The use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,' Vaeth wrote. The pause, set to take effect Tuesday at 5 p.m. ET, could affect trillions of dollars, potentially disrupting health care research, education funding and other such programs. The memo calls on agencies to submit 'detailed information on any programs, projects or activities subject to this pause' to OMB by February 10. Here's what to know. List: All of Trump’s executive orders on the economy Who will be affected by the pause? The funding pause could affect trillions of dollars, but it's still unclear which programs will be impacted and how. Vaeth's memo is full of carve-outs and says OMB may grant exceptions that allow Federal agencies to 'issue new awards' or 'take other actions' on a 'case-by-case basis.' 'The vague and contradictory language makes it hard to know if funding is imperiled for public schools, community health centers, state and local law enforcement, veterans’ housing, health care through Medicaid, public services on tribal lands, etc,' wrote Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. In fiscal year 2021, $2.8 trillion in federal funding was distributed to states, communities, tribal governments and other recipients using Census Bureau data. Some of the top federal assistance programs funded health care, nutrition, highways, housing, school lunches, child care and COVID-19 assistance. The federal budget provides about 30% of state revenue, making it the single largest source of revenue in many states, according to the Federal Funds Information for States (FFIS). Will Social Security and Medicare be impacted? The memo says that federal assistance to individuals won't be affected, meaning Social Security, Medicare, food stamps and other such programs won't change. 'Nothing in this memo should be construed to impact Medicare or Social Security benefits,' Vaeth wrote. However, Medicaid, the health care program for low-income people and families, is reportedly having issues. 'My staff has confirmed reports that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states following last night's federal funding freeze,' Oregon's senior US senator, Democrat Ron Wyden, wrote on X. What about student loans? The Education Department said the temporary pause does not impact assistance received directly by individuals, therefore students who rely on federal financial aid to cover tuition and other costs aren't expected to see any disruptions. 'Title IV, HEA funds that are provided to individual students, such as Federal Pell Grants and Direct Loans, are not impacted by yesterday’s guidance,' Madi Biedermann, spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education, told NewsNation. More than 40 million Americans have federal student loans, and about 7 million students receive Pell Grants each year in the United States. The Association of American Universities (AAU), composed of roughly 70 research universities, told NewsNation it's still working to assess the potential impact on research funding. Will the pause go into effect? The pause is scheduled to take effect at 5 p.m. ET on Tuesday, but a coalition of state attorneys general plans to file suit to block the order. New York Attorney General Letitia James is leading the charge and plans to ask a Manhattan federal court to intervene. 'My office will be taking imminent legal action against this administration's unconstitutional pause on federal funding,' James wrote on social media Tuesday. Other states joining the suit are California, Illinois, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, according to The New York Times. Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell, a Democrat, called Trump's directive 'a reckless abuse of power.' 'This will hurt families. We're exploring prompt action to stop it,' Campbell said on X. This is a developing story that will continue to be updated.

Rumors and speculation circulated about the origin of large drones seen in the skies above New Jersey and other states, with fears they could originate from foreign adversaries. President Donald Trump vowed to get to the bottom of the issue and in a White House press briefing on Tuesday, the administration said the drones are no threat and are properly licensed by the FAA.

What to know about White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt	Karoline Leavitt is set on Tuesday to preside over her first briefing with reporters as press secretary for President Trump’s White House. Leavitt was Trump's top spokesperson along the 2024 campaign trail and has been one of his chief messengers during the early days of his second administration. Live: White House press briefing Here are four things to know about Leavitt ahead of her first briefing. Leavitt is the youngest person to ever serve in the role Leavitt, 27, is the youngest person to hold the position of press secretary since Ron Ziegler, who worked as President Nixon’s top press official and was 29 when he was hired. She was widely viewed as the favorite to land the press secretary gig. Several former Trump officials told The Hill after she was hired that Leavitt was the obvious choice, given her record defending Trump on the campaign trail and close relationship with the president. On Tuesday, she will be tasked with defending a flood of executive orders and actions handed down during Trump's first week in office and promoting the administration's agenda before what is expected to be a widely televised audience. Leavitt has teased a briefing room shake up Like other top allies of the president, Leavitt has suggested the White House could change the way business in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room is conducted or who gets to ask questions during press conferences. Leavitt has said during a number of media appearances she looks forward to taking questions from mainstream media reporters and will not be shy about pushing back on assertions or premises she disagrees with. 5 takeaways from Trump’s whirlwind week back at the White House 'We hope there will be decorum, certainly, and we will try to instill that,' she said during a Fox News appearance last month. 'But we’re not shy of the hostile media.' Leavitt worked in Trump's first White House Before joining Trump’s 2024 campaign, Leavitt was a top aide to Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), another Trump ally whom he chose to serve as ambassador to the United Nations. Leavitt served as a press aide and speechwriter for Trump during his first administration under former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who is now a Fox News host. McEnany has spoken glowingly about Leavitt's fitness for the role. Here are the 5 biggest issues facing the new Trump administration On Tuesday, Leavitt will find herself in the national spotlight as Trump's presidency enters its second week. Leavitt ran for Congress After working in Trump's first White House, Leavitt ran an unsuccessful 2022 campaign for New Hampshire’s 1st District, after winning a contested GOP primary.

Chicago will 'not forfeit our humanity': Mayor	(NewsNation) — An invitation for Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson to appear before the House Oversight Committee is under legal review, according to the city's legal counsel. Appearing at a news conference Tuesday, Johnson said Chicago is standing firm in its status as a 'welcoming city' and will not be made to forfeit its humanity. 'We will not surrender that,' he said. ICE reports 3,500 arrests in first week of Trump’s presidency Immigration actions in Chicago The city's legal counsel said an invitation for Johnson to appear before Congress is under review but did not comment further on how the city might respond. Johnson detailed efforts to empower citizens, including the publication of 'Know Your Rights' guides and working with community organizations, schools, hospitals, businesses and houses of worship to ensure the needs of those groups are being met. So far, Johnson said there is no evidence that people have failed to report crimes because of fear of deportation. He said that no one should fear coming forward if they are a victim of a crime because they do not have documents. He urged citizens to familiarize themselves with the laws to protect themselves and their neighbors. City officials said they believe 100 people in the greater Chicagoland area have been detained as a result of immigration actions. Johnson also noted that people without documents who have been convicted of serious crimes have always been subject to deportation and reiterated that being a welcoming city simply means city authorities do not do the work of immigration enforcement that falls under the duty of the federal government. Trump administration freezes nearly all federal loans and grants 'We stand together firmly in our welcoming city status as well as our commitment to protecting all residents of the city of Chicago no matter where you come from or how long you've lived here,' Johnson said. Federal funding freeze Johnson also addressed the freeze put on federal financial assistance, noting that it could affect a wide variety of services that people rely on. The city said the order is under legal review to determine exactly what impact it will have on projects and funding. 'There's a real goal here to sow fear into the American people,' Johnson said. Johnson said President Donald Trump has failed to address the concerns of everyday Americans worried about how to afford rent, child care and groceries, all of which could be impacted by the freeze. 'There's no answer from this administration,' Johnson said, regarding Americans' concerns over basic needs. City officials said since the election, they have been working on ways to continue to protect and serve residents during changes put into place by the new administration. Mass deportations could hinder US agriculture 'I wish I had a better understanding of why this administration has shown such disdain for the working people,' Johnson said. He noted that American taxpayers expect a return on their tax dollars in the form of investment in society and programs that help people meet basic needs like child care and housing.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/chicago-not-forfeit-humanity-mayor/	2025-01-28T09:56:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/GettyImages-2152121318.jpg?w=900
Live: White House press briefing	(NewsNation) — New White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses the media from the White House for the first time now as President Donald Trump's administration carries out his deportation promises. Trump is telling members of his party that he will push to allow for the deportation of repeat criminal offenders who are in the country legally. He says it will cause crime nationwide to 'dry up.' 'I also will be seeking permission to do so,' Trump said during an address of House Republicans at their annual policy retreat in Florida on Monday. 'We're going to get approval, hopefully, to get them the hell out of our country, along with others, let them be brought to a foreign land and maintained by others for a very small fee, as opposed to being maintained in our jails for massive amounts of money.' ICE reports 3,500 arrests in first week of Trump’s presidency 'That's what Venezuela and other countries are doing. They're getting rid of their criminals and putting them into the United States of America,' Trump said. Deportation flights to Colombia have begun after its president caved to Trump's wishes to allow the transportation of migrants illegally in the U.S. amid the threat of tariffs and other measures. The Pentagon has moved 1,500 U.S. troops to the border, bringing the total of forces along the border to nearly 4,000. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on X on Monday night: 'This is only just the beginning. We will get 100% OPERATIONAL CONTROL of our nation’s border. It is about time.' White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt shared images on X of U.S. soldiers and Marines at the southern border, accompanied by a message: 'Promise Made. Promise Kept.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-deportation-repeat-criminal-legally-us/	2025-01-28T08:02:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195559727.jpg?w=900
No one injured after Border Patrol, cartel shootout in Texas	(NewsNation) — U.S. Border Patrol was involved in a shootout with cartel members in the Rio Grande Valley, the Texas Department of Public Safety says. The tense moments unfolded Monday in Fronton, Texas. At around 1:40 p.m, shots were fired from the Mexican side of the border at agents. The Border Patrol agents took cover, returned fire, and called for backup. Drone footage from Texas DPS shows suspected cartel members fleeing after firing the shots. No one was injured on either side. Department of Homeland Security sources tell NewsNation the cartel members were attempting to smuggle a group across the river, but they did not make it onto U.S. soil. What is the minimum income to file this year’s tax return? An investigation into the incident is ongoing. U.S. agents are working closely with Mexican authorities. At this time, no arrests have been made. 'The State of Texas will continue to monitor the area closely and use every resource available to prevent transnational threats to our law enforcement partners and the homeland,' Texas DPS spokesperson Lt. Chris Olivarez said on X. Texas National Guard sent to Rio Grande Valley The Rio Grande Valley is a place notorious for cartel activity and human smuggling. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deployed 400 additional Texas National Guard troops to the area. They arrived in McAllen on Monday from the Texas Technical Border Force unit. The Border Force Unite was launched in 2023 as part of Texas’ operation Lone Star initiative. Border Patrol agents on the ground in the Rio Grande Valley say they welcome the additional manpower and support.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/border-patrol-cartel-shootout/	2025-01-28T07:24:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GiWjQD4XEAALF34.jpg?w=360
Trump administration freezes nearly all federal loans and grants	(The Hill) - The Trump administration late Monday directed federal agencies to pause the disbursement of loans and grants while the government conducts a review to ensure spending aligns with President Trump’s agenda. A memo issued by acting director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Matthew Vaeth directs federal agencies to temporarily pause 'all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.' 'This temporary pause will provide the Administration time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the President’s priorities,' the memo states. The memo indicates that Social Security or Medicare benefits should not be impacted, nor should assistance that is provided directly to individuals. The pause goes into effect at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, according to the memo, which was reviewed by The Hill. OMB may grant exceptions for certain awards on a case-by-case basis, the memo states. Federal agencies are instructed to conduct a review to determine whether federal loan and grant programs are impacted by Trump’s wave of executive orders during his first week in office. Those orders were related to border security, the federal workforce, ending the 'weaponization' of government, the military and other aspects of government. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the memo. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) lambasted the move in a statement late Monday, saying the pause on federal disbursements 'blatantly disobeys the law' and expressing skepticism that it is just a temporary hold. 'Congress approved these investments and they are not optional; they are the law. These grants help people in red states and blue states, support families, help parents raise kids, and lead to stronger communities,' Schumer said. 'Donald Trump’s Administration is jeopardizing billions upon billions of community grants and financial support that help millions of people across the country,' he added. 'It will mean missed payrolls and rent payments and everything in between: chaos for everything from universities to non-profit charities.' Trump and his nominee to lead OMB, Russ Vought, have signaled they may seek to expand presidential authority over the agency. Trump has also talked about challenging the Impoundment Control Act by using presidential authority to hold back certain funding appropriated by Congress.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-freezes-federal-loans-grants/	2025-01-28T06:00:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/trump_donald_02142025_GettyImages-2195057904-e1738062162228.jpg?w=900
ICE reports 3,500 arrests in first week of Trump's presidency	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents say they made nearly 1,200 arrests Monday, setting a new record since President Donald Trump reintroduced his 'zero tolerance' policy on illegal immigration after returning to the White House last week. The surge in arrests came as Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited New York City on Tuesday and as ICE operations extended across major U.S. cities, including Chicago, Miami, Phoenix and Atlanta. Raids have also been reported in Los Angeles and Denver. Noem shared a video on X showing one of the arrests with the caption, 'Criminal alien with kidnapping, assault &amp; burglary charges is now in custody' and added, 'Dirtbags like this will continue to be removed from our streets.' More than 1,500 active-duty troops at southern border Since Trump's return to the White House, ICE agents have reportedly arrested more than 3,500 undocumented migrants, with more than half occurring since raids began over the weekend. Aiding in these efforts are more than 1,500 active-duty troops along the southern border, joining some 2,500 National Guard and Army Reserve troops already deployed in the area. What's happening with ICE raids and the border under Trump? Tom Homan, Trump's 'border czar,' emphasized these efforts are just the beginning. 'President Trump's going to secure the borders as promised to the American people. We're going to enforce immigration law. So that's what we're going to do, without apology. We're on board, we're going to go forward, you're going to see it get a hell of a lot bigger in the near future,' he said. However, not everyone supports Trump's tough new immigration measures. Quaker groups have filed a lawsuit aimed at blocking ICE agents from raiding 'sensitive locations,' such as houses of worship, playgrounds and hospitals, without approval from supervisors. This marks the first legal challenge to Trump's policies from a faith-based organization. Congress targets sanctuary cities Meanwhile, members of Congress are starting to push back against local leaders who refuse to cooperate with Trump's deportation efforts. The House Oversight Committee sent letters to the mayors of Chicago, Boston, New York and Denver, requesting more information about their efforts to assist with the raids. DOJ fires prosecutors who worked on Trump criminal cases Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., chair of the committee, called for the mayors to testify before Congress next month. 'Congress must determine whether further legislation is necessary to enhance border security and public safety,' Comer said in a statement Monday. It is unclear whether the mayors will agree to appear before the committee.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/ice-arrests-in-trumps-first-week/	2025-01-28T04:19:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195569259.jpg?w=900
Google Maps to rename Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America'	Google said on Monday that it will change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America' in Google Maps once it is updated in the U.S. Geographic Names System. Google Maps will also change the name of Denali in Alaska to 'Mount McKinley.' 'We’ve received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We have a long-standing practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,' the company said in an X post. But users in other countries will see both names displayed on the map in line with a long-standing practice, the company said. Gulf of Whatnow? Trump’s geographic renaming plans leave mapmakers pondering what to do next President Donald Trump ordered the name changes the day of his inauguration last week, making good on his campaign promise. The federal government has since formally implemented the directive to rename both. The Gulf of Mexico change is new, but naming the nation’s highest peak has been a matter of debate for years. The Obama administration decided to formally name it Denali in 2015, the name that local Natives once used. Former President McKinley, for whom the mountain is once again named, never visited Alaska. His name was first used for the summit in an article written by a gold prospector in 1897 and was popularized after his 1901 assassination. NewsNation affiliate The Hill has reached out to Google for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/google-maps-rename-gulf-of-america/	2025-01-28T02:36:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-1185009222.jpg?w=900
ICE causing ‘state of terror’ in Chicago: Alderman Sigcho Lopez	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump's influx of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations is causing panic and hurting people in Chicago, said Byron Sigcho Lopez, the Democratic alderman for Chicago’s 25th Ward. On Sunday, Trump border czar Tom Homan and the acting deputy attorney general were in the city as ICE operations ramped up. It came just days after reports leaked of mass deportation raids planned in the sanctuary city. 'I think that to deploy the force of government against innocent people sends a chilling effect,' Sigcho Lopez told NewsNation. Dems take ‘government for granted’ on immigration: Chicago alderman '[It's] not something that a democratic president will do, but something the dictators do to bypass the constitutional rights to criminalize entire communities,' he added. Sigcho Lopez said that local businesses are reporting losses, parents aren't putting kids in school, and people are not going to hospitals or churches amid fear of ICE. He said that some 'MAGA fanatics' even harassed churchgoers in the ward. ICE now allowed to make arrests in and near churches and schools The alderman pointed to the pardoning of 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters as hypocritical, telling NewsNation that the hundreds of Oath Keepers and Proud Boys are facing less persecution than 'children who go to school.' Chicago and state officials, including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, have vowed to protect immigrant communities from mass deportations. Mayor Brandon Johnson shared on X: 'We’ve received reports of ICE enforcement activity in Chicago today. Please know that Chicago police were not involved. My team and I are working closely with City officials.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/ice-chicago-alderman-sigcho-lopez/	2025-01-27T15:52:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195569259.jpg?w=900
DOJ fires prosecutors who worked on Trump criminal cases	Justice Department officials fired several prosecutors who worked on President Trump's criminal cases, saying they could not 'trust' them. The move impacted at least a dozen prosecutors who worked both on Trump’s election interference case as well as another for improperly retaining records at Mar-a-Lago. Rumors about ICE raids stoke fear amid deportations 'Today, Acting Attorney General James McHenry terminated the employment of a number of DOJ officials who played a significant role in prosecuting President Trump,' a DOJ official said in a statement. 'In light of their actions, the Acting Attorney General does not trust these officials to assist in faithfully implementing the President’s agenda. This action is consistent with the mission of ending the weaponization of government.' CNN first reported the terminations. The firings come as The Wall Street Journal reported DOJ is likewise asking prosecutors who worked on the case of Jan. 6 defendants to turn over their files on those who were charged with felony obstruction under 1512(c)(2). That direction comes after the Supreme Court last year sided with a Jan. 6 defendant in determining the statute had been too broadly applied.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doj-prosecutors-trump-criminal-cases/	2025-01-27T14:00:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/doj_062724gn06_w.jpg?w=900
Bishop who enraged Trump says she was speaking from faith	(NewsNation) — Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde said she spoke from the 'foundation of her faith' and not a political perspective when she called upon President Donald Trump to have mercy for vulnerable communities during her inauguration sermon last week. 'I spoke to the president about the need for mercy, again a pretty solid Christian spiritual tenant … it feels pretty straightforward,' Budde told NewsNation's partner The Hill. 'If I were seen as partisan, I think that would be problematic, but given the way the country is divided, what I'm saying right now is perceived as partisan. 'But I'm not basing it on the Democratic Party. I'm basing it on my Christian faith and how I interpret what it means to be a follower of Jesus Christ.' Who is Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop who drew Trump’s ire at prayer service? The Episcopalian bishop of Washington was thrust into the national spotlight during Trump’s first week in office after she called on him to have compassion for transgender children and migrants at a National Cathedral prayer service for the inauguration. 'I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now,' she said. 'There are gay, lesbian, and transgender children in Democratic, Republican, and independent families, some who fear for their lives.' Trump, who sat alongside Vice President JD Vance and both their families, appeared annoyed, looking away from Budde at several points of her direct address to him. Her plea went viral and elicited a swift rebuke from the president, who called her 'nasty in tone' and 'not compelling or smart.' Trump called Budde a 'Radical Left hard line Trump hater' on his Truth Social site and demanded an apology for 'her inappropriate statements.' Trump demands apology from bishop who requested ‘mercy’ But Budde said she has nothing to apologize for. 'People have asked if I feel like I should apologize, and that would be apologizing for my understanding of the teachings of Jesus, and I just can't do that. ... I regret the reaction in the sense that it's an example of the very thing I was talking, that we needed to address ... which is the culture of contempt and the outrage that is fueled in our country.' Budde, who is Washington's first female diocesan bishop, is no novice in calling out Trump. The bishop joined other cathedral leaders in rebuking Trump’s 'racialized rhetoric' and blaming him for inciting violence on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to keep him in power. Most notably, she said she was 'outraged' in 2020 after Trump staged an appearance in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, which is near the White House. He held up a Bible after the area had been cleared of peaceful protesters. Still, she says she would be open to a conversation with Trump to discuss their opposing opinions. ' I would welcome that. I don't think I want to do it on a social media platform. I think face to face,' she said.

Troops from across US headed to southern border	(NewsNation) — Military units from across the country are rushing to provide reinforcement along the southern border following President Donald Trump's executive order last week declaring a national emergency there. Hundreds of troops, including from Kentucky, Washington and New York, are en route to the U.S.-Mexico border. At least 300 troops landed in El Paso, Texas, over the weekend, and sources tell NewsNation that at least 500 soldiers are in California. Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott also announced he will buttress efforts by sending at least 400 soldiers from the Texas Tactical Border Force to help the National Guard and Border Patrol agents. Trump’s 5 biggest moves on immigration so far Texas Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales, who represents much of Texas's southern border, said more troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. He added that Fort Bliss in El Paso will essentially be ground zero for these removal actions. While many of the units headed to the border will not have immigration jurisdiction and cannot apprehend migrants, they will have policing authority on military bases, Gonzales said. These troops will be used as a deterrence and to assist law enforcement. On his first day in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, tasking the U.S. military with aiding border security, issuing a broad ban on asylum and taking steps to restrict citizenship for children born on American soil. Trump’s Jan. 20 order instructed the Pentagon to send as many troops as necessary to obtain 'complete operational control of the southern border of the United States.' The president deployed an initial 1,500 troops in California and Texas. The show of force in California and Texas comes as deportation flights have started to Central and South America. On Friday, two U.S. military aircraft, each carrying about 80 migrants, flew from the U.S. to Guatemala, a U.S. official told reporters. 80 Guatemalans deported out of Biggs Army Airfield in Texas Multiple deportations were carried out via flight, some of which were reportedly refused by Mexico. The White House has since claimed there was a miscommunication and that Mexico has not refused any of the flights. Trump has threatened hefty tariffs on countries that refuse the deported migrants. Trump said on Sunday he would impose sweeping retaliatory measures on Colombia, including tariffs and sanctions, after the South American country turned away two U.S. military aircraft with migrants being deported. Colombia, the third largest U.S. trading partner in Latin America, swiftly responded, threatening a 50% tariff on U.S. goods.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/troops-travel-southern-border/	2025-01-27T11:14:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192614816.jpg?w=900
Trump to reinstate service members discharged over COVID vaccine	(NewsNation) —President Trump will sign an executive order Monday allowing for the reinstatement of about 8,000 service members who were discharged during the height of the pandemic for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Under Trump's order, these service members will be reinstated with former rank, full back pay and benefits if they reenlist. The move comes as the next in a series of executive orders that Trump promised while on the campaign trail. ICE arrests 956 Sunday as nationwide raids continue From August 2021 to January 2023, the Biden administration discharged thousands of troops over their refusal to get a mandated COVID-19 shot, with limited exceptions for medical issues or religious objections. The number of service members that were discharged represented less than 1% of the Air Force, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and about 2% of the army. The Pentagon allowed dismissed soldiers to reapply once the mandate was rescinded in 2023, but only 43 chose to do so, according to federal statistics. With many of these members not returning and low recruiting numbers, Trump's new Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, is hoping the new order will incentivize many of them to come back.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-service-members-discharged-covid-vaccine/	2025-01-27T10:55:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2194910701.jpg?w=900
JD Vance challenges Catholic bishops to ‘do better’ on immigratio...	Faith is an integral part of millions of Americans' daily lives. 'One Nation Under God' is committed to reflecting America's voices, values and communities, covering stories of faith and religion, from the latest headlines to stories of hope. Subscribe here. (NewsNation) — After his first week on the job, Vice President JD Vance issued a challenge to Catholic bishops in the United States to 'do better' on the issue of immigration. He voiced his criticism during an interview with 'Face the Nation' on CBS News on Sunday. Pastor urges clergy to put aside politics and embrace scripture 'I think the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has, frankly, not been a good partner in common sense immigration enforcement that the American people voted for, and I hope, again, as a devout Catholic, that they'll do better,' Vance said. On his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders cracking down on illegal immigration. His administration has made its first priority the deportation of immigrants in the U.S. illegally who are criminals. Bishops condemned some Trump orders The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops condemned some of the executive orders signed by President Donald Trump on issues including immigration. In a statement, Archbishop Timothy Broglio, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said, 'Some provisions contained in the Executive Orders, such as those focused on the treatment of immigrants and refugees, foreign aid, expansion of the death penalty, and the environment, are deeply troubling and will have negative consequences, many of which will harm the most vulnerable among us.' Trump world descends on bishop who pleaded for ‘mercy’ The bishops conference is the governing body of Catholic leaders in the United States and coordinates and promotes Catholic activities. The body also monitors federal legislation that affects Catholic entities and the dignity of the human person. J.D. Vance is sworn in as U.S. vice president as his wife Usha Vance and family and President Donald Trump look on in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. Donald Trump takes office for his second term as the 47th president of the United States. (Photo by Saul Loeb - Pool/Getty Images) JD Vance: Focus on humanitarian issues Vice President Vance, who said he is a practicing Catholic, suggested the Catholic Church should pay closer attention to the humanitarian issues surrounding immigration, including the sex trafficking of children. 'I think that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns? Or are they actually worried about their bottom line?' Vance told CBS News’ Margaret Brennan. Who is Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop who drew Trump’s ire at prayer service? 'If they're worried about the humanitarian costs of immigration enforcement, let them talk about the children who have been sex trafficked because of the wide open border of Joe Biden,' he said. The Catholic Church teaches that richer nations have the moral duty to welcome foreigners who are seeking security and a livelihood that they cannot find in their country of origin, but it also teaches that governments have the right to enforce their laws and to protect the common good. Bishops praised some Trump orders 'We're going to enforce immigration law,' Vance said. 'We're going to protect the American people.' Pastor Lorenzo Sewell says politics and spirituality intertwined Alongside their criticism, the bishops also praised some of the president’s executive orders, including one that recognizes two sexes: 'Other provisions in the Executive Orders can be seen in a more positive light, such as recognizing the truth about each human person as male or female.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/religion/jd-vance-catholic-bishops-immigration/	2025-01-27T10:21:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2194918366.jpg?w=900

Click here to watch the live Q&amp;A when it begins. Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, defended the administration's plans to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) into schools. Homan joined ABC’s 'This Week,' where he was asked about the logistics behind the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. Host Martha Raddatz asked how the administration said it will 'no longer tell ICE agents they have to avoid sensitive locations, including schools, hospitals, churches.'

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'What criminals are hiding in schools? Middle schools, elementary schools — you gonna to go into those?' Raddatz questioned. Trump has formally authorized ICE to begin arresting people in schools and churches, rescinding a guideline that prevented arrests in 'sensitive' areas. They have begun making arrests in various communities. Homan defended the practice to Raddatz and said the arrests are being made with planning. 'How many MS-13 members are the age 14-17? Many of them,' Homan said. 'So look, if it’s a national security threat, public safety threat and what, what you need to understand is that it’s case by case, name another agency, another law enforcement agency, that has those type of requirements, that they can’t walk into a school or doctor’s office or a medical campus. No other agency is held to those standards. These are well trained officers with a lot of discretion, and when it comes to a sensitive location, there’s still gonna be supervisory review.' During the interview, Homan noted how expensive the deportation plans will be. He called on Congress to pass funding for the administration’s mission.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/ice-schools/	2025-01-27T09:03:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP18059615938391-1-e1733323119120_abd0ec.jpg?w=900
Trump to reshape military with barrage of executive orders	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is expected to reshape the U.S. military with a raft of executive orders Monday, including banning transgender service members and ending diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs, according to the White House. The executive orders come days after Trump’s nominee to lead the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, was sworn in as Secretary of Defense. Hegseth has vowed to restore 'the warrior ethos' to the military, which he has claimed has been weakened by 'woke issues.' Trump is set to issue an executive order abolishing all DEI programs within the armed forces as a way to 'restore merit and lethality to America’s fighting force.' This executive order directs the Pentagon’s new leader to conduct an internal review of all instances of 'race- or sex-based discrimination' based on DEI initiatives, a White House fact sheet obtained by NewsNation said. Here are all executive orders Trump signed on Day 1 In a social media post foreshadowing the upcoming announcement, Hegseth wrote on X: 'The President’s guidance (lawful orders) is clear: No more DEI at the Department of Defense. The Pentagon will comply, immediately.' The White House says this order will 'combat ideologies that seek to divide our Armed Forces by race, sex or other immutable characteristics and thus tear at cohesion and military efficacy.' A second executive order will ban transgender service members from the U.S. military. The Department of Defense will update its guidance regarding trans-identifying medical standards for military service to ensure it prioritizes 'readiness and lethality,' the White House said. 'On the battlefield, there can be no accommodation for anything less than resilience, strength, and the ability to withstand extraordinary physical demands.' According to its fact sheet, the White House argues it can take a minimum of 12 months for an individual to complete treatments after transition surgery. During this period, they are not 'physically capable of meeting military readiness requirements and require ongoing medical care. This is not conducive for deployment or other readiness requirements,' the new administration contends. Trump issued a similar ban during his first term that barred transgender troops from serving, which former President Joe Biden rescinded. In 2019 — the most recent year for which figures were available — the Department of Defense estimated that approximately 8,000 transgender individuals served on active duty in the military.

Trump to huddle with House GOP at retreat in Florida	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is set to meet with top Republican leaders on his agenda this week. House GOP leaders indicated that they aim to move Trump’s legislative agenda — encompassing extension of the 2017 tax cuts, energy policy, and border policy — in a single bill through the budget reconciliation process, rather than split it into two pieces as some Republicans had wanted in hopes of delivering some Trump wins faster. Trump is expected to speak to the Republicans on Monday evening. The policy retreat is set to end Wednesday morning. Three of Trump’s most controversial Cabinet picks set for hearings The meetings, taking place at the Trump National Doral just outside Miami, come a day after Trump threatened Colombia with tariffs after it denied the entry of U.S. planes carrying Colombian migrants. Shortly after, Colombia reversed its decision. Trump threatens Colombia with tariffs On Sunday, Colombia President Gustavo Petro wrote in a post on X that he was denying the entry of American planes carrying Colombian migrants into the country, stating the U.S. cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals. Hours later, Trump responded in a Truth Social post threatening 25% tariffs on all goods coming into the U.S. from Columbia, raising that to 50% after one week. Additionally, he threatened a travel ban on Columbian government officials, visa sanctions on family members of the Columbian government and enhanced customs and border protection inspections of all Columbian nationals. Senate tees up more confirmations as House GOP talks Trump agenda Almost immediately Colombia reversed its decision. The government wrote on X that Trump is providing a presidential plane for the dignified return of his fellow citizens, after turning away two U.S. military deportation flights. The U.S. military aircraft carried out two similar flights, each with about 80 migrants to Guatemala on Friday. Secretary of State Marco Rubio asserts the U.S. is committed to 'bolster America's border security.' The White House said Monday that the tariffs and sanctions are on hold and won't be signed unless Columbia fails to honor the agreement.

Rumors about ICE raids stoke fear amid deportations	NewsNation’s Ali Bradley is hosting a panel of law enforcement experts on the border tonight at 6p/5c. Click here to watch the live Q&amp;A when it begins. (NewsNation) — Mass deportations were one of President Donald Trump's main campaign promises — and now, some people are using them to spread misinformation and rumors about Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. ICE agents arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants during Trump's first week in office. Two metropolitan police departments in Georgia, Forest Park and Clayton County, went on Facebook to clarify that they are not partnering with ICE. What is the minimum income to file this year’s tax return? 'We’re here to dispel that rumor and clearly state that we have NOT engaged in any activity with ICE by any means; nor have we been notified that they’re conducting business within city limits,' Forest Park's statement said. 'Furthermore, we are not targeting our Hispanic citizens or those who commute throughout the City of Forest Park.' In Durham, North Carolina, last week, a supermarket had to write a statement saying that any claims of raids at their stores are just a 'harmful prank.' These claims, Super Compare Foods wrote, were the result of people seen near their stores in uniforms and vehicles made to look like the ones used by border agents. 'What's most concerning is that these actions were carried out with clear malicious intent, aimed at spreading fear and misinformation in a time when our community is already in a fragile and sensitive climate,' the statement said. Super Compare Foods filed a report with Durham Police, and the supermarket says it will pursue legal action against the individuals responsible. Mass deportations under Trump On Sunday alone, ICE reported 956 arrests. That number follows the arrest of roughly 1,300 people by Thursday, according to numbers put out by 'border czar' Tom Homan. Arrests made in the first three days of Trump's second term represent about 1.1% of total arrests made by ICE in FY 2024. The number of arrests has gone from 310 a day to about 433 — and that number is expected to grow. Raids were reported in Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; Austin, Texas; New Jersey; Los Angeles, California; San Antonio, Texas; Miami, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; Omaha, Nebraska; Phoenix, Arizona and Atlanta, Georgia. Officials in 'sanctuary cities' such as Chicago have vowed to protect immigrant communities from mass deportations. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said on X that police were not involved in ICE enforcement activity in the city. 'My team and I are in close communication with city officials including the CPD,' he said. 'It is imperative that all Chicagoans know their constitutional rights and share the Know Your Rights guidance with their neighbors and community.' List: All of Trump’s executive orders on the economy How to avoid ICE scams Officials warn that scammers are posing as ICE officials and demanding money from people. To avoid them, officials say to avoid making payments over the phone or email and to remember that agents do not request financial information or money to dismiss an investigation or arrest warrant. People can report suspected ICE fraud to the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General at 1-800-323-8603.

Trump's top immigration officials oversee raids in Chicago	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — Top Trump administration officials, including 'border czar' Tom Homan, visited Chicago on Sunday to oversee ramped-up immigration enforcement efforts as federal agencies touted arrests nationwide. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made 956 arrests nationwide on Sunday and 286 on Saturday. While in Chicago, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said he observed immigration agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), along with agents from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). He did not offer details on the operation, which came days after the DHS expanded immigration authority to agencies in the Department of Justice, including the DEA and ATF. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is disappointed in the results of his mass deportation efforts so far, the Washington Post reports, urging ICE to increase daily arrests to at least 1,200 to 1,500. ICE has averaged 433 daily arrests since Trump's inauguration, nearly doubling on Sunday. Dozens of alleged Tren de Aragua members arrested in Denver These targeted enforcements are happening nationwide, including in New Jersey, New York, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. In Denver, law enforcement officials conducted an early morning operation at a makeshift nightclub, seizing drugs, weapons and cash. Approximately 50 people who were reportedly in the U.S. illegally were taken into custody — many allegedly connected with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. 'Mama Paty' reunited with 4-year-old found alone at border 'I want a safer community. I live in this community too, and I feel like the people in the Denver metro area can wake up today and feel like they have a safer city to live in,' said DEA Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Pullen. ICE arrested five alleged Tren de Aragua members in Chicago on Sunday. Illinois' Pritzker backs 'law-abiding' undocumented migrants Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson launched a 'Know Your Rights' ad campaign across the city's public transit trains, as Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called on Trump to stop going after what he called 'law-abiding' undocumented migrants. 'Violent criminals who are undocumented in this country should be deported,' Pritzker said. 'But when we're talking about undocumented people who have been living law-abiding lives and raising families in the United States, we need comprehensive immigration reform. We need to give them an opportunity to stay in this country legally.' Arrest quotas for ICE officers ‘a bad idea’: William Enyart The 'Illinois Trust Act' limits local involvement with federal immigration enforcement, meaning Chicago Police officers are blocked from cooperating with ICE agents. Homan argues ICE wouldn't need to conduct such community arrests if local law enforcement were allowed to collaborate more closely with ICE to target high-priority criminals.

Three of Trump's most controversial Cabinet picks set for hearing...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — More Senate hearings have been scheduled for President Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees, marking a significant week ahead for some of his more controversial picks. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's choice to run the Department of Health and Human Services, will have his first hearing Wednesday. Kennedy is a former Democratic presidential candidate who dropped out and endorsed Trump. His nomination alarmed some concerned about his record of spreading misinformation regarding vaccines. On Thursday, Kennedy will have a second hearing before a different committee. Kash Patel, who is nominated to run the FBI, also has a hearing Thursday. Former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is Trump's choice for national intelligence director; she also has a hearing Thursday. Sources told NewsNation that Gabbard may face more issues with a smaller group of Republicans than Democrats. Hearings are not yet scheduled for all of Trump's picks, including Lori Chavez-DeRemer, nominated to lead the Department of Labor; Howard Lutnick, tapped to lead the Department of Commerce; and Linda McMahon, picked to lead the Department of Education. Vance: Tulsi Gabbard will 'restore trust' in intel Democratic senators have been scrutinizing Gabbard's past support for deposed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, as well as her calls to pardon national security leaker Edward Snowden. While some Republicans appear willing to consider those concerns, many continue to defend Gabbard as a proud, patriotic figure who isn't afraid to challenge the political establishment. Gabbard’s path through Intelligence Committee narrows ahead of key hearing 'I'm going to see how the hearing goes. I'm inclined to be 'yes' on everybody, but there's some questions she will be asked that I want to hear the answers to,' said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.'It's fine for people to have policy differences and ask questions about those differences. I hope no one would impugn Ms. Gabbard's patriotism or her integrity,' said Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark.'The bureaucrats at our intelligence services have gotten completely out of control. They've been part of the weaponization of our political system, the weaponization of our justice system. We need to have good intelligence services who keep us safe, but part of that is restoring trust in those services, and we think Tulsi is the right person to do it,' said Vice President JD Vance. Overall, several Republican lawmakers told NewsNation they feel it's their responsibility to support Trump's nominees. However, some stated they will reserve judgment until hearing from the nominees. Arrest quotas for ICE officers ‘a bad idea’: William Enyart Pete Hegseth, Kristi Noem confirmed Pete Hegseth was confirmed as the nation’s defense secretary late Friday. Vance broke a 50-50 tie to narrowly seal Hegseth's confirmation. Three Republicans — Sens. Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, Susan Collins, of Maine; and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska — also voted against him. While Hegseth received bipartisan pushback against his nomination, Kristi Noem was confirmed as homeland security secretary on Saturday with bipartisan support, receiving seven Democratic votes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-controversial-cabinet-picks-hearings/	2025-01-27T04:43:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/kennedy_robert_RFK_11152024_AP_AP24320339674317.jpg?w=900
Missing 12-year-old child's mom reveals he never made it to frien...	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (WAVY) -- Virginia Beach Police have launched an extensive search for 12-year-old Juan Sebastian Mejia Acevedo. The boy’s mother told NewsNation affiliate WAVY that her son never reached his friend’s house on the Friday he disappeared. She said she had given him permission to visit a friend’s home to work on homework between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., but he never made it there. The Virginia State Police (VSP) issued an Amber Alert for Juan around 5:45 am Saturday. He was last seen by his parents on Mica Avenue in Virginia Beach around 9 a.m. Friday. Juan is a student at Larkspur Middle School. VBCPS did not have in-person classes on Friday. 'They thought he was home doing homework. A snow day for students here in the area. He, I think, was seen on a ring camera somewhere around 2 p.m. I think we've seen that family believed he was at a friend's house, and at around 9 p.m., when he didn't show up back home, they started to become concerned,' said Jody Saunders, Chief Communications Officer with VBPD. Human remains found in 2021 confirmed to be Cassie Sheetz 'When we got home, he was not home. We told him he could go to his friend's house from two to four, but we just thought because he wasn’t home, he was probably still at his friend's house as boys do. We went to his friend's house, spoke to the parents and the parents tell us he never came to their house,' said Jenni Acevedo, Juan’s mother. Jenni went on Facebook Live to get the word out to see if friends or family could help. That’s when several ransom requests came in. 'They made me go to a nearby Walmart and asked for money. I did not give the full amount, just part of it,' said Acevedo. Juan’s mother sent $500, and they then demanded $10,000, and she realized she was getting scammed. 'We have to treat it as a credible lead. And so that's why our federal partners are here helping us with this potential abduction, and we'll chase that all the way to its end,' said Saunders. Juan is their only child. The family is desperate to find him, and the mother believes he is still on Mica Avenue. Missing woman, 96, may be displaced due to Eaton Fire Local and federal law enforcement have been canvassing the neighborhood, using drones, knocking on doors, and on Sunday added mounted patrol. VBPD does not believe it is a recovery mission; out of caution, the marine patrol unit is searching nearby lakes and ponds. 'We also enlisted the help of some of our Hispanic Citizens Police Academy alumni to help be shoulder to shoulder with our officers, knock on doors and assist translating, if necessary,' said Saunders. According to Saunders, the family has recently moved, and VBPD is also looking at the other areas they have lived in as well as the current entire neighborhood. One neighbor who lives in the apartment complex says police have knocked on his door asking for additional information. 'They asked if I'd seen any suspicious activity around here. Cars that kind of look unfamiliar here. And I have not,' said resident Gavin Sands. VBPD has contacted ICE and confirmed that Juan is not in ICE custody. 'Our first and only priority is the safety and well-being of our community. And that comes regardless of immigration status,' said Saunders. VBPD has created an anonymous digital evidence portal where people can upload photos and videos about this case. Juan is described as: Age: 12 Height: 5’8' Weight: 105 pounds Hair Color: black Eye Color: brown Clothing: Last seen wearing a gray jacket, red hoodie, and blue pants If you have any information about this case, you can submit an anonymous tip by calling 1-888-LOCK-U-UP, downloading the P3 tips app to a mobile device, or visiting www.P3tips.com and submitting a tip.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/missing-12-year-old-virginia-beach/	2025-01-27T04:00:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-31-2.jpg?w=900
Israel lets Palestinians return to northern Gaza for the first ti...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel on Monday began allowing thousands of Palestinians to return to the heavily destroyed north of the Gaza Strip for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas, in accordance with a fragile ceasefire. The opening was delayed for two days over a dispute between Hamas and Israel, which said the militant group had changed the order of the hostages it released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Mediators resolved the dispute overnight. Palestinians who have been sheltering in squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters for over a year are eager to return to their homes -- even knowing that they have likely been damaged or destroyed. Many had feared Israel would make their exodus permanent, and expressed similar concerns about an idea floated by President Donald Trump to resettle large numbers of Palestinians in Egypt and Jordan. Ismail Abu Matter, a father of four who had waited for three days before crossing with his family, described scenes of jubilation on the other side, with people singing, praying and crying as they were reunited with relatives. 'It’s the joy of return,' said Abu Matter, whose family was among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. 'We had thought we wouldn’t return, like our ancestors.' Hamas said the return was 'a victory for our people, and a declaration of failure and defeat for the (Israeli) occupation and transfer plans.' The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas and securing the release of dozens of hostages captured in the militants’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which triggered the fighting. Israel ordered the wholescale evacuation of the north in the opening days of the war and sealed it off shortly after ground troops moved in. Around a million people fled to the south in October 2023, while hundreds of thousands remained in the north, which had some of the heaviest fighting and the worst destruction of the war. Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel would continue to enforce the ceasefire, and that anyone violating it or threatening Israeli forces 'will bear the full cost.' 'We will not allow a return to the reality of Oct. 7,' he wrote on the platform X. Hostage dispute rattled week-old ceasefire Israel had delayed the opening of the crossing, which was supposed to happen over the weekend, saying it would not allow Palestinians north until a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was released. It also accused Hamas of failing to provide information on whether the remaining hostages set to be freed in the first phase are alive or dead. Hamas in turn accused Israel of violating the agreement by not opening the crossing. The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, announced early Monday that an agreement had been reached to release Yehoud along with two other hostages before Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the hostage release — which will include female soldier Agam Berger — will take place on Thursday. That release will be in addition to the one already set for next Saturday, when three hostages should be released. Hamas also handed over a list of required information about the hostages to be released in the ceasefire’s six-week first phase. Starting at 7 a.m., Palestinians were allowed to cross on foot without inspection through part of the so-called Netzarim corridor, a military zone bisecting the territory just south of Gaza City that Israel carved out early in the war. A checkpoint for vehicles was to open later with an inspection mechanism, the details of which were not immediately known. A second and more difficult phase awaits Under the first phase of the ceasefire, which runs until early March, Hamas is to free a total of 33 hostages in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The militants have released seven hostages, including four female soldiers, in the current ceasefire, in exchange for more than 300 prisoners, including many serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. The second — and far more difficult — phase of the agreement has not yet been negotiated. Hamas says it will not release the remaining 60 or so hostages unless Israel ends the war, while Netanyahu says he is still committed to destroying the militant group and ending its nearly 18-year rule over Gaza. Hamas started the war when thousands of its fighters stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 90 hostages are still inside Gaza, and Israel believes around a third are dead. Israel’s air and ground war has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israeli bombardment and ground operations have displaced around 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times, and flattened entire neighborhoods. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israel-begins-allowing-palestinians-to-return-to-northern-gaza-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-year/	2025-01-26T22:44:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67972ba1edf379.10563631.jpeg?w=900
Arrest quotas for ICE officers 'a bad idea': William Enyart	(NewsNation) — Enacting a daily arrest quota for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would be 'asking for an abuse of their police powers,' Ret. U.S. Army Major Gen. William Enyart said. 'Anytime you put a quota on a law enforcement officer, that that's a bad idea,' Enyart told NewsNation. 'Law enforcement officers are supposed to use their discretion.' Crisis on the border: Trump’s first week tackling immigration The quotas would range from 1,200 to 1,500 people each day, The Washington Post first reported. On Sunday alone, ICE reported 956 arrests, as immigration operations were conducted in major cities like Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Jose and more. The push for quotas comes from Trump's displeasure with arrest numbers, according to the Post. Mexico busing deported Venezuelans away from border 'Almost all of them are good people and they work hard,' Enyart added. 'But you know, when you're put under that kind of pressure, you make mistakes.'

Mama Paty' reunited with 4-year-old found alone at border	(NewsNation) — A 4-year-old girl from Honduras who was found alone at the southern border by officials last year is back with her mother. NewsNation has followed the emotional journey since November, when U.S. immigration officials said they found the child after she was smuggled by coyotes through South America. The unnamed girl had a note with her, on it written a phone number and her mother's name, 'Mama Paty.' Her mother, who was already in the states, told NewsNation she left her child in the hands of criminal smugglers in Honduras and Mexico in hopes of being reunited. The 4-year-old was held under federal custody for a little over a month as officials worked to verify her mother's identity before the pair were finally reunited. ICE, DEA carry out deportation operations in cities across US NewsNation traveled to South Carolina to meet the happily-reunited family. 'They were endless days for me. I couldn’t sleep at night,' Paty said. 'I was just waiting for a message, a call, someone to tell me if my daughter was okay.' Both mother and daughter had previously been deported back to Honduras three years ago after crossing illegally into the United States with the help of a smuggler. Paty decided to attempt crossing into the U.S. again — but this time, without her daughter, who stayed back in Honduras with her grandparents. Mexico busing deported Venezuelans away from border Paty and her daughter are overwhelmed with joy to be finally together again here in the U.S., but also now worry that they could be removed, as the Trump administration promises to carry out largest deportation in national history. 'Everything we’ve been through would have been for nothing. All the risk my daughter took — it was a big risk since she was traveling alone — would have been for nothing,' Paty said. 'It would be devastating. If Donald Trump were to deport me, or deport both of us together.' She told NewsNation, if she were to be deported, she would bring her daughter back with her to Honduras rather than have her stay with relatives in America.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/mama-paty-border-mom/	2025-01-26T16:55:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/F1D6A8A0158F45B546FF2799CEE8C6E7.jpg?w=900
ICE, DEA carry out deportation operations in cities across US	(NewsNation) — During his first week back in office, President Donald Trump's administration carried out nationwide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, with several operations taking place Sunday. ICE raids in multiple major U.S. cities have led to the arrests of more than 1,300 criminal migrants, Trump’s 'border czar' Tom Homan told NewsNation on Thursday. On Friday, one arrest was a convicted murderer and 10 were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, NewsNation's Ali Bradley reported. Crisis on the border: Trump’s first week tackling immigration Raids have taken place in major cities such as Boston, Denver, New York City, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, Miami, Washington, D.C., and Newark, N.J., according to media reports. The number of arrests in the first three days of Trump’s presidency represents about 1.1% of total arrests made by ICE in FY 2024. Here's where raids have happened Sunday. Chicago Top Trump administration officials, including 'border czar' Tom Homan and the acting deputy attorney general, visited Chicago on Sunday to witness the start of ramped-up immigration enforcement in the nation’s third-largest city. The DEA’s Chicago office posted pictures on X showing Bove and Homan with agents from ATF and Customs and Border Protection. The operation comes just days after reports leaked of mass deportation raids planned in the Windy City. Chicago and state officials, including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, have vowed to protect immigrant communities from mass deportations. Denver ICE tooki nearly 50 people into custody — including members of the Tren de Aragua gang — in an overnight raid at a 'makeshift nightclub,' according to an X post from the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Rocky Mountain Division. The DEA, Homeland Security, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and 'local partners' seized drugs, weapons and cash in the raid. The raid was connected to a DEA drug trafficking investigation that began several months before President Donald Trump took office during the Biden Administration, a DEA official told NewsNation local affiliate KDVR reports. Austin, Texas A series of ICE raids were conducted in Austin on Sunday, DEA sources confirmed to NewsNation local affiliate KXAN. 'The raids are underway or have been done,' said Sally Sparks, a DEA Houston Division spokesperson, said in a phone call. In an X post, the Houston DEA Division confirmed the DEA is working with Department of Justice partners, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal law enforcement partners with these efforts. New Jersey Paterson, N.J., Mayor Andre Sayegh told affiliate PIX11 that ICE agents are in the town. 'We are genuinely concerned. We are a welcoming city. Quite frankly, there has to be an appropriate procedure. If they have a warrant, we understand. If they don’t, people have to know their rights. As a matter of fact, I did get a report today that ICE was in Paterson, not too far from here,' said Mayor Sayegh. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said ICE agents raided a seafood store and detained three people on Thursday. Los Angeles An post from the Los Angeles DEA Division confirmed that the department 'participated in an operation' on Sunday that supported the Justice Department, DHS and other federal law enforcement partners with their '#immigration enforcement efforts.'

A child's life in Gaza, as explained by a Middle East reporter	(NewsNation) — Waiting in line for clean water, lugging around water jugs larger than they are and hoping for a slice of bread for the entire family, children in Gaza are living a life of survival. That's how one on-the-ground reporter described the life of a child in Gaza during war -- one of devastation, medical suffering and pure survival. Middle East reporter Arwa Damon, who founded the nonprofit INARA, described what she's seen in Gaza to NewsNation on 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' on Sunday, as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal reached the one-week mark. The Emmy Award-winning journalist was in Gaza in December. She shared the story of a 2-year-old girl who is at risk of losing her limbs -- and life.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana, File) The girl, who doctors say has a protein C deficiency leading to blood overclotting, has known war most of her life since Hamas' attack on Gaza on Oct. 3, 2023. 'Her arms and legs are covered with gangrenous tissue. She's at a very real risk of losing her limbs and potentially losing her life,' Damon said. 'She needs an emergency medical evacuation, as do thousands of other children who are on this waiting list, but we still have not seen those starting up.' Damon, whose nonprofit provides medical and mental health care to children impacted by war and natural disasters, is calling for urgent medical evacuations. She thought that aid would be 'speedier' after the ceasefire's enactment. 'The opposite seems to have taken place,' she said. Israel said it is keeping Palestinians out of northern Gaza after a civilian hostage was not returned in last weekend's hostage-prisoner exchange. On Saturday, Hamas released four female Israeli soldiers, three of whom are a mere 20 years old and one who is 19. Israel said it was expecting the hostages to include women and children civilians. 14,000 children killed in Gaza Children play in the rubble of a destroyed building in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, Monday, Jan. 20, 2025.

And in some areas: 'It’s not even that a building has been reduced to rubble. It's actually been reduced to sand.' The Palestinian Ministry of Health estimates at least 14,000 children have been killed in Gaza. 'The medications, the treatment that (the girl) needs doesn't exist. And actually, you know, the sort of specialty care that she needs doesn't exist in Gaza,' Damon said. 'What you have is … children who get these horrific blast injuries, very complex injuries, but there isn't the needed testing.' What’s next in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire? There is only one CT scanner in all of Gaza City and no MRI machine, according to her experience. 'The other issue is that the rate of infection among injuries has been extremely high because children's bodies are so weakened due to malnutrition that their body cannot fight to heal and fight off infection at the same time,' Damon said.

(AP Photo/Hussein Malla, File) Patients often return because their wounds haven’t healed properly. And the mental wounds won’t heal for a long time, either. 'The fear of the drone and the bombs … these traumas are very deep and very, very ingrained and are something that really needs to be focused on in the future,' she said. 'We talk a lot about Gaza's physical rebuilding, but we also need to equally talk about Gaza’s psychological rebuilding.' Urgent needs include proper shelter, access to clean water and access to clean bathrooms. A bed to sleep on would seem like a luxury at this stage. Hamas releases 4 female Israeli soldiers in ceasefire deal swap 'We have to recognize that the vast majority of Gaza's children have not slept in a bed for 15 months,' Damon said. 'A number of children were being asked, ‘What's the thing you look forward to the most?’ And they were saying things like, ‘I want to sleep in a bed. I want to sleep in a room on my own. I want to be able to go to the bathroom and have a measure of privacy. I want to go back to school.’' Stability and safety are what they hope for. 'The child is sort of entrenched in this daily struggle of survival. That's what it’s like to be a child in Gaza right now.'

Dems take ‘government for granted’ on immigration: Chicago alderm...	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — Chicago Alderman Raymond Lopez is blaming the city’s mayor for 'fear' and spreading 'false information' in the city’s immigrant communities following news of planned ICE raids. 'Our mayor, and others, have continuously stoked fires of fear and anxiety in neighborhoods, spreading false information that the Trump administration and ICE were coming to round people up out of churches,' Lopez said on NewsNation’s 'Morning in America.' Lopez said when he met with President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan, they agreed that detaining 'criminal' migrants who entered the U.S. illegally was the chief concern. Crisis on the border: Trump’s first week tackling immigration 'They want to focus on those dangerous, undocumented, criminal migrants that are here in our communities,' said Lopez. 'When I met with (Homan) in December, that's exactly what he said.' Lopez said he is trying to limit 'collateral captures,' immigrants without a criminal record but lacking legal documents, and implored Democrats to work with the new administration. 'Many Democratic leaders refuse to show any kind of working relationship with the Trump administration, and that's only going to hurt the people that they pretend to care about,' said Lopez. Lopez compared Democrats' maneuvering on immigration to the way they handled abortion. '(Democrats) took government for granted (on abortion), and they're doing it again with immigration,' he said. Chicago Public Schools officials said Friday that ICE agents showed up at an elementary school in the city but were denied entry. After confusion, the Secret Service said it was they who visited the school, not ICE.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/raymond-lopez-ice-raids-chicago/	2025-01-26T09:27:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-14.jpg?w=852
Ramaswamy's expected run for Ohio governor would test experienced...	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Fresh off of his unexpected departure from President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, Vivek Ramaswamy has set his sights on becoming governor of his home state. The 39-year-old biotech entrepreneur who made an unsuccessful bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination has lined up strategists with Ohio experience and plans to announce his run as soon as this week. Ramaswamy will try to follow the paths of Vice President JD Vance and Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno — two political newcomers who won Senate seats with the help of Trump's endorsement. His plans have complicated things for a deep bench of veteran Republican politicians, especially the ones who also aspire to succeed term-limited Gov. Mike DeWine. Attorney General Dave Yost announced his candidacy on Thursday. So far, Ohio voters have continued to support candidates with government experience for state-level offices, while favoring business backgrounds in their presidential and Senate picks. 'At the federal legislative level, that’s a different yardstick and standard than for governor of Ohio,' said Republican consultant Terry Casey. 'Historically, the governor's a little closer to voters — clearing highways, running prisons — than senators and members of Congress.' Ramaswamy stands to benefit from instant popularity among Trump's most ardent backers and long ties to both Vance and Moreno. He attended Trump's second inauguration and is a well-known booster of the president. Attending a recent breakfast with more than 600 state GOP activists, Ramaswamy was mobbed by people seeking to have their photos taken with him and his wife, Apoorva. Ramaswamy, who travels with his own small security detail, was again swarmed the same evening during a black-tie inaugural ball in Washington sponsored by the Ohio Republican Party. 'The question is can you bypass the 20 years' worth of political history that used to be required to run for governor,' said Ryan Stubenrauch, a Republican strategist and former senior policy adviser to DeWine. All eyes on Ramaswamy Ramaswamy is the son of Indian immigrants and a native of Cincinnati. He earned Harvard and Yale degrees before joining a hedge fund firm and leading its pharmaceutical investments. Ramaswamy launched his own venture in 2014, Roivant, specializing in buying discount patents for drugs stuck in development and resurrecting them. His portfolio is now measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars, enough to dwarf the $15 million he loaned his presidential campaign. He was raised in a Hindu-practicing home. With evangelical Christians holding sway in the Republican Party, Ramaswamy says his faith shares core principles with Christianity and he traces his abortion-rights opposition to his time at St. Xavier High School in his hometown. Ramaswamy has drawn criticism both from establishment Republicans and the party's populist pro-Trump wing. His opposition to providing weapons to Ukraine in the war with Russia bothered some Republicans. But when he urged Trump, notably in an X post that went viral, to bring in more foreign tech workers, it angered former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and other hard-line supporters of restricted immigration. When Ramaswamy arrived in Springfield, Ohio, last year to hold a town hall in the wake of false claims made by Trump and Vance that Haitian migrants there were eating people's pets, the venue couldn't hold all the people who showed up. That popularity does not always translate to those who know Ramaswamy well. Some inside and outside the Trump universe say his style can be abrasive and exhausting. Trump has made no endorsement in the developing race. Ramaswamy has long considered running for governor, according to those with knowledge of his plans. After Trump appointed him to DOGE, Ramaswamy pulled himself out of consideration for the Senate seat that came open with Vance's election as vice president. But Ramaswamy later discussed the vacancy with Trump, according to two people familiar with his plans who were not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity, and then went to DeWine to ask for the appointment. The governor opted for Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, citing his extensive government experience. A spokesperson for DOGE said Ramaswamy would not participate in the cost-cutting initiative due to his plans to run for office. That leaves Musk, the world's richest person, as its sole leader. Ramaswamy has ties to Republican strategists from his campaign for the White House race, notably Ben Yoho, CEO of the Columbus-based Strategy Group. Ramaswamy is scrambling others' plans By appointing Husted to the Senate, DeWine eliminated the leading contender to follow him as governor. But no longer is it a given that the wealthy donors and key endorsers that Husted had locked up over the past six years would naturally shift to another experienced Republican — Yost or Treasurer Robert Sprague, for example. Yost, 68, is a former county prosecutor elected four times statewide — twice as auditor, twice as attorney general. Sprague, 51, has been twice elected statewide after spending years in the Ohio House and county government. Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a former state senator whose job running elections makes him among the state’s highest profile politician, has yet to announce his plans. 'This new dynamic and competition adds a layer of complexity for me,' said Ken Blackwell, a Trump loyalist who served two terms as Ohio secretary of state and whose potential endorsement would be coveted. Blackwell is a long-time Yost supporter who lives in Cincinnati and is a former mayor. Yost, in announcing his campaign, did not mention Ramaswamy, but seemed to draw a contrast with a potential rival who has played on the national stage. 'This is my heart, my home,' he said in a statement. 'I work for the people of Ohio, and I love my bosses.' But Ramaswamy isn't a total stranger to state government either. Like Moreno and Vance, his entry point was an invitation to the board of InnovateOhio, an office overseeing technology-related improvements that DeWine set up in 2018 and assigned to Husted. 'It’s pretty cool,' Husted said at a news conference announcing his Senate appointment. 'We have a vice president from Ohio who’s, like, my friend. I mean, seriously, InnovateOhio board? We had Bernie Moreno, JD Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy and me. We did all right. We got a good crew there.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-ramaswamys-expected-run-for-ohio-governor-would-test-experienced-republicans-and-tradition/	2025-01-26T08:54:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67965e7a487c95.71377238.jpeg?w=900
What is the minimum income to file this year's tax return?	(NewsNation) — This year's tax season begins Monday, Jan. 27, 2025, lasting through April 15. People filing taxes for income made in 2024 must do so by that April deadline, also known as Tax Day. Not everyone is required to file a tax return, although most Americans must do so, per Internal Revenue Service income requirements. Anyone under the age of 65 by the end of last year must file a return or else they may face penalties. When are taxes due this year? And other important dates Those filing single should file if their income is above $14,600. Couples filing together have a minimum income requirement of $29,200 ($30,750 if one spouse is over 65 years old). Anyone above the age of 65 by the end of last year has different minimum income amounts. For single filers, it's $16,550 and above; for couples, $30,750 if one spouse is under 65; and $32,300 if both spouses are over 65. However, the IRS notes people can still file taxes if their income is below those thresholds because they can still take advantage of some tax credits and may receive a refund. The IRS has other requirements, in addition to income, for tax filers.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/tax-return-minimum-income-requirement-irs/	2025-01-26T08:28:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/GettyImages-1139383323-3-e1713571009616.jpg?w=698
Ozempic can help other chronic health conditions: Study	(NewsNation) — GLP-1 weight loss drugs such as Ozempic are known to promote weight loss, but they have other benefits according to a new study. Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Veteran Affairs St. Louis Health Care System evaluated the effects of GLP-1 drugs on more than 2 million veterans suffering from diabetes between Oct. 1, 2017, through Dec. 31, 2023. According to the research, cognitive and behavioral improvements were seen. However, there were some detractions with increased likelihood of kidney conditions and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). People with ADHD have shorter life expectancy: Study GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy are known to decrease hunger, but the findings included a decreased suicidal ideation and psychotic disorders, in addition to the risk of seizures and addiction to substances such as recreational drugs and alcohol. A decrease in the chance of Alzheimer's and dementia was also found. 'Interestingly, GLP-1RA drugs act on receptors that are expressed in brain areas involved in impulse control, reward and addiction — potentially explaining their effectiveness in curbing appetite and addiction disorders,' Al-Aly, director of the Clinical Epidemiology Center at the VA St. Louis Health Care System said in the release. 'These drugs also reduce inflammation in the brain and result in weight loss; both these factors may improve brain health and explain the reduced risk of conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/ozempic-help-chronic-health-conditions-study/	2025-01-26T08:15:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP23182605436072-e1731552139952.jpg?w=800
Israel blocks thousands of Palestinians from returning to norther...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel kept thousands of Palestinians from returning to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday as it accused Hamas of violating a fragile ceasefire by changing the order of hostages it has released. Local health officials said Israeli forces fired on the crowds, killing two people and wounding nine. Israeli forces also opened fire in Lebanon on protesters demanding their withdrawal in line with a separate ceasefire agreement with the Hezbollah militant group, killing at least 15 people and wounding more than 80. Israel refused to withdraw by a Sunday deadline, accusing Lebanese forces of not deploying quickly enough. The Lebanese army says it cannot move into areas until Israeli troops leave. U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile suggested that most of Gaza's population should be at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan, in order to 'just clean out' the war-ravaged enclave. Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians themselves have previously rejected such a scenario, fearing Israel might never allow the refugees to return. Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said Palestinians would never accept such a proposal, 'even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction.' He said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza 'even better than before' if Israel lifts its blockade. Under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza on foot through the so-called Netzarim corridor bisecting Gaza. Israel put the move on hold until Hamas frees a hostage who Israel said was supposed to have been released Saturday. Hamas in turn accused Israel of violating the agreement. Crowds of people traveling by foot and carrying their belongings filled a main road leading to a closed Israeli checkpoint. 'We have been in agony for a year and a half,' Nadia Qasem, a woman displaced from the north said as she waited. 'Since 1 a.m. we have been waiting to return.' Fadi al-Sinwar, who was also displaced from Gaza City, said, 'the fate of more than a million people is linked to one person,' referring to the Israeli hostage. 'See how valuable we are? We are worthless,' he said. Dispute and shootings test fragile ceasefire Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday, killing two people and wounding nine, including a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza as part of the ceasefire, which came into force last Sunday, but the military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which are still operating in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor. Hamas freed four young female Israeli soldiers on Saturday, and Israel released some 200 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom were serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks. But Israel said another hostage, the female civilian Arbel Yehoud, was supposed to have been released ahead of the soldiers, and that it would not open the Netzarim corridor until she was freed. It also accused Hamas of failing to provide details on the conditions of hostages set to be freed in the coming weeks. Hamas accused Israel of using the issue as a pretext to delay the return of Palestinians to their homes. In a statement, the militant group said it had informed mediators that Yehoud was alive and provided guarantees that she would be released. The United States, Egypt and Qatar, which mediated the ceasefire, were working to address the dispute. Ending the war will be difficult The ceasefire reached earlier this month after more than a year of negotiations is aimed at ending the 15-month war triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack and freeing scores of hostages still held in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Around 90 hostages are still being held in Gaza, and Israeli authorities believe at least a third, and up to half of them, were killed in the initial attack or died in captivity. The first phase of the ceasefire runs until early March and includes the release of a total of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The second — and far more difficult — phase, has yet to be negotiated. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israel has threatened to resume its offensive until Hamas is destroyed. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 people. More than 100 were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more, at least three of whom were mistakenly killed by Israeli forces. Seven have been freed since the latest ceasefire began. Israel's military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Israeli bombardment and ground operations have flattened wide swaths of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. Many who have returned to their homes since the ceasefire began have found only mounds of rubble where their neighborhoods once stood. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israeli-fire-kills-1-wounds-7-as-palestinians-are-kept-out-of-north-gaza-over-a-ceasefire-dispute/	2025-01-26T06:09:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/6796426d9e6e77.84664676.jpeg?w=900
15 reported killed in Lebanon as Israeli forces remain after a wi...	MAYS AL-JABAL, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli forces in southern Lebanon on Sunday opened fire on protesters demanding their withdrawal in line with a ceasefire agreement, killing at least 15 and injuring more than 80, Lebanese health officials reported. The dead included two women and a Lebanese army soldier, the Health Ministry said in a statement. People were reported wounded in more than a dozen villages in the border area. Demonstrators, some of them carrying Hezbollah flags, attempted to enter several villages to protest Israel’s failure to withdraw from southern Lebanon by the 60-day deadline stipulated in a ceasefire agreement that halted the Israel-Hezbollah war in late November. Israel has said that it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army has not deployed to all areas of southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish its presence in the area. The Lebanese army has said it cannot deploy until Israeli forces withdraw. The Israeli army blamed Hezbollah for stirring up Sunday's protests. It said in a statement that its troops fired warning shots to 'remove threats in a number of areas where suspects were identified approaching.' It added that a number of suspects in proximity to Israeli troops were apprehended and were being questioned. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said in a statement addressing the people of southern Lebanon on Sunday that 'Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable, and I am following up on this issue at the highest levels to ensure your rights and dignity.' He urged them to 'exercise self-restraint and trust in the Lebanese Armed Forces.' The Lebanese army, in a separate statement, said it was escorting civilians into some towns in the border area and called on residents to follow military instructions to ensure their safety. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, whose Amal Movement party is allied with Hezbollah and who served as an interlocutor between the militant group and the U.S. during ceasefire negotiations, said that Sunday's bloodshed 'is a clear and urgent call for the international community to act immediately and compel Israel to withdraw from occupied Lebanese territories.' An Arabic-language spokesperson for the Israeli military, Avichay Adraee, posted on X that Hezbollah had sent 'rioters' and is 'trying to heat up the situation to cover up its situation and status in Lebanon and the Arab world.' He called Sunday morning for residents of the border area not to attempt to return to their villages. U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and the head of mission of the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL, Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro, called in a joint statement for both Israel and Lebanon to comply with their obligations under the ceasefire agreement. 'The fact is that the timelines envisaged in the November Understanding have not been met,' the statement said. 'As seen tragically this morning, conditions are not yet in place for the safe return of citizens to their villages along the Blue Line.' UNIFIL said that further violence risks undermining the fragile security situation in the area and 'prospects for stability ushered in by the cessation of hostilities and the formation of a government in Lebanon.' It called for the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops, the removal of unauthorized weapons and assets south of the Litani River, the redeployment of the Lebanese army in all of south Lebanon and ensuring the safe and dignified return of displaced civilians on both sides of the Blue Line. An AP team was stranded overnight at a UNIFIL base near Mays al-Jabal after the Israeli army erected roadblocks Saturday while they were joining a patrol by peacekeepers. The journalists reported hearing gunshots and booming sounds Sunday morning from the base, and peacekeepers said that dozens of protesters had gathered nearby. In the village of Aita al Shaab, families wandered over flattened concrete structures looking for remnants of the homes they left behind. No Israeli forces were present. 'These are our houses,' said Hussein Bajouk, one of the returning residents. 'However much they destroy, we will rebuild.' Bajouk added that he is convinced that former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs in September, is really still alive. 'I don’t know how much we’re going to wait, another month or two months... but the Sayyed will come out and speak,' he said using an honorific for Nasrallah. On the other side of the border in the kibbutz of Manara, Orna Weinberg surveyed the devastation of the recent conflict on her neighbors and the Lebanese villages on the other side of the frontier. The sound of gunfire sporadically popped in the distance. 'Unfortunately, we have no way of defending our own children without harming their children,' Weinberg, 58, said. 'It’s a tragedy to all sides.' Some 112,000 Lebanese remain displaced, out of over 1 million who fled their homes during the war. —— Sewell reported from Beirut.

Democrats splintered on immigration and how to respond to Trump	WASHINGTON (AP) — When Donald Trump took office in 2017 with promises to crack down on immigration, he was met by widespread protests that filled churches, airports and union halls as Democratic lawmaker vowed to fight the new Republican president at every turn. The second time around, Democrats helped send an immigration bill to his desk during his first week in office. Stinging from election losses, the Democratic Party has so far been splintered in responding to Trump's push against illegal immigration. Yet the party’s soul searching comes as the stakes could hardly be higher. The new president is acting to seal off the U.S.-Mexico border to asylum seekers and deport millions of immigrants who do not have permanent legal status. 'I think Donald Trump has painted the Democratic Party into a corner on immigration, and it’s going to take us a while to get out of the corner,' said Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo. 'I want us acting out of conviction about what we believe about immigration rather than out of fear.' Looking for areas of agreement with Trump On Capitol Hill, a crucial faction of Democrats are looking for places of agreement with Trump. Between the House and Senate, 58 Democrats last week voted to pass the Laken Riley Act, which requires federal authorities to detain migrants accused of theft, assaulting a police officer, or other crimes that injure or kill someone. Meanwhile, other congressional Democrats said they spent the last week addressing the fears and developing resources for those who could be deported. Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif., joined a priest at Our Lady of Guadalupe church in San Diego last weekend, carrying the Eucharist from home to home because so many in the congregation feared to go outside. What the Democratic votes may mean For Republicans, the votes on the Laken Riley Act were proof that they had found a winning message — amplified and led by Trump — on illegal immigration. They are planning to continue pushing immigration legislation, as well as a roughly $100 billion package that would enable Trump to carry out his border and deportation plans. Democratic senators willing to back tougher enforcement could be crucial. It takes support from 60 senators to advance most legislation, meaning that at least a few Democrats will need to be on board. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. 'It’s a really important moment for the country. And it’s always good when the right thing is also the popular thing,' said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., after the Laken Riley Act passed. It was named after a Georgia nursing student who was killed last year by a Venezuelan man who had entered the United States illegally and was allowed to stay and to pursue his immigration case. When asked about Democratic votes for the legislation, the party's leader in the House, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, was circumspect. 'House Democrats are going to continue to make decisions based on what's right for the districts that we represent, and the politics will take care of themselves,' he said. Since last year, many Democrats have steadily moved to the right on border security, emphasizing the need for stricter immigration enforcement after historic numbers of migrants arrived at times under Democrat Joe Biden's presidency. What Americans think Half of U.S. adults now think increasing security at the border should be a high priority for the federal government, according to a January poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Another 3 in 10 adults say it should be a moderate priority. While most Democrats oppose deporting all immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally, about 8 in 10 also favor deporting immigrants in the country illegally who have been convicted of a violent crime. The Biden administration prioritized for deportation those who posed a threat to national security. The Trump administration plans to go further by beginning its deportation operation with immigrants tied to crime. Sen. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat who last year won in Arizona while Trump also carried the state, was outspoken in his support for legislation such as the Laken Riley Act. He said that he' was just reflecting the will of his constituents, including many Latino voters. 'They want sane border security, commonsense solutions, more Border Patrol, more customs officers,' Gallego said. 'They want to see bad people get deported. They want to see an opportunity for good people — to find a way for them to stay here.' The search for unity Immigration advocates are frustrated by Democrats acquiescing to Trump's tough border. They fear Trump can own the narrative around immigration. Vanessa Cárdenas, the executive director of America’s Voice advocacy group, acknowledged that it was a 'tough moment' for Democrats. But, Cárdenas added, 'They need to find their backbone and put up a fight.' After the Laken Riley Act passed, leaders of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, a Democratic group that has usually played a key role in immigration policy, met with Jeffries as their party tried to formulate a united message. The group said it would focus on action to keep mixed-status families together, protect farmworkers and advocate for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Still, the group ranges from progressive members to those who voted for the new legislation. 'We have to show we have the ability to build consensus internally,' New York Rep. Adriano Espaillat, chair of the Hispanic caucus, told The Associated Press. At a news conference the next day, Espaillat laid out the practical concerns of mass deportations, from forcing out immigrants who have contributed to the U.S. for decades to rising food prices if agricultural laborers are targeted. The event was intended to present a united front, yet as members of the caucus took turns at the microphone, their promises varied. 'We are going to be here to fight back,' said Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-N.Y. Then Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-N.M., spoke: 'There are opportunities for us to work with Republicans, such as fighting the cartels and coyotes who traffic women and children, provide an endless supply of drugs and hurt our border communities.' __ Associated Press writer Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-democrats-are-splintered-on-immigration-and-how-to-respond-to-trump/	2025-01-26T05:04:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/6796332fe402c3.23107511.jpeg?w=900

(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump spent his first week in office bringing the U.S.-Mexico border to the nation's center stage. Donald Trump's first border actions His first actions included signing a slew of executive orders to curtail immigration and deport unauthorized migrants already in the country. One order, signed on Day One, shut down the CBP One app, canceling all outstanding appointments made by migrants seeking visas. Others designated cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, attempted to end birthright citizenship and shutter the U.S. refugee program. Immigration officers are also now permitted to enter sensitive locations like schools and churches to conduct raids. White House denies reports Mexico is refusing migrant flights In his first week, the 47th president deployed an initial 1,500 troops in California and Texas, making good on his promise to involve military personnel at the border. Multiple deportations were carried out via flight, some of which were reportedly refused by Mexico. The White House has since claimed there was a miscommunication and that Mexico has not refused any of the flights. Rep. Tony Gonzalez, R-Texas, confirmed that 80 Guatemalan nationals were deported by flight at Biggs Army Airfield in his district. Secret Service says it visited Chicago elementary school, not ICE ICE arrests more than 1,000 people across US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in 10 major U.S. cities — including Boston, Denver, New York City and Newark — have led to the arrests of more than 1,300 migrants, Trump’s 'border czar' Tom Homan told NewsNation on Thursday. Of those arrested, Homan said 1,000 have criminal records. The number of arrests in the first three days of Trump’s presidency represents about 1.1% of total arrests made by ICE in FY2024. Then, there were about 310 average arrests per day. That average is now about 433 per day — a number that will likely grow.

Trump touts 'no-tax-on-tips' plan in Nevada victory lap	President Trump on Saturday touted his campaign promise for tax-free tips and thanked Nevada voters for delivering his win as he stopped for a victory lap in the battleground state that flipped red for the first time in decades in November. 'In the coming weeks, I'll be working with Congress to get a bill on my desk that cuts taxes for workers, families, small businesses, and, very importantly, keeps my promise for a thing called .... No tax on tips,' Trump said to applause at the Circa Resort and Casino, his first visit to Nevada since taking office on Monday. 'So if you're a restaurant worker, a server, a valet, a bellhop, a bartender, or one of my caddies — I go through caddies like candy, if I play badly, I always blame my caddy — or any other worker who relies on tipped income, your tips will be 100% yours,' he continued. Florida Republican urges Trump to spare some migrants under deportation plan Trump debuted his proposal to exempt tips from federal taxes at a rally in Nevada last summer, and he has pointed to its popularity among the state’s service and hospitality workers as a big factor in his victory there. Recent polling has shown the idea has traction nationwide, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) last week reintroduced a bill to that end. As he talked up the proposal, Trump quipped to the Las Vegas crowd that 'I know you didn't hear anything about this, and I'm sure it had no influence on the state, the fact that we won this crazy, massive majority, the state that hadn't been won by a Republican in decades.' When Nevada flipped red in November, Trump became the first GOP presidential candidate to win the key swing state since President George W. Bush in 2004. 'I want to come to Nevada to pay my respects because this is the only Republican win of the state in decades, and it was a very big landslide,' Trump said, adding that 'I think Republicans are going to win a lot now.' Trump’s stop in Las Vegas came after back-to-back visits in hurricane-hit North Carolina and wildfire-torn Los Angeles, capping off a busy first week back in the Oval Office. From the Nevada stage, Trump laid out some of his accomplishments, including executive action to recognize only two sexes and end diversity, equity and inclusion practices in the federal government. White House denies reports Mexico is refusing migrant flights He touted his hiring freeze affecting the Internal Revenue Service, saying 'they hired, or tried to hire, 88,000 new workers to go after you, and we're in the process of developing a plan to either terminate all of them, or maybe we'll move them to the border.' 'How about just no tax, period?' Trump said to the crowd, after an audience member appeared to shout the suggestion. 'You know, if the tariffs work out ... a thing like that could happen.' The president also hinted at possible territorial expansion as he hailed plans to 'drill, baby, drill,' — comments that come as he floats U.S. control of Greenland and the Panama Canal. 'The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we may be a very substantially enlarged country in the not too distant — isn't it nice to see? You know, for years, for decades, we’re the same size to the square foot, probably got smaller, actually, but we might be an enlarged country pretty soon, and one of the things we're going to be doing is: drill, baby, drill,' Trump said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-touts-no-tax-on-tips-plan-in-nevada-victory-lap/	2025-01-25T14:34:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25025748210008.jpg?w=900
CIA believes COVID likely originated from a lab, but agency has l...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has 'low confidence' in its own conclusion. The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director. The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory. Mediterranean diet improves brain memory: Study Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities. 'CIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,' a spokesperson for the agency wrote in a statement about the agency's assessment. Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs. Lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths. While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019. How will federal health ‘black out’ affect bird flu response? Some official investigations, however, have raised the the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago a report by the Department of Energy concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding. Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario. 'The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,' Ratcliffe said in 2023. The CIA 'will continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information that could change CIA’s assessment,' the agency spokesperson said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/ap-cia-believes-covid-likely-originated-from-a-lab-but-agency-has-low-confidence-in-its-own-finding/	2025-01-25T12:41:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67954d6fbb08b7.80370789.jpeg?w=900
White House fires some independent inspector generals	(NewsNation) — A White House official has confirmed to NewsNation that 'some' of the independent inspectors general of major federal agencies 'have been asked to leave.' NewsNation partner The Hill reported that Trump has ousted around 17 federal watchdogs within various departments including the Department of Veteran Affairs, Defense Department, State Department, Energy Department and Housing and Urban Development. A HUD spokesperson told The Hill that Inspector General Rae Oliver Davis received notice on Friday. The Washington Post reported late Friday night that 'the White House fired the independent inspectors general of at least 14 major federal agencies in a purge that could clear the way for President Donald Trump to install loyalists in the crucial role of identifying fraud, waste and abuse in the government.' Mexico refuses US military flight deporting migrants, sources say House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Angie Craig criticized Trump's move in a statement on Saturday. 'While the president has the right to replace inspector generals, the late-night firing of these independent watchdogs not only violates the law but also hampers our ability to combat waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure programs are run as Congress intended, whether its disaster assistance for farmers or nutrition programs,' she said. Craig referred to the 'midnight purge of inspector generals' as 'alarming and unprecedented.' 'These firings threaten to undermine public trust at a time when many hardworking Americans doubt whether government institutions are looking out for them and reinforce the perception that politicians get to play by a different set of rules,' she added. Senator Chuck Schumer also ripped Trump on X, saying that it 'is a glaring sign that it’s a Golden Age for corruption and abuse in government.' In an earlier statement on the platform, Schumer also said it could be a violation of federal law with 30 day-notice needed to fire inspector generals.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/white-house-fires-independent-inspector-generals/	2025-01-25T09:24:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195072294.jpg?w=900
Senate confirms Noem to lead Department of Homeland Security	The Senate on Saturday approved the nomination of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) to lead the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), putting her at the center of an administration focused heavily on immigration. The 59-34 vote to confirm Noem capped off a relatively smooth process even as other nominees face more intense scrutiny. Six Democrats voted with Republicans to confirm Noem: Sens. John Fetterman (Pa.), Tim Kaine (Va.), Andy Kim (N.J.), Gary Peters (Mich.), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) and Elissa Slotkin (Mich.). Noem will lead one of the most sprawling agencies in government and one of particular importance in a Trump administration determined to crack down on immigration. During his first week in office, President Trump signed a number of orders on immigration, taking steps to militarize the border and crack down on many legal pathways for immigrating to the U.S. That included suspending refugee admissions and working to limit asylum — another pathway for those fleeing danger and persecution. He also sought to end birthright citizenship for children not born to U.S. citizens. While the order would apply to children of those unlawfully present, it could also impact those born to non-immigrant visas, such as those legally in the U.S. on work visas. It has already been challenged in court. The nomination is a major win for Noem, a four-term congresswoman with little national security experience but who had been vocal on border issues as governor, sending the South Dakota National Guard to the southern border. She is slated to work closely with Tom Homan, who Trump tapped as his border czar. It also solidifies her standing in MAGA circles after chatter about her serving as a potential running mate to Trump faltered amid the release of her book, in which she wrote about shooting a young dog she described as untrainable. Noem earned the backing of those on both sides of the aisle despite the role she will play in a controversial policy area. 'Kristi brings experience and commitment to her new role,' Senate Majority John Thune (R-S.D.) said on the Senate floor on Friday. 'One of the biggest challenges facing the Department of Homeland Security right now is securing our nation’s border. Four years of record breaking illegal immigration at our southern border has left our country vulnerable to a whole host of security concerns.' 'Fixing this crisis and restoring respect for the rule of law is one of President Trump and Republicans’ top priorities, and it’s going to require a decisive and committed leader at the Department of Homeland Security,' Thune continued. 'I believe Kristi has everything it takes to undertake this task.' Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), the top Democrat of the Senate Homeland and Government Affairs Committee, said he was willing to back Noem due to her commitment to handling issues on a bipartisan basis. 'During her confirmation hearing, I pressed Governor Noem to set aside partisan ideologies and to follow the facts when it comes to the threats our communities face – whether we’re talking about securing our borders, foreign and domestic terrorism, or even increasingly devastating natural disasters,' he said in a statement when Noem advanced out of committee. 'Given her openness to working on a bipartisan basis to address these and other threats to our homeland security, I voted to advance her nomination out of committee and send it to the Senate floor for consideration.' The South Dakota governor was on track for a bipartisan confirmation after the panel approved her in a 13-2 tally on Monday. Noem’s role will not just be limited to immigration. She will also oversee the numerous national security functions DHS controls, including the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, and DHS’s Office of Intelligence Analysis. DHS also oversees the Secret Service, which has come under increasing scrutiny following two attempts on Trump’s life. The department also plays a key role in responding to cyberattacks through the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Trump has also recently spoken about siphoning off another key DHS agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has come under fire as it has responded to a series of back-to-back natural disasters. The confirmation marks the fourth national security nominee the Senate has green-lighted in Trump’s first week. The upper chamber unanimously and quickly approved Marco Rubio to lead the State Department before Democrats forced Republicans to run out the clock in order to confirm John Ratcliffe and Pete Hegseth to lead the CIA and Pentagon, respectively.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/senate-confirms-noem-to-lead-department-of-homeland-security/	2025-01-25T09:03:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/IMG_5214.jpeg?w=900
Inflation isn't the only reason egg prices are soaring	(NewsNation) — The last time eggs were under $2 a dozen was January 2022, around the time the now-widespread bird flu outbreak first originated. Now, egg eaters are lucky if they can find them cheaper than $7 to $9. Avian influenza, or bird flu, has killed millions of chicken flocks across the country, which is hurting the nation's egg-laying population. This has caused a supply shortage and in turn, higher prices for consumers. Egg prices have skyrocketed, with some grocery stores running out of the food item altogether and some placing limits on the number of cartons people can buy at once. In a statement to NewsNation, Walmart said they have not put a purchase limit on eggs but acknowledged that 'supply is very tight in some areas.' Experts say it’s going to get worse before it gets better. The Department of Agriculture reports that 136 million birds have been infected by or died from the bird flu since January 2022. More than 13 million chickens have died in the last month. Rents for single-family homes 41% higher than prepandemic In some states like California, prices have reached nearly $9 a carton, up 70% since December, according to the USDA Egg Markets News Report. Last week before President Donald Trump's inauguration, the Department of Health and Human Services said it would give biotech company Moderna just under $600 million to try to accelerate a bird flu vaccine. The FDA issued an alert saying eggs are safe to eat despite the infected chickens. Also, the risk of humans contracting the disease is rare. The CDC has reported 67 human cases and one death in Louisiana. The virus is also spreading among dairy cattle in California.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/egg-prices-soaring-bird-flu/	2025-01-25T08:39:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195557704.jpg?w=900
Missing Florida woman Jennifer Kesse's family hopeful 19 years la...	(NewsNation) — Florida woman Jennifer Kesse was last seen leaving for work in 2006. 19 years later, her family is still searching for answers, but hope remains with the involvement of state and federal agencies. On the anniversary of her disappearance, Jennifer's father Drew Kesse joined NewsNation's 'Banfield' to share how he feels her case was mishandled and explain how NASA got involved in the search. 'It’s Jennifer's time in the lineup, I guess, to either be found or not found,' Drew Kesse said. What happened to Jennifer Kesse? In 2016, 10 years after her disappearance, Jennifer was officially declared dead by the state of Florida. Since then, the Orlando Police Department handed the case files over to the family, who have now hired a private investigator, hoping for answers. They also enlisted the help of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which is now leading the investigation. The agency announced Friday that it has conducted more than 50 interviews and reviewed tens of thousands of documents and pieces of evidence in hopes of developing new avenues to explore. Christy Giles’ husband: Hollywood producer’s defense is ‘shaky’ Florida woman Jennifer Kesse was last seen leaving for work in 2006 'FDLE, finally after 18 years, got involved, and it took them a little while to get going, but boy, they're going now,' Kesse said. 'But they are truly putting all the resources that they have towards trying to find out what happened to Jennifer, and we couldn't be more grateful. It's, been too long.' Nearly two decades ago on Jan. 24, 2006, Jennifer's day started like any other. She took a shower, got dressed, did her hair and makeup and then headed to work. But that's when things veered from the usual routine. The 24-year-old simply vanished. Her boyfriend didn't get his usual text that morning, and he couldn't reach her by phone. She didn't show up for work, which was unlike her, according to friends and family. Family of woman killed by estranged husband wants longer sentence Jennifer’s parents realized her purse, keys, phone and iPod — items she typically would take to work — were missing from her home. That was when Jennifer's parents contacted the Orlando Police Department. Soon after, Jennifer's car was found abandoned a mile away at a different apartment complex. Apartment security cameras showed images of a man parking her car around noon the day she disappeared. Because the video was so grainy, police made the rare move of reaching out to NASA for help.

(Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) NASA was able to produce a clearer image, providing a partial profile of the suspect, who wore clothing typical of a painter or some kind of worker. At the time of Jennifer's disappearance, she told her parents that workers at her building made her feel 'uncomfortable.' Once the family received the evidence from local police, they realized the lead detective hadn't been investigating. 'Come to find out, she did not write a single word for seven years,' Kesse said. 'It's a good thing that it's out of Orlando. I honestly don't think that they had the talent to do what's needed to do in a long-term missing persons case.' Evidence in Jennifer Kesse's case A witness saw Jennifer's car swerve out of the condo complex. Handprints and scratches on her car, which appeared to have been cleaned before it was found, indicate there may have been a struggle. A skeleton key for Jennifer's building had gone missing a year earlier. Physical evidence from the car includes hairs and 100 fingerprints, some of which were not identified to a person at the time. 'We do have to remember, technology has come so far since 2006. We didn't even have Google Earth in 2006. It was in beta, so we were still tapping twice on our phones for the letter B when we were texting things like that,' Kesse said. 'So, it's come a long way. Unfortunately, it just didn't help Jennifer at the time.' The family remains hopeful despite the decadeslong delays. 'This is what we live with, and we move forward every day because we have unconditional love for Jennifer,' Kesse said. 'We're just not going to give up until we find her.'

Hegseth says Pentagon will 'put America first' as sec. of defense	(NewsNation) — Pete Hegseth praised Jesus, President Donald Trump and his wife Jennifer for his Senate-confirmed position as Secretary of Defense. After being sworn in, Hegseth thanked those of greatest importance to him before saying it is 'the honor of a lifetime to serve under [the president].' Hegseth added, 'We will put America first, we will bring peace through strength. [At the Pentagon], we will restore the warrior ethos in everything that we do, rebuild our military and reestablish deterrence.' Vice President JD Vance's tiebreaking vote allowed for Hegseth's nomination to go through, despite tough grilling from legislators during the confirmation process. 'We don't want to fight wars, we want to deter them and we want to end them responsibly,' Hegseth said. 'But, if we need to fight them, we're going to bring overwhelming and decisive force to close with and destroy the enemy, and bring our boys home.' Democratic states weigh more support for immigrants as Trump administration cracks down His children and wife joined him on stage as Vance swore him in. 'I have to say a few words of appreciation, first, of course, to the President of the United States for nominating a person who is respected and adorned by the war fighters,' Vance said. 'I also want to say thank you to my Senate colleagues. It turns out we couldn't spare one.' Trump praised the Senate's decision. He wrote on Truth Social late Friday, 'Congratulations to Pete Hegseth. He will make a great Secretary of Defense.' On Saturday before the swearing-in, Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, showed his support. 'Congratulations to Pete Hegseth on being confirmed as Secretary of Defense,' Turner said in a statement. 'As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I look forward to working with Secretary Hegseth on rebuilding our military and its readiness to meet the challenges posed by our adversaries.' Former Senate leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., opposed Hegseth's appointment, voting no on Friday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-congratulates-hegseth-secretary-of-defense/	2025-01-25T08:01:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Pete-Hegseth-e1731682598233.jpg?w=900
Mexico refuses US military flight deporting migrants, sources say	WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Mexico has refused a request from President Donald Trump's administration to allow a U.S. military aircraft deporting migrants to land in the country, a U.S. official and a Mexican official told Reuters. U.S. military aircraft carried out two similar flights, each with about 80 migrants, to Guatemala on Friday. The government was not able to move ahead with a plan to have a C-17 transport aircraft land in Mexico, however, after the country denied permission. A U.S. official and a Mexican official confirmed the decision, which was first reported by NBC News. Mexico's foreign ministry, in a statement late on Friday, said the country had a 'very great relationship' with the U.S. and cooperated on issues such as immigration. 'When it comes to repatriations, we will always accept the arrival of Mexicans to our territory with open arms,' the ministry said. Secret Service says it visited Chicago elementary school, not ICE The Mexican official did not give a reason for the denial of permission to land, while the foreign ministry did not mention the incident. Trump's administration earlier this week announced it was re-launching the program known as 'Remain in Mexico,' which forced non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until their cases in the United States were resolved. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Wednesday such a move would require the country receiving the asylum-seekers to agree, and that Mexico had not done so. The U.S. State Department and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S.-Mexico relations have come into sharp focus since Trump started his second term on Monday with the declaration of a national emergency along the two nations' shared border. He has ordered 1,500 additional U.S. troops there so far, and officials have said thousands more could deploy soon. The president has declared Mexican drug cartels terrorist organizations, renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and threatened an across-the-board 25% duty on Mexican goods beginning in February. Sheinbaum has sought to avoid escalating the situation and expressed openness toward accommodating Mexican nationals who are returned. Colorado hotline sees increased ICE raid reports around Denver But the leftist leader has also said she does not agree with mass deportations and that Mexican immigrants are vital to the U.S. economy. The use of U.S. military aircraft to carry out deportation flights is part of the Pentagon's response to Trump's national emergency declaration on Monday. In the past, U.S. military aircraft have been used to relocate individuals from one country to another, like during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. This was the first time in recent memory that U.S. military aircraft were used to fly migrants out of the country, one U.S. official said. The Pentagon has said that the U.S. military would provide flights to deport more than 5,000 immigrants held by U.S. authorities in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California. Guatemala also on Friday received a third flight of about 80 deported migrants on a chartered commercial aircraft, Guatemalan authorities told Reuters.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/mexico-refuses-us-flight-deporting-migrants/	2025-01-25T06:21:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2172480608.jpg?w=900
Trump's 5 biggest moves on immigration so far	President Trump released a flurry of immigration actions this week, signing a series of orders targeting the border and ramping up enforcement. While Trump has long pledged to address illegal immigration, many of his actions targeted longstanding legal pathways. 'As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do,' he said in his inaugural address. Immigration advocates describe the actions as yet another example of Trump cruelty, targeting vulnerable people while causing further unrest at the border in ways that won’t make Americans safer. Here’s a look at Trump’s five biggest moves on immigration during his first week in office: Birthright citizenship Trump signed an order on Day One to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to many noncitizen parents. It’s a move that directly counters the Constitution, which grants citizenship to anyone born in U.S. territory regardless of the status of their parents. The order generated some of the first lawsuits — and legal victories — against the Trump administration. Twenty-two different Democrat-led states sued over the order, as did groups including the American Civil Liberties Union. And a four-group band of states led by Washington scored a temporary injunction blocking the order for the next two weeks. 'I've been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,' U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour, a Reagan appointee, said during the hearing. The order was broader than just targeting children of those who may not be in the country legally. It applied to anyone in the U.S. on a nonimmigrant visa, a status that also includes those on work visas, raising numerous questions for how the children of those lawfully present would be viewed under U.S. law. Refugee program suspended Another order from Trump paused the U.S. refugee program, leaving the program under review for three months. The order calls for the Departments of Homeland Security and State to issue a report within 90 days detailing whether it’s in the nation’s interests to resume the admission of refugees. The secretaries of State and Homeland Security will submit a report every 90 days until it is found that it is appropriate to resume refugee admissions, the order states. Until then, refugee admissions will remain suspended. Though the order was not set to take effect until Monday, both agencies immediately curtailed their refugee operations. The State Department suspended refugee flights, saying it was 'coordinating with implementing partners to suspend refugee arrivals to the United States and cease processing activities.' And an email reviewed by The Hill that was sent to staffers who process refugee cases at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services also directed them not to 'make any final decisions (approval, denial closure) on any refugee application.' 'The refugee program is not just a humanitarian lifeline through which the U.S. has shown global leadership. It represents the gold standard of legal immigration pathways in terms of security screening, community coordination, and mutual economic benefit,' Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, which helps resettle refugees, said in a statement when the order was first announced. Shutting down the CBP One app After Trump took office, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol suspended the CBP One App, cancelling all outstanding appointments made by migrants without visas who sought to enter the United States through legal ports of entry. CBP One was a key component of the Biden administration’s efforts to channel migrants through legal pathways to seek refuge in the United States, one they also used to bring a more orderly process at the border. Shutting down the app left in limbo those who have been waiting months just to get an appointment. It also sparked criticism from immigration advocates who said the Trump administration was targeting those who have sought to come to the U.S. through legal channels. The Trump administration this week also shut down the Safe Mobility portal, another initiative of the Biden administration that established offices across Latin America to help immigrants find legal pathways to the U.S. and dissuade them from migrating illegally. Militarizing the border Trump signed a series of orders directing increased military presence at the southern border. He signed a proclamation Monday evening declaring a national emergency at the border, a move that will mobilize additional resources to the region. The declaration will allow the Trump administration to deploy Pentagon forces and resources to help complete construction of the border wall and also allows for surveillance at the border, including the use of uncrewed aerial systems. Trump also signed an executive order directing U.S. Northern Command to draft detailed operational plans for the border. That directive came in an order declaring an 'invasion' there. The Pentagon is sending around 1,000 Army soldiers and 500 Marines to the border, building on an existing practice of relying on troops to support existing immigration agents. But the White House’s nods to the potential for more troops raises questions over whether military presence at the border could eventually violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars troops from carrying out domestic law enforcement duties. Beyond potential legal issues, immigration advocates are also concerned about having armed troops in close proximity to migrants. 'Military people are trained for a very aggressive, bellicose scenario, not necessarily for crowd control,' said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. 'And so we feel that there are other types of law enforcement agencies that are trained for that, and that are best suited to be at the border, and they are already at the border.' Boasting over the border While Trump has taken a significant number of immigration actions, in some cases his team also sought to take credit for ongoing immigration enforcement actions. The White House on Friday shared an image of migrants boarding a plane, saying 'deportations have begun.' The photo was also emblazoned with the words, 'Promises made. Promises kept.' Of course, deportations never stopped under President Biden, and the statement was mocked by immigration experts. 'Are these people seriously trying to suggest the deportation flights have not already been going on?' Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, wrote on X. 'They’re lying to you. The Biden administration had already ramped up deportations from the border to a higher level than it was under the Trump admin.' The photo of migrants boarding a plane to be deported was reportedly returning a group of Guatemalan citizens, a nation that accepted hundreds of deportation flights during the Biden administration. Government accounts on Friday also sought to highlight migrants arrests, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) touting it had made 538 arrests and lodged 373 detainers as of Thursday night. However, those figures are also not a sharp departure from the levels that were under Biden, with Reichlin-Melnick saying the Trump administration was 'slap[ping] a ‘mass deportation’ sticker on the side of normal ICE operations.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-5-biggest-moves-on-immigration-so-far/	2025-01-25T04:07:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Immigration-–-5-things_012425_AP_Evan-Vucci.jpg?w=900
Hamas releases 4 female Israeli soldiers in ceasefire deal swap	(NewsNation) — Another four hostages in Hamas captivity were released Saturday morning and have returned to Israel, nearly one week since the start of the ceasefire deal with Israel in the war in Gaza. This is the second round of hostages freed since the deal took effect Sunday, Jan. 19. The hostages are four female Israeli soldiers, 19-year-old Liri Albag and 20-year-olds Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy, who were kidnapped on Oct. 7, 2023, in the Hamas attack that spawned the war. Agam Berger, 20, was another female soldier abducted from their unit but was not included in the deal, reports say. Ceasefire deal timeline: What officials say will happen next The four women were seen in military uniforms handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross a few minutes after 4 a.m. ET (11 a.m. local) in Gaza City. Shortly after, the Israeli military confirmed. They will be medically evaluated, transferred to hospitals and then reunited with their families.

Israel and Hamas are set to swap more hostages for prisoners in a...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel and Hamas were expected to swap more hostages for Palestinian prisoners on Saturday, the second such exchange since a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip last weekend and another test for the deal. The truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the militant group. The fragile deal has so far held, quieting airstrikes and rockets and allowing for increased aid to flow into the tiny coastal territory. When the ceasefire started Sunday, three hostages held by the militants were released in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children. On Saturday, four hostages are expected to be freed for 200 prisoners, including 120 who are serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks on Israelis. They will likely be released into Gaza or sent abroad. The four Israeli soldiers, Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19, were captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war. They were taken from Nahal Oz base near the border with Gaza when Palestinian militants overran it, killing more than 60 soldiers there. The female abductees had all served in a unit of lookouts charged with monitoring threats along the border. A fifth female soldier in their unit, Agam Berger, 20, was abducted with them but not included in the list. Israel's military issued a statement Saturday morning saying that preparations had been completed to receive the hostages and provide them medical care and personal support at the initial reception points, then transfer them to hospitals and reunite them with their families. In Gaza City's central Palestine Square, a crowd began to gather early as militants worked to cordon off an area where the hostages were expected to be handed over to the Red Cross. After the swap, Israel is expected to begin pulling back from the Netzarim corridor — an east-west road dividing Gaza in two — and allowing displaced Palestinians in the south to return to their former homes in the north for the first time since the beginning of the war. Palestinians will only be allowed to move north on foot, with vehicular traffic restricted until later in the ceasefire. What happens after the deal’s initial six-week phase is uncertain, but many hope it will lead to the end of a war that has leveled wide swaths of Gaza, displaced the vast majority of its population, and left hundreds of thousands of people at risk of famine. The conflict began with a cross-border attack led by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, when Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 others hostage. More than 100 hostages were freed in a weeklong truce the following month. But dozens have remained in captivity for over a year with no contact with the outside world. Israel believes at least a third of the more than 90 captives still inside Gaza were killed in the initial attack or died in captivity. Israel's air and ground war, one of the deadliest and most destructive in decades, has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not say how many were militants. They say women and children make up more than half the fatalities. ___ Follow coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israel-and-hamas-are-set-to-swap-more-hostages-for-prisoners-in-another-test-of-the-gaza-ceasefire/	2025-01-25T00:03:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67949b5bc22859.29490535.jpeg?w=900
Trump visit is 'morale boost': CA fire official	PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. (NewsNation) — Cal Fire battalion chief Brent Pascua said President Donald Trump's visit to Southern California following wildfire devastation is a 'morale boost' for the firefighters who have been working tirelessly. 'It's not over,' Pascua said during an appearance on 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' 'I don't know what Trump can give us, but it's a morale boost.' Trump toured the damage caused by wildfires in Southern California on Friday, later expressing that the devastation is beyond what can be captured in images. Trump says the federal government is behind California ‘100%’ Trump acknowledged he had a 'very positive talk' with California Gov. Gavin Newsom once he landed in Los Angeles. He told wildfire victims and city officials the federal government is '100% behind California.' Gavin Newsom signs $2.5B bill to aid California wildfire recovery His comments came after he took an aerial and walking tour of Pacific Palisades, a neighborhood destroyed by one of the recent fires. On Thursday, Newsom signed legislation directing $2.5 billion in relief to support response and recovery efforts for Los Angeles.

Bolton: What can Pete Hegseth do in a 'tripolar nuclear world'?	(NewsNation) — Democrats missed the chance to grill Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth on topics of national security while favoring questions about his 'drinking' and 'womanizing,' said Donald Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton. 'I think the way the confirmation hearing was conducted left it entirely open to the Democrats to try and make the case against Hegseth on the basis of competence, and they didn't do it,' he said. Bolton told NewsNation’s Elizabeth Vargas that Hegseth’s expertise wasn’t fully put to the test during the hearing. Pete Hegseth will be confirmed, has ‘big shoes to fill’: Clark 'What are you going to do in a tripolar nuclear world where China joins Russia and the U.S. (in terms of nuclear weapon capabilities)? So we just don't know what (Hegseth) knows or doesn't know — but we're going to find out one way or another,' Bolton said. He believes that barring an unforeseen event, Hegseth will be confirmed as secretary of defense on Friday evening. Bolton’s security detail revoked He also addressed President Donald Trump’s decision to revoke his security detail, a move that could potentially endanger the former diplomat’s life. 'I think this kind of attitude by Trump shows that what his real motivation was was entirely political,' said Bolton. 'This is part of the retribution campaign.' Trump revoked government security protection for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, his top aide, Brian Hook, and Bolton, all of whom have faced threats from Iran since they took hard-line stances on the Islamic Republic during Trump's first administration. Trump signs order to declassify files on JFK, RFK and MLK Jr. assassinations Bolton, who has been targeted for assassination by Iran, said the Republic is still looking to exact revenge for the U.S. assassination of Iranian defense official Qassem Soleimani in 2020. 'President Biden back in late 2021 ordered that I receive protection,' said Bolton. 'It was ordered on the basis that the reason the Iranians were threatening to — and not just threatening, trying — to hire hitmen to assassinate me was because I carried out my official responsibilities as national security adviser.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/pete-hegseth-confirmation-john-bolton/	2025-01-24T15:47:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/hegsethpete_120924gn02_w.jpg?w=900
Pete Hegseth will be confirmed, has 'big shoes to fill': Clark	(NewsNation) — Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth 'has some big shoes to fill' if he is confirmed, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Wesley Clark said on 'NewsNation Now.' 'I think it's the president's choice. That's our system,' the retired four-star general said ahead of Friday's Senate vote. 'I think the senior ranks in the military will do the best they can to work with the officer or leader appointed over them,' Clark added. Bolton: What can Pete Hegseth do in a ‘tripolar nuclear world’? Hegseth, a Fox News personality and former combat veteran, faces allegations of excessive drinking and aggressive actions toward women. He's denied all allegations. Detractors of the 44-year-old nominee also point to his inexperience and the Department of Defense's massive budget as a mismatch. 'Pete Hegseth has got to prove himself,' Clark said. 'He's got to earn their respect. Having the office is one thing, but actually doing the job is another.' Trump ends federal security detail for Dr. Anthony Fauci If confirmed, which Clark thinks is likely, what matters most for Hegseth is who he works with — preferably, those with more bureaucratic experience. 'He's got to have people around him that he trusts who do have that experience,' Clark added. 'Because you're managing a huge bit of bureaucracy ... it requires attention to detail and management skill.'

Watch live: Pete Hegseth faces close Senate vote for confirmation	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Senate will vote on the nomination of Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense Friday night, one day after two Republicans said they could not support the former combat veteran and Fox News personality serving in the role. However, Hegseth could still have enough support in the Senate in Friday's vote, even if one more Republican chooses not to support the nominee. On Thursday, Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, announced in separate statements why they voted against advancing Hegseth's nomination following Thursday's 51-49 Senate vote. Despite the two GOP defections, Republicans who spoke with NewsNation ahead of the vote believed Hegseth has enough support to secure the nomination. If needed, Vice President JD Vance could cast the tie-breaking vote should another Republican senator follow Murkowski and Collins’ lead. Trump tours Helene-hit North Carolina on first trip of second term Hegseth faces allegations of excessive drinking and aggressive actions toward women, which he has denied. In her statement announcing her decision not to support Hegseth’s nomination, Murkowski mentioned both of the claims levied against Hegseth while Collins said she believed the former television host lacked the experience to serve as defense secretary. Murkowski’s statement said that Hegseth’s 'past behaviors …demonstrate a lack of judgment that is unbecoming of someone who could lead our armed forces.' Regardless, other Republican senators expected Hegseth to be appointed to the role he was nominated for by President Donald Trump. 'Who knows, he may lose one more (Republican),' Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told NewsNation. 'But I’d be very surprised based on the number of people who have publicly said they are going to support him. … I’d be surprised if we lost another vote.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/hegseth-senate-vote-confirmation/	2025-01-24T13:05:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/675b325ce76751.04159269.jpeg?w=900
1,300 arrested in big city deportation operations: Homan	(NewsNation) — Federal authorities have arrested more than 1,300 migrants, according to President Donald Trump’s 'border czar' Tom Homan, who has carried out deportation operations in nearly 10 major cities across the U.S. Homan told NewsNation on Thursday that of the 1,300 arrested, at least 1,000 have criminal records. 'The other ones are either fugitives who've been through immigration court, that became a fugitive, or collaterals … in sanctuary cities because they forced us in the community,' Homan said. The number of arrests in the first three days of Trump’s presidency represents about 1.1% of total arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in FY2024. Fugitive task force plays critical role in border mission There were about 310 average arrests per day in 2024, but that average is now about 433 per day — with a high likelihood that number will grow. Homan said the Biden administration did not allow ICE to arrest migrants unless they were convicted of a serious crime, but that that policy no longer binds agents. 'There's nothing in the Immigration Nationality Act that says you got to be convicted of a crime. If you're here illegally, you could be removed,' he said. 'Our focus is on arresting public safety threats and national security threats. That's exactly what we're doing now.' Raids have taken place in major cities such as Boston, Denver, New York City, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, Miami, Washington, D.C., and Newark, N.J., according to media reports. Several of those, such as Newark, are sanctuary cities, which are areas that have refused to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in deportation proceedings. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said in a statement Thursday that ICE agents detained multiple people — including U.S. citizens, a U.S. military veteran and undocumented individuals — without a warrant. Trump expands use of fast-track deportation, which critics say is prone to mistakes 'Newark will not stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorized,' the statement read. In Chicago, another sanctuary city, Mayor Brandon Johnson launched a campaign in conjunction with the public transportation system in which digital monitors at train stations provide 'know your rights' information to migrants, reported WLS-TV. 'Any of the measures that the president is looking to execute against working people in the city of Chicago ... ' Johnson said, according to the outlet, 'We will defend our city. It's just that simple.' But Homan pushed back on sanctuary cities, saying if they cooperated by allowing ICE into local jails, then federal agents wouldn't have to go into communities to arrest people. 'They're not letting us in the county jail because of their sanctuary laws, but if we can arrest the bad guy in the safety and security of a jail — which is safer for the officer, safer for the aliens, safer for the community — then it'd be a lot less of the type of low-level offenders, and be a lot less arrested,' Homan said. When agents are forced into the community, 'sanctuary cities will get exactly what they don't want: more agents in neighborhoods and more collateral arrests while we're doing this criminal operation,' he said. 'I hope the sanctuary cities come around,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/arrests-big-city-deportation/	2025-01-24T09:23:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/videoframe_2526.png?w=800

(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump will kick off his first cross-country tour of his second term Friday, visiting disaster areas in North Carolina and California before heading to Nevada on Saturday for a rally. The tour comes as Trump considers overhauling the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), floating the idea that he'd rather see states handle their 'own problems.' Friday's focus is on two major disaster zones. Trump's first stop is North Carolina, a state he visited in the wake of Hurricane Helene while still campaigning for the White House. Without FEMA, ‘more people would have died’ in Helene: Resident He'll return as he renews his criticism of the Biden administration, accusing it and FEMA of abandoning North Carolina, which still faces more than $50 billion in damage. After the Tar Heel State, Trump will head to California, where wildfires continue to burn and first responders work to contain the blazes. On Saturday, his trip to Nevada will strike a different tone as he thanks voters for giving him his first win in the state. He's expected to highlight his 'no tax on tips' campaign promises.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tours-north-carolina-helene/	2025-01-24T05:25:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2194583291.jpg?w=900
Trump to survey wildfire-damaged Southern California	PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump will tour the damage caused by wildfires in Southern California on Friday as he continues to feud with Gov. Gavin Newsom over his handling of the disaster and federal aid. Nearly 50,000 acres have burned from Los Angeles to San Diego. Eight active wildfires are burning in the region, and a red flag warning remains in effect. Residents are also reeling from the deadly and destructive Palisades and Eaton fires. Trump has criticized the state for not sending enough water into the cities, while Newsom accuses the president of spreading misinformation. The Trump administration has remained largely silent about specific plans for Friday. Trump may visit the region in person to survey the widespread damage, or he could choose to view it from a helicopter. Gavin Newsom signs $2.5B bill to aid California wildfire recovery Newsom, Trump spar on California water policy Tensions have escalated between Newsom and Trump over how the wildfires have been managed. Since the fires broke out on Jan. 7, Trump has used social media and interviews to accuse the state of sending too much water to the Pacific Ocean instead of south toward Los Angeles and to highlight how some hydrants ran dry in the early hours of the firefight in Pacific Palisades. In the first hours of his second term, Trump called on federal officials to draft plans to route more water to the crop-rich Central Valley and densely populated cities in the southern part of the state. Disaster prep: How to know if you’re underinsured Two days later, he threatened to withhold federal disaster aid unless California leaders change the state's approach to its management of water. Trump blames Newsom for the city's inability to tame some of the deadly fires, while Newsom denies this claim. On Thursday, Newsom signed legislation directing $2.5 billion in relief to support response and recovery efforts for Los Angeles.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/trump-survey-wildfire-damage-california/	2025-01-24T04:57:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25022819258498-1.jpg?w=900
A look at the executive orders President Trump has signed	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump wasted no time in carrying out his White House agenda with a series of executive orders ranging from securing the U.S.-Mexico border and the ban on TikTok to pushing economic policies designed to prioritize American interests. By signing 26 executive orders during his first day in office alone, Trump put himself on pace to rank among the fastest-acting presidents during his first 100 days in office. In addition to curbing the flow of migrants entering the U.S. illegally, Trump has vowed to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the government and to establish the Department of Government Efficiency.

US active duty troops beginning to arrive in Texas and San Diego ...	WASHINGTON (AP) - Active duty military troops will begin arriving in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego on Thursday evening, in what defense officials said is the first batch of the new forces being deployed to secure the southern border. The Pentagon announced on Wednesday that about 1,500 troops were being sent to the border this week, as the department scrambles to put in motion President Donald Trump’s executive order demanding an immediate crackdown on immigration. U.S. officials said they expect additional troops to be ordered to deploy in the next few days as defense and homeland security leaders iron out requests for more support. The officials said it’s not yet clear how many more service members would get tapped in the near future, but they would include active duty, National Guard and Reserves, and come from land, air and sea forces. Other defense and military officials this week estimated that the additional number deployed could be in the thousands. The troops announced Wednesday include about 1,000 Army soldiers from a variety of units and 500 Marines from Camp Pendleton in California. Officials said Thursday that they expect the bulk of them to be in El Paso - including Fort Bliss - or in San Diego by Friday, where they will get their mission assignments and prepare to spread out along the border. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details on troop movements. There were already about 2,500 Guard and Reserve forces deployed to the border, and the new 1,500 would add to that total. But officials noted that given the length of the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico, it will take additional forces to help put large rolls of concertina wire barriers in place and provide needed transportation, intelligence and other support to the Border Patrol. As of Thursday there were still no requests for the use of military bases to house migrants or for troops to be used for law enforcement duties.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/us-active-duty-troops-beginning-to-arrive-in-texas-and-san-diego-to-support-border-security/	2025-01-23T15:48:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-163834.jpg?w=494
Released JFK files could be ‘embarrassing’ to CIA: Journalist	(NewsNation) — An investigative journalist and Pulitzer Prize finalist said that while the release of thousands of classified government documents about the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy may not put any conspiracy theories to rest, they will likely be 'embarrassing' to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 'I think these files won't prove that (the CIA) was behind the effort to kill the president, but I think they will be embarrassing to the agency about how much they knew that Oswald was unhinged in the weeks before the assassination,' Gerald Posner told NewsNation’s Elizabeth Vargas. 'They never told the FBI. So to the extent the files show that it will be embarrassing to the agency, and it should be, because we need to see these after all these years well.' Trump: Make products in America or face tariffs Trump had promised during his reelection campaign to make public the last batches of still-classified documents surrounding Kennedy's assassination in Dallas, which has transfixed people for decades. He made a similar pledge during his first term but ultimately bent to appeals from the CIA and FBI to keep some documents withheld. Posner cautions, however, that if you’re looking for what he calls an 'X-Files' moment, you’re probably going to be disappointed. Nevertheless, Posner said there will be 'important information' in the released files. 'There are still files about the Bay of Pigs, the failed invasion there. There are things about the Mafia, CIA plot to kill (Fidel) Castro. There's some Mexican intelligence material on Oswald. So we'll fill in part of the history, but I don't think it will put the conspiracy theories to rest,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/released-jfk-files-cia-gerald-posner/	2025-01-23T15:19:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2194905868.jpg?w=900
Trump signs order to declassify files on JFK, RFK and MLK assassi...	(Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an order related to the declassification of files on the assassinations of former president John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr., an aide to Trump said. 'Give that to RFK Jr.,' Trump said about the pen he used to sign the order declassifying information about the JFK, RFK and MLK assassinations. 'All will be revealed.' Trump: Make products in America or face tariffs Trump had promised on the campaign trail to release classified intelligence and law enforcement files on the 1963 assassination of JFK, America's 35th president. He had made a similar promise during his 2017 to 2021 term, and he did in fact release some documents related to JFK's 1963 slaying. But he ultimately bowed to pressure from the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation, and kept a significant chunk of documents under wraps, citing national security concerns.

Senate advances Hegseth nomination; Collins, Murkowski vote 'no'	The Senate voted largely along party lines Thursday to advance Pete Hegseth, President Trump’s nominee to serve as secretary of Defense, brushing aside a litany of misconduct allegations and the objections of Democrats who argued he is unqualified for the job. The 51-49 vote to end debate on Hegseth’s nomination sets the stage for a final confirmation vote on Friday, when he is expected to secure the majority support he needs to join Trump’s Cabinet. Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Maine) voted against Hegseth. Trump has touted Hegseth as someone who would bring a fresh perspective to the leadership of the Pentagon, move past the 'political agendas' of the Biden administration and help build the 'most powerful military in the world.' Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, who strongly supported Hegseth throughout the confirmation process, argued that the American people gave Trump 'a clear mandate' to reform Washington. He called Hegseth a 'good choice' who would be 'open to new ideas' and 'not beholden to the status quo.' Democrats, however, panned Hegseth as completely unqualified and unfit to lead the nation’s armed forces given his lack of managerial experience and multiple allegations of misbehavior. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) on Thursday called Hegseth, a former Fox News host who retired from the Army with the rank of major, 'utterly unqualified' and among Trump’s 'very worst nominees.' 'Pete Hegseth has shown himself not only incapable of running a large organization, he often shows himself incapable of showing up or showing up in a way where he could get anything done,' Schumer said. Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the ranking member of the Armed Services panel, said Hegseth repeatedly 'dodged and deferred' allegations of 'disregarding the laws of war, financial mismanagement, racist and sexist remarks about men and women in uniform, alcohol abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment and other troubling issues.' Democrats highlighted throughout the contentious confirmation process his infidelities to multiple spouses and allegations that he got drunk at work events. That was enough to help sway Murkowski, who announced shortly before the vote that she would vote against Hegseth, citing 'significant concerns with his nomination.' She said that managing the 'department of Defense requires vast experience and expertise' and that Hegseth’s prior career experience does 'not demonstrate to me that he is prepared for such immense responsibility.' 'His leadership of two veteran organizations was marked with accusations of financial mismanagement and problems with the workplace culture he fostered,' she said. Hegseth admitted during his confirmation that he was 'not a perfect person' but he vigorously denied the allegation that he sexually assaulted a woman in 2017 or that he mismanaged the finances of two veterans’ groups he ran before joining Fox News as a contributor in 2014. But the nominee admitted to having a consensual sexual encounter with the woman who accused him of assault in 2017 while he was still married to his second wife and shortly after he fathered a child with another woman who would become his third wife. Murkowski cited this behavior as raising serious concerns about the nominee’s judgment. 'While the allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking do nothing to quiet my concerns, the past behaviors Mr. Hegseth has admitted to, including infidelity on multiple occasions, demonstrate a lack of judgment that is unbecoming of someone who would lead our armed forces,' she said. The closely decided vote by the full Senate to advance Hegseth marks a remarkable turnaround for a nominee. He appeared to be in deep trouble in early December after allegations of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement and public drunkenness surfaced in several media outlets. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said she hadn’t gotten to yes on Hegseth when asked about her position during a Fox News interview in early December, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) initially called the allegations 'disturbing.' Trump even floated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as a possible Plan B option to head the Pentagon before changing his mind and deciding to fully back his embattled nominee. The president’s advisers warned, however, that if he let Hegseth’s nomination go down in flames, it could embolden Democrats and produce a domino-like chain reaction of other Cabinet picks failing to advance. Trump’s decision to double down in his support of Hegseth was backed by a strong push by the president’s allies on social media, who piled immense pressure on wavering Senate Republicans, including Ernst and Graham, to support the nominee. Ernst and Graham announced their support after Hegseth survived a bruising confirmation hearing at which Democrats repeatedly grilled him about his drinking, his infidelity, his management of Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America, and his view of women in combat roles. Ernst said after the hearing that Democrats 'were there just to score political points,' adding 'I think they failed.' Graham said Hegseth showed his mettle during several hours of withering criticism 'Democratic attacks were overly personal and fell flat. It was clear Pete was more prepared for the hearing than my Democratic colleagues,' he said. Wicker held a vote Monday to report Hegseth’s nomination out of the Senate Armed Services Committee over the angry objections of Democrats on the panel, who argued that Republicans should respect the tradition of waiting at least seven days after a hearing to report a nominee to the floor. The Armed Services panel voted along party lines, 14-13, to waive the seven-day rule and advance the nominee.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/senate-advances-hegseth-nomination-paving-way-to-confirmation/	2025-01-23T12:02:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/hegsethpete_011425gn43_w.jpg?w=900
A federal judge temporarily blocks Trump’s executive order redefi...	SEATTLE (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order redefining birthright citizenship, calling it 'blatantly unconstitutional' during the first hearing in a multi-state effort challenging the order. U.S. District Judge John Coughenour repeatedly interrupted a Justice Department lawyer during arguments to ask how he could consider the order constitutional. When the attorney, Brett Shumate, said he’d like a chance to explain it in a full briefing, Coughenour told him the hearing was his chance. The temporary restraining order sought by Arizona, Illinois, Oregon and Washington was the first to get a hearing before a judge and applies nationally. The case is one of five lawsuits being brought by 22 states and a number of immigrants rights groups across the country. The suits include personal testimonies from attorneys general who are U.S. citizens by birthright, and names pregnant women who are afraid their children won’t become U.S. citizens. Coughenour, a Ronald Reagan appointee, began the hearing by grilling the administration’s attorneys, saying the order 'boggles the mind.' 'This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,' Coughenour told Shumate. Coughenour said he’s been on the bench for more than four decades, and he couldn’t remember seeing another case where the action challenged was so clearly unconstitutional. Shumate said he respectfully disagreed and asked the judge for an opportunity to have a full briefing on the merits of the case, rather than have a 14-day restraining order issued blocking its implementation. Arguing for the states, Washington assistant attorney general Lane Polozola labeled as 'absurd' the government’s argument that the children of parents living in the country illegally are not 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States. 'Are they not subject to the decisions of the immigration courts?' he asked. 'Must they not follow the law while they are here?' He also said the restraining order was warranted because, among other reasons, the executive order would immediately start requiring the states to spend millions to revamp health care and benefits systems to consider an applicant’s citizenship status. 'The executive order will impact hundreds of thousands of citizens nationwide who will lose their citizenship under this new rule,' Polozola said. 'Births cannot be paused while the court considers this case.' Trump's executive order, which he signed on Inauguration Day, is slated to take effect on Feb. 19. It could impact hundreds of thousands of people born in the country, according to one of the lawsuits. In 2022, there were about 255,000 births of citizen children to mothers living in the country illegally and about 153,000 births to two such parents, according to the four-state suit filed in Seattle. The Trump administration argued in papers filed Wednesday that the states don’t have grounds to bring a suit against the order and that no damage has yet been done, so temporary relief isn’t called for. The administration’s attorneys also clarified that the executive order only applies to people born after Feb. 19, when it’s set to take effect. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli or 'right of the soil' — is applied. Most are in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them. The lawsuits argue that the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship for people born and naturalized in the U.S., and states have been interpreting the amendment that way for a century. Ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, the amendment says: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' Trump’s order asserts that the children of noncitizens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and orders federal agencies to not recognize citizenship for children who don’t have at least one parent who is a citizen . A key case involving birthright citizenship unfolded in 1898. The Supreme Court held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was a U.S. citizen because he was born in the country. After a trip abroad, he faced being denied reentry by the federal government on the grounds that he wasn’t a citizen under the Chinese Exclusion Act. But some advocates of immigration restrictions have argued that case clearly applied to children born to parents who were both legal immigrants. They say it’s less clear whether it applies to children born to parents living in the country illegally. Trump’s order prompted attorneys general to share their personal connections to birthright citizenship. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, for instance, a U.S. citizen by birthright and the nation’s first Chinese American elected attorney general, said the lawsuit was personal for him. 'There is no legitimate legal debate on this question. But the fact that Trump is dead wrong will not prevent him from inflicting serious harm right now on American families like my own,' Tong said this week. One of the lawsuits aimed at blocking the executive order includes the case of a pregnant woman, identified as 'Carmen,' who is not a citizen but has lived in the United States for more than 15 years and has a pending visa application that could lead to permanent residency status. 'Stripping children of the ‘priceless treasure’ of citizenship is a grave injury,' the suit says. 'It denies them the full membership in U.S. society to which they are entitled.' ___ Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/ap-a-bid-to-block-trumps-cancellation-of-birthright-citizenship-is-in-federal-court/	2025-01-23T11:09:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67929430814294.64823705.jpeg?w=900
DOGE faces 'constant battle' in cutting spending: Burchett	(NewsNation) — The newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is up and running now that President Donald Trump has taken office and has plenty of options for where to begin cutting government spending. The group, led by Elon Musk, is tasked with reducing federal spending by at least $2 trillion. Three lawsuits have already been filed over the formation of DOGE, which has targeted budget items such as health care and education for cuts, according to U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who sits on the House DOGE subcommittee. Burchett said he expects DOGE to go after Pentagon spending, which he told NewsNation is 'bloated' and said the group must also look at health care and Medicare, where he said there is fraud and duplication that needs eliminating. Trump re-ups tariff threats against Mexico, Canada, Russia Burchett also said education could be a target for spending and believes funding being devoted to the U.S. Department of Education should be returned to the states. 'I don’t know if we’ve got the guts to (eliminate the Department of Education),' Burchett said. 'I’ve got the guts to do it. We can pay our teachers more and that’s what the unions are supposed to be about — not about promoting bureaucrats. …they’re worse than the mob.' With so many areas to consider spending cuts, however, Burchett is not confident DOGE can reach its goal of eliminating as much spending as it has been tasked with by the time Trump leaves office. 'Heck, no. It’s going to be a constant fight,' Burchett said. 'People up here have no guts. They run on this, they go home to their districts to their MAGA and Reagan Day dinners and they’ll focus on things like Nancy Pelosi’s stock portfolio. … It’s all a diversion and then they come up here and they vote you down the river.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-constant-battle-cutting-spending/	2025-01-23T09:01:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2188387811.jpg?w=900
Hughes Fire breaks out in California, 50,000 under evacuation ord...	(NewsNation) – More than 50,000 people are under evacuation warnings because of another fire that broke out late Wednesday morning in Los Angeles County. The Hughes fire started late Wednesday morning and and quickly engulfed 10,176 acres, according to CAL FIRE. It charred miles of trees and brush near Castaic Lake, a popular recreation area. The extremely strong winds were fueling the flames. However, they have since died down — something firefighters are using to their advantage. 'It’s really terrible to see it happening,' Chris Dittes, a member of the Castaic Town Council, said. 'But this instance here is not one of tragedy. There’s no homes that have been burned as far as I know. It’s just just been brush that has actually long needed to burn.' Oscar noms announced: Which film leads the pack? Still, 'any fire, of course, is scary,' Dittes added. Evacuation warnings were also in effect but later lifted for parts of the Brentwood and Bel Air neighborhoods for the Sepulveda Fire, which started overnight. Firefighters were able to stop forward progress on Sepulveda around 2 a.m. Thursday, NewsNation local affiliate KTLA reported. That blaze torched around 40 acres. The Los Angeles area had already been devastated by wildfires that began earlier this month and have continued burning. Of these, the Palisades Fire is the largest, burning 23,448 acres. It is 70% contained, per CAL FIRE. The second-largest, the Eaton Fire, is 14,021 acres and 95% contained. Disaster zone: How to know if your home is underinsured Meanwhile, the Clay Fire in Riverside County has burned 39 acres and reached 65% containment. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said residents and officials have been on edge over the last 16 days because of the numerous figures started in January. However, Marrone noted that the situation for the Hughes fire is different. 'In addition to the state resources that were pre-deployed, we had two strike teams in the Santa Clarita area,' he told reporters. 'We were able to amass a lot of fire resources early on to change what this fire looks like.'

Kohberger to appear in court as defense challenges DNA evidence	(NewsNation) — Attorneys for Idaho college killings suspect Bryan Kohberger are set to ask a judge to dismiss most of the evidence in the case, which they believe relies on a genetic investigation process that they say is unconstitutional. Kohberger's defense team also claims the search warrants in the case were tainted by police misconduct. They'll make their arguments during a two-day hearing starting Thursday. If successful, their motion could significantly disrupt the prosecution's case ahead of the trial, which is set to begin in August. Idaho college murders timeline in Bryan Kohberger case Prosecutors say the investigation, including the use of genetic genealogy, was properly done. Part of Thursday's hearing will be held behind closed doors, which the judge says is meant to avoid potential jurors being 'tainted' by hearing evidence that might not be allowed in trial. The open portions of the hearing will be livestreamed on the court's YouTube page, starting at 9 a.m. local time. Prosecutors: Bryan Kohberger's DNA on knife sheath Kohberger's attorneys claim law enforcement violated his constitutional rights when they used Investigative Genetic Genealogy, or IGG, to identify possible suspects. The IGG process often starts when DNA found at the scene of a crime doesn’t yield any results through standard law enforcement databases. When that happens, investigators may look at all the variations, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, that are in the DNA sample. Those SNPs, or 'snips,' are then uploaded to a genealogy database like GEDmatch or FamilyTreeDNA to look for possible relatives of the person whose DNA was found at the scene. In Kohberger's case, investigators said they found 'touch DNA,' or trace DNA, on the sheath of a knife that was found in the home where the students were fatally stabbed. The FBI used the IGG process on that DNA, and the information reportedly identified Kohberger as a possible suspect. Kohberger allowed to wear suit during murder trial The defense team also says that once Kohberger was identified as a possible suspect, law enforcement officers either purposely or recklessly lied or omitted crucial information when they asked the court to issue search warrants for his apartment, his parent's house, his car, his cellphone and even for his own DNA. They want all of that evidence kept out of the trial as well. Specific details about the alleged police misconduct are hidden from public view. Judge Steven Hippler has kept most of those court filings, along with many of the court documents on the IGG evidence, under seal. Bryan Kohberger can face death penalty if convicted Kohberger, accused of killing four University of Idaho students on Nov. 13, 2022, can face the death penalty if convicted, a judge ruled last November. Kohberger’s defense team sought to remove the death penalty as a possible punishment, but Hippler denied its request. The deaths of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, shocked the small town of Moscow. Initially, investigators had few leads and spent considerable time tracing the activities of the four students in the hours prior to their deaths.

Elon Musk's father calls claims Elon made Nazi salute 'rubbish'	(NewsNation) — During an exclusive interview with NewsNation's 'CUOMO,' Errol Musk, father of billionaire Elon Musk, revealed what he thinks about his son's collaboration with President Donald Trump and Republicans during the 2024 election, and the fact that he's now become a key figure in the Trump administration. Errol Musk laughed and defended his son against allegations of making a Nazi salute, calling the accusation 'absolute nonsense' and 'rubbish.' While addressing a large crowd Monday at Capital One Arena, Musk thanked attendees for helping to elect Trump. He grabbed the left side of his chest with his right hand and extended his arm at a raised angle. Musk turned around and made the gesture a second time. 'My heart goes out to you,' he said. Democratic infighting is rising as Trump takes center stage Responding to criticism of the stage gesture, Errol Musk pointed out that other politicians have used similar hand signals without controversy. Elon Musk, widely regarded as the world's richest man with a net worth exceeding $400 billion, has made his mark on space, technology and politics. The elder Musk talked about his own political history, noting he was twice a parliamentary candidate for a party opposing apartheid in South Africa. He also revealed a family connection to the Jewish community through his grandfather. Biden’s outgoing letter to Trump: ‘May God bless you’ Elon changed after Biden snubbed him, father Errol Musk says Errol Musk detailed his son's political transformation, highlighting a shift from supporting Democrats to aligning with Trump. He attributed this change to former President Joe Biden's perceived slight of not inviting Tesla to a White House electric vehicle event in 2021. 'He started changing when Biden invited all the electric car manufacturers to the White House in 2021 but didn't invite Tesla. Tesla built a million cars, and the other five manufacturers built about 26 and hadn't even sold one,' Errol Musk told NewsNation. 'Elon couldn't understand that. He started calling Biden a lunatic and the government 'loony,'' Errol Musk said. Errol Musk recounted a 2016 incident in which Elon and his brother were upset by their father's public support for Trump. He suggested Elon's current alignment with Trump stems from feeling marginalized by the Democratic administration. The tech billionaire is now leading Trump’s 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE), which is expected to focus on reducing government spending and regulations and has already secured a White House email address. Speaker Johnson forms committee to probe Dems, Jan. 6 investigation After co-founding and selling PayPal, Musk launched SpaceX, which now dominates the reusable rocket industry. He later was an early investor in Tesla, manufacturing millions of electric vehicles, and acquired Twitter, where his influence grew. 'We are very happy with' Elon, Errol Musk says Errol Musk said he was 'very happy' with Elon, and adds that his children have 'done well in their fields.' He said Elon has 'broken the mold' to some extent, but the family is not 'sitting back' and would 'like to see more' from him.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/elon-musk-father-errol-nazi-salute-rubbish/	2025-01-22T19:00:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-8.jpg?w=900
Trump orders 'blackout' for federal health agencies	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has ordered a 'blackout' for federal health agencies, banning them from publishing external communication. Agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institute for Health and the Department of Health and Human Services will not be allowed to publish scientific reports, issue health advisories or update their websites. The blackout, first reported by the Washington Post, comes at a time when experts are raising the alarm about public health concerns. When will Trump’s mass deportations begin? During a change in administration, it's not uncommon for agencies to pause external communications. However, the blackout comes at a time of concern over public health issues and as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., nominated for Health and Human Services secretary, faces a potentially lengthy confirmation. CNN reported that a follow-up memo specified the blackout is set to last through Feb. 1, and includes public speaking engagements and communications with lawmakers. Communications deemed urgent, such as recall notices or that are required by law, are exempt but higher-ups must be notified. Another issue of concern is the increased spread of bird flu. The virus has been rapidly spreading among birds, wreaking havoc on the poultry industry, and a strain has been circulating among livestock, as well. There have also been cases of bird flu reported in humans. The majority of cases have been reported in farm workers, though there have also been cases in which it's less clear how it was contracted. While continuing to stress that the risk to the public is low and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, the CDC recently advised hospitals to speed up testing for bird flu in admitted patients, urging subtype tests for those positive for influenza A be done within hours of admission. A blackout would cut off such advisories and recommendations, leaving the public and health care professionals in the dark about new developments. Trump cuts DEI regulations across federal government The Senate has yet to set a confirmation hearing date for Kennedy, even as it hurries to push through other Trump nominees. It's not clear whether this would impact the length of the blackout. Kennedy's nomination has been controversial even among Republicans, with Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a polio survivor, criticizing efforts by a lawyer working for Kennedy to revoke approval of the polio vaccine. A group associated with former Vice President Mike Pence has also begun running a series of ads urging Republican senators to oppose Kennedy's nomination. Other Republican senators, however, including Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, have expressed support for Kennedy. Some of Kennedy's critics have also supported aspects of his platform, including efforts to reduce some of the ingredients used in processed food.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/health-agency-blackout/	2025-01-22T14:30:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-1892965715-e1730320693839.jpg?w=800
Trump ends remote work impacting half of federal workers	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is putting an end to remote work for federal employees, with one of his first executive orders bringing the federal workforce back to the office full-time. Half of the federal workforce has been allowed to work remotely. It's part of a larger culture shift that occurred during the pandemic and for many workers, the desire to remain remote has stuck. But that has left large federal facilities like the Department of Energy empty, with fewer than 1% of the office spaces being used according to the Public Buildings Reform Board. Trump cuts DEI regulations across federal government In addition to bringing workers back to the empty desks, Trump says he wants to sell unused federal buildings. Research shows there are nearly 8,000 empty buildings that cost taxpayers about $8 billion to maintain. That's on top of another $7.7 billion spent on energy bills to keep them running. A 2023 Government Accountability Office report said that 17% of the 24 federal agencies are using as little of 9% of federal buildings and only as much as 49% of their building's capacity. Several unions have pushed back, including one that represents 800,000 federal workers. Bird flu mutating in humans: Researchers 'President Trump's order is a blatant attempt to corrupt the federal government by eliminating employees' due process rights so they can be fired for political reasons,' said American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley. 'It will remove hundreds of thousands of federal jobs from the non-partisan civil service and make them answerable to the will of one man.' While some employees are fine with heading back to the office, others are facing major upheaval, having arranged responsibilities like childcare around a work-from-home schedule.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-ends-remote-work-half-employees/	2025-01-22T12:18:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/10/return_to_office_telework_getty-e1698162451766.jpg?w=900
Trump re-ups tariff threats against Mexico, Canada, Russia	(NewsNation) — President Trump doubled down on his tariff threats against Canada, Mexico and China saying they will start in ten days in the hopes that it will force the countries to renegotiate trade deals. The president has set a February 1 deadline for levying 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico unless, he says, the nations do more to stop the flow of illegal immigration and fentanyl into the United States. The ultimatum has sparked a push back from the nations. Trudeau vows Canada will respond to Trump’s tariffs, but says burden will be shared across regions Outgoing Canadian PM Justin Trudeau responded on X saying, 'Our cabinet just wrapped a day of meetings focused on one thing, protecting Canadians from harmful U.S. tariffs. Canada and the US have a partnership that works for both sides of the border and will do everything it takes to keep it that way.' But Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, said a trade war is 100% coming. Trump 'declared an economic war on Canada,' Ford said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'And we are going to use every tool in our tool box to defend our economy.' Meanwhile, Mexico's president says she will defend her nation's sovereignty and independence but also pursue dialogue with Trump. Trump also threatened to impose tariffs, taxes and sanctions on 'anything being sold by Russia to the United States' in a bid to put pressure on the nation to end its war in Ukraine. 'I’m not looking to hurt Russia. I love the Russian people, and always had a very good relationship with President Putin — and this despite the Radical Left’s Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX,' Trump posted on Truth Social, referencing a special counsel investigation into any coordination between his 2016 campaign and Moscow. 'All of that being said, I’m going to do Russia, whose Economy is failing, and President Putin, a very big FAVOR. Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War! IT’S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE,' Trump continued. Trump signed an executive order Monday that directed the Secretaries of Commerce, Treasury and the United States trade representative to investigate the cause of America's trade deficits with foreign nations. The president also said he is trying to build an 'external revenue service' to collect tariffs. Trump pumps brakes on Day 1 tariffs Trump said he is still looking at a 10% tariff on China to stop the flow of fentanyl after threatening as much as 60% during his campaign, but appeared to temper his plans after a phone call last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He said Monday there would be more discussions with his counterpart in the world’s second largest economy. Trump is placing a big bet that his executive actions can cut energy prices and tame inflation and that the tariffs will strengthen the economy instead of exposing consumers to higher prices. But it’s unclear whether his orders will be enough to foster the growing economy with lower prices that he promised voters.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-re-ups-tariff-threats-mexico-canada-russia/	2025-01-22T11:36:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/676e04041219b3.84887230.jpeg?w=900
As buses of migrants deported, Mexican officials open shelters	(NewsNation) — Buses full of Mexican nationals being deported were caught on camera by a NewsNation crew — one sign that President Donald Trump’s immigration policies are being put into place. Sources in Tijuana said to NewsNation that the city has also started to see Mexican nationals deported back to that port of entry as well. Mexican government officials say they are sending the buses to Mexican border towns, and then will take those people farther inside the country. Deportations are expected to ramp up even more in the coming weeks — something Trump said he would enact many times during the 2024 election. Mexico opening migrant shelters To help those who are newly deported, Mexico plans to set up nine migrant shelters that will provide food, medical checkpoints and a temporary place to stay. Three of these new shelters are set to open soon in Reynosa, Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Each facility can hold up to 2,500 people. According to Mexican officials, those deported will receive around 2,000 pesos, which is around $10, to assist with travel expenses back to their hometowns. However, these shelters will only accept those originally from Mexico — not other foreign nationals. Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum is calling it the 'Mexico Embraces You' program. 'This initiative will provide a range of support to repatriated Mexicans, including services and other benefits,' Seguismundo Doguin Martinex, migration chief for Tamaulipas, Mexico, said. 'The National Institute of Migration is responsible for receiving them and providing them with a repatriation certificate, which serves as identification, and arranging transportation to their place of origin.' What would it take for US to reclaim the Panama Canal? Trump immigration policies After being sworn in Monday, Trump signed a slew of executive orders, several of which had to do with immigration. One of them was reinstating the 'Remain in Mexico' policy, which requires those seeking asylum to stay in Mexico until their claims are processed. Critics say that the policy forces migrants to live in Mexican border towns where many have been victims of abuse and extortion In addition, Trump signed an order for work to continue on the southern border wall. One of the biggest changes he made was shutting down the CBP One app, which let migrants make appointments for processing at the U.S.-Mexico border. Sheinbaum called on Trump administration to keep the app.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/buses-migrants-return-to-mexico/	2025-01-22T09:52:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/676ecea8932413.89172779.jpeg?w=900
Pentagon to send up to 1,500 active duty troops to secure US-Mexi...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon will begin deploying as many as 1,500 active duty troops to help secure the southern border in the coming days, U.S. officials said Wednesday, putting in motion plans President Donald Trump laid out in executive orders shortly after he took office to crack down on immigration. Acting Defense Secretary Robert Salesses was expected to sign the deployment orders on Wednesday, but it wasn't yet clear which troops or units will go, and the total could fluctuate. It remains to be seen if they will end up doing law enforcement, which would put American troops in a dramatic new role, not done in recent history. WATCH: CBP officers in riot gear march through South Texas border crossing The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement has not yet been made. The active duty forces would join the roughly 2,500 U.S. National Guard and Reserve forces already there. There are currently no active duty troops working along the border. The forces are expected to be used to support border patrol agents, with logistics, transportation and construction of barriers. They have done similar duties in the past, when both Trump and former President Joe Biden sent active duty troops to the border. Troops are prohibited by law from doing law enforcement duties on the border, but that may change. Trump has directed through executive order that the incoming secretary of defense and incoming homeland security chief report back within 90 days if they think an 1807 law called the Insurrection Act should be invoked. That would allow those troops to be used in civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil. The widely expected deployment, coming in Trump’s first week in office, was an early step in his long-touted plan to expand the use of the military along the border. In one of his first orders on Monday, Trump directed the defense secretary to come up with a plan to 'seal the borders' and repel 'unlawful mass migration.' On Tuesday, just as Trump fired the Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Linda Fagan, the service announced it was surging more cutter ships, aircraft and personnel to the 'Gulf of America' — another nod to the president’s directive to rename the Gulf of Mexico. Trump said during his inaugural address on Monday that 'I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places in which they came.' In his first term, Trump also ordered active duty troops to the border to help the Department of Homeland Security and border control agents, in response to a caravan of migrants slowly making its way through Mexico toward the United States in 2018. As buses of migrants deported, Mexican officials open shelters In executive orders signed Monday, Trump suggested the military would help DHS with 'detention space, transportation (including aircraft), and other logistics services.' U.S. active duty troops are forbidden from doing law enforcement duties under the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th century federal law. So they can’t arrest or detain people at the border, unless the president acts to invoke the Insurrection Act. The Insurrection Act allows presidents to call on reserve or active duty military units to respond to unrest in the states, an authority that is not reviewable by the courts. During the 2018 deployment, more than 7,000 active duty troops were sent to Texas, Arizona and California, including military police, an assault helicopter battalion, various communications, medical and headquarters units, combat engineers, planners and public affairs units. What would it take for US to reclaim the Panama Canal? At the time, the Pentagon was adamant that active duty troops would not do law enforcement. So they spent much of their time transporting border patrol agents to and along the border, helping them erect additional vehicle barriers and fencing along the border, assisting them with communications and providing some security for border agent camps. The military also provided border patrol agents with medical care, pre-packaged meals and temporary housing. Normally, in deployments to the border in support of the Department of Homeland Security, Pentagon officials request specifics from DHS on what needs to be accomplished, and military leaders then decide what troops should go and how many.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/ap-pentagon-to-send-up-to-1500-active-duty-troops-to-help-secure-us-mexico-border-officials-say/	2025-01-22T09:49:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67912c78adcb28.95907475.jpeg?w=900
Previously approved refugee flights to US canceled after Trump or...	(The Hill) - The State Department has suspended flights bringing previously approved refugees to the United States, cutting off access to protection in advance of the timeline set by President Trump in a new order pausing the program. An email reviewed Wednesday by The Associated Press, the U.S. agency overseeing refugee processing and arrival told staff and stakeholders that 'refugee arrival to the United States have been suspended until further notice.' Trump pardoned violent Jan. 6 rioters. Here are 5 of them The suspension of flights indicates early action on an order that didn’t direct movement from agencies until Jan. 27. The State Department did not return a request for comment, but a page on refugee admissions was already unavailable. Afghan refugees walk through a refugee camp at Joint Base McGuire Dix Lakehurst, N.J., on Sept. 27, 2021. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) A Day 1 order from Trump pauses the refugee program for a minimum of three months, calling for the departments of State and of Homeland Security to issue a report within 90 days detailing whether it’s in the nation’s interests to resume the admission of refugees. The agency heads are directed to do so every 90 days until it is found that it is appropriate to resume refugee admissions, the order states. Until then, such admissions will remain suspended. The U.S. refugee program is considered one of the most rigorous on the globe, providing a pathway to safe haven for those fleeing danger or who has faced persecution due to their race, religion, nationality or political views. WATCH: CBP officers in riot gear march through South Texas border crossing 'The refugee program is not just a humanitarian lifeline through which the U.S. has shown global leadership. It represents the gold standard of legal immigration pathways in terms of security screening, community coordination, and mutual economic benefit,' Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, which helps resettle refugees, said in a statement when the order was first announced. 'The US Refugee Admissions Program was designed and ameliorated over four decades precisely to address the concerns used to suspend it today.' Democrats seized the moment to criticize Republicans over the order’s impact on stranding an estimated 1,600 Afghan allies cleared for resettlement in the U.S. They pointed to GOP attacks on the Biden administration for leaving behind thousands of Afghans who worked with the U.S. during the chaotic and deadly American withdrawal. 'Republicans spent 4 years baselessly chastising Biden for ‘abandoning our Afghan Allies.’ But *this* is what abandonment looks like. Leaving vetted, verified Afghan Allies at the mercy of the Taliban is shameful,' the Democratic side of the House Foreign Affairs Committee wrote in a post on X. 'Among those being abandoned are: family members of US military service personnel, Afghans who fought alongside us and allies who worked with US contractors. We owe them better.' ICE now allowed to make arrests in and near churches and schools Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said she was 'alarmed' at the suspension and that it goes against bipartisan support for the Refugee Admissions Program. She noted that among those stranded are victims of genocide, such as the Rohingya Burmese and Sudanese refugees, as well as Afghan partners. 'Stepping away from this program at a time of unprecedented displacement will put refugees’ lives at risk and ultimately weaken our nation’s long-term security,' she said in a statement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/refugee-flights-trump-order/	2025-01-22T09:43:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/refugeecamp_092721_ap_afghanrefugees-e1737562101687.jpg?w=900
Trump vows to shine light on New Jersey drone mystery	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has vowed to release a report on the unexplained drones spotted over the Northeast, which led the FAA to issue temporary drone bans in New Jersey and parts of New York. While signing executive orders at the White House on Monday, Trump promised to investigate drone reports that began in November. He promised a report on the drones within a day of taking office. However, when reporters questioned Trump in the Oval Office on that 'Day 1 update,' he put White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles on the case. Trump wants American astronauts on Mars: Is it possible? 'I would like to find out what it is and tell the people. In fact, I'd like to do that,' Trump said. He then redirected to Wiles. 'Could we find out what that was, Susie? Why don't we find out immediately?' Trump added: 'I can't imagine it's an enemy, or there would have been, you know, people would have gotten blown up, all of them. Maybe they were testing things. I don't know why. They wouldn't have said what it was. They had a lot of them flying over Bedminster, which is interesting.' Where were drones spotted? Unexplained drones began reportedly flying over sensitive military sites in New Jersey in mid-November. The White House and the Pentagon insisted they did not pose a threat. Along the East Coast, drone sightings were also reported near Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, as well as in Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut. Sightings were additionally reported in California, Florida, Ohio and Minnesota. The reports and concerns from the public prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue bans in parts of New Jersey and parts of New York. Those drone bans have been lifted, but Trump believes there are questions left unanswered. Marco Rubio met with UAP whistleblower prior to Trump nomination Trump: Biden, military knew details Last month, Trump claimed the Biden administration and the military knew what was going on with the unexplained drone sightings but wanted to keep 'people in suspense.' Later, more than 20 officials from the departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Defense went before Congress for a classified drone hearing, testifying there was no threat.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/trump-shine-light-on-drone-mystery/	2025-01-22T05:38:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/DronesNJ-e1734134961775.jpg?w=800
Trump expresses doubt in Gaza ceasefire: 'It's not our war'	(NewsNation) — Aid trucks are getting into Gaza as part of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, but President Donald Trump expressed doubt the ceasefire will hold while signing executive orders Monday night. As part of the ceasefire deal, three people taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023, have been released by Hamas, with another four expected to be freed this weekend. A total of 33 hostages are set to return home in the first phase of the deal. Loved ones of those still being held are urging Trump to make sure the deal is carried out to completion. This was something Trump said he'd do on the campaign trail. At one point, he said there would be 'hell to pay' in the Middle East if all the hostages weren't released by Inauguration Day. When will Trump’s mass deportations begin? Some families of Israelis still believed to be in captivity were onstage at Trump's indoor parade Monday. The president was seen telling the families of at least one hostage that his administration was going to get him back. To the audience, Trump said the work begins now, saying that this is 'not a good situation.' In the Oval Office Monday, Trump called Gaza a 'massive demolition site' that has to be 'rebuilt in a different way.' Negotiating the second and third phases of this deal will be a critical step. If agreed to, a second phase would include the release of more hostages and a permanent pause in fighting, plus the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. In Phase 3, the deceased hostages would be returned, and the reconstruction of Gaza would begin. However, it's a delicate process. Mediators are in the Middle East right now on standby for obstacles as the first phase of this ceasefire is now underway. Trump on Monday night acknowledged that he is not confident the ceasefire will go through all three phases, telling reporters, 'It's not our war.' Here are all executive orders Trump signed on Day 1 Six killed by Israeli military in West Bank A major Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday left at least six dead and dozens wounded, Palestinian health officials said. This operation was focused on the city of Jenin, which The Associated Press reports has been through repeated Israeli incursions and gunbattles with militants in recent years. This operation was announced shortly after the ceasefire in Gaza was announced. More than 800 people have been killed by Israeli fire, including attacks by settlers, in the West Bank since Oct. 7, the Palestinian Health Ministry says. According to the Associated Press, more than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, which started after the Hamas-led attack on Oct.7 that killed 1,200. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/trump-doubt-gaza-ceasefire/	2025-01-21T12:50:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25021402908298.jpg?w=900
Trump cuts DEI regulations across federal government	(NewsNation) — President Trump slashed all diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government, giving agencies 60 days to cut all DEI positions and proclaiming there are only two genders. In several executive orders signed Monday, Trump undid several Biden-era initiatives, saying they were 'illegal and immoral discrimination programs' within the government. 'This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private light; we will forge a society that is color blind and merit-based,' Trump said during his inauguration. 'As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.' Here are all executive orders Trump signed on Day 1 The order asks the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management to coordinate with agencies to terminate what it deems as 'all discriminatory programs' in the agencies. The U.S. government is the largest employer in the country with 3 million workers, and the new marching orders appear to stand in line with a similar shift away from DEI initiatives in the private sector. Walmart, Meta and McDonalds have all reportedly pulled back on some aspects of DEI. A Trump official said Monday that 'private businesses should wait and see ... we have more actions coming very soon.' Trump has also caused concern among LGBTQ+ Americans after declaring the government would recognize only two sexes, male and female, and those will correlate with the sex assigned at birth. What is an executive order? His order directs agencies to enforce laws to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes and not enforce laws as if sex includes gender identity. It will also direct the secretaries of state and Homeland Security to ensure official government documents such as passports and visas reflect categories of 'male' and 'female.' It will also prevent agencies from promoting the concept of gender transition, and agencies will only list 'male' or 'female' when asking about sex. The order also intends to stop federal funds from promoting gender identity. The Trump administration also intends to recognize that women are identified as having reproductive cells, as opposed to identifying women through a chromosome.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-cuts-dei-federal-government/	2025-01-21T12:36:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25021063358170.jpg?w=900
DOGE faces early bumps with lawsuits and leadership shakeup	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was slapped with several lawsuits on his first day in office from groups saying the new nongovernment entity must abide by the same transparency as federal agencies. The suits were brought by progressive consumer watchdog Public Citizen, the American Public Health Association and National Security Counselors, a public interest law firm. The groups argue that DOGE should be considered a federal advisory committee, which falls under regulations under the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972. The three cases were some of the first lawsuits filed against the new Trump administration after the president took the oath of office in the Capitol. Vivek Ramaswamy set to depart DOGE What is DOGE? Trump tapped Musk and Ramaswamy to co-lead DOGE shortly after his reelection last year, promising to cut down on federal spending and slash federal jobs that the nongovernmental task force deems unnecessary. Since then, Ramaswamy left DOGE, leaving the agency in the hands of tech tycoon Musk. While Ramaswamy is also planning to run for Ohio governor in two years, his departure may be linked to disagreements with the congressional leaders working on DOGE, according to some reports. The two had pledged to cut $2 trillion in government spending and restructure federal agencies. Elon Musk’s DOGE sued as Trump takes office: Report What do the lawsuits say? Three separate lawsuits allege that DOGE should be classified as a federal advisory committee, which has rules around them. The plaintiffs each claim DOGE is covered by FACA, which mandates federal advisory committees meet transparency requirements like having a charter, fairly balanced membership and a designated federal officer to call meetings. 'The suit challenges DOGE’s operating without complying with federal transparency laws,' the groups said in a statement. 'DOGE’s stacked membership, far from being fairly balanced, reveals that only one viewpoint is represented: that of ‘small-government crusaders’ with backgrounds in either the tech industry or Republican politics. This shortcoming renders DOGE’s membership imbalanced and unfit for the function it has been directed to perform,' the National Security Counselors' lawsuit states. DOGE leadership hit back. 'I expect the entrenched bureaucracy and the vested interest to fight like dickens…I wouldn't count Elon Musk out,' Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who is part of the DOGE congressional leadership, told NewsNation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-faces-early-bumps/	2025-01-21T11:34:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2188387811.jpg?w=900
Democratic AGs sue Trump over birthright citizenship executive or...	Twenty-two Democrat-led states and two cities challenged President Trump’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship, that on Tuesday kicked off the first legal battles between his new Justice Department and Democratic attorneys general. The two separate lawsuits, filed in Massachusetts and Washington state, ask federal judges to rule the order contradicts the Constitution, which under the 14th Amendment bestows citizenship on anyone born in the United States. 'President Trump now seeks to abrogate this well-established and longstanding Constitutional principle by executive fiat,' one group of states wrote in their complaint. 'The principle of birthright citizenship has been enshrined in the Constitution for more than 150 years. The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment unambiguously and expressly confers citizenship on ‘[a]ll persons born’ in and ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ of the United States.' Trump’s order, signed as part of a flurry of executive actions during his first day in office, seeks to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who are not lawfully present. But it also applies to some parents in the U.S. on nonimmigrant visas, a broader category that blocks citizenship to children born to those with authorization to work in the U.S. The states’ lawsuits follow a similar challenge filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) late Monday. In a call Monday to preview executive orders, a Trump administration official seemed to acknowledge potential problems with the order, saying it would be carried out on a 'prospective basis.' 'On a prospective basis, the federal government will not recognize automatic birthright citizenship for children of illegal aliens born in the United States,' the official said. The order from Trump frames citizenship as 'a priceless and profound gift,' casting the order itself as one that protects 'the meaning and value' of American citizenship. One coalition, which sued in Massachusetts, comprised Democratic attorneys general 18 states, as well as the cities of Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. The other coalition, which filed in Washington, comprised four states. 'President Trump’s public statements make clear that he wishes to end birthright citizenship purely as a policy tactic to purportedly deter immigration to the United States. Despite a president’s broad powers to set immigration policy, the Citizenship Stripping Order falls far outside the legal bounds of the president’s authority,' the second group of states wrote in their complaint.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/democratic-ags-sue-trump-over-birthright-citizenship-executive-order/	2025-01-21T11:00:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25021063358170-e1737479667344_b55e3b.jpg?w=800
Trump pumps brakes on Day 1 tariffs	(The Hill) -- President Donald Trump pumped the brakes on his plan to deliver wide-ranging tariffs as soon as he took office, slow-tracking and toning down changes to the U.S. trade system that figured as a centerpiece of his campaign. Trump kicked off his second term with a memo that directs federal agencies to study U.S. trade relationships with China, Canada and Mexico, but he did not impose any new tariffs, which are taxes levied on U.S. individuals and companies that import goods from abroad. The memo, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, also seeks to make progress on Trump's 2020 U.S.-China trade pact and looks ahead to a 2026 review of the updated NAFTA deal with Canada and Mexico. But the order stops short of ordering any new import taxes. Here are the biggest fights Democrats are bracing for in Trump’s second term A summary of the memo says agencies will assess the updated NAFTA deal and 'make recommendations' about U.S. participation in it, the Journal reported. That’s a far cry from the rhetoric on trade that Trump used while on the campaign trail. 'On January 20th, as one of my many first executive orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25-percent tariff on all products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous open borders,' Trump wrote on social media in November after winning the election. Trump frequently blasted establishment thinking on trade deals, suggesting an overhaul of U.S. trade doctrine was underway with the imposition of a general tariff, something that hasn’t been widely tried since the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was set up following World War II. 'It must be hard for you to spend 25 years talking about tariffs as being negative, and then have somebody explain to you that you’re totally wrong,' Trump challenged Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait during an interview in October. Presidents can issue tariff orders without approval from Congress, and there had been heavy speculation that Trump was going to single-handedly change the trade system overnight. Mexican steel producers put out a statement Friday, saying they didn’t pose a threat to U.S. businesses. 'Steel exports from Mexico do not represent a threat to the United States. On the contrary, the U.S. greatly benefits from steel trade flows,' Mexican steel industry group Conacero said. Even the Federal Reserve noted in December that uncertainty about the U.S. trade posture was clouding its economic projections, saying they had to build out multiple scenarios. 'The effects of trade policy changes could be larger than the staff had assumed,' the Fed’s December minutes say. Uncertainties had been showing up in foreign markets, as well. 'Foreign financial market pricing reflected weaker-than-expected foreign data releases, expectations of further policy easing by foreign central banks, and potential changes in U.S. trade policy,' Fed meeting participants noted. Markets and industry groups that work on international commerce seemed reassured by the decision not to immediately impose new tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of major U.S. stock rose by more than 300 points in afternoon trading. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up more than 290 points, and the S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 60 points. The retail industry, which sources many of its products from countries with considerably lower labor costs than the U.S., welcomed the new trade approach from Trump, saying they wanted to make sure it’s 'carefully targeted.' 'We look forward to working with the president to see that the resulting policy changes are carefully targeted and create an environment that attracts investment and protects critical industries,' the National Retail Federation said in a Monday release. The National Foreign Trade Council, a business advocacy group, said U.S. businesses want to keep access to foreign markets. 'American companies need to maintain a competitive advantage globally, and access to open markets,' the group said in a Monday release. 'We are keen to work with the Administration on the details of its economic strategy, including its trade, tax and tariff policies.' Trump campaigned hard on tariffs, which allowed him to tap into undercurrents of frustration about the globalized economy and to deliver clear and repetitive messaging that likely made a difference in the election. Trump, who made import taxes the backbone of his first-term economic policy, called 'tariff' the 'most beautiful word in the dictionary.' Close Thank you for signing up!

The tax, which can take a bite out of the importer’s profit margin, can be avoided by switching to a domestic supply chain, or it can be passed along to a retailer in the form of a price increase. The latter option added to concerns that Trump’s tariffs could contribute to short-term inflation, which could further be spurred by stimulative tax cuts expected by the new Congress and increased labor costs stemming from a clamp down on immigration. But Trump’s lack of immediate action on tariffs likely bodes well for the pace of price increases. In his inaugural address, Trump said he wants to bring manufacturing jobs back to America, which have largely been outsourced to foreign production centers, representing another point of economic frustration for many voters. Manufacturing jobs have been on the decline since the late 1970s and really fell off in the 2000s following the passage of a string of 'free trade' deals. While they rebounded slightly in the 2010s to a recent high around 13 million jobs, they have yet to approach historical levels. A surge in manufacturing construction investment during the Biden administration could reverse this trend to some degree. After hovering around $6 billion annually, the number shot up to more than $21 billion in October, following the passage of a major infrastructure law, a climate technology law and a bill to promote semiconductor production.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tariffs/	2025-01-21T08:56:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/trump_012025ap_1a2b52-e1737463030433.jpg?w=800
Live:Trump attends prayer service at National Cathedral	(NewsNation) — After being sworn in on Monday, President Donald Trump is marking his first full day in office with a prayer service at Washington National Cathedral on Tuesday morning. Leaders from nearly a dozen different religions are on hand for the service, which has been a post-inaugural tradition since former President Franklin D. Roosevelt was in office. The service is meant to be a way to push past the divisiveness of the 2024 election, staffers say, and the political jabs on the campaign trail. Here are all executive orders Trump signed on Day 1 It's a message the president tried to convey at the Commander in Chief Ball on Monday evening when speaking to the troops. 'Your bravery inspires us. Your service unites us, and your sacrifice and spirit protect us all,' Trump said. 'We love you, we respect you so much, and we have a big commitment to each and every one of you. Starting today, America will be stronger and greater than it's ever been before.' Staffers say this year's prayer service is different from those held in the past, as it was not planned with a particular candidate in mind. Trump starts second term Shortly after being sworn in, Trump signed a slew of executive orders relating to diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government, gender identity, border security and other issues. In addition, Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state, was confirmed in a 99-0 vote Monday night. John Ratcliffe, Trump's nominee to lead the CIA; Pete Hegseth, nominee for head of the Department of Defense; Kristi Noem, nominee for secretary of Homeland Security; and Russ Vought, nominee for chief of the Office of Management and Budget are all in position for a full vote in the Senate. Their confirmations have been passed by Senate committees. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune are heading to the White House and are expected to meet with Trump on Tuesday.

When will Trump's mass deportations begin?	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — Migrants in Chicago are growing increasingly anxious as they brace for potential mass deportation raids, which could begin as soon as Tuesday. On Monday, President Donald Trump signed several executive orders related to immigration, including declaring a national emergency at the border. According to the Wall Street Journal, four people familiar with the plan said on the day after Trump’s inauguration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will send 'between 100 and 200 officers' for the operation. In December, Trump's incoming border czar, Tom Homan, told Chicagoans the largest deportation operation in history was set to start on Tuesday. However, it's uncertain whether the raids will begin as planned, given the extremely cold temperatures and leads about the operation. When can we expect to see mass deportations start? Federal immigration officers are expected to target more than 300 people in Chicago with histories of violent crimes, according to an official who spoke anonymously to NewsNation over the weekend. Additionally, Trump aids have indicated they may arrest others, like spouses or roommates, who aren't the primary target but are also in the country illegally. Still, Trump hasn't provided any specific timeline for the deportation. Here are all executive orders Trump signed on Day 1 'I don't want to say when, but it's going to happen. It has to happen, or we're not going to have a country left,' Trump said Monday when asked if ICE raids would start Tuesday. Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker emphasized that ripping families apart is not acceptable to Americans and asserted that the state will stand up for those affected. However, immigrant rights groups say the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants in Chicago are living in fear as raids loom. How are undocumented Chicagoans preparing for potential raids? Some Chicago churches have canceled in-person services to protect churchgoers from potential immigration roundups. Meanwhile, immigrant advocacy groups have distributed flyers and held workshops to educate undocumented people about their rights. Elena Barrera, who has lived in the Chicago area without legal status for nearly 27 years, shared her fears. A mother of three, including a 9-year-old, Barrera worries about the trauma her family would face if she were detained by ICE agents. '(My son) doesn't want to go to Mexico because he has his school here. He has lived his whole life here. He cries. Nothing has happened yet, but he is already anxious. He is thinking, 'What will I do without my mom?'' she said. Can Trump use a law from 1798 to crack down on cartels? Organizations like the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights advise that those fearing a raid do not open the door if ICE agents come knocking. They also urge people to memorize the phone numbers of loved ones in case their phones are taken during an arrest. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the city’s law forbids Chicago police officers from coordinating with ICE. Chicago Public Schools, the Chicago Transit Authority, the Chicago Park District and Community Colleges of Chicago have all been directed not to allow ICE access into any of their buildings. Trump's deportation plans are a 'disgrace': Pope Francis On Sunday, Pope Francis appeared on a popular Italian talk show, 'Che Tempo Che Fa,' where he called Trump’s mass deportation plans a 'disgrace.' 'If true, this will be a disgrace because it makes poor wretches who have nothing pay the bill,' for the problem, Francis said. 'This won’t do! This is not the way to solve things. That’s not how things are resolved.' Bishop Robert Casey, vicar general of the Archdiocese of Chicago, has been a Catholic priest for 30 years. 'For all those 30 years, I have found myself living in a nation that's struggled with immigration reform,' said Casey, whose parents were immigrants. 'I think it's important to recognize ... what Pope Francis reminds us, that we're dealing with people with faces and names. This is not just an issue on paper.' Casey added that people are afraid and anxious because there is so much unknown about what to expect and when it will happen. 'For many of our immigrants, they have been able to build a life here and contribute greatly to the foundations that our city is built on, and they're at the core of who we are as a community and as churches,' he said. 'But at the same time, amidst that blessing, there is the challenge that people don't want to welcome the stranger, that don't want to welcome the migrant in our midst.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/when-will-mass-deportations-begin/	2025-01-21T05:01:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6772ed5e99af47.82108108.jpeg?w=900
Trump's 'two sexes' order to face legal challenges	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump signed executive orders Monday recognizing only two sexes, male and female. The gender identity order will limit the choice of gender identification to sexes assigned at birth and direct federal agencies to cease the promotion of the concept of gender transition. 'I will end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life,' Trump said Monday in his inaugural address. 'We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.' Here are all executive orders Trump is expected to sign on Day 1 The order will require Americans to select their sex assigned at birth on government documents like passports and visas. The State Department issued the first U.S. passport with an 'unspecified' gender marker in 2022, denoted by a single letter X, NewsNation affiliate 'The Hill' reported. Trump’s executive order also tasks the attorney general with providing guidance on how the Supreme Court’s 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, which determined that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects workers from discrimination because of their gender identity or sexuality, may be applied to other federal statutes. 'It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,' the order reads. Trump vows to release JFK, RFK, MLK assassination records Monday's executive order will likely face legal challenges in the months and years ahead. The ACLU has pledged to take the administration to court 'wherever we can.' Chase Strangio, an ACLU attorney who last month became the first transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court, wrote in an Instagram post that Trump’s orders 'do not and cannot change the law.' Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ advocacy group, said Monday’s orders 'serve no other purpose than to hurt our families and our communities' and stressed that they would not take effect immediately, 'The Hill' reported. Janson Wu, senior director of state advocacy and government affairs at the Trevor Project, an LGBTQ youth suicide prevention organization, said Trump’s executive orders 'will cause harm,' especially for young people. 'We know that many people are feeling afraid, or even confused, by what certain actions today and in the coming days mean for our community,' Wu said. 'I want to remind everyone that we are prepared for whatever lies ahead — and will continue to protect and care for each other now, just as we always have.'

Nelly: I wasn't scared of Trump performance backlash	(NewsNation) — After receiving backlash from the public, Nelly defended his decision to perform at President Trump's inauguration ball. Nelly told NewsNation's 'CUOMO' his performance is about 'respect.' 'This is not a campaign trail,' Nelly said. 'This is not anything that I feel like I'm influencing people to sway how they feel, but it's more about the respect and the honor of being invited for what I like to call the greatest country on the planet.' Nelly said 'Regardless of the differences we have,' it's 'all about coming together' and being positive. He also said he doesn't plan to take his shirt off during his performance because 'they don't want to see this dad bod.' Judges allow some Capitol riot defendants to return to DC for Trump’s inauguration Nelly wasn't the be the only music star present in Washington, D.C., on Inauguration Day. Country music phenomenon Carrie Underwood sang 'America the Beautiful' at the swearing-in ceremony. Underwood also faced some backlash for taking the opportunity to sign at Trump's inauguration, though longtime Trump critic Whoopi Goldberg came to her defense this week. Nelly, 49, whose birth name is Cornell Haynes II, is a St. Louis native with hits such as 'Hot in Herre' and 'Just A Dream.' The 49-year-old has had four No. 1 hits and won nine Billboard Music Awards. He escaped drug charges in November following an arrest at a Missouri casino in August. Other performers on Inauguration Day include Kid Rock, Jason Aldean, Billy Ray Cyrus, The Village People and Rascal Flatts.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/nelly-trump-performance-backlash/	2025-01-20T19:59:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/D929FD020AE9F8625C91C846178ADE3C.jpg?w=536
Trump pardons nearly all Jan. 6 rioters on first day of presidenc...	President Trump pardoned nearly all Jan. 6 defendants on Monday, making good on a long-standing campaign promise just hours into his second presidency. He briefly said Monday night that he granted roughly 1,500 'full, complete and unconditional pardons' for rioters charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. There have been 1,583 total defendants charged. 'What they've done to these people is outrageous,' Trump said while signing various orders from the Oval Office. The pardons clear the way for potentially hundreds of his supporters to be released from prison in coming days, some of whom were sentenced to years in prison for violently attacking law enforcement that day. They came just hours after former President Biden in the eleventh hour of his presidency issued preemptive pardons for members and staff of the House Jan. 6 select committee, which investigated the riot. Trump also commuted the sentences of Proud Boys and Oath Keepers members who were charged with plotting to forcibly halt the peaceful transfer of power in 2020 to time served. However, former Proud Boys national chair Enrique Tarrio — who is serving a 22-year prison term, the longest handed down in connection with the attack — received a pardon. An attorney for Tarrio told The Hill he’s being 'processed out' of prison, suggesting his release could be imminent. Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers who is serving an 18-year prison term, is among those whose sentences were commuted to time served. About 600 Jan. 6 defendants were accused of assaulting, resisting or impeding police. Ten defendants were convicted of sedition, the crown jewel of the Justice Department’s sprawling prosecution. Trump also ordered his Justice Department to take steps to throw out all pending indictments against Jan. 6 defendants whose cases have not yet been fully adjudicated — a decision that would shut down roughly 470 ongoing cases. Trump long vowed to grant clemency to those who descended on the Capitol as Congress certified the 2020 election win of his Democratic opponent, former President Biden, describing them on the campaign trail as 'political prisoners' and 'hostages.' But in recent weeks, his allies’ comments suggested Trump’s clemency might not be so sweeping. Vice President Vance said earlier this month that people who 'committed violence' on Jan. 6 should 'obviously' not receive pardons, while Pam Bondi, Trump’s pick for attorney general, said at her confirmation hearing that she 'condemns' any violence against law enforcement. Trump said Monday he believed the supporters of Jan. 6 rioters would be pleased with his clemency decisions, describing them as 'hostages' who 'for the most part ... didn’t do stuff wrong.' 'You'll be happy because, you know, it's action, not words that count,' he said. 'And you're going to see a lot of action on the J6 hostages — a lot.'

Bill O'Reilly: Trump 'humiliated' Biden in inauguration speech	(NewsNation) — Bill O'Reilly stated that President Donald Trump 'knows he humiliated' outgoing President Joe Biden and that the act was driven by 'vengeance.' 'That was a brutal speech,' O'Reilly said on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' 'It's a unique moment in American history. I can't find any other inaugural address that humiliated an outgoing president as much as this one did.' 'Vengence doesn't leave the building easily,' O'Reilly added, calling out Biden for 'attacking' both Trump and his family. Live Updates: Trump’s inauguration Cuomo: Time Trump spends persecuting Biden is wasted O'Reilly pointed out how Biden had to sit through Trump's speech and 'listen to how he screwed up every single thing in this country.' 'It was excruciating,' O'Reilly said, emphasizing that Trump chose to speak that way because 'He believes that President Biden was behind Jack Smith and Mar-a-Lago raids.' NewsNation's Chris Cuomo disagreed, calling it 'petty vengeance.' 'Every moment that Donald Trump motivates any retrospective in terms of investigating narratives, looking at narratives, is, to me, a moment wasted for the American people,' Cuomo said. Trump calls America’s past leadership corrupt Trump described America’s leadership over the last four years as incompetent and corrupt, echoing some of the darker rhetoric he used daily on the campaign trail. He did not mention his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, or any other Democrats by name. But there was no question about whom he was talking. 'We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad,' Trump charged. Here are all executive orders Trump is expected to sign on Day 1 He said the current government protects dangerous immigrants instead of law-abiding citizens, protects foreign borders at the expense of American borders and 'can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency.' 'All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly,' he said. As of Monday, Republicans control all three branches of the federal government.

Marco Rubio unanimously confirmed as secretary of State, becoming...	The Senate on Monday unanimously confirmed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) as America's 72nd secretary of State, putting in place the first member of President Trump's cabinet on the day of his inauguration. Rubio’s confirmation vote passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, 99-0. Rubio also was able to cast a vote for himself. Vivek Ramaswamy set to depart DOGE 'No one on this body can doubt that Marco Rubio is an intelligent man with remarkable understanding of American foreign policy and a very deep commitment to the American Dream,' Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in remarks on the Senate floor. Rubio’s Senate seat will be filled by Florida state Attorney General Ashley Moody. As the son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio is the first Latino American to serve as top diplomat. A 14-year veteran of the Senate, member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Rubio’s nomination as secretary of State brought relief to lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and America’s allies abroad concerned over Trump’s unpredictable and chaotic approach to foreign affairs. Alongside Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virg.), Rubio co-sponsored legislation that would prevent any president from withdrawing from NATO, a move viewed as safeguarding America’s position in the alliance in the face of Trump’s threats to withdraw the U.S. Trump in recent weeks has telegraphed imperialist goals, expressing his desire to assume ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, as well as talk of making Canada the 51st state and taking over the Panama Canal from Panama. 'The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory,' Trump said during his inauguration address. Trump singled out retaking control of the Panama Canal in his address as an imperative to counter China’s influence in the strategic waterway. Panama’s president has rejected that the canal is under foreign influence. Senate passes Laken Riley Act in first move after Trump inauguration Rubio, during his confirmation hearing, said that the presence of Chinese companies on either side of the canal has raised concern from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, and poses a national security risk to the U.S. – in one example of how he is planning to thread the needle of explaining some of Trump’s threats. 'In reality a foreign power today possesses, through their companies – which we know are not independent – the ability to turn the canal into a choke point in a moment of conflict and that is a direct threat to the national interest and security of the United States,' he said. Rubio, viewed as a China hawk, is sending early signals of his focus on countering Beijing’s global influence ambitions, scheduling bilateral and group meetings in Washington with American allies on the frontlines of Chinese aggression the day after the inauguration. This includes a bilateral meeting with Japan’s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, and a joint meeting with the foreign ministers of Japan, Australia and India, the so-called Quad. The foreign ministers were present at Trump’s inauguration at the Capitol on Monday. The group's meeting demonstrates 'an iron-clad commitment' to close cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong told reporters in Washington on Sunday, Reuters reported. Wong posted a photo from Trump’s inauguration ceremony at Capitol Hill alongside Japan’s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and India’s Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar. Also in the photo was Malta’s Deputy Prime Minister Ian Borg. The meetings are expected to take place Tuesday, a nod to the confidence that Rubio’s confirmation vote would move through quickly. Rubio has called for making the State Department 'highly relevant again,' but it’s unclear how much influence the State Department will have in a Trump administration where the president has appointed a slew of special envoys to take on specific foreign policy challenges.

Trump has also appointed a Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia, part of his push to end the nearly three-year war. And Trump has anointed Richard Grenell, his former ambassador to Germany, whose name was floated as a potential secretary of State, for the undefined role of Presidential Envoy for Special Missions. Rubio steps into a role filled by two people during Trump's first term: Rex Tillerson, a former oil executive who was fired by Trump after 423 days in the role, and then Mike Pompeo, a former House member and CIA director under Trump. Rubio was a fierce Trump critic during the contest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. But he has evolved to a staunch loyalist, a shift cemented when Trump chose him for secretary of State one week after he won the election. He is widely seen as a potential presidential contender again in 2028.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/marco-rubio-confirmed-secretary-of-state/	2025-01-20T16:05:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/rubiomarco_011525gn03_w.jpg?w=900
Transcript: Trump's second inaugural address to the American peop...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump delivered a 30-minute speech from the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, his second inaugural address to the American people. Here is a transcript: Trump’s inauguration 2025 vs. 2017: Photos Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the United States Supreme Court, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris and my fellow citizens: The golden age of America begins right now. From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation. And we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first. Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end. And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud and prosperous and free. America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before. I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before. But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing and the United States of America. As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, the radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens. While the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair, we now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad. It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world. We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders, or more importantly, its own people. Tech CEOs get prime seating at Trump inauguration Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina, who’ve been treated so badly. And other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago. Or more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They’re raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don’t have a home any longer. That’s interesting. But we can’t let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That’s going to change. We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today and will change very quickly. Our recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom. From this moment on, America’s decline is over. Our liberties and our nation’s glorious destiny will no longer be denied and we will immediately restore the integrity, competency and loyalty of America’s government. Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I’ve learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our Republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed to take my life. Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin’s bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then, and believe even more so now, that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. Michelle Obama, Nancy Pelosi: Here’s who skipped Trump’s inauguration That is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. For American citizens, Jan. 20, 2025, is Liberation Day. It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country. As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society. Young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban and rural. And, very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states and the popular vote. We won by millions of people. To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I’ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come. Today is Martin Luther King Day and his honor — this will be a great honor — but in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true. National unity is now returning to America and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country. We will not forget our Constitution. And we will not forget our God. Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It’s all about common sense. First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted. And we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. I will end the practice of catch and release. And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. Under the orders I sign today we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities. As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions. And that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Next, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices. And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill. Trump officials shut down CBP One app for migrants America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have: the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth. And we are going to use it. We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top, and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again. And it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it. With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice. We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the auto workers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote. I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources. The American Dream will soon be back and thriving like never before. To restore confidence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America. Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents. Something I know something about. We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again. Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the Constitution and the rule of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities. This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. This week I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from the military for objecting to the Covid vaccine mandate with full back pay. And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It’s going to end immediately. Our armed forces will be free to focus on their sole mission—defeating America’s enemies. Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen.

And, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into. My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That’s what I want to be. A peacemaker and a unifier. I’m pleased to say that, as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families. America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world. A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. And we will restore the name of the great President William McKinley to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent. He was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States — the United States, I mean, think of this, spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal. We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made. And Panama’s promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back. Melania dons hat at Trump inauguration, struggles to kiss Trump Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor and the vitality of history’s greatest civilization. So as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy and disease free. The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons. And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars. And it’s the lifeblood of a great nation. And, right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other. There’s no nation like our nation. Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls. Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close. Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted millions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve. Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken. I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we do best. From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steel workers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride. Together they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced. Will Melania and Barron Trump live at the White House? After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore an American promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love. And we love it so much. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. So to every parent who dreams for their child and every child to dreams for their future: I am with you, I will fight for you and I will win for you. And we’re going to win like never before. In recent years, our nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again. Greater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other. Full of compassion, courage and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable. America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith and goodwill. We will be prosperous. We will be proud. We will be strong and we will win like never before. We will not be conquered. We will not be intimidated. We will not be broken. And we will not fail. From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign and independent nation. We will stand bravely. We will live proudly. We will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way. Because we are Americans. The future is ours. And our golden age has just begun. Thank you. God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transcript-trump-second-inaugural-address/	2025-01-20T14:06:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25020648327450.jpg?w=900
Tech CEOs get prime seating at Trump inauguration	(NewsNation) — The strategic seating of several prominent tech leaders who were perched behind President Donald Trump during his inauguration could foreshadow their potential hand in his administration, some political analysts say. The heads of the largest companies were spotted at his inauguration Monday. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Apple head Tim Cook and Google chief Sundar Pichai all attended the inauguration service at St. John's Church in Washington and were later seen seated together in the second row behind Trump’s family. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew was also in attendance, with the inauguration occurring one day after the video-sharing platform went dark in the U.S., though he was not seated with the other tech leaders at the Capitol rotunda. Will Melania and Barron Trump live at the White House? 'They [tech leaders] got some of the most prominent positions there, and it seems like Donald Trump was trying to send a message of some kind,' NewsNation Chief Washington Correspondent and host of 'The Hill' Blake Burman said. Niall Stanage, White House columnist for The Hill, also noticed the priority seating. 'I think visually, one of the most striking things was the prominence of so many tech executives, much more prominent than most members of Congress or even the proposed members of President Trump's Cabinet,' he said. Trump Cabinet nominees all sat behind the tech titans during the president's inaugural lunch. Musk is not a surprising guest as he will co-lead the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The billionaire owns Tesla, SpaceX and the social media platform X and has become Trump's close friend in recent years. The executives or their companies had all donated hefty sums to Trump’s inauguration fund, which likely garnered the prime locations. 'Things in Washington are changing. This is a different town when Donald Trump walked in here,' NewsNation's Leland Vittert said, referring in part to the seating chart. TikTok app restored in US amid Trump assurances A number of Republican governors, including Greg Abbott of Texas and Ron DeSantis of Florida and many spouses of members of Congress, were relegated to an overflow room in Emancipation Hall due to the limited space in the Capitol rotunda, reported The Hill. Democrats denounced the seating decision. 'Big Tech billionaires have a front row seat at Trump’s inauguration. They have even better seats than Trump’s own Cabinet picks. That says it all,' Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, wrote on the social platform X. 'All you need to know. The billionaires are in charge. Not you,' Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut wrote on X. Some Republicans privately were miffed, the outlet reported. 'I didn’t like that,' one GOP lawmaker told The Hill. 'Why is Zuckerberg all of a sudden in our fold? My concern is, if we hadn’t won, where would he be? Would he be on the other team?' a second GOP lawmaker said. 'At least Elon was in the fight.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/tech-ceos-trump-inauguration/	2025-01-20T13:57:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2194915745_a4adc3.jpg?w=900

Here are all executive orders Trump is expected to sign on Day 1	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump will put pen to paper Monday, signing a slew of executive orders relating to ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government, strictly defining two sexes and enforcing heightened border security. The president is expected to make good on several campaign promises on his first day in office, but many of his executive orders will likely come up against legal opposition in the coming days. An executive order is a signed statement about how the president wants the federal government to be managed. They can come in the form of instructions to federal agencies or requests for reports. Trump vows to release JFK, RFK, MLK assassination records 'Today I will sign a series of executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense,' Trump said during his inauguration speech Monday. Trump is expected to sign these executive orders Monday afternoon: Border Diversity and inclusion Border-related executive orders Trump will declare a national emergency at the southern border This order would help the secretary of defense quickly and seamlessly deploy members of armed forces to the border and free up more federal resources. Trump will end catch and release of migrants Border czar Tim Homan said the Trump administration would be ending the federal 'catch and release' program, which allows immigrants who entered the country illegally to remain in the country as long as they are in the process for asylum. 'Stay in your homeland,' Homan told NewsNation last month. 'Be safe. Crossing into this country illegally is very dangerous.' Trump will reinstate the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy During his first term, Trump implemented the 'Remain in Mexico' policy, also called 'Migration Protection Protocols,' which required asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico until their claims were processed. Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration ended the policy in 2022. Under the order, this policy would be reinstated. Will Melania and Barron Trump live at the White House? Trump will resume border wall construction Trump began construction of the southern border wall during his first administration in an effort to prevent illegal crossings. Under the order, work would resume. Trump will designate cartels as global terrorists After being elected, Trump revived a campaign vow to designate Mexico’s drug cartels as terrorist groups. 'I will immediately designate the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations,' Trump said. Trump plans to rename Gulf of Mexico, Mount Denali — but can he? While in office in 2019, Trump dropped the plan at the request of Mexico’s then-President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who said he wanted U.S. cooperation in fighting drug gangs. Trump will suspend refugee resettlement for 4 months Trump, who put tight limits on refugees in his first term, has vowed to 'suspend refugee resettlement' for four months as part of a broader effort to 'immediately end the migrant invasion of America.' Trump will end birthright citizenship The president said he would end birthright citizenship, the right of children born in the U.S. to claim citizenship regardless of their parents’ immigration status. The 14th Amendment guarantees American citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. Only constitutional amendments, not executive orders or legislation, can change the Constitution. Trump said he intends to issue an executive order to end the practice, though executive orders cannot overturn constitutional amendments. Trump will direct the military to prioritize borders White House officials said the order would 'clarify the military’s role in protecting the territorial integrity of the United States' by sending military personnel to the border, pushing the Department of Defense to erect barriers and green-lighting the use of drones and other surveillance measures. Trump will order enhanced border vetting and screening Under this order, the president is expected to tighten up the vetting and screening of migrants entering the country. Trump plans to rename Gulf of Mexico, Mount Denali — but can he? Diversity and inclusion Trump will define gender as two sexes Trump officials said the order will direct federal agencies to enforce laws in order to protect men and women as distinct sexes and use sex, not gender, in federal policies and documents. The Trump administration will maintain there are two sexes, 'male' and 'female,' and that 'they are grounded in incontrovertible reality,' one official said. The official added the federal government will use the sex of a person at birth to determine how they are classified. Under the order, government-issued identity documents, including passports and visas, will reflect a holder's sex. The order is expected to state that the federal government will no longer promote gender ideology, according to officials. Trump will end federal DEI programs A Trump official said an executive order will end 'radical wasteful DEI programs and preferences' in the federal government in order to 'create equal treatment.' DEI refers to diversity, equity and inclusion programs. This order will end funding for DEI funding in the government and will direct the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management to end 'illegal mandates, preferences.' 'This is going to be a priority,' one official said. This story is developing.

Trump declares ‘Golden Age’ in America in inaugural address	President Trump on Monday declared it was the beginning of a new 'Golden Age' in America, pledging to restore a country that he said had been decimated by the previous administration as he officially took the oath of office for his second White House term. In an inaugural address from the Capitol, Trump depicted a nation in disrepair and laid out an ambitious agenda that he argued was validated by his election victory in November. The president, in taking a shot at his predecessor Joe Biden, who was also seated directly next to the lectern as he spoke, said he was inheriting a government that 'cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad.' 'Our recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and, indeed, their freedom,' Trump said. 'From this moment on, America's decline is over.' Trump said he would address the 'inflation crisis,' which he blamed on overspending by the Biden administration. He vowed to declare a national emergency at the southern border and to impose tariffs on foreign goods. He said he would end 'weaponization' of the Justice system. He vowed the official policy of the government would be that there are 'only two genders.' And he cast himself as a 'peacemaker,' even as he signaled he would seek to reclaim ownership of the Panama Canal. Trump delivered his address in the Capitol Rotunda after Monday’s inauguration proceedings were moved indoors in anticipation of bitterly cold temperatures in the nation’s capital. It was the first time an inauguration took place inside since 1985 for then-President Ronald Reagan’s second inaugural ceremony. The change in plans meant fewer people could be in the room to witness Trump’s swearing in and remarks in person. Attendees who made it inside the Rotunda and were seated directly behind the lectern included Trump’s Cabinet nominees and senior officials, former presidents and vice presidents, GOP donors and tech industry leaders like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai. Hundreds of other guests were relegated to an overflow room in the Capitol, including members of Congress, governors, New York Mayor Eric Adams and influencer Logan Paul. Thousands of Trump supporters who intended to watch from the National Mall witnessed the events via livestream at nearby Capital One Arena. Trump’s 2017 inauguration speech was widely remembered for its references to 'American carnage' and a pledge to put 'America First,' a sharply different tone than the typical notes of optimism and unity that are hallmarks of inaugural addresses. Monday’s address carried some of those same echoes, as Trump promised to put America first and argued he'd been left with 'plentiful' challenges. But he was at times reflective, speaking about the rally last July where he was grazed by a bullet. And, as he did throughout the 2024 campaign, Trump argued the nation's success would ultimately unify its citizens. 'I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success,' Trump said. 'A tide of change is sweeping the country.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-declares-golden-age-in-america-after-inauguration/	2025-01-20T10:09:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25020631610246-e1737394872142.jpg?w=900

Trump, Melania launch meme coins: What are they?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's newly created cryptocurrency token has soared to more than $10 billion in market value on his second Inauguration Day. Trump announced the new $TRUMP meme coin Friday, writing on Truth Social: 'It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community.' Will Melania and Barron Trump live at the White House? On Sunday, Melania Trump launched her own meme coin, $MELANIA, writing on X: 'The Official Melania Meme is live! You can buy $MELANIA now.' Here's what to know about the bizarre world of meme coins and the ethical concerns around the president's involvement: What is a meme coin? Meme coins are cryptocurrencies inspired by internet trends or jokes. They have no intrinsic value. They're worth what someone else is willing to pay. In some cases, that can be a lot. Dogecoin, the first meme coin, was meant as satire to mock Bitcoin, but its viral popularity has led to real gains for many. DOGE has a current market cap of roughly $55 billion. Unlike stocks, which represent an ownership share in a company, meme coins' value are based on hype, making them notoriously volatile and risky to invest in. Are the Trump meme coins worth anything? The Trump meme coins started selling for less than $10 each before surging above $70 on Sunday. By Monday morning, the price was below $50. The Melania coin was trading for around on $8 Monday morning, down from $13 on Sunday evening. Where is Michelle Obama? Those price swings underscore the volatility that makes meme coins so risky for buyers. A community note was later added to Melania's announcement on X, reading: 'Buying this token is incredibly risky and will likely result in the loss of funds.' On the meme coins' official websites, potential buyers are warned that Trump and Melania's crypto coins are 'digital collectibles intended to function as an expression of support for and engagement with the values embodied by the symbol $TRUMP' and the symbol 'MELANIA.' The disclaimers go on to say the tokens 'are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.' Instead, Trump's meme coin website encourages buyers to, 'Celebrate our win and have fun!' Why did Trump launch a meme coin? Trump is expected to be the most pro-crypto president in history, and his foray into the space suggests as much. The project is also likely to enrich him personally, raising ethics issues. 'The tokens released by Donald and Melania Trump appear to symbolize support for the digital currency sector. However, the introduction of these coins during the presidential inauguration raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest,' Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at Conotoxia, told CNBC.

Subscribe Now Breaking News Alerts Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Justin D'Anethan, an independent crypto analyst based in Hong Kong, told Reuters: 'While it's tempting to dismiss this as just another Trump spectacle, the launch of the official Trump token opens up a Pandora's box of ethical and regulatory questions.' The Trump meme coin was organized by CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization.

Trump expected to sign these executive orders related to the bord...	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump is expected to fulfill the crackdowns he’s long promised on securing the U.S. border by signing multiple executive orders around immigration on his first day in office. Trump ran a campaign largely focused on immigration and the southern border, saying he would order the largest mass deportation in American history of people who crossed illegally. 'The border security measures I will outline in my inaugural address tomorrow will be the most aggressive, sweeping effort to restore our borders the world has ever seen,' Trump told attendees of a private dinner on Sunday. Trump is expected to sign these executive orders around the border Monday afternoon: Trump to declare national emergency at southern border This order would help the secretary of defense quickly and seamlessly deploy members of armed forces to the border and free up more federal resources. Will Melania and Barron Trump live at the White House? Trump to reinstate 'Remain in Mexico' policy During his first term, Trump implemented the 'Remain in Mexico' policy, also called 'Migration Protection Protocols,' which required asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico until their claims were processed. Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration ended the policy in 2022. Under the order, this policy would be reinstated. Trump to end 'catch-and-release' program 'Border czar' Tim Homan said the Trump administration will be ending the federal 'catch-and-release' program, which allows immigrants who entered the country illegally to remain in the country as long as they are in the process for asylum. 'Stay in your homeland,' Homan told NewsNation last month. 'Be safe. Crossing into this country illegally is very dangerous.' Trump to resume construction on southern border wall Trump began construction of the southern border wall during his first administration in an effort to prevent illegal crossings. Under the order, work would resume. A boy walks near where a border wall separating the U.S. from Mexico reaches the Pacific Ocean on Nov. 26, 2024, in Tijuana, Mexico. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Trump to designate cartels as global terrorists After being elected, Trump revived a campaign vow to designate Mexico's drug cartels as terrorist groups. 'I will immediately designate the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations,' Trump said. While in office in 2019, Trump dropped the plan at the request of Mexico's then-President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who said he wanted U.S. cooperation on fighting drug gangs. Trump to suspend refugee resettlement Trump, who put tight limits on refugees in his first term, has vowed to 'suspend refugee resettlement' for four months as part of a broader effort to 'immediately end the migrant invasion of America.' Trump vows to release JFK, RFK, MLK assassination records The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program has brought in more than 3 million people since it was created by Congress in 1980 for refugees fearing persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or political opinion. Trump to end birthright citizenship The president said he would end birthright citizenship, the right of children born in the U.S. to claim citizenship regardless of their parents' immigration status. The 14th Amendment guarantees American citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. Only constitutional amendments, not executive orders or legislation, can change the Constitution. Trump said he intends to issue an executive order to end the practice, though executive orders cannot overturn constitutional amendments. Trump to direct military to prioritize borders White House officials said the order would 'clarify the military’s role in protecting the territorial integrity of the United States' by sending military personnel to the border, pushing the Department of Defense to erect barriers and green-lighting the use of drones and other surveillance measures. Trump to enhance vetting, screening Under this order, the president is expected to tighten up the vetting and screening of migrants entering the country. This story is developing.

Trump plans to rename Gulf of Mexico, Mount Denali — but can he?	Video above: President Biden welcomes President-elect Trump to the White House ahead of the inauguration. (NEXSTAR) — President Donald Trump is set to hit the ground running as he takes office for the second time on Monday. In addition to declaring a national energy emergency and issuing executive orders regarding the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump appears set to enact another change he has teased: renaming the Gulf of Mexico. Earlier this month, Trump told reporters he wants it to be known as the Gulf of America, calling it 'a beautiful name' and 'appropriate.' It quickly drew pushback from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, who suggested North America be labeled as 'América Mexicana' or 'Mexican America.' That didn't stop Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., from quickly introducing a bill to rename the gulf. Trump's Inauguration Day: Live updates Ahead of Trump's inauguration Monday, his incoming press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, shared on X that Trump will rename not only the Gulf of Mexico but Mount Denali as part of his initial executive orders. The post included a link to the New York Post, which reports it has learned that Trump will call for the Gulf of Mexico to become the Gulf of America. Mount Denali will return to Mount McKinley — President Barack Obama changed the name of the continent's highest mountain in 2015.

(AP Photo/Manuel Valdes, File) Citing a preview of the executive orders, the Post reports the move is to honor 'American greatness' and would require the secretary of the interior to change the names. In federal communications and official maps, the locations would be referred to as the Gulf of America and Mount McKinley. Mount McKinley was named for Republican president William McKinley, who was assassinated in 1901. Trump had previously expressed admiration for McKinley, calling him a 'very successful businessman' and a 'very good president' during a December 2024 rally. Will Melania Trump and Barron live at the White House? Following Obama's renaming of the mountain in 2015 — a move done to recognize 'the sacred status of Denali to generations of Alaska Natives' — Trump criticized the decision. He then vowed to change it back to McKinley during his first term in office. Members of Congress representing Alaska long resisted Denali becoming McKinley again. Does Trump have the power to rename both sites, though? While he could take the same path Obama did to rename Denali after McKinley — technically, his Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, used her authority to rename the mountain — it's unclear exactly if that's what Trump's executive order calls for. Because Denali is within the U.S. boundaries, it could be a relatively simple process. Renaming the Gulf of Mexico could be more complicated. 378913 01: Pennzenergy Company Oil Exploration Drilling Rig In The Gulf Of Mexico During Sunset.

The International Hydrographic Organization — of which both the United States and Mexico are members — works to ensure all the world’s seas, oceans, and navigable waters are surveyed and charted uniformly, and also names some of them.

The U.S. Board on Geographic Names, the nation's geographic naming authority, explains that name changes for natural features are considered only for 'a compelling reason.' 'Generally, the most important policy regarding names is local use and acceptance,' it explains.

MLK Day, Trump inauguration convergence brings reflection	(NewsNation) — The inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on Monday coincides with Martin Luther King Jr. Day for just the second time, but the occasion is one of reflection rather than concern for King’s family. Bernice King, daughter of the late civil rights leader, told MSBC that Trump’s inauguration falling on the same day as the national holiday that honors her father draws attention to the legacy of service that King left behind. 'It points us back to King,' Bernice King said in the interview. 'It says, ‘When we move forward, we’ve got to do in the spirit of King.'' Trump expected to sign record number of executive orders on Monday Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established by President Ronald Reagan in 1983 and was first observed in 1986. Since then, only the inauguration of former President Bill Clinton in 1997 coincided with the federal holiday. In 2013, former President Barack Obama was sworn in during a private ceremony on Jan. 20, which fell on a Sunday. However, a public ceremony was held the following day, which fell on the federal holiday. Obama’s inauguration ceremony included a Bible that belonged to King. The next time the federal holiday falls on Jan. 20 will come in 2053 for the swearing-in of the winner of the 2052 presidential election. While the inauguration is always scheduled for Jan. 20, MLK Day falls on the third Monday of January each year. Bernice King, who was 5 years old when her father was assassinated in 1968, has been critical of Trump in the past. However, she told MSNBC that she wanted those who felt defeated by Trump’s victory in the 2024 election to stay focused on the message of nonviolence preached by her father. 'We have to strategize. We’ve been missing the strategy. We’ve been missing the spirit of Dr. King,' she said in the televised interview. 'The spirit of Dr. King is nonviolence. And nonviolence is not just a posture, it’s a mindset. For us, we define it as a love-centered way of thinking, speaking, acting and engaging that leads to personal, cultural and societal transformation.' Trump’s son, Martin Luther King III, told NBC News on Sunday that it is important for Trump to work to unify the country rather than to tear it apart. 'If you said you wanted to be a uniter, then those who didn’t support you, you need to reach out to them or allow them to reach out to you,' King's son said in an interview with 'Meet The Press'. 'We’re not reflective of the ‘United’ States of America right this moment, in my judgment.' Civil rights activists also stressed the importance of recognizing the timing of Trump’s inauguration and the holiday remembering King. Like King’s family, the Rev. Al Sharpton told USA Today the convergence of the two events serves as a reminder of King’s message that the work never stops. However, Sharpton said that to remain silent on Trump’s past rhetoric would be a disservice to King’s legacy. 'Everything that Dr. King stood for, Donald Trump has stated clearly he wants to dislodge,' Sharpton said, according to the report. Bernice King and other faith leaders will participate in a program at the King Center in Atlanta on Monday. She said it is important for people to listen to Trump’s speech as he is sworn in for a second time. 'Regardless of what people feel or think about President-elect Trump, at this point he's going to be the president of the United States,’’ she said, according to USA Today. 'We need to hear what he says. It does not need to be ignored, because you cannot create an effective strategy making assumptions.’’	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/mlk-day-trump-inauguration-convergence/	2025-01-20T08:07:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/kingbernice_032723_AP_Brynn-Anderson-e1730817580302.jpg?w=900
Will Melania and Barron Trump live at the White House?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump is returning to the White House on Monday as the second president to serve two nonconsecutive terms. Trump has not said he will live anywhere but the White House. Seven presidents have resided elsewhere during their administrations for varying periods, most of which occurred due to renovations. Where will Melania live during Trump's presidency? Trump's wife, Melania, and teenage son, Barron, are expected to stay at the White House in varied capacities, with the latter attending NYU in Manhattan. Melania told Fox News in a Jan. 13 interview that she will split her time between Washington, D.C., New York and Florida. Biden issues pardons for Jan. 6 Committee members, Fauci, Milley 'I will be in the White House. And when I need to be in New York, I will be in New York,' Melania said. 'When I need to be in Palm Beach, I will be in Palm Beach. My first priority is to be a mom, to be a first lady, to be a wife.'

Trump vows to release JFK, RFK, MLK assassination records	(The Hill) -- President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday vowed to release records related to former President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassinations 'in the coming days.' 'As a first step toward restoring transparency and accountability to government, we will also reverse the overclassification of government documents, and in the coming days, we are going to make public remaining records relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy, as well as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and other topics of great public interest,' Trump said during a rally at Washington D.C.’s Capital One Arena in a clip highlighted by Mediaite. Robert F. Kennedy’s son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., backed Trump’s 2024 bid for the presidency and has been picked by Trump as his nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

Trump to promise 'new era of national success' in inaugural addre...	(The Hill) -- President-elect Donald Trump is set to promise a 'new era of national success' in his inaugural address, according to The Wall Street Journal. 'I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country,' a part of the inaugural address, which the Journal first obtained, reads. 'My message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor and the vitality of history’s greatest civilization,' the speech continues. The former president's inauguration ceremony on Monday is set to take place inside the Capitol Rotunda instead of the West Front of the Capitol due to cold weather. Trump’s return to the presidency comes after an intense 2024 election cycle that featured one of the major candidates dropping out and assassination attempts against the president-elect. He enters the office amid a period of heated political rhetoric on both sides of the aisle. In President Joe Biden’s inaugural address four years ago, he pushed for 'unity,' saying that Americans 'can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors.' 'We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury,' he added. The expected attendees for Monday's swearing-in ceremony include Biden, former President Bill Clinton, former President George W. Bush and former President Barack Obama. Other expected guests include tech moguls such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-to-promise-new-era-of-national-success-in-inaugural-address/	2025-01-20T05:39:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25009055812675.jpg?w=900
What's next in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire?	(NewsNation) — On Day 2 of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, amid mixed emotions of joy and relief, there is uncertainty about what happens next. Aid trucks are flowing into Gaza following the release of three Israeli hostages and dozens of Palestinian prisoners. In the coming weeks, 30 more hostages are expected to be freed. Additionally, Yemen's Houthi rebels signaled they will limit attacks on Israeli ships in the Red Sea now that there is a ceasefire. In less than a week, another four Israeli hostages are expected to be released from Gaza, with the remaining 26 set to be freed over the next five weeks. How the deal to pause the Israel-Hamas war could unfold Gaza sees surge in food and medical aid Gaza is seeing a surge in food and medical supplies, with more than 630 trucks of humanitarian aid in the region, according to the U.N. Egypt's foreign minister has confirmed the assistance is expected to continue daily over roughly the next 40 days. However, the next critical step involves negotiating the second and third phases of the deal. If agreed upon, these stages would include the release of hostages, a permanent pause in fighting and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Phase three would focus on returning the bodies of the deceased hostages and beginning the reconstruction of Gaza. Mother of slain American son in Gaza reacts to ceasefire deal Hostage's father: 'The job is not done' Over the weekend, the first hostages were released from Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli custody. It was a bittersweet moment for the families of those still believed to be in captivity, including the family of Itay Chen, a U.S.-Iraeli believed to be held hostage in Gaza. 'We also know that the job is not done, and that there are still 94 hostages in Gaza, and we must do everything possible in order to bring them back,' Itay's father, Ruby Chen, told NewsNation. 'We feel that all the families will stick together and support one another till the last hostage comes out. and that is exactly what we are waiting for.' Ruby Chen and former military personnel emphasize this agreement is only a partial deal and that future negotiations are needed. This, they stress, is not a peace deal.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/israel-hamas-ceasefire-whats-next/	2025-01-20T05:10:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25019691319746.jpg?w=900
Biden issues pardons for Jan. 6 committee members, Fauci, Milley	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden issued pardons for retired Gen. Mark Milley, Dr. Anthony Fauci and members of the congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot on Tuesday, just hours before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. People who are close to Trump expect the president-elect might try to prosecute those who have gone against him politically or sought to hold him accountable for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss. In a previous interview with NewsNation, U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said the House Judiciary Committee would be considering potential investigations into the Jan. 6 committee. Biden said in a statement that the issuance of the pardons 'should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.' 'These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions,' Biden said in a statement. Trump expected to sign record number of executive orders on Monday Several of those on the committee who got pardons Tuesday publicly said they didn’t want them, nor did they feel they even needed one. They include former Republican representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. However, Bennie Thompson, chairman of the committee, has gone on record saying he would accept the pardon for fear of prosecution in the incoming administration. Trump's pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi wouldn’t commit either way to prosecuting or not prosecuting the incoming president's political foes during her confirmation hearing last week. Instead, she said she needed to 'look at the facts and circumstances.' Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called Trump a fascist and detailed Trump’s conduct around the Jan. 6, 2021 riot. Fauci was director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. He coordinated the nation’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and raised the ire of Trump after refusing to back the president-elect's claims about the virus.

Trump's Inauguration Day security: What we know	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration is under heightened security in the wake of two national security events — a terror attack in New Orleans and a Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas. The event will mark Trump's nonconsecutive return to the White House, ringing in a presidency for a man who faced two assassination attempts during his reelection bid and incited the Jan. 6 Capitol riots after his 2020 loss to Joe Biden. Are there Inauguration Day security threats? Law enforcement prepared for potential demonstrations this time around, but they are not anticipating any major problems, the Associated Press reported. In a Capitol Police intelligence assessment report released earlier this month, obtained by ABC News, authorities expect the 'civil unrest' trend in 2020 to repeat in 2024. What happens on Inauguration Day? A schedule of key events In an interview with CBS News, FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency was 'not tracking any specific or credible threats to the inauguration.' 'What I would tell you, though, is that we're dealing with a threat landscape where terrorists, whether they be foreign, jihadist-inspired or domestic terrorists or others, can move from radicalization to action quite quickly, often with very crude but still lethal attacks,' Wray told the outlet.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) He pointed to FBI cooperation with state and local law enforcement partners to prevent safety issues. 'What I would tell you is that I have enormous confidence in the FBI's men and women in our role as supporting the other agencies, which have the primary responsibility for securing the inauguration,' Wray said. Who will act as security at Trump's inauguration? Roughly 7,800 National Guard soldiers and airmen will join the Secret Service, U.S. Capitol Police and D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department to secure the 60th presidential inauguration. That's roughly the same amount of guardsmen as Trump's first inauguration in 2017 and one-third of the guardsmen present at President Joe Biden's 2021 inauguration, according to NGAUS officials. The guards will provide security support, crowd management and medical assistance during the event. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. 'The National Guard is proud to contribute to the safe and orderly inauguration of our 47th commander-in-chief,' Gen. Steven S. Nordhaus, the chief of the National Guard Bureau, said in a statement. 'We are immensely proud of the Soldiers and Airmen who will take part in it.' The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security will also secure the event. How is security impacted by an indoor ceremony? Security preparations changed last minute after Trump announced the swearing-in ceremony would move inside due to forecasted freezing temperatures. Trump will take the oath of office in the Capitol Rotunda, the first time in 40 years that a president isn't sworn in on the Capitol steps outdoors. Instead of hundreds of thousands of people being able to watch the ceremony outside, now a room housing about 2,000 will be the site for Trump’s swearing-in as the 47th president. On the eve of the inauguration, inauguration committee staff members were mapping out where entertainers would enter the room and who would escort family members to the stage. The decision Friday to move the ceremony inside forced organizers and security agencies to redo hundreds of decisions meticulously laid out for months to new ones decided within days, such as: Who will get the coveted seats, and who won’t? A new road closure map was released late Saturday. What is the Inauguration Day schedule? Procession to Capitol: By tradition, a procession to the Capitol will kick off the events. President Joe Biden, President-elect Trump and their spouses will travel to the White House, escorted by members of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (JCCIC). The two presidents will meet briefly and then proceed to the Capitol for the swearing-in ceremonies. Swearing-in ceremonies: Vance will be sworn in first, followed by Trump. Inaugural address: The chief justice of the Supreme Court will deliver the oath to Trump, who will subsequently give his inaugural address. Every President since George Washington has delivered an inaugural address, according to the JCCIC. Outgoing presidential departure: After the ceremonies, outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will depart the Capitol by plane.

Luncheon: The president, first lady, guests and members of the JCCIC will have a luncheon in the Capitol, a tradition since 1953. Military review and parade: Finally, the president and vice president will make their way to the east front steps of the Capitol, where they review the military troops, who will then lead a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. The procession will include ceremonial military regiments, citizens’ groups, marching bands and floats.

President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated for his second presidential term on Monday, and former White House usher Chris Emery has a look behind the scenes at the 'mass bedlam' behind a White House flip. Emery told NewsNation the process of moving presidents in and out of the White House 'is almost like Cirque du Soleil,' with all 97 staff members working together. What happens on Inauguration Day? A schedule of key events 'Some people are bringing clothes in. Some are bringing furnishings. You got electricians doing wiring. You get engineers putting up things. Everybody's working together,' Emery said. It's incoming first ladies who plan for the move — and it doesn't always go as planned, Emery said. 'I can recall President Clinton coming directly to me, saying, where's his tux? He had an inaugural to go to, and so there's a mad search throughout the house trying to find what happened,' Emery recalled. 'His tux was finally found in a third floor closet, like a half an hour before he was ready to go.' The first family knows what to expect this time around, but Emery said it will still be a heavy lift before their homecoming is complete. 5 takeaways from Trump’s inauguration eve rally How to watch Inauguration Day on NewsNation You can watch the full Inauguration Day proceedings on NewsNation on TV, online at NewsNationNow.com or on the NewsNation apps for your television or phone.

Trump expected to sign record number of executive orders on Monda...	President-elect Donald Trump is expected to sign a record number of executive orders on Monday after he takes the oath of office. The topics are expected to include temporarily suspending the ban on TikTok, measures to toughen border security, stop diversity mandates in the federal government, multiple ones dealing with energy policy and to stop what he called the 'over classification' of government documents. 'You are going to see something tomorrow. You are going to see executive orders that are going to make you extremely happy – lots of them, lots of them. We have to set our country on the proper course,' Trump said at a rally Sunday evening. President Biden signed a total of 22 executive orders during his first week in office, marking a modern record at the time. 6 dramatic moments that shaped Biden’s presidency 'Somebody said yesterday, 'Sir don’t sign so many in one day. Let’s do it over a period of weeks.' I said, 'Like hell we are going to do it over weeks.' We are going to sign them at the beginning … we are doing them tomorrow,' Trump added. As expected, some will deal with one of his top priorities: the border. 'The border security measures I will outline in my inaugural address tomorrow will be the most aggressive, sweeping effort to restore our borders the world has ever seen,' he told the crowd. There will be multiple executive orders dealing with energy policy: opening up areas and easing permitting for oil and gas production, two Senate Republican sources familiar with the plans said. Capitol Rotunda prepped as inaugural ceremony moves indoors The president-elect also promised he would undo some of the recent executive actions President Joe Biden enacted. 'Every radical, foolish executive order of the Biden administration will be repealed within hours of when I take the oath of office.' Trump told the rally he will pardon a number of defendants charged with the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. 'Tomorrow everybody in this very large arena will be very happy with my decision,' referencing the Jan. 6 pardons. Jason Miller, a senior adviser for Trump, teased on Sky News on Sunday that Trump could sign some executive orders inside the Capitol Rotunda shortly after being sworn in and then sign some additional actions later at Capital One Arena, where the presidential parade is now set to take place.

Live updates: Trump to hold victory rally at Capital One Arena, T...	President-elect Trump is making the rounds in Washington on Sunday ahead of a victory rally at Capital One Area just before Inauguration Day. Trump arrived in the nation's capital over the weekend where he is preparing to take a second term in the White House as the Republican trifecta takes form. Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance took part in a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier earlier Sunday. He will hold a rally this evening where the slate of guest speakers include Megyn Kelly and Elon Musk. Also Sunday, TikTok said it was 'in the process' of restoring service in the United States hours after the popular video-sharing platform went dark. And in the Middle East, the ceasefire deal struck between Israel and Hamas took effect on Sunday, with the release of hostages that have been held in the Gaza Strip for more than one year. The deal includes three phases including an initial six-week pause in fighting. Several lawmakers also took to the Sunday political news shows including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) who told NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' that Trump is entering the White House as a 'different Donald Trump' from the man who took office eight years ago. Plus, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said on NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that he 'won’t commit' to sending California disaster aid without conditions, even as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) insists his state needs it for wildfire relief. He also vowed that there will be 'hell to pay' if Hamas violates the ceasefire deal struck recently with Israel.

Capitol Rotunda prepped as inaugural ceremony moves indoors	(NewsNation) — With just under 24 hours before Monday’s inauguration, the Capitol Rotunda was full of activity Sunday afternoon. The majestic room is being turned into the site of the inauguration, which was moved inside because of concerns about the frigid cold. Instead of hundreds of thousands of people being able to watch the ceremony outside, now a room housing about 2,000 max will be the site for Donald Trump’s swearing-in as the 47th president. These notable inaugurations weren’t held at the US Capitol. Here’s why Congressional officials were figuring out where exactly Trump should stand on stage as he takes the oath. Inauguration committee staff were mapping out where entertainers would enter the room, and who would escort family members to the stage. The decision Friday to move the ceremony inside forced organizers and security agencies to re-do hundreds of decisions meticulously laid out for months to new ones decided within days, such as: Who will get the coveted seats and who won’t? Various agencies are now figuring out where security entrances will now be. What road closures now need to be in effect? A new road closure map was released late Saturday. For the Secret Service, which is in charge of the security for the inauguration, the switch of venues means the swearing-in ceremony is an easier event to safeguard because it means fewer people in attendance and takes away the uncertainty of an outside site. Capitol staff, who are in charge of setting up the ceremony, were seen unloading new batches of chairs as they see how many seats could be jammed into the area. Ted Cruz: ‘This is a different Donald Trump that is being sworn in than in 2017’ Meanwhile, the decision to move the ceremony is causing repercussions across Washington. Congressional offices are being inundated with constituents who had received inaugural tickets but now won’t be able to attend and want to know if there is anything they can do. As part of the move inside, jumbotrons set up across the National Mall allowing thousands without tickets to view the swearing-in and feel like they are part of the event were taken down by the Presidential Inaugural Committee because of the weather, a spokesman for the National Park Service said. As for the Rotunda preparations, workers will be probably working through much of the night putting on the final touches because just like every other inaugural- at noon the new president will be sworn in.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/capitol-rotunda-inaugural-ceremony/	2025-01-19T13:40:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/cap_rouunda.jpg?w=900
Live updates: Protestors descend on Washington as US prepares for...	Inauguration festivities will begin in full force Saturday as President-elect Trump and his allies — and protesters — arrive in Washington ahead of Monday's inauguration of the 47th president of the U.S. Trump is expected to arrive at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, and he will later host a reception and fireworks display at his Virginia golf course. There will also be a Cabinet reception and dinner for Vice President-elect Vance at the National Gallery of Art on Saturday evening. The D.C. People’s March, organized by several activist groups, kicked off Saturday morning. It will culminate in a rally outside the Lincoln Memorial at 3 p.m., and about 50,000 people are expected to attend. On Sunday, Trump will host a rally at Capital One Arena in downtown Washington, where allies such as tech billionaire Elon Musk are expected to deliver remarks. The Village People, Kid Rock and Billy Ray Cyrus are also set to perform. Although Saturday is expected to be balmy, Monday’s inauguration ceremony was moved inside the Capitol as freezing temperatures and a snow storm are expected to envelop Washington later in the weekend.

Mother of son killed in Gaza 'relieved' after first hostages rele...	(NewsNation) — The ceasefire deal in Gaza and the release of the first three hostages is bittersweet for one mother who lost her 23-year-old American son, Hersh Goldberg, to the war. The ceasefire deal in Gaza is in effect as of Sunday morning, after almost falling apart in the final hours with Hamas holding out on releasing the list of hostage names. Ultimately, Hamas announced the names of three living female hostages who were successfully freed to Israeli officials Sunday afternoon local time. The deal was too late for Rachel Goldberg-Polin and her family, but she remains hopeful for the other grieving families. 'I woke up this morning, and I felt tremendous relief,' Goldberg-Polin said on NewsNation’s 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' on Sunday. 'I am a mother who is going to be processing the loss of her only son for the rest of my life, but I am so relieved for these families.' Ceasefire deal timeline: What officials say will happen next She described her son, who was executed by Hamas five months ago, as a 'happy-go-lucky, positive, wide-eyed lover of listening, small ego, curious, beautiful young man.' She compared him to a flower 'that's about to open up,' as she hopes his memory will 'serve as a blessing and as motivation to do and be better.' This undated photo provided by Rachel Goldberg shows her son Hersh Goldberg-Polin. The 23-year-old from Jerusalem was last seen when Hamas militants loaded him into the back of a pickup truck with other hostages abducted from a music festival in the western Negev Desert on Oct. 7. (Courtesy of Rachel Goldberg via AP) First hostages released Three women -- Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari -- were handed over to the Red Cross on the first day of the ceasefire. They are now in Israel and will soon be medically evaluated. The three-phase ceasefire began with this prisoner exchange, with Israel releasing 1,700 Palestinian prisoners in return in the first phase. Thirty-three hostages held captive by Hamas are expected to be released in the first six weeks as well. No Americans were released on the first day of the ceasefire, Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told NewsNation, but they are expected to be freed within the first six weeks. Phase two will include the return of the remaining living Israel hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza. The third phase is expected to address the handing over of the remaining bodies of dead hostages and the start of Gaza’s reconstruction, according to President Joe Biden. Families of hostages grateful but cautious about ceasefire deal The youngest hostage was kidnapped when he was nine months old, celebrating his second birthday the day before the ceasefire’s start. And 64 people will remain in captivity. 'We cannot be celebrating until every single one is home, and until this deal is complete,' Goldberg-Polin said. The war began 471 days ago on Oct. 7, 2023. In that time, people of different backgrounds faced a life-changing event. 'Now the remaining hostages comprise 23 different nationalities. They are Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists. And I started to wear the number because so many people would ask me during interviews, just on the street randomly, how many days has it been and I decided very early on that this is going to be my identity until every single one of these hostages comes home.' More than 46,000 Palestinians have died in the war, according to officials. In a post to X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on the hostage release. 'Romi, Doron and Emily - an entire nation embraces you, with congratulations on your homecoming. This moment was achieved thanks to the sacrifice and fighting of our heroic fighters - the heroes of Israel. I promise: We will bring everyone home!' Netanyahu wrote, translated from Hebrew. Two Americans to be released from Gaza in first phase of ceasefire deal Is the ceasefire deal enough?

Scott Applewhite) It’s been five months since Goldberg-Polin lost her son. Is the deal enough? 'Well, if this deal gets every single person home, it is enough,' she said. 'If this deal even saves one life according to Jewish tradition and actually to Islamic tradition, one life is one universe. So, if we can save one universe, three universes, 33 universes, that's wonderful, but we have an obligation, a moral, ethical obligation to save 98 universes.' Goldberg-Polin said she wants to see Trump stand by his promises. Ceasefire in Gaza begins, Hamas releases hostage names to Israel 'This deal could have happened back in the summer, and Hersh and three of the people who he was executed with would have been released. But I don't think anymore that it's healthy nor helpful to dwell on that,' Goldberg-Polin said. 'That was not the destiny for our six families of the beautiful six who were tortured, starved and murdered in that lightless, airless tunnel that wasn't meant to be.' She is looking ahead and not behind. 'I truly believe there is light ahead, and we all need to be looking toward the light.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/mother-of-son-killed-in-gaza-relieved-after-first-hostages-released/	2025-01-19T09:18:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/652d813a1663e5.11579913.jpeg?w=900
These notable inaugurations weren't held at the US Capitol. Here'...	(NEXSTAR) – For decades, Americans have gathered at the Capitol Building in Washington D.C. to watch the inauguration of the incoming president, but there are some noteworthy exceptions. While the first and second inaugurations of President George Washington were held outside of Washington D.C., they were still held in the nation's capital, which was in New York City in 1789, and, for Washington's second inauguration in 1793, in Philadelphia. The inauguration ceremony would move to Washington D.C. for Thomas Jefferson's 1801 oath of office, according to the National Library of Congress, but circumstances in subsequent years would force the inauguration to happen on a plane, at a farm and at a personal residence. Chester A. Arthur (1881) After just 200 days in office — a presidency historians called 'impactful,' if short — an 'embittered attorney' passed over for a consular post shot President James A. Garfield at a Washington, D.C. railroad station. Garfield would not survive his injuries, making his vice president, Chester A. Arthur, head of state. On Sept. 20, 1881, then-Vice President Arthur took the oath of office at his home in New York City, with New York Supreme Court Judge John R. Brady administering the proceedings, according to official accounts. The next day, he took his oath again, this time before a group of invited guests inside the vice president's room at the U.S. Capitol, according to UC Santa Barbara's 'The American Presidency Project.' Theodore Roosevelt (1901) The assassination of President William McKinley led to an inauguration ceremony hastily arranged at a home in Buffalo, New York, according to the National Park Service. McKinley was shot twice at point blank range while attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, on Sept. 6, 1901, according to White House historians. He would die eight days later. His vice president, Theodore Roosevelt, had been vacationing in New York's Adirondack Mountains when he received news that McKinley was gravely wounded. Roosevelt rushed to Buffalo, but by the time he arrived McKinley had died. Using a borrowed coat, pants, waistcoat, tie and leather shoes, Roosevelt decided to take the oath of office immediately so the country wouldn't experience a gap in leadership, according to the Park Service. 'I was so shocked by the terrible news brought to me last night and by the calamity which it entailed upon the country, as well as by personal sorrow which I feel, that I have had no time to think of plans for the future conduct of the office, which has been so suddenly and sadly thrust upon me,' Roosevelt said, according to a newspaper account from The Richmond Dispatch. The impromptu inauguration ceremony was held in the library of the house of Roosevelt's friend, Ansley Wilcox. The home is now open to the public as the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site. Calvin Coolidge (1923) The death of a sitting president brought about another unorthodox inauguration – this time in 1923 when Calvin Coolidge was sworn in using a family bible at the Vermont farmhouse in Plymouth Notch where he grew up. Coolidge was ushered into office after President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack in 1923 while in San Francisco, according to White House historians. After learning at 2:30 a.m. on August 3, 1923, that he was president, Coolidge's father, a notary public, had his son place his hand on the family Bible and swear the oath of office. The birthplace and childhood home of President Coolidge have since been preserved as a Vermont State Historic Site. Lyndon Johnson (1963) Roughly two hours after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a presidential motorcade in Dallas, Lyndon Johnson made history by becoming the only president to be inaugurated on an airplane. Johnson took the oath of office in the forward cabin of Air Force One in Dallas, according to a Library of Congress blog post. District Judge Sarah T. Hughes administered the oath, the first time a woman had done so in U.S. history. Photos show Johnson flanked by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy and his wife, Claudia 'Lady Bird' Johnson as he pledged to 'preserve, protect and defend The Constitution of the United States.' Five days later, he would address Congress and invoke Kennedy's vision for the country, calling for the passage of civil rights and tax legislation. Fast forwarding to Monday, President-elect Trump's inauguration ceremony is already making history. While the ceremony will happen at the Capitol, Trump announced that it will be held inside the Capitol Rotunda to shield people from the brutal cold forecast for that day. An indoor inauguration ceremony hasn't happened since President Reagan's in 1985, according to The Washington Post.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/these-notable-inaugurations-werent-held-at-the-us-capitol-heres-why/	2025-01-19T08:05:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-515466874-e1737143828756.jpg?w=799
First round of hostages released after ceasefire	(NewsNation) — More than 30 Israeli hostages have been released, signaling the start of Israel and Hamas' three-phase ceasefire deal. On Sunday, 33 Israeli hostages deemed 'humanitarian cases' — including all women, children and men over 50 years old — were released. Two American citizens, Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen, are on the list of hostages to be released in the first phase. Not all Americans are expected to be released Sunday, a U.S. official confirmed to NewsNation. French citizens Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi are also among the 33 hostages, according to French President Emmanuel Macron. Palestinians are expected to be able to return to their homes during the first phase. Names of hostages to be released The Times of Israel and Jerusalem Post reported the names of the 33 people set to be released in the deal. They are: Liri Albag Itzhik Elgarat Karina Ariev Ohad Ben-Ami Ariel Bibas Yarden Bibas Kfir Bibas Shiri Silberman Bibas Agam Berger Romi Gonen Danielle Gilboa Emily Damari Sagui Dekel-Chen Yair Horn Omer Wenkert Alexander Troufanov Arbel Yehud Ohad Yahalomi Eliya Cohen Or Levy Naama Levy Oded Lifshitz Gadi Moshe Moses Avera Mengistu Shlomo Mansur Keith Siegel Tsahi Idan Ofer Calderon Tal Shoham Doron Steinbrecher Omer Shem-Tov Hisham Al Sayed Eli Sharabi The process for releasing the remaining American hostages, including those who have died, is ongoing. The temporary ceasefire is set to become permanent during the second phase. The third phase will involve the return of dead hostages and reconstruction in Gaza. Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal reached Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a ceasefire deal to return Hamas-held hostages has been reached. Netanyahu said in a statement that the decision was made after 'examining all the political, security and humanitarian aspects, and with the understanding that the proposed transaction supports the achievement of the war’s goals.' Both President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have claimed credit for the deal. Two Americans to be released from Gaza in first phase of ceasefire deal The pause in fighting comes after more than a year of conflict and a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. Israel says 405 soldiers have been killed in the conflict, while Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed. It is not clear how many of those are combatants and how many are civilians.

TikTok app restored in US amid Trump assurances	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump plans to help the popular social media app TikTok stay in operation under his presidency. And now, it looks like it is powering back up despite a shutdown in the United States late Saturday night before the ban upheld by the Supreme Court took effect on Sunday. 'In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,' TikTok said in a statement on Sunday afternoon. 'We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.' Trump had said earlier Saturday that he would 'most likely' give TikTok a 90-day extension but left no one in any doubt via Truth Social on Sunday morning. The president-elect kept it short initially, writing on his social media platform: 'SAVE TIKTOK!' TikTok ban enforced: What happens now? Shortly after, Trump said he would not let the app 'stay' dark, saying he would issue an executive order on Monday to 'extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.' He proposed that the U.S. have 50% ownership in a 'joint venture.''By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up. Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions,' he wrote.TikTok began to restore service to U.S. users Sunday afternoon and credited Trump again for pushing to keep the app operational. 'In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,' TikTok said in a statement posted to the social platform X. 'We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,' it continued. Upon opening the app shortly late last night, users were greeted with a message: 'A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now.' 'We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!' the notice continued. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-AK, and Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-NE, posted a joint statement to X on Sunday morning stating that there is 'no legal basis' for an extension of any kind. Republicans set to give Trump big immigration win — while dividing Democrats 'We commend Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft for following the law and halting operations with ByteDance and TikTok, and we encourage other companies to do the same. The law, after all, risks ruinous bankruptcy for any company who violates it,' the statement read. 'Now that the law has taken effect, there is no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law's qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China. 'Only then will Americans be protected from the grave threat posed to their privacy and security by a communist-controlled TikTok.' Elon Musk, who has become close with Trump, posted to his own social media app X: 'I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech. That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but 𝕏 is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change.' In 2020, Trump tried to ban TikTok with an executive order, but two courts later shut his efforts down.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-save-tiktok-truth-social-shutdown/	2025-01-19T05:23:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2193195255.jpg?w=900
6 dramatic moments that shaped Biden’s presidency	President Biden’s single term in office will be marked by several moments that saw the White House take the spotlight. It began with the pandemic and a raucous State of the Union. Then there was the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and his handling of wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Ultimately, his age and questions about his stamina led to him dropping out of the 2024 race that ended his decades-long political career. Here are the top dramatic moments of Biden’s presidency. The raucous 2023 State of the Union During his 2023 State of the Union address, Biden sparred with Republican lawmakers over potential cuts to Social Security with a lively back-and-forth in the House chamber. He argued that 'some Republicans want Social Security and Medicare to sunset' and Republicans yelled back, 'no,' which prompted the president to ad-lib about people contacting his office if they don’t believe him. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) stood up and pointed her finger at Biden, and yelled 'liar.' Biden replied, 'I don’t think it’s a majority of you, I don’t even think it’s a significant' before more jeers from Republicans. 'So folks, as we all apparently agree, Social Security and Medicare is off the books now, right?' Biden said. 'Alright,' he added, with a thumbs-up, while Democrats and some Republicans stood up to cheer. Biden spent much of his speech urging unity to kick off the second half of his presidency following the 2022 midterm elections, but a back-and-forth inside the chamber with Republicans was the key takeaway from the address. At the time, it offered Biden and the White House an example of the president’s stamina, which Democrats used as an example when arguing Biden was fit enough to run for reelection. Ukraine speech In March 2022, Biden gave a fiery speech in Poland about his support for Ukraine a month after Russia’s invasion, during which he said that Russian President Vladimir Putin can’t remain in power. 'Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness. We will have a different future, a brighter future, rooted in democracy and principles, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom, and possibilities,' Biden said during a speech in front of the Polish presidential palace. 'For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.' The crowd he spoke to was made up of Polish citizens, Ukrainian refugees and government officials from both countries. But, his stern remarks led to a clean-up operation from the White House and officials at the time attempted to argue that Biden’s comments meant Putin should not have power outside of Russia. A year later, the president made a surprise trip to Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which involved a covert journey to the war-torn country on a 10-hour train ride from Poland to Kyiv. He is the only commander-in-chief to visit a war zone not controlled by U.S. forces. Afghanistan withdrawal The August 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan was a major bruise on Biden’s legacy early into his presidency and is seen as the start of a long and windy downfall for his presidency. When hectic images out of the Kabul airport surfaced, Americans at home could see how chaotic the troop removal was. Then, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members who were helping to evacuate people from the country. Biden was told to 'burn in hell' by a family member of one of the 13 fallen service members in Kabul when the remains of troops arrived at Dover Air Force Base. Biden was personally involved in solving problems at the Kabul airport during the withdrawal, directing people on the ground to find ways to get Afghans at risk out of the country, according to a recent book.The nature of the withdrawal and the several deaths led to investigations from House Republicans, who dropped a long-awaited report in September. It painted Biden as determined to leave the country but fumbling preparation, criticizing him for a rushed effort regardless of counsel from allies and advisers that led to unnecessary deaths. Hur report A March 2024 release of a transcript of special counsel Robert Hur’s two-day interview with Biden for his investigation into the president’s handling of classified materials gave Republicans and critics new ammunition to go after his age — and gave the public a window into the president’s fitness for office. Biden had not engaged in many press interviews, in print or television, so the Hur report released amid the president’s campaign for reelection fueled concerns over Biden’s age. Hur described the president as a 'well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory' in the report, which recommended no charges against Biden for his handling of classified documents. One of the most notable exchanges to come out of Hur’s final report was when the special counsel wrote that Biden struggled to remember key dates and details, including when his son Beau died. The White House and Biden himself went on the attack. Disastrous debate Biden and Trump had their first and only 2024 presidential debate on June 27, moderated by CNN. It began immediately with Biden fumbling his answers and giving confused looks. Biden’s disastrous performance, one that lasted 90 minutes, set off a series of events that led to him ultimately dropping his reelection bid. Biden’s voice was hoarse, he struggled to finish sentences and he tripped over his words while discussing key topics like border security and the economy. He appeared to lose his train of thought while mixing up the terms Medicare and COVID and Trump took aim at him for slurring his comments. His team at the time said that Biden had a cold to explain his slow start and raspy voice. Democratic operatives were the first to call for him to drop out, followed by the first Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), on July 2. Pressure then built from party leaders like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and former President Obama, who were in part behind urging lawmakers to publicly call for the president to drop out and warning Biden that he could lose to Trump. At the time of the debate, Biden was trailing Trump in the polls, especially in the pivotal battleground states. Drops reelection bid Once the flood gates were open with Democratic lawmakers calling for him to drop out, Biden was unable to stop the bleeding. In early July, he and his team spoke with Democratic congressional leadership and Democratic governors and he sat for an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos in an effort to show he can participate in unscripted events. He campaigned in Wisconsin, where he fought back against critics, and he gave a defiant interview on 'Morning Joe' to dare other Democrats to challenge him at the convention in August. At this time, the White House also faced a series of questions over visitor logs that showed a neurologist who specializes in Parkinson’s disease visited the campus several times in recent months. There was then a brief pause in calls from lawmakers for Biden to step down in the aftermath of the assassination attempt against Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania The president sat for another interview, with NBC’s Lester Holt, to defend the fallout from the debate. Days later, he tested positive for COVID-19 when he was campaigning in Las Vegas. While isolating at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., with a growing list of sitting Democrats urging him to drop out, Biden and a small circle of his closest advisers ultimately made the decision to do so. He announced he would no longer seek another four years in office on July 21 in a letter shared on X and then later endorsed Vice President Harris to be the party’s nominee Harris had just over 100 days to run against Trump and lost decisively in November.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/6-dramatic-moments-that-shaped-bidens-presidency/	2025-01-19T05:21:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Biden-regulations_010825_AP_Gerald-Herbert.jpg?w=900
Marco Rubio met with UAP whistleblower prior to Trump nomination	(NewsNation) — Whistleblower Jacob Barber tells NewsNation he not only knows of secret unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs, more commonly known as UFOs) retrieval programs in the government but has worked for one. For the past 30 years, Barber said he’s worked in both an official and unofficial capacity for the United States government and its partners in the intelligence community. 'We're in this rare opportunity in human history where it's very clear that we know that there are things flying in the sky that are unexplained and un-understood,' Barber told NewsNation investigative reporter Ross Coulthart exclusively. UAP whistleblower says UFO retrieval program exists: NewsNation exclusive During his time as a contracted helicopter pilot, he retrieved all kinds of downed craft, some of which he believes are of nonhuman origin. 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous,' Barber said. 'It was not human.' Barber claims he is 'uniquely providing information on' UAPs and wants the public to know what he knows. Witnesses at the congressional UAP hearings have been saying the same thing. 'The Pentagon, the intelligence community is treating us like children. It's time for us to know the truth about this. I think that we can handle it,' journalist Michael Shellenberger said during his testimony. Barber has been to Capitol Hill too. NewsNation confirmed that this past fall, he met with staffers for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is now President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state. 'I feel I was able to fill in gaps that have been there for a long time that no other whistleblower has been able to do,' Barber said. Rubio is expected to see a smooth confirmation from the Senate. Is Trump considering an overhaul of NASA? NewsNation checked Barber's records and confirmed he was an airman in the U.S. Air Force who worked as an aerospace mechanic in the late 1990s. He was also recruited into Air Force Special Operations, known as 'combat control.' He would eventually go on to work in a nonofficial capacity for the Defense Department and the intelligence community. In addition to reviewing his official documentation, NewsNation spoke with three former special operations soldiers who corroborated Barber’s credentials.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/marco-rubio-uap-whistleblower-jack-barber/	2025-01-18T18:01:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/FX6_0682.mp4.15_03_57_00.Still002000.png?w=900
UAP recovery video shows ‘egg-shaped’ object: Exclusive	(NewsNation) — NewsNation has obtained exclusive footage capturing an egg-shaped craft, recorded during a UAP retrieval operation. The egg resembles the UAP encountered by U.S. Navy fighters off the east coast of the U.S. in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects. NewsNation was told that the video was sent to the organization responsible for monitoring UAPs, and until now it has never been shown to the public, making a U.S. Air Force veteran's mission even more critical. What we know about UFOs from whistleblowers to secret programs Whistleblower Jake Barber believes he was involved in the recovery of alien technology while working for a long-rumored secret UFO retrieval program. When asked to describe the object, Barber told NewsNation's Ross Coulthart. 'I saw an egg, a white egg.' 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous,' Barber said. 'It was not human.' He added: 'It's inconsistent with anything I'd ever seen before. I can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.' Former Navy rear admiral supports UFO whistleblower claims Other whistleblowers, including Lue Elizondo and David Grusch, have alleged a secret government UFO program exists but Barber says he knows it’s true because he’s part of it. NewsNation has also obtained exclusive, never-before-seen video of one of these alleged UFO crash retrievals. That video and the full interviews will air in Saturday's special report 'Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower' at 8p/7c. Click here to find NewsNation's channel on your television.

Whistleblower reveals UAP retrieval program; object caught on vid...	(NewsNation) — In October 2024, an unknown man stepped out of the shadows, arriving in our nation’s capital to deliver an important message about what the public calls 'UFOs' and what the government calls 'UAPs,' or unidentified aerial phenomena. His name is Jacob Barber, and he says for the past 30 years, he’s worked in both an official and unofficial capacity for the United States government and its partners in the intelligence community. What he knows, and what he’s here to tell Congress, could change the world. 'We're in this rare opportunity in human history where it's very clear that we know that there are things flying in the sky that are unexplained and un-understood, and that's another one of the things that I'm uniquely providing information on,' Barber said. Others have alleged there’s a secret government UAP retrieval program that’s been going on for decades. People like David Grusch and Lue Elizondo. They say they’ve been told about it, they believe it exists, but they weren’t a part of it themselves. Barber, however, is different. He says he was part of that covert program that worked with alien spacecraft for years. NewsNation checked Barber's records and confirmed that he was an airman in the U.S. Air Force who worked as an aerospace mechanic in the late 1990s. He was also recruited into Air Force Special Operations, known as 'combat control.' He would eventually go on to work in a nonofficial capacity for the Defense Department and the intelligence community. Barber was a highly talented airplane mechanic who was deployed on a number of presidential support missions. But Barber was no ordinary mechanic. Being recruited into the Air Force’s Elite Combat Control unit meant he had a résumé that reads like something out of an action thriller: helicopter pilot, freefall parachutist, expert marksman and the recipient of a NATO top-secret security clearance — a legacy of his service in Bosnia, for which he won an award for heroism. What we know about UFOs from whistleblowers to secret programs In addition to reviewing his official documentation, NewsNation spoke with three former special operations soldiers who corroborated Barber’s credentials. One of his most fervent supporters is Col. John Blitch, a Renaissance warrior who also holds a doctorate in psychology, was a Delta Force sniper and is one of the few men to hold doomsday in his hands while commanding a nuclear weapons battalion. Blitch says he believes Barber’s claim wholeheartedly and that the U.S. has 'absolutely' recovered UAPs. For Barber, he says 'everything changed' for him around Sept. 11, 2001. 'I left the Air Force and was sent out to California at that time to begin establishing my cover basis as an independent contractor so that I can serve. What was coming down the line next for me was the path which led to the UAP subject,' said Barber. He says he was contracted as a helicopter pilot and was part of a team assigned to retrieve crashed aircraft at an undisclosed testing facility in the desert. 'A lot of the work we did was on what I call ‘the range,’ where the U.S. government and its private partners used to test all kinds of things — weapon systems and resilience to weapon systems of certain craft — and so you see a lot of exciting things,' said Barber. That’s where Barber said he began to see strange things. 'It's always interesting out there,' he said. 'Things come in and out of sight. Things disappear for a moment and reappear. Things seem to move very quickly. Things change color. They change shape.' Barber said his team recovered 'things that were exotic in nature.' 'We know they were classified craft,' he said. 'And we recovered them and took them back to where they go.' Barber’s first encounter with nonhuman intelligence 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous. It was not human,' he said. Barber said he got his first glimpse of 'not human' pretty quickly. 'I was a helicopter pilot, and I operate with a 150-to-200-foot-long line. So, I got within 150 feet of this object,' he said. That’s when he saw it. 'I saw an egg, a white egg,' he said. 'There was no engine. There was no thermal signature. I was operating at night when I finally came in to pick it up. So, I'm working under night vision goggles at the time, and it was quite clear. I flipped them up, flipped them down and looked at it a couple of different ways.' UAP whistleblower says UFO retrieval program exists: NewsNation exclusive Barber said the 'metallic, pearly white' object was about the size of an SUV. 'I can tell you that the reaction by my team … we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary,' he said. While Barber said he was never told the craft wasn’t human, he’s certain. 'I'll tell you that because of the reaction of my leadership structure and because of my experience working in that capacity, everyone involved was convinced that what we were seeing and dealing with was, in fact, exotic in its origin,' said Barber. 'I will also tell you that during this process, over the last couple of years, it's been confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP Task Force that what we were working with that night was, in fact, NHI (nonhuman intelligence), and it was not a unique experience.' Barber said he still doesn’t know what exactly the object was or where it may be housed now. 'It would be taken to a secure facility. But my role stops once I deliver it,' he said. That wasn’t Barber’s only brush with the unexplained. 'There was another object. One was the egg, the other is what I called an ‘eightgon.’ The eightgon was essentially a flying disc with what looked like eight delineated sections when looking down,' said Barber. 'And I can tell you what it looked like from looking down because that's primarily how I saw it. Because I'm a helicopter pilot. We did recoveries with the eightgons. There was more than one that made its way to the ground on this particular operation.' Barber said what happened next would be one of the most 'profound' experiences he’s had in his life. 'As I get closer to this site, I start feeling odd, I start feeling extremely emotional, and the closer I get, the more the emotion starts to overwhelm me,' he said. 'I feel this intense hybrid of sadness and happiness and beauty and song, and it was very disruptive to me because I had a very practical responsibility at the time to operate a helicopter in the mountains at night. And I began wondering, ‘What was wrong with me?’' Barber said it didn’t feel like an emotional breakdown but rather something entirely different. Drone sightings over Long Island airport spark concerns 'I felt like something connected with me,' he said. 'I felt like something had tuned in to me and my soul and was providing me some sense of guidance on what to do and how profound what I was doing was. It was so overwhelming that I began to cry.' Barber said he had never experienced a feeling like that before. 'It was a very feminine energy. I'll tell you that it felt like the spirit of God, but not in any masculine sense. And it wasn't like a soul; it was like a frequency that I was connected with. And whatever that force was since that night, it has stayed with me. And as crazy as this sounds, it's what's guiding me now, and it's what's providing protection for me.' Psionics Barber said his mission that night came from no accidental crash. He claims the UAP was summoned by a special team with special abilities: the 'Psionics.' Psionics, according to Barber, are people with a 'predisposition for extratemporal abilities and sensitivities,' more commonly referred to as people with alleged psychic powers. 'In the program, there was certainly a desire to explore the idea that perhaps UAP could be summoned, could be communicated with, could be controlled and could be persuaded to land, all by deploying people with psionic abilities to interface and communicate with the UAP,' said Barber. It’s something Barber said he has witnessed firsthand — and it looks a lot like meditation. He firmly believes psionics are capable of making a mental and spiritual connection to technology. It’s something another decorated Special Forces operator and colleague of Barber says he has witnessed too. 'I've had the pleasure of meeting multiple psionic assets,' said Don Paul Bales. 'I've seen them function. I know that they're capable of doing what they're doing.' It’s an established fact that the Pentagon has had an interest in psychic abilities — what it calls 'remote viewing' — for military purposes. The famed Project Stargate spent years studying the subject and despite the CIA’s official position that such studies yielded nothing. Despite the wonder of it all, Barber claims that he and his team have suffered serious injuries. Are UAPs bad for your health? Barber tells NewsNation that these encounters could come with a staggering cost to his health. 'We transported what we called ‘mystery boxes’ all the time,' he said. 'I have no idea … it could have been empty. It probably wasn't empty, but we don't know what was inside the boxes.' Barber and his team, however, were authorized to use 'lethal force' to protect their shipments should someone attempt to seize them. Former Navy rear admiral supports UFO whistleblower claims 'After this particular mission, I and everyone on my team got extremely sick, like physically ill, in the hospital,' he said. 'Within weeks after this, I lost every hair on my body, which they call alopecia. I also lost the skin on my arms, so the skin's actually falling off your body. I ended up developing a severe heart murmur that I'd never had before.' Last year, NewsNation’s Ross Coulthart introduced Barber to Stanford University immunology professor Dr. Garry Nolan. He’s been studying anomalous injuries among U.S. military personnel for years at the behest of the CIA. He agreed to review decades of Barber’s medical records. 'The acute injuries were obviously severe,' said Nolan. 'I mean, the report reads like a bit of a horror show, to be quite honest. To me, the first thing that came to mind was (Barber) was exposed to some kind of radiation.' To this day, Barber is nervous that he may have some form of cancer. Assuming Barber and his team were exposed to radiation emanating from the mysterious box they transported, could it have come from one of the many radioactive materials used regularly by the military? Barber doesn’t believe so. 'Can I put on my speculative hat for a minute? Okay, so if the Air Force, let's say, knew that what we were working with that night had any type of radiological signature, there's a whole set of processes that we're trained in on how to deal with that from a hazmat perspective and a containment perspective,' said Barber. 'And the fact that none of that was apparent that night tells me they didn't know what was in the box, and it got turned on or turned off. It leads me to believe, in hindsight all these years, that it may have been something of nonhuman origin or exotic. Let's just say exotic. It may have been something exotic that activated or still had some fallout.' Barber remains under Nolan’s care and is receiving proper evaluation and treatment. Stolen hard drives? It wasn’t just the U.S. government interested in using Barber’s expertise in UAPs and psionics; his skills were also needed by private companies involved in the program. His assignments soon took a turn from recovering UAPs to something more sinister. 'We were deployed on a particular task to recover what we call HVTs, or 'high-value targets.' Those high-value targets were Panasonic Toughbooks — the sensitive material that is on these Toughbooks has to do with sensor data, video that was illegally captured during some of these operations, some of which may be incriminating or classified now,' said Barber. What UAP witnesses recommend for congressional action Those laptops allegedly contained illegally obtained sensor data from the UAP recovery missions — sensor data that was illegally recorded during UAP recovery missions in violation of top-secret protocols. Barber said the company contracting him was determined to cover up the laptops’ existence. 'We recovered our first two Toughbooks. We got back to our base location and then went through them and took photographs. Then we discovered that the hard drives were missing,' he said. Barber said the next piece of intelligence that came through led them to a lake where they found the hard drives in a sealed steel container 25 feet underwater. 'Yeah, so someone's going through a lot of effort in order to hide these things,' he said. What began as a straightforward recovery mission proved to be anything but simple, and Barber says things soon took a nefarious turn. ‘Things got strange for me’ 'The very next time we went out, things got strange for me. My spidey senses, my intuition, was on high alert because our intel contact changed; the rhythm and style of our intel changed. As we got closer to the day in which we were going to deploy, intelligence kept changing. That raised my concern, but we ended up going anyway. When we got there, the HVTs were gone, and it was clear that shots had been fired,' said Barber. Barber was worried he was in significant danger and possibly being set up. 'We were being prepared for the one thing that we've always offered employers, and that is plausible deniability and that we were perhaps going to be the hidden hand that gets severed,' he said. Bales, a Special Forces veteran who was working on Barber’s team at the time, said he was concerned about a potential setup. 'Yes, setup is a mild term,' Bales said. 'The fact that people have lost their lives involved in this type of activity — and the links to which people have gone to suppress politically uncomfortable truths — is such that there is risk involved.' Barber was convinced his former employer, or someone pretending to be them, was determined to kill him. Barber was then on the hunt, using his skills and vast network of contacts to determine who was behind this shadow war fought over those missing hard drives. He says the trail led him right to the top. Last spring, Barber and his team were in Washington, D.C., conducting surveillance — and eventually confronting — one of their prime suspects. Where are UFOs coming from? 'I reached out to the director of security for the particular organization and a sister organization and set up a meeting with them because there were only two truths in my mind: Either they were complicit, or they were compromised,' he said. Barber said he got in contact with the head of security of his former private aerospace company and was basically told to 'forget it.' 'If he had any knowledge at all, it was clear he was trying to distance himself from it,' said Barber. 'He didn't want to get involved. But he did provide some advice on where we should go.' Barber was no closer to finding out who wanted him dead, but he knew that he was no longer doing the mission he signed up for when he first enlisted. To make it stop, he would need more than his handpicked team: He would need Congress, he would need funding, and he would need to go public. Startling UAP footage Barber says he has been recruiting individuals from within the program and forming a new team in coordination with government agencies. Barber would not name the various agencies he’s recruiting from but hopes to 'very soon.' His Skywatcher Team has already deployed on behalf of the U.S. government to investigate last year’s drone sightings on the East Coast. But before that, they were on the hunt for something even more elusive. In August of 2024, Barber and the Skywatcher Team conducted their own operation, with a psionic asset, to see if they could summon a UAP themselves. The team hoped to quietly gather evidence for Skywatcher but instead found themselves in danger once more. According to the team, Barber says a UAP psychic dogfight erupted in the sky above them. He believes the craft summoned by the team was warring with a rogue UAP piloted by an unknown entity attempting to intercept Skywatcher’s operation. 'And then things got a little weird,' said Barber. 'I'd say, four or five minutes into the operation, (the psionic) goes, ‘Something's going on, something's wrong. Get me out of here.’ And right about that time, our overwatch, Fred, looked up to the sky and saw a disc, a classic lenticular-shape disk.' What Fred Baker and the rest of the team saw was an oval egg — exactly like the one Barber had a previous encounter with. NewsNation has independently obtained video recorded during one of those UAP retrieval operations. The extraordinary footage shows a view from the belly of a helicopter retrieving one of those mysterious eggs. The egg resembles a UAP encountered by U.S. Navy fighters off the East Coast in 2015, suggesting a possible connection between these anomalous objects. Aside from releasing data and footage like this to the public, the Skywatcher Team feels it also has to push the federal government to disclose what it knows about the UAP program — and any criminal activity that may have been perpetrated over the years to keep it secret. NewsNation has confirmed that last fall, Barber met with staffers for U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, now Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state. 'I feel I was able to fill in gaps that have been there for a long time that no other whistleblower has been able to do,' Barber said of the meeting.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/hfr-uap-recovery-video-egg-shaped-object-exclusive/	2025-01-18T16:54:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/MainbarThumbnail.png?w=900
CDC urges hospitals to fast-track bird flu testing	Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that hospitals speed up testing people who are hospitalized with the flu for H5N1 bird flu. Health care workers in hospitals are urged to perform additional testing on patients hospitalized with influenza A — ideally within 24 hours of admission — to determine whether they have bird flu, according to a CDC advisory issued Thursday. The advisory comes amid concerns that cases of H5N1 avian influenza will sicken more people in the United States. CDC officials confirmed earlier this week that a second San Francisco child contracted bird flu last week, and earlier this month, a 65-year-old Louisiana man became the first person to die from the disease in the United States. FDA proposes putting nutrition labels on the front of packaged foods Principal Deputy Director for the CDC Nirav Shah said the agency is not changing its guidance out of growing concern about the H5N1 bird flu virus. Instead, officials want to speed up an already slow system that runs the risk of becoming backlogged amid a surge in seasonal flu cases. More than 100,000 people have been hospitalized with the flu since October, according to CDC data. Officials said they expect more than 200,000 flu hospitalizations by the end of the winter. There have been 67 confirmed bird flu cases across 10 states since March, with 40 of those cases linked to exposure from infected dairy cows. About two dozen of those cases have been linked to infected poultry and one to a backyard flock of birds. CDC officials said there is still a low risk of contracting H5N1 bird flu and a moderate pandemic risk stemming from the current age of the virus. There are different types of influenza, and H5N1 avian influenza is caused by a kind of influenza A virus, which is a category of flu that also includes most seasonal variants of the virus. Currently, hospitals will occasionally test for influenza in patients who appear to have the virus. Most influenza tests performed in hospitals or other health clinics can show if someone has a seasonal variant of the flu, but they cannot detect bird flu. Many hospitals will test for the H5N1 bird flu variant by sending bulk batches of influenza A samples to public health laboratories every few days, according to Shah. US to hit 2 million annual new cancer cases for the first time 'But this system can take time, and sometimes by the time the results of the subtyping are in, the patient may already be discharged,' said Shah. Hospitals that have the equipment to test for the H5N1 bird flu subtypes are urged to do so in house, as close to the time of admission as possible, particularly for patients with influenza in intensive care units. CDC officials said they are working with hospitals that cannot test for influenza subtypes to connect them with public laboratories that can test influenza samples in real time. The new guidance is one of a few new efforts from the Biden administration to prepare for an H5N1 bird flu pandemic before President-elect Donald Trump takes office later this month. Other efforts include the Department of Agriculture launching a national program to test for bird flu in untreated milk and $211 million in new funding to address emerging infectious diseases.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/cdc-bird-flu-testing-hospitals-cases/	2025-01-18T15:15:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP24228761933243-e1728569319445.jpg?w=900
First residents allowed back to communities ravaged by LA fires	LOS ANGELES (NewsNation) — Some residents affected by the Palisades Fire are being allowed to return home and begin taking the first steps on a long road to recovery. Repopulation began Friday afternoon in communities where evacuation orders had been issued and have since been downgraded by officials. As of early Saturday morning, the Palisades Fire was 43% contained. Since erupting on Jan. 7, it has scorched more than 23,000 acres, destroyed thousands of structures in the Pacific Palisades, and led to the deaths of ten people. How to build a budget to help you save in 2025 Simultaneously, the Eaton Fire, which was 73% contained as of publication, reduced thousands of structures to ash and rubble further east in the Altadena area after breaking out on the same day as the Palisades Fire. The fires have killed at least 27 people as of Friday and destroyed more than 10,000 structures in the residential enclaves of Pacific Palisades and Altadena. In the wake of the fires, rents have surged and uncertainty over insurance settlements has left some of the displaced in limbo. The Eaton and Palisades fires that erupted last week have collectively burned almost 4 square miles of highly dense parts of Los Angeles, more than double the urban acreage consumed by the region's Woolsey Fire in 2018, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the Silvis Lab at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. The National Weather Service in Los Angeles said Thursday it expects a 'much-needed break from the fire weather concerns' for the end of this week. However, 'next week is a concern,' the weather service said. 'While confident that we will NOT see a repeat of last week, dangerous fire weather conditions are expected,' the NWS in LA added. A moderate red-flag warning is predicted Monday and Tuesday, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said at a news conference.

Can Donald Trump save TikTok ahead of ban?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump could issue an executive order to save TikTok once he's in office, according to reports. In doing so, it would suspend the enforcement of the ban or sale for 60 to 90 days, buying the new administration time to find a solution. The Supreme Court ruled the social media app would be banned in the U.S. on Jan. 19, a day before Trump’s inauguration, unless the Chinese-owned company was sold. Trump tried to ban it during his first term as president but could be changing his tune on the popular video platform. Trump’s goal is 'perhaps to buy himself more time,' political contributor Dr. Lauren Wright, said on 'NewsNation Live Weekend.' 'That's what I would expect the executive order to do.' Lawmakers first proposed a ban in 2023, claiming it poses a national security threat, alleging the Chinese government could be spying on American users. What happens to TikTok and its users after ban starts Sunday? Wright, who teaches courses on the presidency and executive power at Princeton University, said she concurs the app threatens national security. 'Most Republicans agree on that, but young people are not persuaded by that argument. A lot of them found President Trump on the app, and a ton of small businesses use this, in addition to young people who just really like the app and their favorite social media platform,' Wright said. 'Trump sees the benefits of it, and I'm sure he's getting a lot of pressure from Republicans in Congress … about the very real security concerns.' She said it’s a 'no-brainer' that Trump would move to prevent the ban. In recent weeks, a new Chinese-owned app called RedNote has emerged in popularity. 'There are certainly other potential replacements that China is already flooding the marketplace with that would do the same thing,' Wright said.

Kevin O’Leary says he’s offering $20B cash for TikTok Trump issued an executive order in 2020, claiming the app was capturing mass amounts of information about Americans. A judge blocked this under the Biden administration. So can Trump successfully lift the ban this time? 'He certainly has leverage based on how many Americans voted for him last time around, (and) he has the understanding of the app because it helped his campaign a lot,' Wright said. 'He's reportedly said he has a soft spot for it for that reason,' Wright added. 'He has a direct line to the American people. But I really think if he wants TikTok to go away, all Republicans in government, and there are definitely some Democrats on this side of the argument too, need to articulate more clearly to the American people, what are the risks?

How to build a budget to help you save in 2025	(NewsNation) — With 2025 in full swing, there is no better time to start the year off with less financial stress. Thirty-six percent of Americans owe an average of $1,181 in credit card debt from holiday shopping. Crafting a tailored budget to your financial needs is essential to paying off what you owe -- and avoiding interest. NewsNation spoke with a personal financial expert about how to build a budget. How to save for retirement without a 401(k) 5-step process to building a budget Elizabeth Ayoola with NerdWallet, a financial services company, recommends following a five-step process. Determine your after-tax income. Add up all your income, including side gigs, after taxes to know how much you have to work with each month. Choose a budgeting system. This is not a one-size-fits-all, so try different methods to see which one works best for you. Track your progress. Some may struggle with consistency, so tracking your progress is important to achieve your financial goals. NerdWallet suggests using budgeting apps to track expenses. Automate your savings. Set up an automatic deduction from your checking account to your savings account. You can also automate your bills to deduct from your checking account without having to think about it every month. However, NerdWallet cautions against overdraft fees if you don't have enough in the account. Practice budget management. Update your budget as your lifestyle and financial situation change. If you get a new job, get married, lose income sources, or develop a new health condition, you should review and adjust your budget. List: Budgeting apps that can help you get on track Budgeting methods There are different budgeting methods to follow, from the zero-based budget to the pay-yourself-first budget. What works for one person may not work for the next. For the overspender, Ayoola recommends the zero-based budget system, which involves allocating every dollar to something until your balance reaches zero. 'This can be a little bit meticulous, but the good thing about this system is it really helps you to see where every single dollar is going,' Ayoola said. 'The goal is to get to zero at the end of the month and allocate every single dollar that you have, giving it a home, essentially. So it can be good to track spending expenses and see where all your money is going.' For the person who doesn't want to track every dollar: 'They may try the pay-yourself-first method,' Ayoola said. 'Essentially what this is is you pay yourself first. ... and you put money toward savings, and then you can essentially spend the rest on bills and whatever you want.' Other methods include the envelope system, the no-budget budget, and incremental budgeting. IRS to send $2.4B in unclaimed stimulus payments: Who is eligible? Budgeting tools 'Budgeting apps can be extremely helpful because they can help you do everything from start to finish when it relates to budgeting,' Ayoola said. 'If you know that you're more hands-off and you want something that's not too meticulous, you may also consider using budgeting apps.' Budgeting apps allow you to customize your budget, personalize it to your spending and lifestyle, track your net worth, review educational resources, and track expenses. 'These apps will link to your financial institutions for you to see all of your expenses in one place and also group them into different budgeting categories so you get a clearer picture of where all your money is going,' Ayoola said. NewsNation has compiled a list of budgeting apps you can find here.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/how-to-build-budget-save-2025/	2025-01-18T09:00:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/GettyImages-1403824678-e1717440328367.jpg?w=800
US to hit 2 million annual new cancer cases for the first time	(NewsNation) — The number of cancer cases is expected to cross the two million mark in 2024 — the first time — according to estimates by the American Cancer Society. Just over 2 million new cancer cases are projected from 2024 as more than 611,000 deaths occurred last year, according to the American Cancer Society's yearly report, published Friday in its medical journal 'CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.' That equates to 5,500 daily cancer diagnoses, as cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. overall. Although total cancer rates and death counts are down, the cancer incidence rates for common types are rising. Cancer incidence is the number of new cases per year, usually at a rate per 100,000 people, whereas the number of cancer cases is the total number in a population. 'Rising diagnoses of six of the most common cancers (breast, prostate, endometrial, pancreatic, kidney, and melanoma) threaten that longstanding downward trend,' the report said. Experts attribute the overall decline to reductions in smoking, earlier detection, and improved treatment options. Rising cases in younger people, women For a long time, cancer risk increased with age and was more likely to develop in people older than 65. Now, more people between the ages of 50 and 64 are being diagnosed. And for people younger than 50: 'Especially notable is the rise in colorectal cancer diagnoses among people younger than 50,' the study says. 'In the late 1990s, colorectal cancer was the fourth leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in this age group, and now, it is the first cause of cancer death in men younger than 50 and the second cause in women that age.' Women are facing an increase in cases, particularly with cervical cancer in women 30 to 44 years old and liver cancer, while racial disparities in diagnoses persist. Because it takes years to compile data, researchers still need to analyze how the pandemic affected cancer statistics. 'Researchers expect that the public health crisis of COVID-19 will be found to have delayed diagnoses and led to worse outcomes and more deaths,' researchers said. 'But it will take many years to parse out those effects.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/2-million-new-cases-cancer-2024/	2025-01-18T06:44:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/breast-cancer-AI-e1728571514261.jpg?w=665
Mother of woman killed in Eaton Fire sues California utility	NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The mother of a woman who was killed in the Los Angeles-area Eaton Fire on Friday sued Southern California Edison (SCE) in what may be the first death-related case brought against the electric utility in connection with the disaster. Multiple fires that began to burn and quickly spread across Los Angeles in strong Santa Ana wind gusts last week have killed more than two dozen people and charred some 40,000 acres of the second-largest U.S. metro area. While official investigators have not released the cause of the Eaton Fire near Pasadena, SCE has fielded a growing number of lawsuits accusing the utility's equipment of sparking the initial flames. Altadena resident Evelyn Cathirell sued SCE for wrongful death after the remains of her daughter, Evelyn 'Petey' McClendon were found in their shared home after it was destroyed by the blaze. State Farm cancels Super Bowl ad over California wildfires 'Petey's final hours were filled with chaos and panic,' said the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. 'The surroundings were straight out of a disaster movie with embers blowing freely in the wind, spot fires sprouting up in all directions, and a ceaseless wind.' Cathirell's legal action follows multiple lawsuits filed against SCE this week by residents and business owners with destroyed property. Late Thursday night, attorneys for a woman who lost her home in the Los Angeles-area Eaton Fire filed an emergency request for SCE to preserve additional electrical equipment to be examined in blaze investigations, court filings show. Evangeline Iglesias, who is among those suing SCE after her Altadena home was decimated in the inferno, asked the Los Angeles Superior Court to halt efforts by SCE to destroy some distribution lines and other electrical equipment in the burn area, according to court documents. A spokesperson with SCE said the company is focused on restoring power to affected areas. The company said it is aware of lawsuits related to the Eaton Fire and will review them. SCE, which is the main subsidiary of Edison International, previously said it preserved some power equipment to be examined in fire investigations. Wisdom of a California grandmother, 90, goes viral amid Eaton Fire tragedy The law firm representing Iglesias, Edelson PC, said in the filings that SCE told the firm in letters that it planned to imminently remove physical power infrastructure in the burn area unless told specifically which equipment to keep. That level of specificity, Edelson argued in its emergency request to the court, was unreasonable, 'particularly where most or all of that evidence is owned by SCE and where SCE has unique knowledge of the fire's origin and spread,' the filings showed. Multiple investigations into the cause of the Eaton and Palisades fires -- the two most destructive fires in California -- are ongoing.

Mass deportation raids could start in Chicago as soon as Tuesday:...	CHICAGO - Mass deportation raids threatened in Chicago could start as soon as Tuesday, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming border czar Tom Homan have threatened to begin the raids in Chicago in the lead up to the new administration. According to the Wall Street Journal, four people familiar with the planning said on the day after Trump's inauguration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will send 'between 100 and 200 officers' for the operation. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have said the city's law forbids CPD from coordinating with ICE. Chicago Public Schools, the Chicago Transit Authority, the Chicago Park District and Community Colleges of Chicago have all been directed not to allow ICE access into any of its buildings.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/mass-deportation-raids-could-start-in-chicago-as-soon-as-tuesday-report/	2025-01-18T05:39:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/generic-chicago-flag.jpg?w=900
Engineer Tedesco brothers use retrofitted RV to track UAPs	(NewsNation) — Two brothers are using a mobile field lab tricked out with various forms of technology as they seek out more answers about unidentified anomalous phenomena and other objects flying around the sky. John and Gerry Tedesco have transformed a retrofitted RV into a fully functional laboratory that tracks UAPs, aka UFOs, and other objects. The efforts come as lawmakers and U.S. residents remain frustrated by a lack of answers over a series of drone sightings around the country. The brothers use their lab, which they have called 'The Nightcrawler,' to collect data. SpaceX loses spacecraft after catching rocket booster at the launch pad in latest Starship test The Tedesco brothers are both engineers who use The Nightcrawler to report their findings on UAPs to the FBI. The two men were recently summoned to a Long Island airport where a series of drone sightings have been reported around the Francis Gabreski Airport in recent weeks. Watch NewsNation Saturday at 8 p.m. ET for 'HUNTING UFOS: THE CRASH RETRIEVAL' The brothers provided NewsNation with an exclusive look at the Nightcrawler rolling lab, which includes a specialized camera that includes a 36x optical zoom, night vision and other technology, including Geiger counters, G4 sensors and monitors. John Tedesco collects data inside The Nightcrawler, a mobile lab that is used to gather information about UAP. (Photo by Laura Ingle/NewsNation) The brothers use the technology to collect information about sightings they encounter. They then compare their data to information associated with commercial and private aircraft that may be in the air at the time. The Nightcrawler’s vertical system can reach up to 70,000 feet into the air to track any moving objects in the sky as well as any radioactive particles that may be in the air. The FBI is said to be looking into the data that the brothers have collected about recent sightings. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to deliver a report on drone sightings around the United States over the past few months shortly after taking office next week. Federal agencies had previously said that drones and other objects spotted in the sky were not the property of the U.S. military or other foreign governments.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/tedesco-brothers-rv-track-ufos/	2025-01-17T12:28:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Nightcrawler.jpg?w=900
Trump inauguration moved indoors due to bitter cold forecast	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration has been moved indoors after forecasts showed bitter cold weather expected for Monday, according to NewsNation's partner The Hill. Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance will take the oath of office in the Capitol Rotunda as opposed to the usual location at the west front of the Capitol. The forecast for Washington, D.C., shows an expected high in the low 20s on Monday, with a wind chill in the single digits. How to watch Trump’s inauguration on NewsNation That would make it the coldest inauguration on record since President Ronald Reagan in 1985. Reagan also moved his ceremony indoors because of the weather. The change means fewer people will be able to watch the ceremony, which will also be broadcast on TV. On Truth Social, Trump posted that the decision was made because he did not want anyone hurt or injured at the event and said the Capitol One Arena would be open for a live viewing and the inaugural parade. Trump indicated he would join the crowd at the arena for his planned victory rally following his swearing in.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-inauguration-indoors/	2025-01-17T09:19:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192426947.jpg?w=900
TikTok ban upheld by Supreme Court	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld a law banning TikTok in the United States by Jan. 19 unless it’s sold by Chinese parent company ByteDance. 'There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,' the Supreme Court opinion said. 'But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate petitioners’ First Amendment rights.' Early in arguments that lasted more than two and a half hours, Chief Justice John Roberts identified his 'main concern': TikTok’s ownership by China-based ByteDance and the parent company's requirement to cooperate with the Chinese government’s intelligence operations. President-elect Donald Trump has indicated he plans to help negotiate a deal to sell the social media platform from ByteDance after his inauguration on Monday. He asked the Supreme Court to pause the ban to give his administration time to negotiate a deal. President Joe Biden said this week he would not enforce a ban if it was upheld. A White House official told NewsNation Thursday, 'it will be up to the next administration to implement.' What happens to your TikTok account? TikTok users who already have the app on their phones will continue to have access to it. But new users won’t be able to download the app and existing ones will no longer be able to receive updates. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department has said in court filings. ByteDance and TikTok have been saying that divestment is not feasible, and that if the ban is allowed to go into effect, the app will effectively go dark. What happens if ByteDance can't find a buyer? If TikTok isn’t sold to an approved buyer, federal law would prohibit app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google, from offering the popular app. It would also bar internet hosting services from hosting TikTok. Why was TikTok facing a ban? President Joe Biden signed a law last April stating that ByteDance, which owns TikTok and is based in China, had a Jan. 19 deadline to sell the platform to an approved buyer or face being banned in the U.S. U.S. officials argued that the vast amounts of user data that TikTok collects, including sensitive information on viewing habits, could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. They were also concerned that the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who could pressure ByteDance to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect. TikTok, which sued the government last year over the law, has long denied it could be used as a tool of Beijing. The law came under a larger foreign aid package called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. TikTok has been fighting the law ever since. What did Tiktok say about the ban? TikTok and ByteDance — along with some content creators and users — argued the law violates constitutionally protected free speech rights. 'Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free speech case that matters to so many people,' lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. TikTok said in previous court briefs that a ban 'will silence the speech of applicants and the many Americans who use the platform to communicate about politics, commerce, arts and other matters of public concern.' The platform also contends it operates separately from its Chinese parent company and will not be subject to pressure from the American adversary. TikTok embattled in legal challenges all over the world With billions of users spanning the globe, concerns around TikTok have sparked in several countries. The company faces outright or partial bans in at least 20 nations, The New York Times reported. India banned the app in 2020 as tense relations with China exploded into combat along their shared border, the Times reported. Nepal took TikTok offline for nearly a year for not shutting down content the government described as hate speech, according to the Times.

Live updates: Kristi Noem has confirmation hearing; Senate holds ...	South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R), President-elect Trump's pick to head the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is set to appear for her confirmation hearing before a Senate panel on Friday. The purview of DHS involves immigration and federal emergency management — two hot-button topics. Immigration was one of Trump's signature issues and has been a top priority for Republicans in the new Congress, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which falls under DHS, has been in the spotlight since Hurricanes Helene and Milton devastated the southeastern U.S. and historic fires broke out in California. Also on Friday, the Senate is poised to vote on cloture for the Laken Riley Act, an immigration bill that has split Democrats. The measure, named after a Georgia college student who was killed in February by a man who had crossed into the U.S. without permission, would mandate federal detention of immigrants without legal status accused of theft, burglary and other related crimes. It is poised to be the first bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress, but has also earned the support of a number of Democrats in both chambers.

Armed California resident keeps watch for looters during wildfire...	(NewsNation) — Officials say they are making progress fighting the Los Angeles-area wildfires that started last week. However, problems still linger, not only for the thousands who have lost everything in the fires but also for those whose homes and businesses are still standing. About 82,000 people are under evacuation orders. Some California residents are defying those orders to protect their property, as well as that of their neighbors. Mel Gibson: They didn’t tell LA firefighters ‘the reservoir is empty’ One woman who talked to NewsNation said she is going into her neighbor's houses and cleaning out refrigerators so they won't smell. Altadena resident EveAnna Manley is keeping herself armed in an attempt to scare looters away. 'To be looting during a natural disaster is the lowest form of human behavior,' Manley said. Manley has a sign in her yard that warns: 'If you are looting, we are shooting.' What Project 2025 says about the first 180 days of a presidency 'It's a bit of a joke, but it's to remind someone — please don't just steal my freaking Starlink,' Manley told NewsNation. 'I know what the laws are as well, and I'm trying to make sure I'm always legal with my firearm control.' Authorities have made multiple looting arrests. On Monday, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman announced charges against 10 people in four separate incidents during the wildfires’ onset. Two people were charged with first-degree residential burglary, looting and grand theft for allegedly stealing over $200,000. Security has been heightened in the areas hit by wildfires, with people having to go through several different checkpoints to get through the area.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/wildfire-looting-residents-fight-back/	2025-01-16T11:56:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25010617515175.jpg?w=900
Drone sightings over Long Island airport spark concerns	(NewsNation) — Repeated drone sightings over a Long Island airport have prompted local law enforcement officials to turn to technology to determine who may be behind the mysterious objects. Officials have reported an unusually high number of drone sightings near Francis Gabreski Airport in Suffolk County in recent weeks. The sightings have taken place in highly sensitive areas, including over runways and in restricted air space. That has prompted investigators to turn to Dedrone, a highly sophisticated detection system that uses radar, cameras and artificial intelligence to pinpoint drones in real time. Watch NewsNation’s TV special: 'Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower' on Saturday, Jan. 18 at 8 p.m. ET. The airport is also home to the 106th Rescue Wing of the New York Air National Guard, which has increased concerns over the sightings. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to make drones a priority, saying he would issue a report on the objects soon after taking office. David Lynch, ‘Twin Peaks’ creator and filmmaker, dies at 78 Christopher Brockmeyer, the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office chief deputy chief, said officials will use the drone detection technology to get to the bottom of the sightings around the airport property. 'We’re going to use that information to potentially go and knock on doors and locate the actual operator and have a conversation as to what they’re doing,' Brockmeyer said. Officials from the airport and the Air National Guard told NewsNation some of the drone sightings involved objects as large as cars. On Christmas Day, officials reported 17 different sightings at the airport.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/drones-long-island-airport/	2025-01-16T11:29:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2189936159_bdca8a-e1734653140947.jpg?w=800
LAFD officials demand chief's ouster for wildfires mismanagement	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley has come under attack for her handling of the deadly wildfires. Several current and former LAFD battalion chiefs and administrators are calling for her retirement. In a scathing five-page letter obtained by NewsNation, the group puts the number of fatalities and the loss of property at Crowley’s feet and says her retirement 'would be best for the citizens of Los Angeles' and members of the department. Crowley told Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass that nearly $18 million in budget cuts within the department’s budget would affect its ability to respond to emergencies. In a memo to the mayor, Crowley wrote that the cuts 'has severely limited the department’s capacity to train for and respond to large-scale emergencies, including wildfires,' NBC Los Angeles reported. UAP whistleblower says UFO retrieval program exists: NewsNation exclusive An LAFD memo shows that Bass had requested an additional $48.8 million in budget cuts and indicated that 16 fire stations would need to close as part of the cuts. In the letter, which was sent on Monday, the group referred to Crowley’s comments regarding budget cuts as 'ill-advised and poorly timed' and took attention away from the efforts being made to control the wildfires, which have claimed at least 25 lives. 'When this incident is over, there will be time for investigations, after action reviews, reflection and of course, finger-pointing and the placement of blame, which apparently you have already started,' the letter states. FILE_4779Download Sources told NewsNation that a group of around 100 fire chiefs and former chiefs have received the letter, as has Crowley. The group wrote that the lack of experience, arrogance and inability to manage and lead the department contributed to its failings in dealing with the Palisades fire. The letter claims Crowley, who took office in March 2022, was aware of LAFD budget issues before taking office. The group of chiefs and former chiefs wrote that Crowley 'went along' with the budget cuts, which are now coming back to haunt the chief. The group blames Crowley for ignoring preventative systems and mechanisms previously put into place to deal with the current wildfires. The letter also blames Crowley for her lack of response in evacuating residents from residential neighborhoods affected by the fires. The chiefs wrote it is LAFD’s responsibility to support and assist with evacuation efforts. That did not happen in this case, the group wrote. 'As harsh as this sounds, the horrific truth is that you and your command staff own this terrible loss of light,' the letter states. Should Trump or Biden get credit for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire? John Knox, a 23-year LAFD veteran who was fired in 2021 for refusing to get a COVID-19 vaccine, told NewsNation that he describes the situation as a 'complete and utter lack of leadership.' Knox told NewsNation that a lack of pre-deployment when the city knew about the looming catastrophe was a failure on the chief’s part. He also said department officials suspended the testing of hydrants due to budget cuts. The letter criticizing the chief's leadership comes as questions continue as to why local reservoirs were empty as firefighters began to battle the sweeping fires. For instance, the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which is a 117-million-gallon water resource near Pacific Palisades was empty and undergoing renovations when the fires began. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for an investigation into why the reservoir was empty and told reporters that all of the region's reservoirs were operating and full. However, data from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power show that five other reservoirs are currently empty. The reservoir issue has already led to one lawsuit being filed, the Associated Press reported. The group also pointed to several critical issues under Crowley’s watch that the chief has ignored or failed to resolve. Among those were a lack of mechanics and support personnel; multiple lawsuits by females, minorities and command officers related to retaliation, harassment and hostile work environment issues; as well as extreme call load and work issues. The group said Crowley did nothing to put mechanisms in place that dealt with a large exodus of experienced fire service professionals. The letter states that more than 125 senior-level chief officers have retired in the last year. The letter states that many of those who left the department were veterans of wildfires who would have been beneficial in dealing with the current fires burning around Los Angeles County. 'While no one is saying that this fire could have been stopped, there is no doubt among all of us that if you had done things right and prepared the LAFD for an incident of this magnitude, fatalities would have been reduced, and property would have been saved,' the group wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/lafd-chief-attack-deadly-wildfires/	2025-01-16T09:33:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25011203379482.jpg?w=900
Live: Lawmakers host hearing over Trump's 'Remain in Mexico' poli...	(NewsNation) — Less than a week before President-elect Donald Trump is set to enter the White House for his second non-consecutive term, senate lawmakers are hosting a hearing about his controversial 'Remain in Mexico' immigration policy. During his first term, Trump implemented the policy, also called 'Migration Protection Protocols,' which required asylum seekers to stay in Mexico until their claims were processed. Democratic President Joe Biden's administration ended it in 2022. In the 2024 election, Trump said he plans to reinstate the 'Remain in Mexico' policy and start other hard-line immigration measures such as mass deportations. What Project 2025 says about the first 180 days of a presidency Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the Republican chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, also said he would immediately take up the matter. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing is set to start at 9 a.m. ET. Those testifying include Kenneth Cuccinelli, a former senior official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Andrew Arthur, a resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies and Adam Isacson, director of defense oversight for The Washington Office on Latin America. Lutheran Social Services, an immigration relief and refugee welcome agency, in a statement ahead of the hearing, criticized 'Remain in Mexico' as a stark departure from longstanding U.S. asylum procedures and protections. When it was in effect, 'families and individuals faced dangerous and unsafe conditions, including violence, exploitation, and inadequate essential services like healthcare, education, and housing' in northern Mexico, Lutheran Social Services said. The American Civil Liberties Union challenged 'Remain in Mexico,' saying it left 'vulnerable asylum seekers stranded.' 'The Migration Protection Protocols (MPP) policy was one of the most abusive and egregious of President Trump’s attacks on the asylum system, exposing vulnerable people to violence and murder,' the ACLU said in a statement to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. 'The policy was a boon to organized crime in Mexico and inflicted horrendous and lasting harm on asylum seekers, including their minor children.'

Two Americans to be released from Gaza in first phase of ceasefir...	Two Americans, Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen, are expected to be released as part of the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal that emerged Wednesday after being held for 15-months by Hamas since the start of the war in Gaza, according to a senior administration official. The deal includes the release or older males and those who were wounded on Oct. 7, of which Seigel and Dekel-Chen apply. The first phase in total includes the release of hostages that are women, elderly males and the sick and wounded. The third American being held by Hamas, Edan Alexander, is a 21-year-old American-Israeli who served in the IDF. Uniform soldiers are part of the second phase of the deal. The official said that they spoke with Alexander’s father last night and are committed to getting Edan out. 'We will see — and I don’t want to say until we actually see them — but Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen will come out in the first day and Edan will come out of Gaza, no doubt about it,' the official said. The administration is in regular contact with the families of the Americans being held and are 'committed' to getting them all out, whether they are living or not, according to the official. Wednesday’s deal largely aligns with a multiphase proposal President Biden first put forward in late May, which included the release of American hostages, remains of hostages who were killed and a surge in humanitarian assistance during the first phase. Biden had announced that Americans would be released in the initial six-week phase earlier on Wednesday. 'I’m proud to say Americans will be part of that hostage release in phase one as well, and the vice president and I cannot wait to welcome them home,' the president said. The official told reporters that the administration didn’t have full confidence that a deal would come together until 'late this afternoon' in the Middle East, saying that Hamas tried to bring up more issues this morning and the U.S. 'held the line on that.' The official also gave credit to President-elect Trump’s team for their help in the hostage deal negotiations, saying that Biden’s Mideast negotiator Brett McGurk and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff were both pivotal in the 'last 96 hours.' 'Steve and Brett have been talking regularly about the process, Brett has been keeping Steve fully informed,' the official said. When asked if the hostage deal would have happened if Trump wasn’t elected in November, noting that the first group of hostages will be released the day before Trump’s swearing in, officials said 'any negotiation, any breakthrough diplomacy, sometimes we just need a deadline.' Trump on Wednesday claimed the credit for himself, saying a deal would not have happened without his victory in November. Meanwhile, Biden replied, 'Is that a joke?' when asked by a reporter whether he or Trump would get credit for the deal.

Families of hostages grateful but cautious about ceasefire deal	(NewsNation) — With the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal expected to begin Sunday, the families of hostages are hoping to once again see their loved ones in front of them. Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire deal that could see the first release of American hostages within days, as part of a broader agreement to free 33 captives during a 42-day pause in fighting. The deal, which awaits approval from Israel's security Cabinet in a Thursday vote, would include the release of two Americans — Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen — in its first phase, according to a senior administration official. Israel, Hamas reach three-phase ceasefire deal Of the seven Americans believed held by Hamas, only three are presumed alive. The third, 21-year-old American-Israeli Edan Alexander, a former IDF soldier, would be part of a second phase of releases. In exchange, Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, following a pattern seen in previous hostage negotiations. Phase three calls for the return of the bodies of remaining hostages and the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which is largely devastated and faces decades of rebuilding. After 466 days in captivity, it remains unclear how many of the approximately 100 hostages still held by Hamas are alive. Officials estimate more than a third of all hostages taken during the Oct. 7 attack have died. For families of the hostages, the wait continues. While some may soon reunite with their loved ones, others face the grim possibility of receiving confirmation of deaths during captivity. Trump and Biden both claim credit for Israel-Hamas ceasefire: Who deserves it? Hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen to be released in ceasefire first phase Jonathan Dekel-Chen joins NewsNation to discuss the upcoming ceasefire in Gaza, aimed at clearing the way for dozens of hostages to be released. His 36-year-old son, Sagui Dekel-Chen, an American citizen, was taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7 and is believed to still be alive.

They have had no word about him whatsoever in the month since their nightmare, and that of the other hostage families, began on October 7. Biden, who has pledged solid support for Israel in its war against Hamas, showed compassion as he spoke to the families for more than an hour and said he is determined to secure the release of the hostages, Ronen Neutra said.

Various commemorations are taking place around Israel to mark the anniversary of the Hamas attacks in Israel. On October 7, 2023, members of Hamas mounted a series of attacks and raids on Israeli citizens in the Gaza Envelope border area of Israel. 251 Israelis and foreigners were kidnapped with nearly 100 still unaccounted for and 1139 people were killed.

On Sunday, Sept. 1, 2024, the Hostages Families Forum announced their deaths while in Hamas captivity. (The Hostages Families Forum via AP) Jonathan Dekel-Chen revealed his son Sagui, held captive since Oct. 7, may not even know he has a new daughter, born two months after his capture. 'I simply do not know if Sagui even knows that his family survived the massacre,' Dekel-Chen said Wednesday on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' His 36-year-old son is among those expected to be freed in the first phase of releases. 'I will feel joy when Sagui is able to embrace his little girls,' Dekel-Chen said. The last confirmed proof of life for Sagui came over a year ago, when released hostages reported briefly encountering him wounded but alive in Hamas tunnels beneath Gaza. 'When he does emerge from that ambulance, we will embrace him in all meanings of the word and help him in all ways necessary to rebuild his life,' Dekel-Chen said while tempering his optimism about his son's condition after 466 days in captivity. While grateful for his son's expected release, Dekel-Chen said that many hostages remain in what he called 'hell holes' under Gaza, including 29 from his own Kibbutz Nir Oz. Some of those captives, he learned, were subsequently killed by Hamas. 'We cannot leave a single hostage behind,' he said. What happens to the hostages in Gaza after ceasefire deal? Omer Neutra's parents hope for a 'proper burial' The parents of a deceased American hostage called the ceasefire 'a deal with the devil' while supporting the necessary compromise to bring home the remaining captives. 'This is not a good deal,' said Ronen Neutra, whose 21-year-old son Omer was confirmed dead after 422 days in captivity. 'But on October 7, 2023, they took 250 people out of their beds… and unfortunately, we have to do a deal with the devil.' Omer Neutra, a first responder who rushed to defend Israeli villages during the October attacks, was among the 98 hostages still in Gaza. His parents learned of his death last month after advocating for his release at the Republican National Convention and in meetings with President Joe Biden. His mother, Orna Neutra, described 'mixed emotions' about the agreement. While supporting the deal, the Neutras now fight for a different outcome — the return of their son's body for 'proper burial.' The parents praised the bipartisan cooperation between the outgoing Biden administration and President-elect Donald Trump's team in securing the agreement. 'There's no daylight between the two teams,' Orna Neutra said, noting both administrations helped push the deal forward.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/families-hostages-ceasefire-deal-reaction/	2025-01-15T16:41:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot_61eeee.jpg?w=900
Whistleblower says UFO retrieval program exists: NewsNation exclu...	(NewsNation) — A U.S. Air Force veteran believes he was involved in the recovery of alien technology while working for a long-rumored secret UFO retrieval program. In an exclusive interview with NewsNation, whistleblower Jake Barber said he has contracted as a helicopter pilot to retrieve all kinds of downed craft, some of which he believes are of nonhuman origin. 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous,' Barber told NewsNation's Ross Coulthart. 'It was not human.' Former Navy rear admiral supports UFO whistleblower claims Watch the full interview during NewsNation's TV special: 'Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower' on Saturday, Jan. 18 at 8 p.m. ET. When asked to describe the object, Barber said: 'I saw an egg, a white egg.' He added: 'It's inconsistent with anything I'd ever seen before. I can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.' Other whstleblowers, including Lue Elizondo and David Grusch, have alleged a secret government UFO program exists but Barber says he knows it's true because he's part of it. What we know about UFOs from whistleblowers to secret programs 'Over the last couple years, it's been confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP task force that what we were working with that night was, in fact, NHI (nonhuman intelligence) and it was not a unique experience,' Barber said. Three high-level military veterans are backing up Barber's story, on the record and on-camera to NewsNation.

Los Angeles fire captain loses home to Eaton Fire	LOS ANGELES (KTLA) — A man tasked with protecting the Los Angeles area from raging wildfires now ranks among those who have lost their homes and everything inside. Capt. Al Hugo, a 32-year veteran of the Los Angeles Fire Department, lived in his Altadena home with his wife, Carmen, for 20 years. As the Eaton Fire ignited on Jan. 7, the fast-moving blaze eventually reached Hugo’s neighborhood. LA-area wildfires: At least 25 have died as winds strengthen He and his wife quickly evacuated with their four dogs, leaving their belongings behind. Although wildfires have threatened his community before, he said the flames had never reached his neighborhood until now. The next day, the family learned their home was completely destroyed by the fire. 'It was surreal,' Hugo told Nexstar's KTLA. 'It's painful because you’ve [spent] a lot of time there. I’ve been there for 20 years so I got a lot of memories and a lot of mementos that we lost, but I’m just thankful that my family and my pets are good.'

As of Wednesday, the Eaton Fire remains at 14,117 acres with 45% containment.

Should Trump or Biden get credit for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump celebrated the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal on Wednesday and said it wouldn't have happened if not for his win in the 2024 election. 'This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. 'I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.' Israel-Hamas hostage deal The deal, which will see 33 Israeli hostages freed and pause the war, comes after more than 15 months of fighting. Israel, Hamas reach three-phase ceasefire deal In his post, Trump said his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue 'to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven.' Witkoff had joined Biden’s Mideast adviser Brett McGurk for the recent round of talks in Doha, the Qatari capital. A senior U.S. official described McGurk and Witkoff’s coordination as a fruitful partnership, according to The Associated Press. Meanwhile, outgoing President Joe Biden emphasized his role in getting the deal done, telling reporters: 'This is the exact framework of the deal I proposed back in May.' When asked how much he credits the Trump team, Biden said: 'I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice because that's what American presidents do.' Israel-Hamas ceasefire comes days before Trump's inauguration The ceasefire comes just days before Trump is set to begin his second term. Last week, Trump warned all hell would break loose if Hamas didn't release the Israeli hostages before his inauguration, though it's unclear how much that threat tipped the scale. What happens to Israeli hostages now? One diplomat who was briefed on the negotiations did credit progress in the talks, in part, to Trump's influence, saying it was 'the first time there has been real pressure on the Israeli side to accept a deal,' according to the Washington Post. The New York Times said Trump's election win and his team's work were, according to multiple people, a factor in the deal getting done. Jonathan Panikoff, director of the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council, told the AP the deal shows how powerful foreign policy can be when it's bipartisan. 'Both the outgoing and incoming administration deserve credit for this deal and it would’ve been far less likely to happen without both pushing for it,' he said. Biden cheered the agreement in remarks Wednesday, chalking it up to 'dogged and painstaking American diplomacy.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Ceasefire deal timeline: What officials say will happen next	(NewsNation) —A ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was reached Wednesday after more than a year of negotiations and is expected to be carried out in three phases beginning Sunday. Qatar, acting as an intermediary, and President Joe Biden heavily pushed the two sides to reach an agreement that would secure the release of hostages held by Hamas. 'This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much-needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity,' Biden said in a statement. What happens to Israeli hostages now? Biden said the ceasefire deal was the same one he introduced to both sides in May 2024. 'The road to this deal was not easy,' Biden said during a news conference announcing the deal. 'This is one of the toughest negotiations I’ve ever experienced.' President-elect Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Qatar for discussions. Trump celebrated the deal on Truth Social, taking credit for its success and saying it would not have happened if he had not won in November. Phase one of the ceasefire deal Phase one of the ceasefire deal is expected to take place over a six-week timeframe. Thirty-three Israeli hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas in 2023 will be returned under the first phase of the deal. These hostages include women, children, people over the age of 50 and the sick or injured, which were given special focus under the deal which passed after more than a year of negotiations, Qatar’s Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said Wednesday. In return, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The remaining American hostages are also expected to be released in the initial phase of the ceasefire deal, a U.S. official confirmed to NewsNation. Israel, Hamas reach three-phase ceasefire deal Phase one also includes the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza. Palestinian civilians will be allowed to return to their neighborhoods in all areas of Gaza, and humanitarian aid will begin to flow into the Strip, Biden said. 'The surge in humanitarian assistance into Gaza will begin, and innocent people can have greater access to these vital supplies,' he said. Hamas and Israel will begin negotiations for phase two in these six weeks, he added. There are still a number of negotiations that need to take place before phase two can be mapped out, but if the negotiations take longer than six weeks, the ceasefire will continue as long as talks are ongoing, Biden said. Phase two of the ceasefire deal Biden said phase two would be a 'permanent end of the war,' where a temporary ceasefire would become a permanent one. Phase two will consist of the return of the remaining living Israeli hostages, including male soldiers. All remaining Israeli forces would also withdraw from Gaza under this phase, he said. Phase three of the ceasefire deal The third phase is expected to address the handing over of the remaining bodies of dead hostages and the start of Gaza’s reconstruction, according to Biden.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ceasefire-deal-timeline/	2025-01-15T12:04:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/bidenjoe_112624gn16_w.jpg?w=900
Details need to be addressed in Israel-Hamas ceasefire	(NewsNation) — Negotiations involving a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have been ongoing for more than a year, but nearing an actual agreement has never been this close to bringing 15 months of fighting to an end. But before a ceasefire is officially declared, several details still need to be addressed, Ret. U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen, Richard Newton told NewsNation. 'I believe we’re on a path to have at least an exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, but nothing is final at this point,' Newton, a senior NewsNation contributor, said on Wednesday. What happens to Israeli hostages now? There are still several implementation details to be ironed out before the ceasefire is finalized. This will include exactly how Israeli hostages will be released as well as how Palestinians are released from jail and where they will be sent, Newton said. Other issues include the flow of humanitarian aid and who will control that flow into Gaza. 'There are many details we need to have sorted out here,' Newton said, adding, 'But we are still a long way out from the end of what will be, at least through the first phase of what we think is going to be a deal.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other government officials still need to sign off on the ceasefire. Newton said that Netanyahu is 'setting the conditions' for the ceasefire, but that Monday’s inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump may have emboldened the prime minister to act. 'The emphasis is on Israel and the emphasis is on who’s leading this effort — not Hamas, but Prime Minister Netanyahu,' Newton said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/details-addressed-israel-hamas-ceasefire/	2025-01-15T11:44:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6771c6185c5905.15866153.jpeg?w=900
Biden to outline accomplishments in farewell address	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden is expected to outline the accomplishments of his four years in the White House during a farewell address to the nation Wednesday night. The reported ceasefire announced between Israel and Hamas will most likely change the tenor of the prime-time address, on which White House officials said Biden will work until the last minute to finalize. The speech was originally set to reflect on Biden’s presidency as well as the moment in which the country finds itself as President-elect Donald Trump takes office next week. White House officials said the address will not include 'a laundry list' of Biden’s accomplishments as president but rather an overview of the time since Biden took office in 2021. What happens to Israeli hostages now? In a letter released Wednesday morning, Biden said the country has the strongest economy in the world after his administration created a record 16.6 million jobs. He also said inflation continues to come down while the racial cap is the lowest it has been in 20 years. 'I ran for president because I believed that the soul of America was at stake,' Biden wrote. 'The very nature of who we are was at stake. And, that’s still the case.' Biden called serving the U.S. for more than 50 years the 'privilege of my life' and wrote he has 'been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people.' 'History is in your hands,' Biden wrote. 'The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. We just have to keep the faith and remember who we are. We are the United States of America, and there is simply nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.' What to make of the final polling of the Biden years Biden is also expected to address his future plans and those of the Democratic Party, which lost control of the U.S. Senate as well as the White House in November. The Republicans also maintain control of the U.S. House as Trump begins his second term as president. Biden is considering taking additional actions as president before Trump assumes control of the White House on Monday. Biden, who commuted about 1,500 sentences in December, is said to be considering more pardons and executive orders, which could be difficult for Trump to undo once he takes office. Biden issued 39 presidential pardons to Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes; several were issued to people who have already been released from prison. Among the pardons issued was one for Biden’s son, Hunter, who the president previously said he would not pardon.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-accomplishments-farewell-address/	2025-01-15T11:02:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192231820.jpg?w=900
Malibu mayor: No expedited re-entry permits for evacuation zones	(NewsNation) — Malibu Mayor Doug Stewart on Facebook debunked a false claim that the city is giving out expedited re-entry permits into evacuation zones as wildfires continue blazing in southern California. At least 25 people have died in the fires that started last week, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. Red flag warnings were issued by the National Weather Service because high winds are expected to cause extreme fire weather. About 88,000 people are under evacuation orders because of the fires. What Trump said he will do on Day 1 'I want to assure you that city staff have been working around the clock alongside our partners to respond to this historic and unprecedented event,' Stewart said in a letter to Malibu residents. This work includes inspecting infrastructure, clearing streets of debris, assisting with damage assessments and stabilizing the area to pave the way for safe re-entry and rebuilding, Stewart said. 'We ask for your patience and understanding as our teams — along with law enforcement, fire crews, and utility providers — continue this vital work,' Stewart said. While some residents have hired private contractors who requested access to the evacuation zones, Stewart said they are not permitted to go in them at this time. 'We urge all residents to adhere to the evacuation orders for their safety and the safety of the crews working in these areas,' he said. 'To our residents, I want to acknowledge the frustration and hardship you are experiencing. Many of you are understandably anxious to return to your homes. We hear you, and we are doing everything in our power to make that happen as quickly and safely as possible.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/malibu-mayor-no-re-entry-permits-evacuation-zones/	2025-01-15T10:39:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25013163967406.jpg?w=900
What happens to Israeli hostages now?	(NewsNation) — Thirty-three Israeli hostages considered 'humanitarian cases' who were kidnapped by Hamas in 2023 will be returned under the first phase of a reported ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. These hostages include women, children, people over the age of 50 and the sick or injured which were given special focus under the deal which reportedly passed after more than a year of negotiations, according to Reuters .

Release of Israeli hostages Negotiations on the second phase of releases will begin by the 16th day of phase one and are expected to include the release of all remaining hostages, a permanent truce and complete Israeli exit from Gaza, the outlet reported. The third phase is expected to address the handing over of the remaining bodies of dead hostages and the start of Gaza's reconstruction, according to Reuters. While a deal has been signed it is yet to be approved by Israel’s Cabinet and is likely to be challenged before the country’s Supreme Court. Israel, Hamas agree to ceasefire deal The Israeli Cabinet will vote on the ceasefire deal on Thursday, with a majority of ministers expected to approve the deal, according to Reuters. War between Israel and Hamas On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas took approximately 240 civilians and soldiers hostage during the attack in Southern Israel. Hamas released around 100 hostages during a negotiated pause in fighting. A total of 70 hostages have died, the Wall Street Journal reported. Human rights organizations have warned of a humanitarian disaster in Gaza, which has long been blockaded with civilians unable to flee the area. Instead, they are displaced to different parts of the Gaza Strip as Israel has announced evacuation orders in cities and towns prior to military strikes. Israel says 405 soldiers have been killed in the conflict, while Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed. It is not clear how many of those are combatants and how many are civilians.
