Addressing the dangers of the presidency, Trump stated, 'Only consequential presidents get shot at,' suggesting the attempts on his life validate his impact. There was an electric atmosphere inside the standing-room-only sports arena, where thousands of Trump supporters greeted the former president with a deafening roar when he took the stage. The overflowing crowd interrupted Trump’s discussion with Sanders with chants of 'God bless Trump!' and 'Fight, fight, fight' at various times. 'A lot of love in this room,' Trump remarked. Trump said he had a call with Vice President Kamala Harris and described it as 'very, very nice.' He did not provide details about the conversation's content. Trump, speaking for an hour, said, 'Secret Service did a hell of a job. Now, they do need more people, and they've been complaining about that for a long time.' Chris Cuomo called Donald Trump after second attempt on his life 'It’s a dangerous business, however, being president. It’s a little bit dangerous,' he said. Trump predicted dire consequences for the auto industry if he loses the upcoming election, claiming, 'If a tragedy happens and we don't win, there will be zero car jobs.' Throughout the town hall, he praised women's intelligence while recounting how a female witness spotted an armed individual.

Who else could be charged in the Diddy investigation?	(NewsNation) — A federal prosecutor said more people may be charged in connection to a federal indictment against Sean 'Diddy' Combs, saying that 'nothing is off the table.' 'We are not done,' U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said during a news conference Tuesday where he shared more details on Combs’ indictment. 'I can't take anything off the table. Anything is possible,' he said in response to a question about the possibility of more charges and defendants. 'Our investigation is very active and ongoing … developments are certainly foreseeable.' Combs was arrested in New York Monday and faces federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and transportation to engage in prostitution. 'We are disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution of Mr. Combs by the U.S. Attorney’s Office,' Combs attorney Marc Agnifilo said in a statement Monday. Timeline: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits Prosecutors allege Combs used the resources of his music empire to create 'a criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.' They also accuse him of having used his employees to help him engage in these activities. 'I definitely think more is coming,' Richard Schoenstein, a trial attorney and legal analyst, told NewsNation. 'The indictment said he did all these things in conjunction with other people, but it doesn’t name them, it does not name the co-conspirators … so there has to be more down the road.' 'It will be interesting to see who will become a defendant, who becomes a witness and who comes forward as a witness cooperating,' he said. Schoenstein added that Combs’ associates should be very concerned right now. 'The indictment alleges his associates helped him commit heinous crimes,' he said. 'If you're one of those associates, you have a lot to think about' on how you will go about participating in this investigation.		2024-09-17T10:27:59-07:00	
Titan submersible CEO was 'a murderer': Titanic expedition leader	(NewsNation) — The founder of OceanGate, who died in the Titan submersible implosion, was called a 'murderer' by a Titanic expedition leader after testimony revealed new details about the implosion. G. Michael Harris, founder of RMS Titanic, said Tuesday on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush was 'a complete, unequivocal narcissist, and in the end, a murderer.' 'He killed those people. He knew better,' Harris said, referring to the five individuals who died when the Titan imploded during a dive to the Titanic wreckage in June 2023. Titan implosion hearing: Key witness testifies on Day 2 The comments came as the U.S. Coast Guard conducted hearings into the disaster. Former OceanGate employees have testified about alleged mismanagement and safety lapses in the Titan's construction. One employee described Rush as more focused on making money than science, saying they had 'no confidence whatsoever' in the way the submersible was being built. Harris claimed that industry professionals had long harbored concerns about the Titan. 'We all knew about this. We all tried to reach out to him,' he said. The expedition leader also questioned why regulatory agencies hadn't intervened, calling it 'the biggest clown show in history.' Diddy indictment: Music mogul denied bail following indictment The hearings, which began this week, are expected to continue for 10 days. They include testimony from former employees and examinations of OceanGate's practices. Coast Guard investigators have released new evidence, including a photo of the Titan's wreckage on the ocean floor and an animation of its final journey. The submersible's last communication, sent moments before losing contact, indicated it was 'dropping two weights.' Harris speculated that this action was likely to slow the Titan's descent rather than attempt an emergency ascent as previously thought. He added that the victims likely died instantly.		2024-09-17T16:11:28-07:00	
Kamala Harris criticizes Trump rhetoric in NABJ interview	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris took questions Tuesday from the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia and addressed the controversial things her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has said on various issues. Among other topics, she talked about the threats of violence residents of the city of Springfield, Ohio, have faced after Trump made false claims about immigrants there kidnapping and eating people's pets. 5 takeaways from Harris’s interview with NABJ Saying 'there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe,' Harris also referenced Project 2025, which conservative organizations created as a blueprint for the next Republican presidential administration, as well as GOP-led efforts to restrict abortion access. Addressing the second assassination attempt against Trump, Harris said in the NABJ interview she feels safe under Secret Service protection. While she spoke with Trump on Tuesday and said he was glad he's safe, she added that his rhetoric on certain topics should be disqualifying. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs arrested in New York after indictment 'When you have that kind of microphone in front of you, you really ought to understand at a deep level that your words have meaning,' Harris said. 'Let’s turn the page and chart a new way forward and say you can’t have that microphone again.' Ashley Davis, a former official in the George W. Bush White House, and NewsNation political contributors A. Scott Bolden, Kurt Bardella and Denise Gitsham joined 'The Hill on NewsNation' to discuss harmful rhetoric. Bardella, a Democratic strategist, called out JD Vance for his misinformation about Haitian immigrants, pointing the finger at Republicans. 'This is not a both-sides issue,' he said. 'You don't get to lecture Democrats about rhetoric when you are the one advancing dangerous and disproven claims in Springfield that is resulting in people not being able to go to school because of bomb threats,' Bardella added. Davis countered that both sides have a responsibility to tone down their talking points, adding, 'I refuse to go on TV shows that argue, and we don't usually do this. I don't think it's right. ... I will never criticize Joe Biden, Barack Obama as a sitting president.' The economy and the Israel-Hamas war were also mentioned during the discussion. While Harris didn't say specifically how she would end it, she said the hostages need to come home, and there needs to be a path toward peace for Palestinians and Israel. This interview comes as the Harris campaign is spending time reaching out to both Black and young voters. Polls indicate that they feel energized about the Harris nomination. When surveyed by the NAACP, 78% of Black people said they felt as excited as they did when former President Barack Obama first ran for office. About 56% said they felt even more excited, NewsNation partner The Hill reports. Still, that same poll showed that over a quarter of younger Black men said they would support Harris' opponent, Republican Donald Trump, in this year's U.S. presidential election. How Americans can register to vote ahead of Election Day When it comes to reaching out to younger voters, the Harris-Walz campaign and Democratic National Convention are launching a weeklong effort to engage them. This includes going to college campuses. Obama even took to TikTok to talk with social media influencers about the importance of getting out there to register and vote. Pennsylvania, where the NABJ conference is being held, is also important to candidates running in the presidential election. Decision Desk HQ polling shows that Harris holds a small lead of 48.1% to Trump's 47.4%, making it a tight race.
