Trump’s ‘gold card’ can work ‘in theory’: Immigration attorney	(NewsNation) — A San Diego-based immigration attorney tells NewsNation that President Donald Trump’s idea for a U.S. investor visa 'gold card' could work because it would function much like the existing EB5 investor visa. 'In theory, it can really work because the EB5 program works,' said Saman Nasseri. 'Now, this will just expand on it and bring bigger businesses, bigger people.' While Trump said the new system has 'never been done before, anything like this,' the broad strokes of what was announced sound similar to the existing EB5 investor program, albeit with a higher price tag. Social Security to increase monthly benefits for millions Trump said he’d like the gold card rolled out within two weeks. It’s an estimate Nasseri says isn’t impossible but has hurdles. 'It is possible that this could start in two weeks and get it going,' he said. 'But it all kind of comes down to what that vetting process looks like. The biggest thing with the EB5 process is the source of the funds. Where's the money going, and is it creating jobs?' The current program requires would-be investors to invest a little over $1 million and create at least 10 jobs, and it also puts investors on a pathway to a green card and later citizenship. It’s unclear, however, whether Trump can end the EB5 program without Congress’ blessing, as the investor program was just reauthorized in 2022.

Should you expect a check from Elon Musk's DOGE cuts?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump wants to take some of the savings that come from Elon Musk's government efficiency push and return it directly to taxpayers, but that doesn't mean you should expect a check in the mail anytime soon. Trump recently endorsed the idea — which started on social media — of sending 20% of the Department of Government Efficiency's savings back to taxpayers as a 'DOGE dividend.' 'I love it. A 20% dividend, so to speak, for the money that we're saving by going after the waste and fraud and abuse and all of the other things that are happening,' Trump told reporters last week. When asked how much money it could be, Trump said, 'It could be a lot. If it's 20%, we'd give back a lot of money to the taxpayer.' ‘DOGE dividend’ advisor says $5k checks are ‘reasonable’ Musk also supports the idea, likening so-called 'DOGE dividend checks' to the 'spoils of battle' in a recent interview. But that doesn't mean dividend checks are going to happen. Congress would have to authorize the plan, and so far, even Republican lawmakers have been hesitant to embrace it. It's also unclear how much money DOGE can save to return to taxpayers in the first place. Clear evidence of major savings has been scant, and budget experts doubt DOGE can reach its $2 trillion savings goal on its own. 'I don't think Americans should bet on a big DOGE dividend coming their way,' said Romina Boccia, the director of budget and entitlement policy at the libertarian Cato Institute. Boccia added: 'Politicians love to provide benefits to their constituents, but when it comes to actually curtailing spending and producing deficit reduction, that is much harder to do.' Here's what to know about the DOGE dividend and how likely it is to happen. What is the 'DOGE dividend' check? The idea for a 'DOGE dividend' surfaced on social media last week when 'anti-woke' investor James Fishback posted a four-page proposal and tagged Elon Musk. Fishback suggested sending a 'tax refund check' as a form of 'restitution' that would go out to roughly '79 million tax-paying households.' Those households would receive a $5,000 check — a 20% cut of DOGE's $2 trillion in targeted savings, according to Fishback's formulation. The idea caught Musk's attention, who said he would run it by Trump, and the president has since expressed support for the proposal. Congress would have to approve the checks, and achieving the sort of payout that Fishback proposed would require Musk to hit his target of $2 trillion in spending cuts — a number that has drawn skepticism. DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for 'I think that 2 trillion is likely an overly ambitious target that DOGE by itself will not be able to accomplish,' Boccia said. Achieving that level of savings, Boccia said, would require congressional buy-in and cuts to major entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, which Trump has already taken off the table. DOGE claims it has saved an estimated $65 billion so far, citing a combination of fraud detection, canceled contracts, workforce reductions and other alleged cost-cutting measures. However, several analyses have cast doubt on DOGE's numbers, identifying errors that caused savings to be vastly overstated. A New York Times report found that the single biggest line item on the DOGE website was off by about $8 billion. 'At the moment, we cannot take DOGE at face value,' Boccia said. Fishback told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo that his plan would help DOGE reach its $2 trillion goal because citizens would be incentivized to report wasteful spending. 'Every American can step up, report fraud and abuse to DOGE directly via X, and we’ll see the savings go up, hit $2 trillion, and we’ll see the checks dispersed next summer,' Fishback said. Who would get DOGE dividend checks? In his proposal, Fishback said the checks would only go to households that pay income taxes, meaning tens of millions of lower-income Americans would miss out. An estimated 72.5 million households — roughly 40% — didn't pay federal income tax in 2022, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. For the most part, people don't pay income taxes because they have little income. About 60% of nonpayers make less than $30,000, and another 28% make between $30,000 and about $60,000, per the Tax Policy Center. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? 'While some politicians imply that people somehow are cheating the system by not paying taxes, the reality is quite different. People generally don’t pay federal income tax because, well, they don’t make very much money,' Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, wrote in the report. Of those who paid no federal income tax in 2022, roughly a third were age 65 or older. That means many people who are primarily living on Social Security benefits wouldn't receive DOGE dividend checks under the current plan. Are DOGE dividend checks a good idea? Some experts think DOGE dividend checks would worsen inflation, like when COVID-era stimulus checks helped drive up prices. 'Love what DOGE is doing, but this is a bad idea. There’s no need to send 'dividend checks,'' Preston Brashers, a tax policy research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, wrote on X. 'If the government sends out stimmy checks, inflation will come back with a vengeance,' Brashers warned. Fishback argues that DOGE dividend checks would not be inflationary because 'unlike COVID-stimulus checks which were deficit-financed,' the new round of checks would be 'exclusively funded with DOGE-driven savings.' Could Trump really return DOGE savings to taxpayers? Kevin Hassett, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, echoed that claim, insisting that the dividend checks would not be inflationary during a press briefing last week. 'Imagine if we don't spend government money, and we give it back to people. If they spend it all, then you're even,' Hassett said. Boccia said a DOGE dividend could push up inflation if the government were to borrow and fund the checks based on expected savings rather than savings that have actually materialized. Others don't think the checks will be sizeable enough to matter. 'I can’t imagine they’d be inflationary because I can’t imagine they’d be big enough,’’ Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, told The Associated Press. Kamarck dismissed the DOGE dividend as 'ridiculous' and said there's not enough money to cut that would result in a big contribution to taxpayers. What do lawmakers think about the idea? A DOGE dividend check would have to be approved by Congress, and even Trump-aligned GOP lawmakers seem skeptical. House Speaker Mike Johnson appeared less than enthusiastic when asked about the idea at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week. 'Politically, that would be great for us, you know, you can send everybody a check,' Johnson said. 'But if you think about our core principles, right, fiscal responsibility is what we do as conservatives. That’s our brand.' Speaker Johnson discourages DOGE stimulus checks idea Johnson added: 'We have a $36 trillion federal debt. We have a giant deficit that we’re contending with. I think we need to pay down the credit card, right?' Senator Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., said he loves what Musk is doing to expose waste, fraud and abuse but pumped the breaks on a DOGE dividend. 'I’m always happy to let the American people keep more of their hard-earned money, but DOGE savings should first go toward reducing spending so that inflation doesn’t become the silent tax robbing them of their purchasing power,' Johnson wrote on X. Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he’d 'want to see the details' of the plan, according to Business Insider. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican, told Scripps News that eliminating the debt and curbing inflation would be her main priorities for any savings associated with DOGE. 'If there's money left after we address inflation, and the debt, and the deficit, it's always a good idea to send taxpayers their money back. But when we're $36 trillion in debt, we've dug ourselves a pretty big hole,' Lummis said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/should-you-expect-check-doge/	2025-02-26T16:37:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67abf8d861b6a3.13913445.jpeg?w=900
JFK, Jeffrey Epstein files: When will they be released?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his third day in office that directed the release of records related to the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, but those files haven't been released yet. Trump has been saying he will have classified records related to the assassination of Kennedy released since he was on the campaign trail. This executive order also called for the declassification of the assassination files of former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ashley Judd backs New York bill to protect survivors, target traffickers There has been pressure to release not only these files but also those surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case. Pressure to release Jeffrey Epstein, JFK files In February, the FBI said it found 2,400 new records related to the assassination of Kennedy and is working on transferring those files to the National Archives and Records Administration to be included in the declassification process. Attorney General Pam Bondi is now being pressured to release Jeffrey Epstein's flight log for his private jet and helicopter, according to The Hill. 'The American people deserve to know exactly who was affiliated with this network. As you know, over the course of many years, Jeffrey Epstein built a heinous global sex trafficking network that caused irreparable harm to countless women,' Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said. Democrats have not said much regarding the release of these files. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida, told Chris Cuomo that she wanted the Epstein and Kennedy files to be declassified. Luna said a plan should be presented this week on how to declassify these documents. 'That will lay out the process in which declassification will take place,' she said. 'We met with the National Archives today ... if everything goes as planned, these will be publicly available as soon as we get them. The American people will also be getting them.' Bondi said the files are 'sitting on her desk' and that she is reviewing them. Luna posted on X, saying, 'On Feb 11 &amp; Feb 19, house oversight sent a letter to the DOJ asking for status on releasing the Epstein files as well as JFK etc. The DOJ has not responded.' She then tagged Bondi, asking her the status of these documents. Why is there pressure to release Jeffrey Epstein, JFK files? Many are citing transparency as the reason for releasing these files. Massachusetts sanctuary cities sue Trump, Feds over funding threats Blackburn said Democrats have undercut efforts to 'crack the Epstein trafficking ring wide open.' In a post on X, Blackburn said, 'The time for transparency is now.' Another Republican senator, Mike Lee of Utah, also said on X that it is time for the American people to 'be given access to' these files, according to Yahoo News. Jeffrey Epstein case Investigations against Jeffrey Epstein started in March of 2005 when a 14-year-old girl said she was molested at his mansion. Later, multiple underage girls would tell police Epstein hired them to give sexual massages. Jeffrey Epstein timeline: Sex trafficking, scandals, Ghislaine Maxwell Epstein was found dead in his jail cell of an apparent suicide back in 2019. He had been awaiting trial for allegedly creating a child sex trafficking ring with Ghislaine Maxwell. In December 2023, a federal judge ordered for the court documents to be unsealed, which would reveal the names of dozens of Epstein's associates. In January 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said the documents would be unsealed on a rolling basis.

However, not much was learned from those unsealed documents. In February 2024, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law that made more documents from the 2006 investigation public. Once those documents were released in July 2024, they showed that the prosecutor in the case had painted the alleged underage victims as drug addicts, liars, prostitutes and thieves. Now, it is alleged that there is a 'list of clients' of Epstein that could be released, according to Newsweek. It is rumored that this list could implicate high-profile figures in various sex crimes. JFK's assassination Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, and there are still questions about what happened. He was shot in the back of the head while traveling in a motorcade and was later pronounced dead at Parkland Hospital. Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for murdering a police officer and Kennedy. However, there have been theories that suggest Oswald was a fall guy, and some withheld documents from the government have been fueling speculation that the public doesn't know everything about the 35th president's death.

(RR Auction via AP, File) Trump has said since his election campaign that he would release all remaining documents related to Kennedy's assassination. However, according to The Associated Press in November, even though there are likely many government records that haven't been released, the public should not expect profound revelations. In September 2024, previously unreleased footage showed Kennedy riding in his motorcade right before the video was auctioned off by RR Auction for $137,500. What are the theories related to JFK's assassination? In 2023, actor and director Rob Reiner, who has a podcast series named 'Who Killed JFK,' told NewsNation that he had proof there were four men involved in the assassination. A private investigator who has spent a lot of his life studying Kennedy's assassination told NewsNation he thinks there were two shooters involved. Trump pushes DOGE, tariffs at first Cabinet meeting 'One of those shots was fired too close to the other two to have come from Oswald's rifle,' Josiah Thompson said. He doesn't believe there will ever be a true answer for what happened on that day in Dallas.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jeffrey-epstein-jfk-files-when-release/	2025-02-26T16:21:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201496887.jpg?w=900
Gov. Newsom directs parole board to evaluate Menendez brothers’ c...	Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that he’s ordering the California Board of Parole Hearings to closely examine whether the Menendez brothers pose a risk to public safety if released from prison right now. Newsom made the announcement on his 'This is Gavin Newsom' podcast. 'The question for the board is a rather simple one,' Newsom said during the introductory episode. 'Do Erik and Lyle Menendez pose an unreasonable risk to public safety?' Menendez brothers’ evidence suggesting sexual abuse not credible: LA County DA Public safety experts and forensic psychologists will conduct the risk assessment. According to Eytan Wallace, California Capitol reporter for Nexstar Media, the process starts with experts analyzing what led a person to commit an offense and determining whether they have done the transformational work needed—and gained the skills—to avoid repeating their mistakes. Nexstar Media is the parent company of KTLA 5. Once that’s complete, a hearing will work like a standard parole hearing, providing the District Attorney and the victims a chance to be part of the process. The risk assessment results will be available to the judge presiding over the case and Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman. Newsom’s announcement comes after Hochman announced that his office had issued an informal response requesting the courts deny the brothers’ habeas petition. Chances of Menendez brothers getting out of prison are slim, legal analyst says A habeas petition is a formal challenge to the legality of a conviction. It is often considered a last resort after appeals have been exhausted. If new evidence is deemed sufficient, it could eventually lead to a convict’s release. In October, former DA George Gascón announced that his office would reexamine the case in the light of new evidence, including a letter purportedly written by Erik Menendez just months before he and his brother, Lyle, killed their parents with a shotgun at their Beverly Hills home in 1989. They were 21 and 18 at the time, respectively. The letter details alleged sexual abuse committed by their father, Jose Menendez. Despite the setback from the DA’s office, Newsom has 'unilateral' power to grant the brothers clemency, which would free them immediately. Still, Newsom noted that 'there is no guarantee of outcome here.' Menendez attorney: The ’90s want their DA office back Erik and Lyle Menendez admitted to fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and their mother, Kitty Menendez, after fearing their parents were about to kill them to stop people from finding out that Jose Menendez had sexually abused Erik Menendez for years. The brothers have been in prison for over 30 years after being convicted in 1996. The case has regained national attention since the release of Netflix’s 'The Menendez Brothers' film.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/menendez-brothers-parole-gavin-newsom/	2025-02-26T15:17:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1462355302-1-e1729360247514_b1b20e_99c390.jpg?w=800

We didn't want to burden any clients with this. Our family deeply appreciates Kylie for later offering to cover funeral expenses and offering up all her help and support. Donations raised through this fundraiser will go toward the costs associated with securing his belongings home. As well as other unexpected expenses to settle his assets. With his death being so unexpected there are many things that weren't set up for a time like this. The next several months will have many hoops we will have to jump through to ensure we honor him in the best way we can.

Ryan Reynolds' image takes hit amid Lively-Baldoni lawsuit; costa...	(NewsNation) — The 'nice guy' in Hollywood may not be so nice after all. Ryan Reynolds has long enjoyed a stellar reputation as a 'good guy,' but with the advent of the 'It Ends With Us' lawsuit he and his wife, Blake Lively, brought against the movie’s producer, director and co-star, Justin Baldoni, that facade is starting to slip. Justin Baldoni's lawsuit takes on Ryan Reynolds with Blake Lively The first shot over the bow came when Baldoni, in his lawsuit against Reynolds and Lively, accused the 'Deadpool' star of becoming unhinged in a meeting. Baldoni claims Reynolds 'berated' him during a heated meeting at the couple's home, where Reynolds 'aggressively' accused Baldoni of a string of offenses against his wife, including 'fat-shaming' her. Hugh Jackman, from left, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Tammy Reynolds, and Brandon Sklenar attend the world premiere of 'It Ends with Us' at AMC Lincoln Square on Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024, in New York. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) According to the lawsuit: 'Baldoni and producers arrived eager to discuss plans for the next day's filming, prepared with their production materials. Instead, they were blindsided by Lively and Reynolds, who presented a list of grievances that were both unanticipated and troubling. 'Reynolds launched into a tirade, berating Baldoni in what Baldoni later described as a 'traumatic' encounter, stating he had 'never been spoken to like that in his life.' Michelle Trachtenberg, ‘Gossip Girl’ and ‘Buffy’ actress, dead at 39 ''When Baldoni resisted apologising for what he had not done, Reynolds became further enraged. Everyone, including the producer Lively had asked production to engage and a representative of Sony that was in attendance, left that 'meeting' in shock. The producer offered that in his 40-year career he had never seen anyone speak to someone like that.' [Reynolds denies he screamed at Baldoni].

Subscribe to her newsletter here. ‘Deadpool’ co-star says Ryan Reynolds was ‘horrifically mean’ Soon after Baldoni’s lawsuit went public, an interview with TJ Miller, Reynolds’ 'Deadpool' co-star, was unearthed. The interview, with Adam Carolla’s podcast, took place two years ago, and in it, Miller accused Reynolds of being 'horrifically mean' during a 'Deadpool 2' shoot and recalled Reynolds telling him: 'Know what's great about you, Weasel? You're not the star, but you do just enough exposition that it's funny, and then we can leave and get back to the real movie.' This image released by 20th Century Studios/Marvel Studios shows Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool/Wade Wilson, left, and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine/Logan in a scene from 'Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.' (20th Century Studios/Marvel Studios via AP) T.J. said at the time, 'Would I work with him again? No. I would not work with him again.' (Miller has since said the two have made up). And then this week, two more damaging interviews came out. Matthew Lawrence on Ryan Reynolds Matthew Lawrence, who starred with Reynolds in 'Boltneck' (1998), said Reynolds had 'creative differences' issues with the Oscar-nominated producers and directors of the movie. Lawrence, on his 'Brotherly Love Podcast,' said: '(Reynolds would) walk out — just kind of wanted to do his thing, and the producers would get really upset.' 'They even told him, ‘Ryan, this is a bad Jim Carrey impersonation. This is not what we hired you to do. You can’t impersonate somebody. You gotta do your own thing.'' This image released by FX shows Ryan Reynolds, left, and Rob McElhenney in a scene from the third season of 'Welcome to Wrexham.' (FX via AP) Reynolds was 'upset' over the criticism and would only say: 'I’m doing my thing.'

Brian Laundrie's family calls Gabby Petito documentary one-sided	(NewsNation) — The family of Brian Laundrie says the new Netflix Gabby Petito documentary series is a one-sided look at the relationship of the two young adults. In a statement provided to PEOPLE by the Laundrie family’s attorney, Chris and Roberta Laundrie say the new documentary series 'American Murder: Gabby Petito' did not paint the full picture of what happened. 'The documentary was what we expected. One perspective depicted as the ‘truth’ as seen through their lens. Similar to Republicans and Democrats fighting it out lately. Hard to see through the lens of the other with all the noise and distrust.' Gabby Petito’s parents destroyed her van: ‘We had it crushed’ Petito vanished in 2021 while on a cross-country road trip with Laundrie in a converted camper van. The two became the center of a nationwide investigation after Laundrie returned home without Petito. Petito, a 22-year-old aspiring blogger, documented their journey on social media, specifically through her YouTube channel, before abruptly stopping. Gabby’s Ford Transit Connect was a regular feature in the travel reports she posted online before she disappeared in 2021. Authorities believe she was killed by Laundrie in Wyoming before he killed himself in Florida. Her body was found at a camping area in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming on Sept. 19, 2021, days after a nationwide search was launched. His body was later found near the Carlton Reserve in South Florida on Oct. 20, 2021. The Laundrie family did not participate in the documentary. Gabby Petito’s family speaks with NewsNation ahead of documentary release 'The documentary contained many inaccuracies, incorrect juxtapositions of timelines, and misstatements and omissions of fact — perhaps deliberate to capture their ‘truth’, perhaps due to simple error,' the statement issued to PEOPLE continued. The family, however, acknowledged that Brian Laundrie killed Petito. 'We all know Brian took Gabby’s life and Brian then took his own as well. Let the parents of both Gabby and Brian mourn and remember them in peace.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/gabby-petito-missing-case/brian-laundries-family-calls-gabby-petito-documentary-one-sided/	2025-02-26T14:04:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/02/brian-laundrie-1.jpg?w=900
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy expected to sign minerals deal Frid...	(NewsNation) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is coming to the White House Friday, where he will sign a rare minerals deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday. Trump addressed the deal, which has been a push and pull since the start, before the first Cabinet meeting of his second term on Wednesday. Details are vague but what is known is that the U.S. is requesting revenue from Ukraine's rare minerals, which are used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. Trump has said this is a way for Kyiv to pay back the U.S. for aid sent for the war effort under Democratic President Joe Biden. DOGE’s Elon Musk to visit Fort Knox to ensure gold hasn’t been ‘stolen’ 'The previous administration put us in a very bad position, but we’ve been able to make a deal where we’re going to get the money back and a lot of money in the future,' Trump said. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said at a news conference early Wednesday in Kyiv that a framework of an economic deal had been reached, but it did not yet include the U.S. security guarantees his country sees as vital. The economic agreement 'may be part of future security guarantees, but I want to understand the broader vision. What awaits Ukraine?' Zelensky said. Zelenskyy said he expects a wide-ranging conversation with Trump. 'Today, there has been a lot of international work. Our teams are working with the United States as we prepare for negotiations this Friday,' Zelenskyy said Wednesday on X. 'Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations. I will meet with @POTUS. For me and for all of us in the world, it’s important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace. This comes during a very public feud between Zelenskyy and Trump that initially stemmed from the minerals deal. After Zelenskyy refused the initial framework, Trump called the Ukrainian president a 'dictator without elections.' Zelenskyy, in turn, said Trump is living in a 'disinformation space.' Along with the minerals deal, there's also a push to put an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Trump says the Europeans should provide security — not the United States. Another European leader, French President Emmanual Macron, was in Washington on Monday, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will visit Thursday.

Massachusetts sanctuary cities sue Trump, Feds over funding threa...	(NewsNation) — Two Massachusetts sanctuary cities have filed a lawsuit against several federal officials, including President Donald Trump, alleging the government is attempting to coerce them into the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts. The cities of Chelsea and Somerville filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging the Trump administration’s efforts and arguing that federal officials are threatening to defund local efforts to keep their communities safe. The lawsuit was filed after Trump border czar Tom Homan claimed he was 'coming to Boston and bringing hell with me.' Woman violated in exam room worries medical worker is still on duty The lawsuit, which was filed by city officials who are represented by Lawyers For Civil Rights, argues the administration’s threat of stripping sanctuary cities of federal funding violates the cities’ constitutional rights. 'Public safety is the top priority for the City of Chelsea—we cannot afford to have our residents fear reporting crimes or engaging with local law enforcement, as this undermines the safety of everyone in our community,' Chelsea City Manager Fidel Maltez said in a statement. Chelsea has been a sanctuary city since 2007 and 'is stronger because of our immigrant population, and we will not let fear or misinformation divide us,' the city manager said. Somerville has maintained its sanctuary city status since 1987 and has reaffirmed its commitment to that status three times since 2016, City Council President Judy Pineda Neufeld said. She said the federal government’s attempts to coerce city officials into betraying its immigrant neighbors are 'unconstitutional, morally unacceptable and a danger' to the full community. 'Our city’s values are clear: We will protect the dignity, safety, and rights of all of our residents, regardless of immigration status,' Pineda Neufeld said. 2 people killed by IED; cartel suspected, officials say In fiscal year 2024, Chelsea received about $14.5 million in federal funding, part of which went to education and downtown reconstruction projects. During the same time, Somerville received about $19.4 million in federal money to support a variety of community and public safety services. Those projects include roadway safety initiatives, homelessness prevention services and efforts to address and reduce youth tobacco use and alcohol consumption, the city said. The lawsuit alleges that since taking office in January, Trump’s executive orders have threatened to keep federal funding from sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration agents as part of the mass deportation effort. Homan has visited cities like Chicago, where ICE raids were conducted shortly after Trump’s inauguration, and has targeted cities that push back against federal involvement in immigration enforcement. Maltez, the Chelsea city manager, told GBH News that since Trump took office in January, the city’s downtown district has seen a decline in foot traffic. He said the city received reports of immigration agents being in local businesses. 'And honestly, it created a lot of fear in our community,' Maltez told the local television station. 'We hear from our residents almost every day about how they are scared of walking in our streets.' The lawsuit also names the Department of Justice and Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Kristi Noem and the Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy as defendants. The suit argues Trump’s executive orders have said sanctuary cities will not receive DOJ funding and that the Department of Transportation will deprioritize those cities as well. An email sent from NewsNation to the Department of Homeland Security seeking comment on the lawsuit was not returned. 'The President cannot use federal funding as a weapon to force local governments to undermine public safety and their values and participate in his mass deportation efforts,' Oren Sellstrom, one of the Massachusetts cities’ attorneys, said in a statement. '(The) lawsuit seeks to protect sanctuary and welcoming cities, so they can continue to make public safety decisions that are in the best interests of their residents.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/massachusetts-sanctuary-sue-trump-feds/	2025-02-26T11:25:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP18059615938391-1-e1733323119120_abd0ec.jpg?w=900

Watch live: Elon Musk attends Trump’s first Cabinet meeting	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Elon Musk got a round of applause from President Donald Trump’s Cabinet at its first meeting Wednesday, highlighting the billionaire’s growing influence in the administration. 'We're going to start getting to be at a point where we can think in terms of balancing budgets, believe it or not, something you haven't heard in many many years decades actually,' Trump said to the cabinet. Last year the U.S. deficit almost reached $2 trillion. Trump asked Elon Musk to get up and give some remarks in the cabinet meeting. He said the U.S. cannot continue with $2 trillion deficits and huge amounts of interest on the national debt. 'This is a central' thing. Musk also disclosed he is 'getting a lot of death threats.' Musk said he thinks that there around $1 trillion in savings that can be found. 'We will make mistakes. We won't be perfect,' Musk acknowledged. 'When we make mistakes we will fix it very quickly.' DOGE subcommittee looks at US foreign aid spending 'Some disagree a little bit,' President Trump said of Musk's efforts, but said most are 'thrilled.' Some criticized Musk's presence at the meeting since his role within the administration is nebulous. He was said to be running the Department of Government Efficiency, but the Trump administration said in a legal filing he was not an employee. 'Elon is working with the Cabinet secretaries and their staff every single day to identify waste and fraud and abuse at these respective agencies,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters before the meeting. 'All of the Cabinet secretaries take the advice and direction of DOGE.' Trump won't guarantee Ukraine security The president also told reporters he would not 'make security guarantees beyond very much' for the war-torn country amid its conflict with Russia. 'We're going to have Europe do that because it's in, you know, we're talking about Europe is the next door neighbor,' Trump said. 'But we're going to make sure everything goes well and as you know we'll be making, will be really partnering with Ukraine in terms of rare earth [metals]. We very much need rare earth. They have great rare earth.' Mexico and Canada tariffs are still happening 'I'm not stopping the tariffs' promised for goods from Canada and Mexico, Trump said in response to a question. The 30 day pause on the promised tariffs on both countries ends Monday. The U.S. had paused the implementation of the tariffs as it talked with both countries about what it may be able to do to strengthen border enforcement and drug interdiction. Trump now says the tariffs will begin on April 2. Pentagon to investigate Afghanistan withdrawal Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon is launching an inquiry into the August 201 withdrawal from Afghanistan. 'We are doing a complete review of every single aspect of what happened, the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan,' Hegseth told reporters. Yet-to-be-confirmed nominees face hearings Also on Wednesday, three of Trump’s Cabinet picks — Dean John Sauer, the nominee for Solicitor General; Harmeet Dhillon, nominee for the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights; and Aaron Reitz, nominee for assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s legal policy office — face initial hearings and, if confirmed, would have influence over reproductive health care access nationwide.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-attend-trump-cabinet-meeting/	2025-02-26T09:04:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201499078.jpg?w=900
One person dead as Texas sees worst measles outbreak in 3 decades	(NewsNation) — The number of measles cases across the United States is on the rise, and at least one person with the disease has died in Texas. In Texas alone, the outbreak has grown to 124 cases across nine different counties. The Texas Department of State Health Services said 18 of those patients have been hospitalized. On Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that one person who had been hospitalized with measles died in West Texas. Officials said the death was of an unvaccinated school-aged child, NewsNation local affiliate KXAN wrote. Five of those who have contracted measles were vaccinated, and the rest either were not vaccinated or their status was unknown, according to the department. Social Security to increase monthly benefits for millions Texas health officials are saying this is the worst outbreak the state has seen in three decades. The virus has also been reported in Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Rhode Island. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is providing technical assistance, laboratory support and vaccines as needed, the agency said. What is measles? Measles is an airborne disease caused by a virus that spreads when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It is highly contagious and can cause serious health complications, especially in children younger than 5 years old, the CDC says. Symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, red, watery eyes or a rash. Populations with high vaccination rates, above 95%, have herd immunity, meaning the disease is harder to spread, one pediatrician told NewsNation. No taxes on tips closer to reality with multiple pathways 'I don't think there is a major concern that it's going to be a pandemic like we saw in coronavirus,' said Dr. Joel 'Gator' Warsh. 'Most people are vaccinated or had measles, so the likelihood of it spreading in that way is pretty small. We've had many smaller-ish outbreaks in the last 10 or 20, years, and they generally don't get huge.' Newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has not publicly spoken about the current measles outbreak. Kennedy has been branded a vaccine skeptic, and his positions have sparked concern, particularly due to a growing vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. following the COVID-19 pandemic. Kennedy's supporters, however, say his positions only further the conversation about doing more long-term research on vaccines.

DOGE subcommittee to look at US foreign aid spending	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The House subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency will meet Wednesday to examine U.S. foreign aid spending. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., chairwoman of the subcommittee, said the hearing comes as Americans are 'shocked' to discover how their taxpayer dollars have been spent overseas. The subcommittee has said it will 'expose egregious foreign aid spending that has undermined U.S. interests, review proposed reforms, and aid the Trump Administration’s efforts to rein in America’s bloated bureaucracy.' Social Security Administration closes Office of Transformation The hearing follows the Department of Government Efficiency's downsizing of the U.S. Agency for International Development as the Trump administration works to dismantle the agency that oversees foreign aid and development programs. Democrats are expected to question three witnesses, including Max Primorac, a Heritage Foundation research fellow who formerly served as USAID’s chief operating officer and is expected to argue that foreign aid organizations have weakened the U.S. influence. 'What I will do is show how the woke agenda harmed the American brand name. It made us synonymous with values that are rejected by most of the world,' Primorac told the Daily Signal. The hearing will begin at 11 a.m. ET. Democrats defend aid amid USAID cuts USAID is likely to be a major topic at the hearing. The agency has laid off thousands of workers and cut programs worldwide as the Trump administration continues its efforts to crack down on government spending. A source shared a message with NewsNation that was sent to employees warning them to pack up in 15 minutes and to not bring any weapons. 2 people killed, 1 injured by IED; cartel suspected, officials say USAID has seen its Washington, D.C., headquarters shuttered over the last month as thousands of its programs have collapsed worldwide. While Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have criticized USAID for wasteful spending and pushing a liberal agenda, Democrats argue agencies like USAID play a critical role in maintaining U.S. influence abroad. 'We got the best military in the world, but we also have diplomacy, and we also have our international allies, our friends,' said Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas. 'But also, one big tool that the U.S. has is soft power. That is, being able to provide assistance to countries ... it's in our best interest.' DOGE staffers resign over cuts Amid the turmoil at DOGE, 21 staffers resigned Tuesday in protest of the widespread cuts the agency is spearheading, refusing to comply with the downsizing effort. The employees, formerly with the U.S. Digital Services department, wrote in a letter, 'We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans' sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,' as first reported by the Associated Press. In response, Musk labeled the staffers as 'political holdovers' and claimed they would have been fired if they had not resigned. DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for Federal workers 'do not deserve' a paycheck: Marjorie Taylor Greene Greene has recently come under fire for saying federal workers 'do not deserve' their paychecks. 'Those jobs are paid for by the American tax people who work real jobs, earn real income, pay federal taxes, and then pay these federal employees. Federal employees do not deserve their jobs. Federal employees do not deserve their paychecks,' she said Tuesday during a House committee meeting. Greene earns $174,000 annually as a member of Congress. Amy Gleason named interim DOGE chief Meanwhile, questions remain about the leadership of DOGE. The White House confirmed that Amy Gleason, a former U.S. Digital Services official, is the interim administrator of the agency. A recent court filing indicated that Musk is not in charge but serves as a senior advisor to the president.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-subcommittee-foreign-aid/	2025-02-26T04:41:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Leading-USAID_022119_AP_Fernando-Vergara.jpg?w=900
Palm Beach, Florida hospital attack 'shouldn't have happened:' Nu...	PALM BEACH, Fla. (NewsNation) — Dr. Cindy Joseph, whose mom, nurse Leelamma Lal, was brutally attacked at a Florida hospital, said she's 'really disappointed in the system,' calling the incident preventable. Joseph told NewsNation's Ashleigh Banfield that her own experience working in health care has led her to expect the worst at times, but ultimately, she says, 'This shouldn't have happened.' US consumer confidence drops by most since August 2021 'My mom's been working there for 20+ years; she's devoted her entire career to the hospital. The fact that this happened at a health care facility which should have proper security is beyond me,' Joseph said on 'Banfield.' Suspect facing attempted murder charges after attacking Florida nurse Stephen Scantlebury is facing attempted murder charges after allegedly attacking Lal at the hospital where he was being cared for, essentially breaking every bone in Lal's face, police said. According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, deputies were dispatched to an aggravated battery incident in a patient’s room at Palms West Hospital on Feb. 18. Scantlebury has been arrested and is undergoing medical clearance, NewsNation affiliate WJW reported. On Feb. 20, the sheriff’s department, in an update on social media, wrote that a hate crime enhancement had been added to the existing charge of attempted second-degree murder. New search to begin for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: Reports 'Hate crime enhancements, if proven, can result in harsher penalties upon conviction. They highlight the motive behind the defendant’s actions and their broader impact on the community,' the post said. According to PEOPLE, police affidavits obtained by Florida media outlets described how Scantlebury allegedly jumped on top of his bed and then onto the nurse and attacked her. It went on to state that 'essentially every bone in the victim’s face is broken,' and additionally, the victim would likely lose the use of both of her eyes. 911 calls released after Palm Beach, Florida nurse attacked by patient 'Did he hurt someone with the scissors?' a dispatcher asked.

Who is Amy Gleason, the new DOGE acting administrator?	(NewsNation) — The White House confirmed Tuesday that Amy Gleason is serving as the acting administrator for the Department of Government Efficiency, the new agency created by President Donald Trump. A White House official said that Gleason, a former U.S. Digital Service official, now leads the department that Trump established via executive order after taking office in January. Questions about DOGE's leadership emerged after the White House stated in a court filing that Elon Musk, despite being widely reported as leading the department's cost-cutting efforts, is technically not part of the agency. According to Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, Musk is an employee of the 'White House Office' and serves as senior adviser to the president. DOGE’s Elon Musk to visit Fort Knox to ensure gold hasn’t been ‘stolen’ What is Amy Gleason's background? Gleason has been a senior adviser at the U.S. Digital Service since January 2025, according to her LinkedIn profile. The service, created under the Obama administration to modernize government technology infrastructure, was renamed the U.S. DOGE Service after Trump's inauguration. Per her Linkedin profile, she previously worked as a digital services expert at USDS from October 2018 to December 2021, serving under both the Biden administration and during Trump's first term. According to an archived White House page, Gleason's career began in nursing before she transitioned to health care technology. The Obama administration recognized her as a 'Champion of Change' for her work improving healthcare technology, including the digitization of medical records. Before joining the federal government, Gleason served as vice president for research at the Cure JM Foundation for nearly five years. She was also co-founder, chief operating officer and chief strategy officer for CareSync, per the biography on the White House site. 21 staffers in office overtaken by DOGE resign What is DOGE doing? DOGE was created by Trump under an executive order in an effort to 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. More than 20 staffers who worked in the federal department overtaken by DOGE resigned Tuesday, saying they won’t use their technical skills to jeopardize Americans’ data and compromise essential government systems. Members of DOGE have been going into federal agencies, looking at their budgets and tapping into computer systems. The Associated Press recently reported that DOGE gained access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security systems. DOGE agents also gained access to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency said this month. New York Magazine reported at least one DOGE worker has been to the Commerce Department’s Maryland headquarters, where they gained access to the agency’s IT system. In addition, DOGE took control of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s funding, locked out workers, accessed classified information and removed leadership.

2 people killed by IED; cartel suspected: Officials	(NewsNation) — A 74-year-old Texas rancher and one other person were killed and a third person was injured by what authorities said was an improvised explosive device planted by a cartel close to the U.S.-Mexico border. The rancher died near Brownsville, Texas, but was killed on the Mexican side of the border, said Sid Miller, the Texas Agriculture commissioner, in a statement Tuesday. Miller's office told NewsNation that the incident took place earlier this month. The rancher, Antonio Céspedes Saldierna, ranched on both sides of the border. Saldierna ran over an IED — which authorities suspect was planted by a drug cartel — in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, Miller's office confirmed to NewsNation. The blast also killed Horacio Lopez Peña, and Lopez’s wife, Ninfa Griselda Ortega, sustained injuries and has been hospitalized. 'This shocking act of violence highlights the growing threat posed by cartel activity along our southern border,' Miller said. 'I urge all Texas farmers, ranchers, and agricultural workers who travel to Mexico or operate near the border to exercise extreme caution.' Southwest Airlines plane has near-collision with jet at Midway Airport Miller referred to the incident as 'tragic and alarming.' Miller encouraged everyone working in the agricultural industry in the Lower Rio Grande Valley to remain aware of their surroundings and to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement. In a separate statement, Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham said these violent acts should be condemned at the highest level. She added that officials have been talking about the cartels' use of IEDs for years and warned that they threaten the safety and security of American citizens and must be brought to an end. 'Unfortunately, extreme violence, including the use of IEDs, has become more common over the last few years as cartels were emboldened by weak leadership in Washington, D.C.,' Buckingham, a Republican, said. 'I encourage all Texans to remain vigilant and cautious. Rest assured, the newly elected Trump Administration and the State of Texas will use all means necessary to bring an end to the cartel’s grip over South Texas.' Law enforcement officials in the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas previously acknowledged the existence of IEDs and have warned communities along the border to exercise caution, especially in agricultural fields. Authorities indicated that the threats are linked to criminal organizations operating in the region. Miller called the Lower Rio Grande Valley a 'crucial part' of the state's agricultural industry. He said the safety of those working in the industry is of utmost importance. 'We cannot overlook the rising violence that threatens not only lives but also the security of our farms, ranches and rural communities,' Miller said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/texas-rancher-killed-ied-cartel/	2025-02-25T11:45:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a15d5517b431.86435320.jpeg?w=900
Judge gives Trump administration two days to release billions of ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday gave the Trump administration less than two days to release billions of dollars in U.S. foreign aid, saying the administration had given no sign of complying with his nearly two-week-old court order to ease its funding freeze. The lawsuit was filed by nonprofit organizations over the cutoff of foreign assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development and State Department, which followed a Jan. 20 executive order by President Donald Trump targeting what he portrayed as wasteful programs that do not correspond to his foreign policy goals. Nonprofit groups and businesses that receive federal money for work abroad said the freeze breaks federal law and has shut down funding for even the most urgent life-saving programs abroad. Those USAID and State partners say the administration has stiffed them on billions of dollars in money already owed, forcing them to lay off tens of thousands of staffers and pushing some organizations toward financial ruin. U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali on Feb. 13 had ordered the administration at least temporarily to get funding flowing again, including to make good on its bills. Despite the order, USAID staffers and the businesses and nonprofit groups say they know of no payments that have gotten through. 'I’m not sure why I can’t get a straight answer from you on this: Are you aware of an unfreezing of the disbursement of funds for those contracts and agreements that were frozen before Feb. 13,' the judge asked Indraneel Sur, the lawyer for the government. 'Are you aware of steps taken to actually release those funds?' 'I’m not in a position to answer that,' Sur said. The case had been brought by the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, representing health organizations receiving U.S. funds for work abroad. They had asked Ali to find the Trump administration in contempt of his earlier order. It’s the second time a judge has found the Trump administration did not follow a court order. U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island also found this month that the administration had not fully unfrozen federal grants and loans within the U.S., even after he blocked sweeping plans for a pause on trillions of dollars in government spending.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-judge-gives-trump-administration-two-days-to-unfreeze-funds-for-us-foreign-aid/	2025-02-25T11:23:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67be19ba0e2ca4.37025492.jpeg?w=900
Southwest Airlines plane has near-collision with jet at Midway Ai...	(NewsNation) — A Southwest Airlines plane and private jet almost collided at Midway Airport in Chicago, Illinois on Tuesday morning. Video footage shows the Southwest plane making its way down the runway, when another aircraft comes in front of it. However, the crew of Southwest Flight 2504 initiated a 'go-round,' allowing the plane to avoid hitting the jet, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement to NewsNation. The business jet entered the runway without authorization around 8:50 a.m., the FAA said. It is now investigating. DOGE’s Elon Musk to visit Fort Knox to ensure gold hasn’t been ‘stolen’ The FAA is also looking into a number of other incidents involving planes that happened this year, including the deadly collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and Black Hawk military helicopter. All 67 people on board those aircraft died. A military plane crashed into the San Diego Bay; a plane crashed in Alaska and a medical jet crashed in Philadelphia in the first few weeks of 2025 as well. Six people, including one child, were on board and killed in the Philadelphia crash. One person on the ground died, too. Last Wednesday, a midair collision involving two small planes in southern Arizona killed two people. This story is developing.

Social Security Administration closes Office of Transformation	(NewsNation) — The Social Security Administration announced Monday that it closed its Office of Transformation and that employees who worked there will be put on administrative leave. In a statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek called it a 'redundant' office. 'President (Donald) Trump has mandated the Federal government eliminate wasteful and inefficient offices and the Office of Transformation was a prime example,' Dudek said. Elon Musk gives federal workers ‘another chance’ to justify jobs The Office of Transformation, according to its website, is responsible for 'strategic guidance and oversight of enterprise-wide initiatives, addressing policies, business processes and systems.' It also plans and coordinates projects involving customer service-related systems and projects. NewsNation has reached out to the Social Security Administration’s Press Office for more information, including how many employees are now on leave and what aspects of the office were wasteful. Last week, the Social Security Administration said it did an 'organizational realignment of the functions provided by its Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight. The administration said moving these functions allowed the agency to streamline layers of management; increase data sharing and 'speed the opportunities to identify fraud, waste, and abuse and implement needed solutions.' The Trump administration and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have been working on cutting spending at federal agencies, as well as its workforce, through the Department of Government Efficiency Monday’s announcement by the SSA didn’t specifically mention DOGE, but Dudek did in a Feb. 19 statement after being confirmed by the Senate. He called it a 'critical part' of Trump’s agenda. DOGE has been controversial as some express concern that its cuts have gone too far and warn they could have negative effects on everyday citizens. In addition, experts have criticized DOGE by saying most of the 'savings' it has touted are driven more by ideological views than economic ones. While DOGE claims it found $55 billion in savings, touting layoffs, canceled contracts and lease renegotiations so far, a closer examination raises doubts about these numbers. On its website, DOGE lists these savings but has not provided evidence for approximately $38 billion of that — nearly 75% of its total claim, NewsNation has previously reported. Another analysis by The Associated Press showed that nearly 40% of the federal contracts the Trump administration says its canceled aren’t expected to save the government any money.

Authorities crack down on gun smuggling to cartels	(NewsNation) — As the Trump administration continues to focus on the U.S.-Mexico border, authorities are ramping up efforts to combat gun smuggling. The decision comes just after the State Department officially designated several cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. That has raised fears of military action in Mexico and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has warned the U.S. not to invade. Meanwhile, Mexican cartels continue to rely on American firearms to supply their arsenal. Escobar: Turning bases into deportation hubs hurts military readiness These weapons are purchased and transported even through legal ports of entry before winding up in the hands of cartels. Customs and Border Protection officers in Nogales, Arizona, recently seized 42 AK-47-style rifles in a cargo truck prior to the truck going through the port of entry and into Mexico. The port director there said, 'These powerful weapons were likely headed to cartels to protect their illicit fentanyl labs.' Retired Homeland Security agent Victor Avila told NewsNation that cartels use straw purchasers, individuals with clean records who can legally buy firearms, to purchase the guns and then smuggle them into Mexico. Now that cartels are officially designated as terror organizations those individuals could face harsher legal consequences. Trump to reinstate Title 42 border policy: Report 'Now you're providing weapons to a terrorist, just like if you were buying a gun for ISIS,' Avila said. 'You're now buying it for the Sinaloa Cartel, same exact thing. So those individuals can now be treated very differently.' Also in Arizona, a task force of federal and local authorities arrested two weapons smugglers, seizing nine guns and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition that were set for delivery to transnational criminal organizations in Mexico, according to Tuscon sector Border Patrol agents. Also on the border in Sonora, Mexico, officials are now discovering a scout site use for human smuggling, seizing two rifles and more than 800 rounds of ammunition. With Trump designating cartels as FTOs, Sheinbaum has fired back at the administration, saying U.S. authorities need to step up enforcement in curbing the flow of those firearms headed to Mexico. 14 indicted for alleged role in ‘prolific’ migrant smuggling operation She is now working on constitutional reforms in Mexico to expand and crack down on foreigners involved in gun smuggling. Sheinbaum says those reforms will call for the highest penalties to be applied to foreigners found guilty of gun smuggling. She's arguing that if cartels are terrorists, those supplying the weapons should be held accountable for aiding terrorism. While the majority of guns used by cartels are coming from the U.S., Avila told NewsNation that the military-grade weapons they use are still being acquired through the Mexican military.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/crack-down-gun-cartels/	2025-02-25T09:49:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/672e9e378cefa2.02033843.jpeg?w=900
Terror designation might prompt cartels to target Americans: Expe...	EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – The White House on Feb. 20 designated eight Latin American transnational criminal gangs as foreign terrorist organizations. They include Mexican drug cartels flooding American communities with fentanyl and other drugs, and Central and South American street gangs like MS-13 and Tren de Aragua linked to violent acts in the United States. The designation empowers the Treasury Department and U.S. law enforcement to aggressively target financial resources these groups utilize to produce their product, wage war on each other and authorities, and terrorize civilians in their home countries. Did Elon Musk’s AI tool Grok 3 censor criticism of Trump? But it does not mean the American public will soon see the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division parachuting into mountains in Mexico or the Navy SEALs knocking down doors on cartel leaders’ mansions in Guadalajara, an international security expert says. 'You may have some advisers physically on the ground working with Mexican law enforcement, the military, army, navy, etc. But if they’re good advisers, you won’t even see them or hear about them,' said Michael Ballard, director of Intelligence for Global Guardian LLC. 'You are not going to have (an American) up front, putting the handcuffs on ‘El Mencho.’ It is going to be a Mexican security or law enforcement official doing that.' Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, aka 'El Mencho,' is the founder of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, or CJNG. Nonetheless, the terror group designation and Mexico’s newfound willingness to give U.S. law enforcement more leeway south of the border will weigh heavily on the leaders of criminal organizations. It might even back them into a corner – which could pose risks for American officials and visitors to Mexico. 'You can view it as cooperation by coercion,' Ballard said of news reports, recently confirmed by the president of Mexico, of American drones flying south of the border and U.S. spy planes operating off the coast of Sinaloa. 'Twenty-five percent tariffs on exports were initially levied on Mexico and then suspended for 30 days pending more border security by the Mexican government; they agreed to deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to the border to help shore up security there.' President Claudia Sheinbaum last week emphasized the drones and U.S. planes were authorized by Mexico as part of binational cooperation. She also sent to her Congress a proposed constitutional amendment to criminalize unauthorized foreign incursions or activities in Mexico. 'The threat of tariffs seems to be a very effective kind of bargaining by the Trump administration to get what they want,' Ballard said. 'But I would guess at least for the first year, the drone flyovers, reconnaissance planes, the U.S. assistance with wiretapping, with electronic device intercepts ... that’s going to be the extent of it.' U.S. companies, visitors might get caught in the crossfire Trump’s executive order on cartels stems from statutes dating back to the 9/11 terror attacks, which the George W. Bush administration used to go after Al-Qaida. He targeted bank accounts and other property the group and its wide network of supporters used to launder money, buy weapons, vehicles and food for its operatives. 'It’s going to give FBI, DEA, CIA more levers they can pull going after shell companies and anyone helping them launder money – knowingly or unknowingly,' Ballard said. 'A lot of businesses that operate in Mexico are going to have to be very careful and scrutinize their operations to make sure they are not inadvertently breaking these new laws.' Fines are already in the books to prosecute Americans inadvertently engaging in international money laundering. The terror designation now could mean jail time, he said.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Also, the subsidiaries of American companies in Mexico occasionally have been targeted for extortion by local criminals threatening to disrupt their operations or harm their employees. From now on, giving in to those threats could be interpreted as funding a terrorist organization, Ballard said. Further, if the U.S. and Mexico begin to inflict serious damage on cartel finances or jailing many of its leaders, there’s always the risk that these groups will lash back. Worst-case scenario 'What are the cartels going to do? That is the big question everyone has,' Ballard said. 'My worst-case scenario is these cartels have a lot of money, lot of firepower, a lot of armored vehicles. [….] You could see these groups morph into an insurgency a la FARC and ELN in Colombia. Those groups started as insurgencies, as guerilla groups and used drugs to fund their militancy. You could see the same but in reverse with drug trafficking groups turn into militant groups.' More likely, if backed into a corner and laying low no longer serving a practical purpose, Mexican cartels could experience further fracturing and discard restraints on kidnappings and extortion. 'You could see some of these cartels targeting American businesspeople or travelers in a way they were previously afraid to do,' Ballard said. 'If your assets, your operations get disrupted, you may feel like, ‘What do I have to lose? The attention of U.S. is already here. We are already public enemy No. 1.’' Trump to reinstate Title 42 border policy: Report The private security expert says he has not yet seen indications that will come to pass. But Global Guardian is urging corporations and travelers to monitor the situation in Mexico. 'Be cautious, keep track of what is going on, especially if you’re traveling to cartel heavy areas. Mexico City has its share of crime but no cartels controlling street violence or trafficking. But Guadalajara sits in the CJNG area of influence. If you go there, consider extra security,' Ballard said. Tourist destinations should still be relatively safe during spring break. 'Mexico still depends to a significant degree on foreign dollars,' he said. 'If we start seeing rhetoric that they’re going to start targeting Americans, our messaging will change accordingly.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/cartels-terror-designation/	2025-02-25T08:35:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP21310015365861.jpg?w=900
Republicans have doubts about whether House budget bill can get v...	(NewsNation) — Although President Donald Trump has called it a 'big, beautiful bill,' Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm over a budget plan pursued by the House that could come up for a vote as soon as Tuesday. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., has told reporters it is increasingly likely lawmakers will need to pass a stopgap bill to keep the government funded into the fall. House Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing for the bill — and jokingly asking for prayers as negotiations continue. At an event in Louisiana, however, he maintained confidence that 'we're going to get everyone there.' DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for Still, there are some doubts it can go forward. Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., told NewsNation partner The Hill that 'there’s probably 10 (Republicans) that are really nervous about the situation.' A trio of Republicans, per The Hill, have said they will vote against the proposal. Supporters of the bill say it fulfills Trump's campaign promises and addresses his full agenda — including extending his 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of the year. It would also provide about $300 billion in additional spending for the border and defense. However, the legislation also calls for up to $2 trillion in spending cuts, without laying out exactly what those would entail, along with a debt limit increase. The lack of detail about the potential cuts has some worried Medicaid is not off the table. Trump’s plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be costly 'I know the president has already indicated that he does not want to cut from beneficiaries,' Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., said. 'That's important for me to hear. The speaker has said the same. But then the question remains — how do we get to that $880 billion in savings, and what does it mean for the tax cuts?' Democrats have slammed the tax cuts, saying they would only benefit the wealthy, but they have not put forward alternative legislation. Instead, they are working with the House Appropriations Committee on a bill that would temporarily avoid a government shutdown before the March 14 deadline.

Musk gives federal workers ‘another chance’ to justify jobs	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk on Monday said hundreds of thousands of federal employees have 'another chance' to justify their recent accomplishments or risk losing their jobs. 'Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance. Failure to respond a second time will result in termination,' he wrote on social media, referring to an email asking federal employees to list five things they accomplished last week by 11:59 p.m. Monday. The directive appeared to contradict guidance from the Office of Personnel Management, which told federal departments and agencies responses were voluntary. Multiple federal agencies had instructed employees to disregard Musk's initial email, at least temporarily. There is no word yet on how many federal workers complied with the original directive. Federal workers rattled by Musk's ultimatum Musk, who oversees the Department of Government Efficiency, sent an email to hundreds of thousands of federal employees Saturday, giving them roughly 48 hours to report five specific things they had accomplished during the week prior. In a separate message posted on social media, Musk said any employee who failed to respond by the deadline — set in the email as 11:59 p.m. EST Monday — would lose their job. The OPM issued a memo Monday to federal departments and agencies, clarifying that it was not mandatory for workers to respond to the email. Could DOGE layoffs at the IRS impact your tax return? The office later clarified individual agencies must decide if they require responses and to determine the consequences of those who fail to do so. It added that agencies should consider whether the 'accomplishment bullets' should be integrated into the agency's weekly activity report. President Donald Trump signaled his support of Musk early Monday. Federal workers blast Musk-caused 'chaos' Musk’s unusual demand has faced resistance from several key U.S. agencies led by the president’s loyalists — including the FBI, State Department, Homeland Security and the Pentagon — which instructed their employees over the weekend not to comply. Lawmakers in both parties said that Musk’s mandate may be illegal, while unions are threatening to sue. Amid federal budget cuts, NewsNation has received messages from workers affected by the layoffs, with some departments letting longtime workers go. One federal worker from the Department of Health and Human Services shared an email with NewsNation they received at 5 p.m. ET Monday night. 'No HHS expectation that HHS employees respond to OPM and there is no impact to your employment with the agency if you choose not to respond,' the email read. Federal workers sue Elon Musk over email ultimatum However, if employees did respond, they were advised to tailor their answers as if 'malign foreign actors' might read them. A Veterans Affairs worker told NewsNation that some nurses came in on their day off Monday, bringing their children, to fill out the required bullet points. These workers were unable to access email from home due to firewall restrictions, creating anxiety about possible consequences. One VA worker expressed concern about how these changes could impact veterans’ services. 'Making efficient is one thing, shrinking and crippling is another,' the employee said. 'Ultimately, they are taking away protection and support for Americans. That is what I am most concerned about.'

Menendez brothers' evidence suggesting sexual abuse not credible:...	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman fired back at Mark Geragos, the Menendez brothers‘ attorney, dismissing his criticism and doubling down on his rejection of new evidence in the case. 'These new pieces of evidence add nothing to the self-defense argument. They are only additional information,' Hochman said Monday during an exclusive appearance on 'Banfield.' 'To meet the rigorous standards to get a new trial, this evidence doesn't come close.' What is the new evidence in the Menendez brothers' case? Hochman told reporters the evidence featured in the brothers’ habeas corpus petition had been made public for years prior. Their lawyers filed the petition in May of 2023, asking a judge to consider evidence suggesting they were sexually abused by their father. Last week, Geragos accused Hochman of rehashing outdated prosecutorial platitudes: 'The ’90s were calling, and they wanted their DA’s office back,' he said. A hearing about the resentencing was scheduled for January but postponed until March due to the wildfires in the Los Angeles region. Menendez brothers found guilty of murder in 1989 Lyle and Erik Menendez were found guilty of murdering their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Prosecutors denied that and accused them of killing their parents for money. In the years that followed, they repeatedly appealed their convictions without success. Since then, the brothers have had the support of most of their extended family, who have said they deserve to be free after decades behind bars. Several family members have said that, in today's world — which is more aware of the impact of sexual abuse — the brothers would not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life.

DOGE's Elon Musk to visit Fort Knox to ensure gold hasn't been 's...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump said during his speech at the CPAC conference that Elon Musk will be reviewing Fort Knox, the depository in Kentucky for American gold reserves, to ensure that gold still exists there. 'We're going to open up the doors. We're going to inspect Fort Knox,' Trump said. 'I don't want to open it and the cupboards are bare.' Inside Texas DPS’ war on human, drug smuggling According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, an audit is done on Fort Knox every year, and 'all the gold is present and accounted for.' What is the Fort Knox depository? The United States Bullion Depository, located at Fort Knox in Kentucky, has stored reserves for the United States since 1937. It is also used as the Army's human resources command center and is where the largest annual training for the Army is held each summer. Fort Knox is about 35 miles south of Louisville, Kentucky, and is over 100,000 acres. It was created during World War I as Camp Knox, an artillery range named after Major General Henry Knox, according to the Kentucky Historical Society Foundation. During World War II, the Army created the Armored Force there, ordering thousands of soldiers to go to Fort Knox and be introduced to the tank. It was known as the 'Home of Cavalry and Armor' for almost 80 years, according to The Associated Press. Elon Musk’s underground digital detective reveals all to NewsNation Then, in 2005, the Armor Center and School was moved to Georgia, and the Human Resource Command Center of Excellence was created in Fort Knox. How much gold is at Fort Knox? According to the United States Mint, the amount of gold holdings at Fort Knox currently adds up to 147.3 million ounces, with half of the Treasury's stored gold being kept there. The only gold that has ever been removed was extremely small to test the purity during the regularly scheduled audits. Those samples are the only gold from Fort Knox that has been transferred to or from the depository for years. The gold's book value is currently at $42.22 per ounce. The depository has about $436 billion worth of gold, according to Forbes. However, the government says the value of gold at Fort Knox is only $6 billion. Is Fort Knox secure? The depository is seen as extremely secure, with no one person having knowledge of every single procedure to open the vault, according to The Associated Press. FORT KNOX, KY - JULY 01: A cadet wielding an M249 fires in the direction of their opposing forces near the objective while other cadets move forward in Training Area 9 during Army ROTC Cadet Summer Training on July 1, 2021 in Fort Knox, Kentucky. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images) The only things that are publicly known include when the facility was built and how it was made. In 1936, the depository was made with 16,000 cubic feet of granite, 4,200 cubic yards of concrete, 750 tons of reinforcing steel and 670 tons of structural steel. It is heavily guarded and has only allowed visitors three separate times. One visit was on Sept. 23, 1974, when the vault was opened to journalists and a congressional delegation. Before this, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the only person to access the vaults. The second visit was on Aug. 24, 2017, when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin and congressional representatives visited. Why is Elon Musk visiting Fort Knox? The main reason is to see if the gold is still there. Starting last week, Musk posted on X, questioning if the gold was still present: 'Who is confirming that gold wasn't stolen from Fort Knox? Maybe it's there, maybe it's not. That gold is owned by the American public! We want to know if it's still there.' Federal workers sue Elon Musk over email ultimatum While there has been no evidence of missing gold at Fort Knox up to this point, Musk still posted on X, saying that there should be a live video walkthrough of the depository. Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday that it would be easy to have Fort Knox audited if that's what Trump wants. 'The gold was there when I visited it, and I hope nobody's moved it. I'm sure they haven't,' he added. Is this visit part of Elon Musk's DOGE initiatives? This visit doesn't seem directly related to the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) initiative to cut government spending.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-elon-musk-fort-knox-visit/	2025-02-24T14:21:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-515113728.jpg?w=900
Vivek Ramaswamy announces campaign for Ohio governor	(NewsNation) — Tech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy launched his campaign for Ohio governor on Monday. The Cincinnati native joins Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and Heather Hill in the 2026 GOP primary race to succeed term-limited Gov. Mike DeWine. The candidates are running the former bellwether state that has shifted red in recent years, having voted for President Donald Trump in the last three elections. On Monday Trump gave Ramaswamy his 'COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT' in a Truth Social post that reads in part: 'I know him well, competed against him, and he is something SPECIAL. He's Young, Strong, and Smart!' DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for Ramaswamy has never run for public office in Ohio but is positioned to be a party favorite for the governor's seat with his connections to Trump and Vice President JD Vance, formerly an Ohio senator. Ramaswamy has already received support from many politicians including Republican Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose. Ramaswamy sought the 2024 GOP nomination for president before dropping out to endorse Trump.

Could DOGE layoffs at the IRS impact your tax return?	(NewsNation) — The IRS has laid off 6,700 workers as part of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's goals with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These aren't the only federal workers that have been laid off, but one of the biggest questions Americans have right now is, 'Will the IRS layoffs impact my tax returns?' It is hard to know for sure. Adam Brewer, a tax attorney with AB Tax Law, told NewsNation that it's 'not an ideal time for layoffs.' However, he doesn't believe that it will affect many Americans, especially those who file electronically. Federal workers sue Elon Musk over email ultimatum These layoffs are happening as IRS employees who were involved in tax season were told earlier in February that they would not be allowed to accept the buyout offer from the Trump administration until mid-May, after the taxpayer-filling deadline. How could your tax return be impacted by IRS layoffs? If you file your return electronically, instead of by paper, then these layoffs might not affect your returns. 'Those taxpayers who always file by paper, I would say this is the year to cut that out,' Brewer said. 'You need to get with the times, so to speak.' Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told reporters that this could be a 'disaster for revenue.' According to the Associated Press, Williamson said, 'When you underpay and understaff the IRS, the agency doesn't have the power or the resources it needs to go after wealthy tax evaders with their high-priced lawyers.' Former President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, giving the IRS $80 billion and the ability to hire thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement. Are tax refund delays possible after IRS layoffs? Democrats from the Senate Finance Committee have warned about possible tax refund delays. In a statement, they said, 'Staffing reductions at the IRS resulting from Trump's hiring freeze and potential layoffs would likely delay tax refunds, harm taxpayer service and undermine law enforcement efforts.' Idaho judge unseals Bryan Kohberger closed hearing transcripts On the other hand, Brewer told NewsNation that, if you are someone who files electronically and receives your refund through direct deposit, there most likely won't be a delay. 'But, let's not take our eye off the ball. There's also a government shutdown that is possible mid-March. And so, should that happen, you know, that's really above my pay grade,' Brewer said. He also said he is more worried about the potential government shutdown causing delays.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/could-doge-layoffs-irs-impact-tax-return/	2025-02-24T09:30:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/6785723cca55f6.01223281.jpeg?w=900
Trump, Macron expected to discuss Russia-Ukraine war, tariffs	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday amid uncertainty regarding the future of longstanding alliances between the United States and European countries. Trump campaigned on quickly ending the war in Ukraine and has shifted the foreign policy landscape by speaking directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin in defiance of international efforts to freeze Putin out. Trump is conducting the negotiations without input from European leadership or Ukrainian officials and set up a meeting with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia. He has also repeatedly attacked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling the elected leader a dictator. Federal workers sue Elon Musk over email ultimatum Trump has falsely said Ukraine started the war, when it was Russia that invaded the country in February of 2022. Trump has made unprecedented demands on other European countries, including a desire to take over Greenland, which is currently under the control of Denmark, and demanding half of Ukraine's rare earth minerals in exchange for American support in the war and as back pay for previous assistance. He has also made demands in other areas of the world, suggesting the U.S. take over Canada, Gaza and the Panama Canal. There are fears those desires could shift the geopolitical landscape and bring an end to the country's role as a leading force for global stability and as an economic and moral leader. Pentagon investigating UFO whistleblower claims 'The only conclusion you can draw is that 80 years of policy in standing up against aggressors has just been blown up without any sort of discussion or reflection,' said Ian Kelly, a U.S. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administrations and now a professor at Northwestern University. Macron is expected to tell Trump that the U.S. and Europe should not show weakness to Russia and that how the negotiations are handled could impact future U.S. relations with China. However, Trump has long shown a level of respect and support for Putin that separates him from other Western leaders. He has often repeated Russian talking points in his campaign rallies and statements as president. Agriculture secretary will ‘do something’ about egg prices: Trump That has led to fears the European-U.S. alliance could be in jeopardy and sparked concerns of cracks in NATO with global consequences. European leaders meeting with Trump hope to shore up traditional ties and persuade Trump to include them in negotiations regarding Ukraine. Another topic likely to be addressed is Trump's plan for 'reciprocal tariffs' on goods, which his administration is expected to determine on a country-by-country basis. On Thursday, Trump is set to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Inside Texas DPS' war on human, drug smuggling	(NewsNation) — With migrant encounters continuing to trend downward on the border and President Trump pressuring Mexico to crack down on illegal immigration, the southern border isn’t seeing the thousands of migrants arriving like it did just a year ago. But that doesn't mean the crisis is over. There are still thousands of migrants in Mexico stuck in limbo after President Trump ended the CBP One Program. Now, smugglers in Mexico are capitalizing on the desperation of migrants and charging up to $18,000 to be smuggled across the Rio Grande. CBP credits Trump administration for 94% drop in border crossings NewsNation rode along with Texas State Troopers in the Rio Grande Valley, an area seeing an uptick in smuggling with migrants now trying to enter the U.S. undetected while smugglers look to make a sizeable profit. Within NewsNation's first hour with Texas Trooper Guadalupe Casarez, he received an alert from a camera showing individuals entering the U.S. illegally and attempting to hide in the brush. Border Patrol agents and Texas National Guard troops also arrived on the scene. NewsNation followed Casarez as he and BP agents cleared the brush and tracked the individuals' footsteps, eventually leading him to two Mexican nationals lying on the ground, attempting to hide from authorities. The men were handcuffed and said they planned to head to San Antonio. Instead, they could now face charges for smuggling. Border Patrol checked the two migrants closely — looking for tattoos or other signs that could link them to a gang or criminal group. Smugglers in Mexico are now moving in smaller groups, looking for areas not patrolled by Texas Troopers, the National Guard, or Border Patrol — all working together to deter smugglers. Plan for bounty hunters to pursue migrants has controls: Lawmaker In the Rio Grande Valley, Texas DPS troopers and Border Patrol are also working to stop drugs from entering the U.S. Last week, the two agencies intercepted 187 pounds of narcotics, arresting three Mexican nationals in Cameron County. The three men now face prosecution. Texas National Guard troops have arrested and processed migrants who attempted to enter near Roma, Texas, a location that has become a hotspot for migrant and drug smuggling in recent weeks. The goal for authorities here on the border is to stay one step ahead of smugglers in Mexico, who are now seeking to capitalize on the desperation of migrants still in Mexico looking for a way to enter the U.S.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/texas-dps-war-on-smuggling/	2025-02-24T08:05:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Texas-DPS-mounted-1.png?w=900
Idaho judge unseals Bryan Kohberger closed hearing transcripts	(NewsNation) —Transcripts from a closed hearing conducted by attorneys representing the University of Idaho killing suspect Bryan Kohberger were unsealed by an Idaho judge Monday. Ada County Judge Steven Hippler unsealed the 175-page partially redacted transcript of several witness interviews including law enforcement. The deaths of Madison Mogen, Kaylee Gonclaves, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin on Nov. 13, 2022, shocked the small town of Moscow, Idaho. The four students were stabbed in their home, with two of their surviving roommates finding them in the morning. Initially, investigators had few leads and spent considerable time tracing the activities of the four students in the hours prior to their deaths. However, after a little over a month, police arrested Kohberger for the crimes. Kohberger, accused of killing the four University of Idaho students, could face the death penalty if convicted, a judge ruled last November. Attorneys for Kohberger claimed local police detectives were too broad in the search warrant that gave them access to Kohberger’s apartment, car and electronic devices. Those searches led to the discovery of evidence that police say connects Kohberger to the killing of the four students.

Western leaders visit Kyiv and pledge military support against Ru...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — More than a dozen Western leaders attended events in Ukraine on Monday marking the third anniversary of the country's war with Russia, many pledging more military aid in a conspicuous show of support for Kyiv as uncertainty deepened over the commitment of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to helping it fend off Russia’s invasion. The fourth year of fighting could be pivotal, as Trump uses his return to office last month to press for a peace deal. But Ukrainian and European officials have been rattled by his cordial approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his tough words for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. World security is at stake in talks over how the war ends, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned. 'The autocrats around the world are watching very carefully whether there’s any impunity if you violate international borders or invade your neighbor, or if there is true deterrence,' she told a conference in Kyiv. Some observers say Russian success in Ukraine could embolden China’s own ambitions. Just as Moscow claims that Ukraine is rightfully Russian territory, China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own. In a cascade of unwelcome developments for Kyiv, Trump has in recent days called Zelenskyy a dictator, suggested Ukraine is to blame for the war and ended Putin’s three-year diplomatic isolation by the United States. U.S. officials have also indicated to Ukraine that its hopes of joining NATO are unlikely to be realized and that it probably won’t get back the land that Russia’s army has occupied, amounting to nearly 20% of the country. Meanwhile, Putin’s troops are making steady progress on the battlefield while Ukraine is grappling with shortages of troops and weapons. Some of Ukraine’s most important backers, including European leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were among the stream of dignitaries arriving by train in Kyiv. Others spoke at a conference via video link. The guests had similar messages: Ukraine and its European partners must be consulted in any peace negotiations, Putin’s ambitions must be thwarted, and Europe must take on more of the burden for its own defense. Alarm bells sound in Europe as Washington changes course The shift in Washington's policy has set off alarm bells in Europe, where governments fear being sidelined by the U.S. in efforts to secure a peace deal and are mulling how they might pick up the slack of any cut in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The changes have also placed strain on transatlantic relations. European Council President Antonio Costa on Sunday announced that he would convene an emergency summit of the 27 EU leaders in Brussels on March 6, with Ukraine at the top of the agenda. 'We are living a defining moment for Ukraine and European security,' he said in a post on social media. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are to both visit Washington this week. EU foreign ministers on Monday approved a new raft of sanctions against Russia. The measures target Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet' of ships that it uses to skirt restrictions on transporting oil and gas, or to carry stolen Ukrainian grain. The EU said 74 vessels were added to its shadow fleet list. Asset freezes and travel bans were imposed on 83 officials and 'entities' — usually government agencies, banks or companies. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country would provide a 1 billion-euro ($1.04 billion) military systems package to Ukraine this year. Starmer said Ukrainians’ voices 'must be at the heart of the drive for peace,' while Trump’s intervention had 'changed the global conversation' and 'created an opportunity.' 'Russia does not hold all the cards in this war,' he said. Coming off a victory in Sunday’s German elections, conservative leader Friedrich Merz — also a staunch backer of Ukraine — posted on X Monday: 'More than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength.' 'For a fair peace, the country that is under attack must be part of peace negotiations,' he wrote. Diplomacy ramps up after record Russian drone attack On Sunday, Russia launched its biggest single drone attack of the war, pounding Ukraine with 267 drones. The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, insisted that the U.S. cannot seal any peace deal to end the war without Ukraine or Europe being involved. She highlighted what she claimed were pro-Russian positions being taken up by the Trump administration. 'You can discuss whatever you want with Putin. But if it comes to Europe or Ukraine, then Ukraine and Europe also have to agree to this deal,' Kallas told reporters in Brussels, where she was chairing a meeting of EU foreign ministers. Kallas travels to Washington on Tuesday for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Washington and Moscow draw closer U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the third anniversary was 'a grim milestone.' 'More than 12,600 civilians killed, with many more injured. Entire communities reduced to rubble. Hospitals and schools destroyed,' he said in Geneva. Russia's foreign ministry said Saturday that preparations for a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin were underway, and U.S. officials have said that they had agreed with Moscow to reestablish diplomatic ties and restart economic cooperation. Kallas rejected Trump’s earlier inflammatory assertion that Zelenskyy was a dictator for not having held elections after his regular term expired last year, saying, 'Russia hasn’t had elections in 25 years.' Ukrainian law prohibits elections being held while martial law is in place, and Zelenksyy said as recently as Sunday that after martial law is lifted, 'there will be elections and people will make their choice.' ___ Associated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-foreign-leaders-visit-ukraines-capital-to-mark-3rd-war-anniversary/	2025-02-24T05:20:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67bc726ddd5989.49597104.jpeg?w=900
DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — As Elon Musk and the Trump administration increase efforts to reduce the federal government workforce, critics are voicing concerns over the chaotic and seemingly random cuts being made across Washington. However, some Republicans argue this is what voters want from the administration. But as the Department of Government Efficiency announces billions in government budget cuts, the question remains: is it actually saving as much money as it claims? Some of the items listed on DOGE's public listing of the billions of dollars in purported savings don't seem to add up as the agency suggests. DOGE receipts aren't adding up DOGE claims it has found $55 billion in savings, touting layoffs, canceled contracts, lease renegotiations and fraud detection in the first month of the second Trump administration. However, a closer examination of the numbers raises doubts about these claims. The website's listing mentions USAID and the Department of Education as the two largest agencies contributing to contract savings. It even features a 'wall of receipts' showing the reported spending slashes. How much federal data has Trump really purged? Despite claiming billions of dollars in savings, DOGE has not provided evidence for approximately $38 billion of that — nearly 75% of its total claim. For example, DOGE claims to have saved $8 billion by canceling a tech support contract for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Office of Diversity and Civil Rights. However, that contract value was worth just $8 million, with the $8 billion figure likely due to a clerical error from when the government first filed the contract. Despite apparent accounting issues, Republicans continue to voice their support for Musk and DOGE. 'I think American voters like the intensity and focus that they've seen from 30-some days of this administration — going about doing the things they told voters they were going to do. Doing the things they were elected to do,' Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said on 'FOX News Sunday.' 'When you're staring down $36 trillion in debt and counting, obviously something has to give, and I think that's what we're seeing right now. A comprehensive forensic audit of every department and agency in the federal government,' Rep. Mike Lawler, R-NY, said on ABC's 'This Week.' DOGE has stated it will update its savings website twice a week, so corrections could be forthcoming. Poll: Just 37% of Americans think DOGE is cutting waste Several new polls suggest Americans are growing uneasy about DOGE and its results. A poll from Emerson College and the Washington Post shows more Americans disapprove of Musk's handling of DOGE. That's in line with a Pew Research Center poll that puts Musk's favorability rating at 42%. The Washington Post found that just 37% think DOGE is cutting wasteful spending. Elon Musk responds to ‘DOGE check’ suggestion A Morning Consult Pro poll shows that number is even lower, reporting that 31% think shrinking the government should be a top priority for the administration. Musk, Trump float DOGE stimulus checks idea However, that sentiment could change if the administration's proposed plan for DOGE stimulus checks becomes a reality. The plan claims to put as much as 20% of whatever the agency cuts from the federal budget directly into Americans' pockets.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-claims-saved-billions-38b-unaccounted-for/	2025-02-24T04:34:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67abd7fbe34323.91974328.jpeg?w=900
Pope Francis awake, resting after 10th night in hospital	(NewsNation) — Pope Francis woke Monday morning and is resting after spending a 10th night at Gemelli Hospital in Rome, battling early signs of kidney failure, the Vatican said. 'The night went well; the Pope slept and is resting,' the Holy See Press Office said in a one-line statement Monday. The 88-year-old pontiff was hospitalized for bronchitis Feb. 14 and subsequently treated for double pneumonia. He received blood transfusions and high levels of oxygen over the weekend and remains in 'critical condition.' Pope Francis has ‘mild’ kidney failure: What is it? This hospital stay is tied for the longest hospitalization of his papacy. In 2021, Francis spent 10 days at Gemelli Hospital for a partial colon removal, according to the Associated Press. Doctors said their biggest concern now is the risk of germs that could enter his bloodstream and cause sepsis, a life-threatening infection. Medical staff said he will stay hospitalized at least through next weekend.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/pope-francis-10th-night-hospital/	2025-02-24T03:08:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6766d67e66a947.38047520.jpeg?w=900
2,000 USAID staff to be cut, others put on administrative leave	The Trump administration is putting all civil servants employed by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on administrative leave beginning Monday at midnight, according to a notice reviewed by The Hill. At the same time, 2,000 staff are expected to be cut from the agency in the U.S., part of a 'Reduction-in-Force,' reads the notice delivered from the Office of the Administrator. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is the acting USAID administrator, but no name is on the order. The notice comes following a federal judge on Friday refusing to renew a temporary block against the Trump administration and its intent to fire or place on 'administrative leave' thousands of employees. Musk doubles down on email ultimatum after agencies push back Following the order, hundreds of employees contracted to work with USAID were fired. In one bureau providing lifesaving humanitarian assistance, one USAID official estimated the firing of contractors cut staff by between 40 and 60 percent. 'There is no one left to do any work,' the USAID official said, requesting anonymity to protect against retaliation. The move to eliminate thousands of USAID’s workforce marks another chapter in the Trump administration’s attack on the independent agency, the primary venue for America’s distribution of lifesaving humanitarian and developmental assistance. The Trump administration first ordered all staff be put on administrative leave Feb. 2, which was initially blocked by a court order six days later. President Trump and his officials have focused on dismantling the agency in the wake of an initial blanket freeze on all U.S. foreign assistance. While Rubio said he is approving waivers to exempt lifesaving humanitarian assistance and allow that USAID work to continue, the mass reductions in staff are eliminating key roles for carrying it out. Trump delegated tech billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency to root out what he and his supporters describe as wasteful and fraudulent spending and accused USAID of operating with a liberal bias. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? The administrator’s order putting staff on administrative leave impacts all USAID staff in the U.S. and around the world. Some staff are expected to be notified by 5 p.m. Feb. 23 that they are exempt, with their positions deemed 'mission critical,' part of 'core leadership and/or specially designated programs.' The administration further is recalling overseas personnel, providing a 'voluntary Agency-funded return travel program and other benefits,' according to another notice reviewed by The Hill. In the court ruling issued Friday, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols said USAID employees 'overstated' the harm those employees stood to face if put on administrative leave. 'The record now reflects that no USAID employee stationed abroad has been or imminently will be required to return to the United States within thirty days,' Nichols wrote. 'Rather, as matters presently stand, USAID employees stationed abroad have been given a choice.' The administrative leave order likely impacts the agency's civil servant workforce, staff who undergo thorough and exhaustive hiring procedures, are vetted for classified security clearances, are highly educated and experienced, and are put in the system with an expectation of decades of service. Trump suggests Musk needs to be ‘more aggressive’ One USAID official, who requested anonymity to protect against retaliation, described the past month as 'psychological torment.' While staff on administrative leave may retain access to their emails and USAID systems, they are not permitted to do work. 'If most civil servants in D.C. go back on admin leave tonight, you will have a few handfuls of civil servants left and they cannot do the work — in skill set or in numbers — of the bureau,' the USAID official said. 'We are, for now, dead. Last night and all week we lost centuries of collective experience.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/usaid-staff-cuts/	2025-02-23T15:27:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25053685599397-e1740253277560.jpg?w=900
Pope Francis has 'mild' kidney failure: What is it?	(NEXSTAR) — Doctors revealed Sunday that blood tests for Pope Francis, the 88-year-old pontiff who has been hospitalized since Valentine's Day after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened, show early kidney failure. Every day, roughly 360 people in the U.S. begin treatment (either dialysis or a transplant) for kidney failure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A patient is considered to be experiencing kidney failure if under 15 percent of their kidney is 'working normally,' the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases says. Pope Francis remains in ‘critical condition’ with signs of early kidney failure Some of Pope Francis' blood tests showed 'initial, mild, kidney failure,' but doctors said it was under control. The Vatican did not provide any details about Pope Francis' condition or what treatment, if any, he was receiving for his kidney failure. Candles are seen near pictures of Pope Francis outside the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, Sunday, Feb. 23, 2025, where the Pontiff is hospitalized since Feb. 14. (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) There are some early warning signs of kidney failure — fatigue, nausea, vomiting, confusion, difficulty concentrating, swelling, change in urination frequency, cramps, dry skin, and food tasting metallic among them — but they may go unnoticed early on, per the Cleveland Clinic. During kidney failure, one or both of a person's kidneys will no longer function well on their own, the Cleveland Clinic explains. In some cases, kidney failure is temporary and develops quickly. In others, it can be a long-term condition that worsens over time. Should the condition worsen, it can reach end-stage kidney disease, or ESKD. This stage, according to the Cleveland Clinic, is deadly without the proper treatment. With it, however, patients can 'have a good quality of life while [they] manage kidney failure.' While doctors did not indicate what may have caused Francis' kidney failure, the National Kidney Foundation says diabetes and high blood pressure comprise roughly two-thirds of cases. Other potential causes include various forms of kidney damage and genetic disorders. Prebiotic sodas: What are they, and why are they everywhere? Those experiencing kidney failure may be at a higher risk of experiencing heart disease, stroke, and anemia, among other complications. Francis developed anemia and, during blood transfusions on Saturday, was given hematin, a treatment designed to increase the level of hemoglobin in his blood, which in turn helps the blood carry more oxygen. Doctors reported Sunday that the therapy had been beneficial. The National Kidney Foundation notes that high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke can both cause kidney disease and occur as a result of it. There is no cure for kidney failure but treatment plans, medications, eating plans, and an active lifestyle can help those living with it, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases explains. The life expectancy of someone experiencing kidney failure can vary depending on 'many things,' the American Kidney Fund says, including age and treatment plan. When will this cold winter end? NOAA releases hopeful outlook The Vatican described Francis as remaining in critical condition but alert and 'well-oriented' on Sunday, adding that he attended Mass. He had also not experienced any more respiratory crises since Saturday night but was still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen. 'The complexity of the clinical picture, and the necessary wait for drug therapies to provide some feedback, dictate that the prognosis remains guarded,' Francis' doctors concluded.

Surviving Hamas: The story of Keith Siegel, an Israeli American h...	(NewsNation) — Tortured, starved and holding onto life without lights or water, Keith Siegel’s story is one of survival. In Hamas captivity for 484 days during the war in Gaza, the Israeli American was released Feb. 1, along with two other hostages that day. He was the first American to be freed. Though he’s doing 'OK' now, Keith didn’t think he would live to see freedom, his wife told NewsNation's 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' Sunday morning. This undated photo provided by Hostages Family Forum shows Keith Siegel, who was abducted and brought to Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023. (Hostages Family Forum via AP) 'He went through so many days of torture and so many times of minutes that he didn't think that he would survive,' said Aviva Siegel, a survivor herself. American-Israeli hostage ‘born again’ after Hamas release: Father In the beginning of Keith's transition to freedom, he wanted to be alone, Aviva said, but she understood. A redeeming moment following the tragedy was meeting his grandchildren. 'They all cried. And to see my grandson that's 10 years old crying and just hugging kids and not letting go,' Aviva said. 'We are just the happiest people in Earth to have him back.' Surviving Hamas A man, identified as Keith Siegel, 64, speaks in a video released by Hamas on April 27, 2024, that appeared to show two Israeli hostages who have been held in the Gaza Strip since the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in this screen grab taken from a handout video. (Credit: Hamas Military Wing/Handout via Reuters) Hamas militants paraded him in front of a crowd, a consistent feature of the hostage releases in which some smiled and waved despite appearing physically weak. 'For the last half a year, he was lying on the mattress on the floor. And he was alone most of the time. He didn't have anybody to talk to anybody to feel that he's with somebody, just with the Arabs and with the Hamas terrorists.' He lost 50 kilograms – 110 pounds. 'We're going to bring back the hostages': Ex-Israeli PM Keith recorded a message about his experience after he was released. 'I was starved and I was tortured, both physically and emotionally,' Keith said in the video. 'When the war intensified, the terrorists who helped me treated me even worse than usual. Terrorists kicked me, spat on me and held me with no water, no light and no air to breathe.' Now that her husband is home, Aviva said she feels 'like a different person,' but she is heartbroken for the families who haven’t been reunited with their loved ones, saying captivity is like 'going through hell.' 'Nobody in this world should go through with what I went through and what Keith went through,' she said. She was held hostage for nearly two months, released long before her husband.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admonished Hamas’ actions, calling the charades 'disgraceful ceremonies.' Hamas has said it would release four hostages next week. Netanyahu’s ultimatum puts the phase-two negotiations and the fate of the remaining living hostages into question as the war drags on past 500 days. Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas’ body returned to family after ID mix-up On Saturday, six hostages were liberated in the final release of the first phase of the three-part ceasefire deal. Last week was an unexpected rollercoaster of emotions when it came to another family, the Bibases. Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas’ body was supposed to be returned last week, along with the bodies of her two sons and another hostage, Oded Lifshitz. Hamas had turned over the wrong body to Israel, now determined to be that of an unidentified Palestinian woman. Days later, Bibas' body was returned to her family. Hearing the news, 'just broke my heart ... I think it's just a slap in the face,' Aviva said. 'I didn't even think that they're able to do something so cruel. But they did.' Her message to the Israeli government: 'Get them out now. Don't even think of (causing) any problems because we need them back now. We need them back alive.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/surviving-hamas-keith-siegel-israeli-american-hostage/	2025-02-23T08:35:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2040411422.jpg?w=900
Musk doubles down on email ultimatum; Patel tells FBI staff to wa...	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk has reiterated the need for federal government employees to explain their weekly tasks as he and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) look to scale back operations. Musk, who was hand-picked by President Trump to examine and cut federal spending, explained why he believes it is necessary on X on Sunday. 'The reason this matters is that a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!' he said. 'In some cases, we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks. In other words, there is outright fraud.' Hegseth defends Trump’s firings of Pentagon leaders and says there may be more dismissals Musk announced on Saturday that civil servants will be asked to send an email explaining what they accomplished last week. Those who don’t comply will be fired, he said. Newly-appointed FBI Director Kash Patel sent a message to the FBI workforce on Saturday night telling them not to reply to the emails. 'The FBI through the Ofice of the Director, is in charge of all our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,' Patel wrote. 'When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-doubles-down-fed-workers-explanation/	2025-02-23T08:10:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2187754492.jpg?w=900
Trump directs ICE agents to find, deport unaccompanied migrant ch...	WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The Trump administration is directing immigration agents to track down hundreds of thousands of migrant children who entered the United States without their parents, expanding the president's mass deportation effort, according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo outlines an unprecedented push to target migrant children who crossed the border illegally as unaccompanied minors. It lays out four phases of implementation, beginning with a planning phase on January 27, though it did not provide a start date for enforcement operations. More than 600,000 immigrant children have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without a parent or legal guardian since 2019, according to government data, as the number of migrants caught crossing illegally reached record levels. Tens of thousands have been ordered deported over the same time frame, including more than 31,000 for missing court hearings, immigration court data show. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to a request for comment about the memo and the Trump administration's plans. During his first term, Trump introduced a 'zero tolerance' policy that led to the separation of migrant children from their parents at the border. The children were sent to children's shelters run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), a government agency housed within the Department of Health and Human Services, while their parents were detained or deported. The separation of families, including babies from nursing mothers, was met with widespread international outrage. Trump halted the policy in 2018, though up to 1,000 children may still remain separated from parents, according to Lee Gelernt, the lead American Civil Liberties Union attorney in a related legal challenge. As well as enforcing immigration laws, the memo, headlined the 'Unaccompanied Alien Children Joint Initiative Field Implementation,' said the initiative aims to ensure that children are not victims of human trafficking or other forms of exploitation. The memo said the children would be served a notice to appear in immigration court or deported, if deportation orders were pending against them. In the memo, ICE said it had collected data from a number of sources on unaccompanied minors and sorted them into three priority groups, 'flight risk', 'public safety' and 'border security.' It directed agents to focus on children deemed 'flight risks' - including those ordered deported for missing court hearings and those released to sponsors who are not blood relatives. The agency uses several databases and government records to track down targets. DNA tests Under the law, migrants who have exhausted their legal options to stay can be removed, even if they are children. But the U.S. government has limited resources and typically prioritizes arresting adults with criminal records. Unaccompanied children began arriving in large numbers a decade ago due to violence and economic instability in their home countries - and U.S. immigration policies that enabled them to enter and often remain. The majority are from Central America and Mexico. Some migrated to join parents already in the United States; many traveled with family members or smugglers. From ORR custody, children are released to sponsors, usually parents or relatives, as immigration authorities weigh their cases to remain in the country. Trump's border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly claimed that some 300,000 unaccompanied children went missing during Biden's presidency and were at risk of trafficking and exploitation. Beyond initial follow-up calls, ORR was not obligated to track the whereabouts of the children after they left custody. Many are now adults or living with their parents. Individual ICE field offices will determine 'how to best locate, make contact, and serve immigration documents as appropriate for individual targets, when conducting enforcement actions,' involving unaccompanied children, the memo said. Because the children often live in households with adults without authorization to be in the United States, their addresses could also help ICE boost its overall arrest numbers. During his first administration, Trump used data gathered to vet sponsors of unaccompanied children to target them for arrests. Since taking office on January 20, Trump has taken steps to tighten vetting of sponsors. These include requiring sponsors and adult household members to submit fingerprints for background checks, according to guidance issued last week. The Trump administration has also expanded its access to ORR's database of children and their sponsors, two sources familiar with the matter said. Mellissa Harper, a former ICE official who now heads ORR, told a staff meeting on Thursday that the agency plans to use DNA tests to establish familial relationships, one of the sources said. It was unclear whether DNA tests would be used only on cases that raised a red flag, or on a routine basis. Harper said at the meeting that ICE was pursuing 247,000 tips related to fraud, trafficking and smuggling of unaccompanied minors and referring cases to the FBI for further investigation, the person said.

Pope Francis remains in 'critical condition' after blood transfus...	(NewsNation) — Pope Francis had a 'peaceful night' Saturday after receiving blood transfusions and high levels of oxygen to treat his double pneumonia, the Vatican said Sunday, but remains in 'critical condition.' Francis took to social media to express his gratitude to supporters, writing, 'I've recently received many messages of affection, and I've been particularly struck by the letters and drawings from children. Thank you for your closeness, and for the consoling prayers I have received from all over the world.' The pontiff, who entered the papacy at age 76 in 2013, is being treated at Gemelli Hospital in Italy where he was initially admitted for bronchitis on Feb.14. He has missed Sunday Mass in back-to-back weeks after suffering a severe and prolonged respiratory crisis requiring oxygen. Pope Francis’ health ‘looking very serious’: Vatican reporter Though not on a ventilator, Francis is struggling to breathe and is keeping his movement limited, according to officials. Still, he remains alert, sitting upright, working and joking, though a bit more fatigued than the day before. The pope also received blood transfusions after tests revealed thrombocytopenia, a condition of abnormally low levels of platelets in the blood. Doctors said their biggest concern now is the risk of germs that could enter his bloodstream and cause sepsis, a life-threatening infection. His medical team says he's expected to return to the Vatican, which may be unsurprising, as he has said previously that the position of pope is a lifelong commitment. Tens of thousands attend funeral of late Hezbollah leader Despite his illness, Francis mentioned the war in Ukraine, saying 'Tomorrow (Feb. 23) will be the 3rd anniversary of the large-scale war against Ukraine. A pain. And shameful occasion for the whole of humanity,' going on to call for the 'gift of peace in all armed conflicts around the world.' Doctors said he will stay hospitalized at least through next weekend. A mass for the pope in his native city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, is expected at 9:15 a.m. Sunday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/pope-francis-peaceful-night-blood-transfusions-pneumonia/	2025-02-23T06:40:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6744708927ada3.30930926.jpeg?w=900
Pope Francis rested during a peaceful night following respiratory...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis, in critical condition with a complicated lung infection, rested well during a peaceful night following a respiratory crisis and blood transfusions, the Vatican said Sunday. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni's one-line statement didn't mention if Francis was up or eating breakfast. 'The night passed quietly, the pope rested.' The brief update came after doctors said the 88-year-old pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was in critical condition. On Saturday morning, he suffered a prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis while being treated for pneumonia and a complex lung infection. The pope received 'high flows' of oxygen to help him breathe. He also received blood transfusions after tests showed low counts of platelets, which are needed for clotting, the Vatican said in a late update. The Saturday statement also said that the pontiff 'continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday.' Doctors said the prognosis was 'reserved.' Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. The main threat facing the pope is sepsis They have warned that the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition. Saturday’s blood tests showed that he had developed a low platelet count, a condition called platelopenia or thrombocytopenia. Platelets are cell-like fragments that circulate in the blood that help form blood clots to stop bleeding or help wounds heal. Low platelet counts can be caused by a number of things, including side effects from medicines or infections, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Francis, who has chronic lung disease and is prone to bronchitis in winter, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed 'absolute rest' and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Vatican hierarchy tamps down speculation Francis might resign Meanwhile, the Vatican hierarchy went on the defensive to tamp down rumors and speculation that Francis might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The pope remains fully conscious, alert, eating and working. The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to speculation and rumors about a possible resignation. It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret. Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat-out denied that any such meeting occurred. Parolin said such speculation seemed 'useless' when what really mattered was the health of Francis, his recovery and return to the Vatican. 'On the other hand, I think it is quite normal that in these situations uncontrolled rumors can spread or some misplaced comment is uttered. It is certainly not the first time it has happened,' Parolin was quoted as saying. 'However, I don’t think there is any particular movement, and so far I haven’t heard anything like that.' Holy Year celebrations continue without pope Deacons, meanwhile, were gathering at the Vatican for their special Holy Year weekend. Francis got sick at the start of the Vatican’s Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. This weekend, Francis was supposed to have celebrated deacons, a ministry in the church that precedes ordination to the priesthood. In his place, the Holy Year organizer was to celebrate Sunday’s Mass, the Vatican said. And for the second consecutive weekend, Francis is skipping his traditional Sunday noon blessing, which he could have delivered from Gemelli if he were up to it. 'Look, even though he’s not (physically) here, we know he’s here,' said Luis Arnaldo López Quirindongo, a deacon from Ponce, Puerto Rico, who was at the Vatican on Saturday for the Jubilee celebration. 'He’s recovering, but he’s in our hearts and is accompanying us, because our prayers and his go together.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Plan for bounty hunters to pursue migrants has controls: Lawmaker	(NewsNation) — A Missouri state lawmaker says his proposal to have bounty hunters track down undocumented immigrants includes guardrails. Under Republican Sen. David Gregory’s bill, state authorities would create a program to certify bounty hunters 'for the purpose of finding and detaining illegal aliens' in Missouri. Gregory said only migrants for whom arrest warrants have been issued would be targeted by the state system. 'It’s not allowing anyone to determine for themselves who to investigate. It’s not allowing any bounty hunters to kick in doors and demand papers — that’s not what this is,' Gregory, said Saturday during an appearance on 'NewsNation Prime.' How ICE finds criminal suspects living illegally in US He said his plan would effectively be a state version of what U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is doing under the Trump administration — going after criminal migrants who pose a threat to local communities. The ACLU of Missouri has promised legal challenges and a former top official with U.S. ICE under President Joe Biden called Gregory’s proposal 'absurd.' 'It puts the communities at risk,' he said Saturday. 'It will build fear into the system. It’ll create these blurred lines between actual law enforcement work by state and locals, by the cities, by the federal government, and blend it with untrained individuals going into homes or doing arrests.' The Missouri bill also would create a telephone hotline and other reporting methods for people to alert authorities about illegal aliens. Informants would be eligible to receive rewards of $1,000.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/bounty-hunters-to-pursue-migrants/	2025-02-22T19:51:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/E7F87C963E210A1C7E650BBB4266A18C.jpg?w=574
Pope Francis' health 'looking very serious': Vatican reporter	(NewsNation) — When EWTN Global Catholic TV Network Vatican correspondent Colm Flynn last saw Pope Francis, the Holy Father was 'in good spirits' but visibly 'struggling to catch his breath.' Flynn pointed to the Pope's compromised lungs — part of his right lung was removed in his youth after a bout of pneumonia — and advanced age as potential cause for concern. 'Things are looking very serious here in the Eternal City today,' Flynn said Saturday on 'NewsNation Prime.' Flynn last saw the Pope on Wednesday, Feb. 12, just two days before he was admitted to the hospital. The Vatican said in a Saturday statement that the 88-year-old is in 'critical condition' after suffering a long asthmatic respiratory crisis that required high flows of oxygen.

'The Holy Father continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday. At the moment the prognosis is reserved,' the statement said. While it's not Pope Francis' first health scare, Flynn said the general feeling in Rome is that this one might be his last. 'This time, there is a feeling that it's more serious, because that press conference that they held yesterday at the Gemelli Hospital, that was the first time that his doctors, his own personal doctors, spoke to us journalists,' Flynn said.

The IRS is firing thousands of workers. Will it affect your tax r...	(NEXSTAR) – With the IRS laying off thousands of employees Thursday, many Americans may be wondering if their tax returns — or their refunds — will be affected. A government official who asked to remain anonymous confirmed news of the IRS culling 6,700 employees to Nexstar's NewsNation. It represents the latest mass termination amid an ongoing purge of federal workers by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's DOGE. 'If you asked me a month ago if the IRS would reduce their staffing, I would say yeah, I think it'll happen, but probably not until April 16 (the day after tax season ends),' tax expert Adam Brewer, of AB Tax Law, told Nexstar. 'Practically speaking, it doesn't make any sense, but here we are.' The firings are happening despite IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season being told earlier this month that they would not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until mid-May, after the taxpayer filing deadline. Social Security given $205 billion boost due to COVID deaths It's not entirely clear how dismissing nearly 7,000 of the roughly 90,000 IRS workers will affect the filing process, but Brewer has been advising clients to safeguard themselves by doing the following: File and pay any owed taxes electronically Make sure your refund can be deposited directly Take care to make sure the return is accurate and complete If you need to request payments by installment, do so online 'If you send in a paper return, at a minimum someone at the IRS has to be there to open the envelope, and we saw in the pandemic that doesn't get done when they get really far behind,' Brewer said. 'We've had situations where people send in payments, they never get cashed, and all of a sudden there's additional penalties and interest.' Taxpayers can check the status of their refunds using the IRS' Where’s My Refund? tool and via the IRS2GO app. Eggs seized at border as prices hit record highs in US Who was fired? The layoffs affect probationary employees with roughly one year or less of service at the agency and largely include workers in compliance departments, according to the person, who was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday. Compliance work includes ensuring that taxpayers are abiding by the tax code, filing their returns and paying their taxes, among other duties. Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said on a Thursday call with reporters that the layoffs at the IRS will disproportionately harm enforcement efforts. 'When you underpay and understaff the IRS, the agency doesn’t have the power or the resources it needs to go after wealthy tax evaders with their high priced lawyers,' she said, adding, 'The result is, of course, a disaster for revenue.' Charitable donations: What’s tax-deductible? The layoffs are part of the Trump administration's intensified efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection. In addition to the planned layoffs, the Trump administration intends to lend IRS workers to the Department of Homeland Security to assist with immigration enforcement. In a letter sent earlier this month, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to borrow IRS workers to help with ongoing immigration crackdown efforts.

Vance is overwhelming favorite to be Trump's successor in CPAC st...	Vice President Vance emerged as the clear favorite to be President Trump's successor in the MAGA movement in a new straw poll conducted at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Saturday. Sixty-one percent of CPAC's 1,022 attendees said they would support Vance as the future GOP standard bearer. Twelve percent said they would support Trump’s former adviser and right-wing media personality Steve Bannon, while seven percent said the same about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R). Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s UN ambassador nominee Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) each received three percent support. Donald Trump Jr., Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Vivek Ramaswamy, who is expected to launch a gubernatorial bid in Ohio next week, all got two percent support. Trump fires top US general in unprecedented Pentagon shakeup Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders (R), Florida Sen. Rick Scott (R ), Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Trump’s former GOP presidential primary rival Nikki Haley all received one percent support. Four percent said they were undecided. CPAC’s straw poll was conducted by Republican pollster Jim McLaughlin. The same poll unsurprisingly showed Trump with a 99 percent approval rating with the staunchly pro-Trump crowd, with 95 percent saying they strongly approved. Vance was the first speaker at this year’s CPAC, while Trump is set to close the annual gathering on Saturday. Earlier this month Trump told Fox News declined to name Vance as his automatic successor, saying it was 'too early.' However, Trump praised his vice president as 'very capable' in the interview.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/vance-is-overwhelming-favorite-to-be-trumps-successor-in-cpac-straw-poll/	2025-02-22T13:25:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/vancejd_022025gn09_w.jpg?w=900
Trump chides Maine governor at CPAC after clash at White House	National Harbor, Md. – President Trump chided Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday after the two clashed the day before at the White House over transgender athletes in women’s sports. 'You saw Maine yesterday, right? The governor of Maine,' Trump said, eliciting boos from the audience. 'She’s fighting to keep men in women’s sports. You ever see what happens to a woman when a woman boxes a man who transitioned to womanhood? You ever see what happens? It’s not pretty.' 'Let her do that fight. Let them all do that fight,' Trump said. Trump suggests Musk needs to be ‘more aggressive’ Mills went head-to-head with Trump at the National Governors Association session at the White House on Friday after the president told a group of Republican governors that he would withhold funding from the state over its refusal to comply with an executive order barring transgender athletes from competing in women and girls' sports. Trump directly asked the governor during the session whether the state would follow the order, to which Mills responded, 'I’m complying with state and federal law.' 'We are the federal law.

Social Security given $205 billion boost due to COVID deaths	(NewsNation) — Almost five years on from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Social Security trust fund has financially benefited following the deaths of more than a million Americans. More than one million Americans died from the coronavirus between 2020 and 2023, meaning those premature deaths saved billions and billions in Social Security payments. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, around $294 billion has been saved as a result. The figure would have been higher if not for lost tax revenue offsetting the total by approximately $205 billion. Survivor benefits to children and spouses of the deceased contributed to the money saved by the Social Security trust. Trump suggests Musk needs to be ‘more aggressive’ The researchers did note that COVID can have other impacts on Social Security, with long-COVID sufferers or others affected by the pandemic, may dip into their benefits more prematurely than pre-pandemic. Jeff Williams, U.S. president and CEO of benefits administration company, Aptia, tells NewsNation that Americans should have a multi-faceted plan before retiring. 'It’s understandable to worry about Social Security, but a strong retirement plan goes beyond just one source of income,' Williams said. 'Taking a proactive approach—factoring in healthcare costs, savings, and available benefits—can help provide long-term financial security and an easier transition into retirement,' he added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/social-security-given-205-billion-boost-thanks-to-covid-deaths/	2025-02-22T11:08:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67afb3eedf8867.99034960.jpeg?w=900
Pope Francis is in critical condition after long respiratory cris...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis was in critical condition Saturday after he suffered a long asthmatic respiratory crisis that required high flows of oxygen, the Vatican said. The 88-year-old Francis, who has been hospitalized for a week with pneumonia and a complex lung infection, also received blood transfusions after tests showed low platelet counts associated with anemia, the Vatican said in a late update. 'The Holy Father continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday. At the moment the prognosis is reserved,' the statement said. Doctors have said Francis' condition is touch-and-go and that he is by no means out of danger. They have warned that the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition. Francis, who has chronic lung disease, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed 'absolute rest' and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Dr. Sergio Alfieri, the head of medicine and surgery at Rome’s Gemelli hospital, said the biggest threat facing Francis was that some of the germs that are currently located in his respiratory system pass into the bloodstream, causing sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ failure and death. 'Sepsis, with his respiratory problems and his age, would be really difficult to get out of,' Alfieri told a news conference Friday at Gemelli. 'The English say ‘knock on wood,’ we say ‘touch iron.’ Everyone touch what they want,' he said as he tapped the microphone. 'But this is the real risk in these cases: that these germs pass to the bloodstream.' 'He knows he's in danger,' Alfieri added. 'And he told us to relay that.' Meanwhile, the Vatican hierarchy went on the defensive to tamp down rumors and speculation that Francis might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The pope remains fully conscious, alert, eating and working. The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to speculation and rumors about a possible resignation. It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret. Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat-out denied that any such meeting occurred. Parolin said such speculation seemed 'useless' when what really mattered was the health of Francis, his recovery and return to the Vatican. 'On the other hand, I think it is quite normal that in these situations uncontrolled rumors can spread or some misplaced comment is uttered. It is certainly not the first time it has happened,' Parolin was quoted as saying. 'However, I don’t think there is any particular movement, and so far I haven’t heard anything like that.' Deacons, meanwhile, were gathering at the Vatican for their special Holy Year weekend. Francis got sick at the start of the Vatican’s Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. This weekend, Francis was supposed to have celebrated deacons, a ministry in the church that precedes ordination to the priesthood. In his place, the Holy Year organizer will celebrate Sunday’s Mass, the Vatican said. And for the second consecutive weekend, Francis was expected to skip his traditional Sunday noon blessing, which he could have delivered from Gemelli if he were up to it. 'Look, even though he's not (physically) here, we know he's here,' said Luis Arnaldo López Quirindongo, a deacon from Ponce, Puerto Rico, who was at the Vatican on Saturday for the Jubilee celebration. 'He's recovering, but he's in our hearts and is accompanying us, because our prayers and his go together.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Trump suggests Musk needs to be 'more aggressive'	(The Hill) -- President Trump suggested in a new post that tech billionaire Elon Musk, one of his closest allies, needs to be 'more aggressive' — presumably referring to his efforts to slash spending, downsize the federal workforce and eviscerate fraud via the newly-formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 'ELON IS DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE,' Trump wrote Saturday in a post on Truth Social. 'REMEMBER, WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO SAVE, BUT ULTIMATELY, TO MAKE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. MAGA!' Musk, who leads six major companies, and DOGE staffers have gone after several federal agencies over the past month looking to overhaul the federal workforce — including initiatives that would nearly dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Education Department. The commission said earlier this week that it saved the government $55 billion by canceling grants, selling assets, reducing teams and by axing contracts and leases. The Trump administration has offered buyouts to many civil service workers. So far, more than 75,000 government employees have accepted the offer. DOGE has been under fire from Democrats and various organizations for the actions it's taken during the president's first month back in office. Critics have urged the advisory board to shed more transparency into their conduct. The group has faced lawsuits, with 14 states saying the board’s cuts are unconstitutional, and others questioning the commission's access to payment systems at the Treasury Department, which has since been blocked. Musk's influence over the administration has also been under the microscope, with many citing his potential conflicts of interest. Trump has consistently defended Musk, whom he recently called a 'patriot.' 'I’m just hearing about it and if there is … obviously I will not let there be any conflict of interest. He’s done an amazing job,' he said earlier this week. 'I told Elon, any conflicts you can’t have anything to do with that. So, anything to do with possibly even space, we won’t let Elon partake in that.' The president and White House have also suggested Musk is not actually part of DOGE. Instead, he is considered a senior adviser to Trump and a 'White House Office' employee, a court filing from the White House Office of Administration shows. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has 'has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,' Joshua Fisher, the director of the office, wrote. Musk defended DOGE’s work during a briefing alongside Trump earlier this month, emphasizing that voters 'voted for major government reform and that’s what the people are going to get.' Trump lauded the tech entrepreneur in early February for doing a 'very good job' and predicted that DOGE’s aides would discover more fraud and waste within the government. 'He’s got a staff that’s fantastic, he’s wanted to be able to do this for a long time,' the president said. 'I think we’re going to be very close to balancing budgets for the first time for many years.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-suggests-musk-needs-to-be-more-aggressive/	2025-02-22T08:15:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Donald-Trump-Elon-Musk-02.22-e1740240747705.png?w=800

Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas' body returned to family after ID mix...	(NewsNation) — After an identity mix-up in Hamas' hostage release earlier this week, Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas' body has returned to her family, according to Israeli authorities. Forensic officials confirmed the remains were hers Saturday morning. 'For 16 months we sought certainty, and now that it’s here, it brings no comfort, though we hope it marks the beginning of closure,' the family said, per the Associated Press. 500 days of the Israel-Hamas war, by the numbers Hamas turned over the bodies of four hostages to Israel, one of whom was said to be Bibas, a mother whose sons also died in captivity. But Israel discovered the body was not Bibas. That body remains unidentified but is believed to belong to a Palestinian woman. Two of the bodies were Bibas' two children, Ariel and Kfir, who were 4 years old and 9 months old, respectively, at the time of their Oct. 7, 2023, abduction. The fourth person was Oded Lifshitz, 83. Hamas has released hostages each week since the ceasefire deal with Israel took effect on Jan. 19. On Saturday, six living hostages were freed. This is the final prisoner exchange in the first phase of the three-part ceasefire. Monday marked the 500th day of the war.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/israeli-hostage-shiri-bibas-body-returned-to-family-after-mix-up/	2025-02-22T04:36:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b6e869596378.94194988.jpeg?w=825
Federal judge temporarily blocks Trump DEI executive orders	(The Hill) — A federal judge has temporarily blocked parts of President Trump’s executive orders that sought to end the federal government’s backing of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson, a former President Biden appointee, issued a preliminary injunction on Friday that prevents the administration from altering or ending contracts viewed as DEI-related. The federal judge also ruled that the administration could not 'bring any False Claims Act enforcement action, or other enforcement action, pursuant to the Enforcement Threat Provision, including but not limited to any False Claims Act enforcement action premised on any certification made pursuant to the Certification Provision.' Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump penned two executive orders with hopes of eliminating DEI in the federal government and shrinking its influence in higher education and corporate America. The orders have prompted firings in the federal government while various groups have filed lawsuits in response. In court, the administration has pushed back on the plaintiff’s claims, saying the orders were forged in adherence with the current legislation in place. 'Plaintiffs, who have easily established their standing to bring this case and irreparable harm, have shown they are likely to prove the Termination and Enforcement Threat Provisions are unconstitutionally vague on their face,' Abelson said in a Friday opinion. The judge said it is not just the 'vagueness' of the challenged provisions that makes them unconstitutional, writing later that the most ''blatant' and 'egregious form of content discrimination’ is viewpoint discrimination.' Abelson’s Friday ruling does not prevent the Department of Justice from compiling and probing schools and corporations’ DEI efforts, but it prevents enforcement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-trump-dei-executive-orders/	2025-02-22T04:17:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25043784844149-e1740078012325_817f00-e1740192036836.jpg?w=800
Hamas hands over the first 2 of 6 Israeli hostages to be freed in...	RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas freed the first two of six Israeli hostages due to be released Saturday even as heightened tension between the adversaries clouded the future of the fragile ceasefire deal. The two hostages — Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 39 — were put into Red Cross ambulances after being brought out onto a stage by masked and armed Hamas fighters in front of a crowd in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Soon after, the Israeli military confirmed that the two had been brought into Israel. The latest hostage release, along with the freeing of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, is going ahead after tensions mounted over a grisly and heart-wrenching dispute triggered this week when Hamas initially handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother of two young boys abducted by militants. The remains that Hamas transferred with her sons’ bodies on Thursday were later determined to be those of an unidentified Palestinian woman. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed revenge for 'a cruel and malicious violation,' while Hamas suggested it had been a mistake. On Friday night, the small militant group believed to have been holding Bibas and her sons — the Palestinian Mujahedeen Brigades — said it handed over a second body. On Saturday morning, Bibas’ family said Israeli forensic authorities had confirmed the remains were hers. 'For 16 months we sought certainty, and now that it’s here, it brings no comfort, though we hope it marks the beginning of closure,' the family said. The dispute over the body’s identity raised new doubt about the ceasefire deal, which has paused over 15 months of war but is nearing the end of its first phase. Negotiations over a second phase, in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal, are likely to be even more difficult. The six hostages being freed Saturday are the last living ones to be released under the ceasefire’s first phase. Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, had been held in Gaza since entering on his own in 2014. Watching the handover on Israeli media, Mengistu’s family broke out into a Hebrew song, 'Here is the Light,' as they saw him for the first time in more than a decade. Shoham, from the northern Israeli village of Ma’ale Tzviya, was visiting his wife’s family in Kibbutz Be’eri when Hamas militants stormed into the community during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. The family of Tal Shoham told Israeli media they were 'starting to breathe again' after seeing him on the stage. Shoham’s wife, two young children, and three other relatives who had been abducted with him were freed in a November 2023 exchange. The others to be freed include Eliya Cohen, 27; Omer Shem Tov, 22; and Omer Wenkert, 23. All three were abducted from a music festival during the Oct. 7 attack. Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, who also crossed into Gaza on his own years ago, is also to be returned to Israel as part of the deal. More than 600 Palestinians jailed in Israel will be freed in exchange, the Palestinian prisoners media office said Friday. The prisoners set for release include 50 serving life sentences, 60 with long sentences, 47 who were released under a previous hostage-for-prisoner exchange and 445 prisoners from Gaza arrested since the war began. Hamas has said it will also release four more bodies next week, completing the first phase of the ceasefire. If that plan is carried out, Hamas would retain about 60 hostages, about half of whom are believed to be alive. Hamas has said it won’t release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he’s committed to destroying Hamas’ military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Trump’s proposal to remove about 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. His idea has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries. Trump said Friday that he was 'a little surprised' by rejections of the proposal by Egypt and Jordan and that he would not impose it. 'I’ll tell you, the way to do it is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works. But I’m not forcing it. I’m just going to sit back and recommend it,' Trump said in a Fox News interview. Israel’s military offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza’s population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Lidman from Tel Aviv, Israel. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-family-confirms-body-handed-over-by-militants-overnight-was-israeli-mother-shiri-bibas/	2025-02-22T00:20:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b98926f0c1b7.92013306.jpeg?w=900
Luigi Mangione makes first court appearance since arraignment in ...	NEW YORK (AP) — The man accused of fatally shooting the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in New York City and leading authorities on a five-day search was in court Friday for the first time since his December arraignment on state murder and terror charges. Luigi Mangione, 26, has pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism, in the Dec. 4 killing of Brian Thompson outside a midtown Manhattan hotel. The executive was ambushed and shot on a sidewalk as he walked to an investor conference. Sean ‘Diddy’ Comb’s lawyer quits case ahead of sex trafficking trial Mangione also faces federal charges that could carry the possibility of the death penalty. He is being held in a Brooklyn federal jail alongside several other high-profile defendants, including Sean 'Diddy' Combs and Sam Bankman-Fried. Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. The maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole. A Feb. 24 hearing in Pennsylvania on charges of possessing an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police was canceled.

(Steven Hirsch/New York Post via AP, Pool) In a statement posted on a website for his legal defense, Mangione said: 'I am overwhelmed by — and grateful for — everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support. Powerfully, this support has transcended political, racial, and even class divisions.' The killing prompted some to voice their resentment at U.S. health insurers, with Mangione attracting a cult following as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills. A poll taken in the wake of the shooting showed most Americans believe health insurance profits and coverage denials share blame. A couple dozen members of the public were allowed into Friday's hearing, including one wearing a 'Free Luigi' scarf. The killing also has sent shock waves through the corporate world, rattling executives who say they saw a spike in threats. Judge cancels trial for NYC Mayor Eric Adams but leaves corruption charges intact for now Mangione was arrested in a Pennsylvania McDonald’s on Dec. 9. Police said he was carrying a gun that matched the one used in the shooting and a fake ID. He also was carrying a notebook expressing hostility toward the health insurance industry and especially wealthy executives, authorities said. Thompson, a married father of two high-schoolers, had worked at the giant UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became CEO of its insurance arm in 2021. Defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo argued at his Dec. 23 arraignment that 'warring jurisdictions' had turned Mangione into a 'human Ping-Pong ball.'

Trump fires top US general in unprecedented Pentagon shakeup	(REUTERS) — President Donald Trump on Friday fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General C.Q. Brown, and pushed out five other admirals and generals in an unprecedented shake-up of U.S. military leadership. Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he would nominate retired Lieutenant General Dan 'Razin' Caine to succeed Brown. A former F-16 fighter pilot, Caine was the associate director of military affairs at the Central Intelligence Agency until late last year. Trump will also replace the head of the U.S. Navy, a position held by Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to lead a military service, as well as the air force vice chief of staff and judge advocates general for the Army, Navy and Air Force, the Pentagon said. Trump's decision sets off a period of upheaval at the Pentagon, which was already bracing for mass firings of civilian staff, a dramatic overhaul of its budget and a shift in military deployments under Trump's new America First foreign policy. U.S. Department of Agriculture suspends scholarship program at NC A&amp;T State University, 18 other historically Black colleges, website shows While the Pentagon's civilian leadership changes from one administration to the next, the uniformed members of U.S. armed forces are meant to be apolitical, carrying out the policies of Democratic and Republican administrations. Brown, the second Black officer to become the president's top uniformed military adviser, had been expected to complete his entire four-year term in September 2027. A U.S. official said Brown was relieved with immediate effect, even before the Senate confirms his successor. Reuters in November was first to report that the incoming Trump administration planned a sweeping shakeup of the top brass, with firings including Brown. 'Woke' generals During last year's presidential campaign, Trump spoke of firing 'woke' generals and those responsible for the troubled 2021 pullout from Afghanistan. On Friday, the president did not explain his decision to replace Brown. 'I want to thank General Charles 'CQ' Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I wish a great future for him and his family,' Trump wrote. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had been skeptical of Brown before taking the helm of the Pentagon with a broad agenda that includes eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the military. In his most recent book, Hegseth asked whether Brown would have gotten the job if he were not Black. 'Was it because of his skin color? Or his skill? We'll never know, but always doubt - which on its face seems unfair to CQ. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn't really much matter,' he wrote in his 2024 book 'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.' How much federal data has Trump really purged? Brown, a former fighter pilot with command experience in the Middle East and Asia, recounted his experiences of discrimination in the military in an emotional video posted online after the 2020 killing of George Floyd, which sparked nationwide protests for racial justice. Brown was on official travel when Trump made the announcement. Hours before Trump's post, Brown's official X account had posted images of him meeting troops on the U.S. border with Mexico, deployed in support of Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. 'Border Security has always been critical to the defense of our homeland. As we navigate unprecedented security challenges... we will ensure our troops at the border have everything they need,' Brown posted. A spokesperson for Brown did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Women leaders fired Franchetti was the first woman to command the U.S. Navy. Her 2023 nomination by then-President Joe Biden had been a surprise. Pentagon officials had widely expected the nomination to go to Admiral Samuel Paparo, who at the time led the navy in the Pacific. Paparo was instead promoted to lead the U.S. military's Indo Pacific Command. On his first day in office, Trump fired Admiral Linda Fagan as head of the U.S. Coast Guard. She had been its first female commanding officer. Pentagon says it will cut 5,400 probationary workers starting next week Last month, Trump's Pentagon lashed out Mark Milley, a retired Army general and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by revoking his personal security detail and security clearance. It also removed his portrait from the walls of the Pentagon. Milley, who served as the top U.S. military officer during some of Trump's first presidential term, became a leading critic of him after retiring as a four-star general in 2023 during Biden's administration and has faced death threats.

(NewsNation) — Tom Homan, President Donald Trump's border czar, defended ICE's focus, stating that all illegal entrants into the U.S. are 'absolutely not' treated the same. 'We're prioritizing public safety threats and national security threats,' Homan said on 'CUOMO.' 'We have given ICE instructions. When you look for the bad guy and you find others with him, you will arrest them because they're in the country illegally.' He urged sanctuary cities to allow ICE agents into jails. 'More agents in jail means fewer agents in your neighborhoods.' 'You have forced me into the neighborhoods to find these people. It's safer for the community, and safer for the agents to arrest the bad guy in the jail. And I think the immigrant community is behind me.' ICE acting director Caleb Vitello removed from role President Donald Trump has expressed anger and frustration over the number of arrests of migrants being made by ICE since he took office. Raids conducted by ICE in cities like Chicago and other cities with high migrant populations began immediately after he took office. Homan said last week that ICE agents arrested about 14,000 migrants during Trump’s first three weeks in the White House, which represented 667 arrests per day. The average was twice that daily in 2024. ICE arrests spiked to about 800-1,200 daily arrests during Trump’s first week in office, but then fell off as migrant detention centers filled up.

LAFD chief removed over handling of LA fires But amid reports that Trump and his 'border czar' Tom Homan expected between 1,200 and 1,500 arrests to be made per day across the country, the number of migrant apprehensions has diminished in recent weeks. According to reports, the Trump administration was seeking individual ICE offices to make 75 arrests per day. Homan said last week that ICE agents arrested about 14,000 migrants during Trump's first three weeks in the White House, which represented 667 arrests per day. The daily average was twice that being made on a daily basis in 2024. ICE arrests spiked to about 800-1,200 daily arrests during Trump's first week in office, but then fell off as migrant detention centers filled up. Vitello has been reassigned within the agency, multiple media outlets reported on Friday. ICE did not immediately return an email seeking comment from NewsNation on Friday. Vitello has spent more than 23 years with the agency, according to his bio. As acting director, Vitello oversaw a workforce of more than 20,000 people, including federal law enforcement officers, attorneys and mission support personnel, the agency said. Before being appointed the acting director, Vitello most recently served as the assistant director for the Office of Firearms and Tactical programs. The agency said between 2015 and 2020, Vitello earned four ICE Director's Awards in Meritourious Service, Core Value, Protecting the Homeland and Efficiency Through Innovation. This is a developing story. NewsNation will update the story as more information becomes available.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/ice-acting-director-vitello-removed/	2025-02-21T12:52:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2197149655.jpg?w=900
LAFD chief removed over handling of LA fires	(NewsNation) — Kristin Crowley has been removed as chief of the Los Angeles Fire Department, with Chief Deputy Ronnie Villanueva taking over the role on an interim basis. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass cited Crowley's decision-making during the wildfires that devastated the Los Angeles area as the reason for Crowley's removal. 'We know that 1,000 firefighters that could have been on duty the morning the fires broke out were instead sent home on Chief Crowley's watch,' Bass said. 'Furthermore, a necessary step to an investigation was the president of the Fire Commission telling Chief Crowley to do an after-action report on the fires. The chief refused.' Fired USDA worker: We want our country to love us back Villanueva is a 41-year veteran of the LAFD. After seven months of retirement, he is returning as interim chief. He spent 24 of those years in the field on active assignments and also has experience in emergency management. President Donald Trump has been a harsh critic of Bass, the LAFD and California Gov. Gavin Newsom for how the fires were handled and previously suggested he would withhold emergency aid if the state did not take actions he deemed important.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/lafd-chief-fired/	2025-02-21T11:37:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/64e386f3eecae9.19751285.jpeg?w=900
Trump threatens to withhold federal funds from Maine over transge...	President Trump is threatening to withhold federal funds from Maine if it continues allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls’ and women’s sports in defiance of a recent executive order. 'I signed really historic orders to get critical race theory and transgender ideology out of the schools and out of our military. It's all going out. It's no longer,' Trump said Thursday evening in remarks at the Republican Governor’s Association meeting in Washington. 'I heard men are still playing in Maine. Is anybody here from Maine?' Trump said. 'Well, I hate to tell you this, but we're not going to give them any federal money. They are still saying we want men to play in women's sports, and I cannot believe that they're doing that. So, we're not going to give them any federal funding whatsoever until they clean that up.' An executive order Trump signed on Feb. 5 — one of more than 70 issued during his first month back in office — intends to broadly prevent transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports. The order could also complicate the nation’s role as host of the next Summer Olympics because it targets visas for transgender female athletes from abroad. The NCAA, responsible for intercollegiate athletics at more than 1,000 colleges and universities nationwide, barred transgender athletes from women’s college sports because of Trump’s order. The organization’s president, Charlie Baker, a former Republican governor of Massachusetts, previously told a Senate panel that fewer than 10 trans athletes are competing at NCAA member schools. US Army bans transgender people from enlisting But some state athletic associations, including the Maine Principal’s Association, the state’s governing body for high school sports, said it would not comply with Trump’s order, which conflicts with state anti-discrimination laws that include protections for transgender people. 'The executive order and our Maine state Human Rights Act are in conflict, and the Maine Principal's Association will continue to follow state law as it pertains to gender identity,' Mike Burnham, the organization’s executive director, told Maine Public Radio this month. The Education Department has said it is investigating athletic associations in California and Minnesota over their refusal to follow Trump’s order. Trump’s comments at the Republican Governor’s Association meeting come after a Maine state lawmaker criticized a transgender high school athlete on her Facebook page, a move that drew swift criticism from Democratic colleagues, including Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D). The lawmaker, Republican state Rep. Laurel Libby, has called for Maine schools that allow trans athletes to compete in girls’ sports to lose their government funding. 'I think that’s really the only thing that will ensure we have biological females competing in sports against other biological females,' Libby told conservative radio host Todd Starnes on his show this week. 'I don’t think that the Democratic majority is going to listen to reason until money talks, and that includes the federal funding getting yanked for Maine schools.' In a statement, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the state 'will not be intimidated' by Trump’s threat to withhold its federal funds. NJ school board to vote on trans rights vs. parents rights 'If the President attempts to unilaterally deprive Maine school children from the benefit of Federal funding, my Administration and the Attorney General will take appropriate and necessary legal action to restore that funding and the academic opportunity it provides,' she said. 'It is disturbing that President Trump would use children as pawns in advancing his political agenda,' said Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey (D). 'Any attempt by the President to cut federal funding in Maine unless transgender athletes are restricted from playing sports would be illegal and in direct violation of court orders. Fortunately, though, the rule of law still applies in this county, and I will do everything in my power to defend Maine’s laws and block efforts by the President to bully and threaten us.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-threatens-to-withhold-federal-funds-from-maine-over-transgender-athletes/	2025-02-21T11:02:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25050840600604-e1740060734442_25c6c6.jpg?w=900
Judge cancels trial for New York City Mayor Eric Adams but leaves...	NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge on Friday cancelled the corruption trial for New York City Mayor Eric Adams and appointed counsel to advise him on how to handle the Justice Department’s controversial request to drop charges against the Democrat. Judge Dale E. Ho's written order means he won't decide before mid-March whether to grant the dismissal of the case against the embattled mayor of the nation’s largest city. At a hearing Wednesday, Acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove cited an executive order by President Donald Trump outlining his criminal justice priorities as he defended the request to drop charges. Adams confirmed at the hearing that he accepted that charges could later be reinstated, a feature of the request to dismiss charges that has led critics to suggest that the mayor would be required to carry out Trump's plans to round up New Yorkers who are in the country illegally if he wanted to remain free from prosecution. The request is 'virtually unreviewable in this courtroom,' Bove argued. Adams was indicted in September and accused of accepting more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. He faces multiple challengers in June’s Democratic primary. He has pleaded not guilty and has insisted on his innocence. At Wednesday's hearing, Ho raised the possibility that he could appoint a lawyer to advise him on future steps. He did so on Friday when he said he'd appointed Paul Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general and acting U.S. attorney general, as amicus curiae to present arguments on the government's request to throw out the charges. Ho said he wanted all parties and Clement to address the legal standard for dismissing charges, whether a court may consider materials beyond the motion itself and under what circumstances additional procedural steps and further inquiry would be necessary. He also said he wants to know under what circumstances, dismissal can occur without the ability to reinstate charges or with the ability to reinstate charges. He scheduled briefs to be filed by March 7 and, if necessary, oral arguments to occur on March 14. Late Thursday, three former U.S. attorneys — from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — submitted a letter urging Ho to 'hear from parties other than the government and the defendant in deciding about the appropriate next steps.'In court on Wednesday, Adams’ lawyer, Alex Spiro, said no appeals court has ever sided with a judge who rejected an unopposed motion to dismiss a criminal case. Until about 80 years ago, such requests were granted automatically, without a judge weighing in. Adams will not be required to attend future hearings, the judge said. That could help mitigate some political damage for Adams as he could avoid being hauled back to court for hearings while he tries to convince the public that the case isn’t distracting him from running the city. Adams has sought to project calm as questions over his independence have sparked a political crisis in his administration. This week, four of his top deputies resigned and Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that she had for now decided against removing Adams from office but would instead propose legislation to enhance state oversight of City Hall as a way to reestablish trust with New Yorkers Bove's initial request last week to then-interim U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon to drop charges against Adams was rejected and she resigned. Another prosecutor, Hagan Scotten, told Bove in a resignation letter that it would take a 'fool' or a 'coward' to meet Bove’s demand, 'but it was never going to be me.' In all, seven prosecutors, including five high-ranking prosecutors at the Justice Department in Washington, had resigned last week before Bove made the request himself, along with two other prosecutors from Washington, to drop the case. ___ Associated Press Writer Jennifer Peltz and Anthony Izaguirre contributed to this story.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-judge-adjourns-trial-for-new-york-city-mayor-eric-adams-but-appoints-counsel-to-advise-on-next-steps/	2025-02-21T10:55:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP24260589021727-e1727365510874.jpg?w=900
LA County DA to give update on Menendez brothers case	LOS ANGELES (NewsNation) — Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman is expected to provide an update Friday on the Lyle and Erik Menendez case. Hochman met with the brothers’ family in January while he reviewed their bid for freedom 35 years after they were convicted of killing their parents. Hochman, who took office in December, said he had a 'productive session' with the family members, who shared their thoughts on whether the brothers should be released. Luigi Mangione set to appear in NY court in insurance CEO killing Brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez were found guilty of murdering Jose and Kitty Menendez in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Now in their 50s, they began their bid for freedom in recent years after new evidence of their father’s sexual abuse emerged in their case. Their lawyers filed a habeas corpus petition — a request for a court to examine whether someone is being lawfully detained — in May 2023, asking a judge to consider the evidence. The brothers have the support of most of their extended family, who have said they deserve to be free after decades behind bars. Several family members have said that in today’s world — which is more aware of the impact of sexual abuse — the brothers would not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life. At the brothers’ original trials, their defense attorneys argued that they had been sexually abused by their father. Prosecutors denied that and accused them of killing their parents for money. In the years that followed, they repeatedly appealed their convictions without success. The brothers are being held at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/la-county-update-menendez-brothers-case/	2025-02-21T10:37:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-1462340490.jpg?w=900
MLB tests robot umpires ahead of possible integration by 2026	(NewsNation) — MLB's robot umpires won't be rolled out for every game this spring, but they will be in play for Friday's matchup between the Tampa Bay Rays and the New York Yankees at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Florida. It’s called the 'automated ball-strike challenge system,' or ABS. Think of it like football — referees make a call, and coaches can challenge it for review. There's still a home plate umpire, but now players can challenge ball-and-strike calls using a computerized system. Connor McDavid scores in OT to give Canada 3-2 win over United States in 4 Nations Face-Off final The batter, pitcher or catcher simply tap their helmet or cap to challenge — but they only have two seconds. If they challenge, the pitch graphic appears on the scoreboard and broadcast, and the umpire updates the count. MLB says this takes about 17 seconds. MLB has been testing ABS challenges in the minors for the past three seasons, and now it's set to use the system in about 60% of spring games to see how it holds up in the big leagues. If all goes well, fans could see it in regular-season games as early as next year. Thirteen spring training ballparks, home to 19 teams, will be using the ABS system, and every team will have a shot at challenging ball-strike calls at some point this spring. Each team gets two challenges per game — and they keep them if they’re correct. The Chicago Cubs have already used the system twice, which is exactly what MLB wants. It's looking for plenty of feedback from players and managers in order to tweak the system. Rookie QB card could be worth $50K if you pull it from new Topps set Rays outfielder Richie Palacios told NewsNation he’s been messing around with the ABS system for the past couple of years and thinks it should work well. Rays starter Ryan Pepiot said he’s curious to see how it plays out batter to batter but is concerned that it might slow the game down. Minor league testing showed a full season with the ABS system did just that — walks went up, and the pace slowed — but fans and players have said they prefer the challenge system.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/mlb-robot-umpires-spring-games/	2025-02-21T07:51:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2200917591.jpg?w=900
Afterschool program uplifting Chicago students' voices through mu...	(NewsNation) — A group of Chicago students are lending their voices to honor Black History Month and learning about the significance of Black culture along the way. Change, power and resilience — that's the message these young voices are spotlighting while coming together to represent Africana music and culture. Uniting Voices Chicago is an afterschool program made up of 3,000 students across 88 Chicago public schools who perform free public shows at the Chicago Symphony Center. Lincoln Park High School student Daelyn Calloway is one of the voices involved. 'Singing songs like this is really exciting because I get to learn more about my culture personally and things that I wouldn't learn about in school about key songs in history, and seeing people gather together is so exciting, seeing stuff that has to do with me,' Calloway told 'Morning in America.' Black-owned barbershop thrives for 50 years as community hub The group’s annual Black Futures Concert series, titled 'Afrofuturism: The Freedom Metropolis,' takes the audience through a journey of Black history, led by conductor Lonnie Norwood. 'We are putting forth the people, the civilization, the ways of knowing, the practices, the momentum. And the memory of those things make us tell their story the way that it's intended to be told,' Norwood said. The show features various genres of music and includes songs such as the 'Black National Anthem' and 'Swing Low.' During the show, the audience is introduced to the character Kendrick and his dream world, where he explores and finds healing through Afrofuturism. Uniting Voices Chicago has been performing for more than 60 years, and Norwood said the group takes pride in knowing diversity still plays a present role in its mission. 19 Black trailblazers that may not have been in your history book 'It was intentional to bring people of diverse backgrounds together to show those adults in the world who didn't know how to live together in harmony,' Norwood said. He said he is excited for the program to grow further and for the impact it will have on generations to come. 'This is really a love letter to the students to let them know that you have the ability right now — not later, but now — to start making real change in your world,' Norwood said. 'You have to start using your imagination and tapping into it. Start being critical thinkers. And we want to just challenge them to see the world first that they want to live in and then just make it happen.' That message has resonated with its students. 'You see young people coming together as one, not caring about anything else, just about music, and I think that's really important,' Calloway, 16, said.

Luigi Mangione set to appear in NY court in insurance CEO killing	(NewsNation) — Luigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is set to appear at a court hearing in New York City on Friday. Prosecutors and defense attorneys are expected to check in with the court to determine their status in the case. Luigi Mangione case timeline, from UnitedHealthcare CEO killing to court dates This will be Mangione's first court appearance since December, when the 26-year-old was charged with first-degree murder and killing as an act of terrorism. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. In addition to the state charges, Mangione faces federal charges that could carry the possibility of the death penalty. Authorities say Mangione shot and killed Thompson as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan on Dec 4. He was arrested in Pennsylvania after a five-day search and was extradited to New York City. He is currently being held at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center.

Senate adopts budget resolution after marathon overnight vote-a-r...	The Senate on Friday adopted a budget resolution intended to serve as a blueprint to deliver the first part of President Trump’s agenda. Senators voted 52-48 along party lines on the resolution after a marathon overnight voting session. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) voted against the measure. The so-called vote-a-rama lasted about 10 hours, as Democrats sought to dial up the heat on Republicans with dozens of amendments needling the party on taxes and Medicaid. Republicans overwhelmingly voted to turn away or reject the proposals. But Democrats were able to peel off one or two GOP defections as some Republicans bucked their party on a few proposals, including measures aimed at preventing healthcare cuts and reinstating federal workers affected by mass layoffs. The resolution helps pave the way for Republicans to pass roughly $340 billion in funding, including $175 billion in for border operations and immigration enforcement and to carry out Trump’s ambitious deportation plans, as well as $150 billion in defense spending. The vote serves as a marker for Senate Republicans in their ongoing battle with the House GOP over the best way to deliver on Trump’s top priorities. 'This budget resolution is a complete game changer when it comes to securing our border and making our military more lethal. It will allow President Trump to fulfill the promises he made to the American people — a very big deal,' Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a statement after the vote. 'I hope the House can pass one big bill that meets President Trump’s priorities. But this approach provides money that we needed yesterday to continue the momentum on securing our border, enforcing our immigration laws, and rebuilding our military. Time is of the essence.' Trump this week endorsed the House’s one-track plan that includes border and defense spending, combined with an extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and a debt ceiling increase. But GOP leadership in the Senate, backed by a large swath of their conference, are barrelling forward with their preferred two-track process. Senate Republicans say their plan would put key points on the board during Trump’s first 100 days, and point out that 'border czar' Tom Homan and other key officials have been clamoring for an infusion of funds for border and defense. They are also not oozing with optimism that the House will be able to shepherd through what Trump and members have dubbed 'one big, beautiful bill' given the slim margin in the lower chamber and the fractious nature of the House GOP conference. 'I think the probabilities of them running into a roadblock are more than 50-50,' said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). 'It makes it a whole lot easier if we’ve only got one bill to go through. We hope it’s doable for them. But if it’s not, then this is the next best deal. We don’t want to be stuck without any other alternatives. This doesn’t hurt.' 'One of the reasons why we’re doing ours is just in case they can’t get a consensus on their big, beautiful bill, we may have to do it in small, really beautiful bills,' he added. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said ahead of the Thursday night vote that he had previously planned to vote against the measure following Trump’s comments. But he said he switched to a 'yes' after speaking directly with Trump, whom he noted gave 'a nod' toward the Senate plan. 'He made clear to me, however, he wants one big, beautiful bill. He said that two or three times on the phone,' he said. 'So, you know, I think this is maybe better than nothing.' Trump sent out a message on Thursday thanking Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) for working to fund his border agenda on Truth Social as senators began to hunker down for the overnight voting session. 'We are setting records, the likes of which have never been seen before, on stopping criminal illegals aliens from entering our Country,' he said, adding, 'Your work on funding this effort is greatly appreciated!' 'I wasn't going to vote for this unless he supported moving forward,' Hawley later told The Hill. '[Trump] issued a statement in which he said he was in support of the border funding. So, that's good enough for me.' Johnson has laid out an expeditious timeline to pass the single, massive package out of the House by early April with the hopes of it reaching the Resolute Desk by sometime between late April and Memorial Day. Senate Republicans have consistently dubbed that plan as overly ambitious and have cautioned that the single-bill plan will likely take more time. There are also major issues on the tax side that members will be forced to contend with, including whether the cuts that go into effect will be made permanent, which Thune and a number of Senate GOP members have laid out as a red line. The House’s budget resolution currently lays out a $4.5 trillion limit in tax cuts, which would not be enough to cover making those cuts permanent. Questions have also surrounded how Republicans will be able to win these levels of cuts without digging into popular programs, including Medicaid, as hardline conservatives have pressed for spending cuts and taxes to go hand in hand. The House’s budget has called for about $2 trillion in spending reductions, but with the committee charged with overseeing the healthcare program tasked with finding nearly $900 billion in cuts – fueling concerns from even some GOP moderates about potential Medicaid cuts in the lower chamber. Many of those cuts could be aimed at what has become the U.S.’s biggest health insurance program, which has been expanded in 41 states since the Affordable Care Act was passed almost 15 years ago. Fears of potential cuts dominated a chunk of the marathon voting session late Thursday, with Democrats sounding alarm over the program and offering multiple proposals aimed at preventing potential cuts. While most Republicans opposed those measures, a majority of the party voted to back an amendment offered from Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) that he said is aimed at strengthening Medicaid and Medicare. 'People rely on Medicare and Medicaid. Alaskans rely on Medicare and Medicaid, and we are here to strongly support them,' Sullivan said. 'So, we should all agree that we want to weed out waste, fraud, abuse in our healthcare system, including in Medicare and Medicaid, and we must maintain our safety net programs.' However, Democrats roundly rejected the amendment, which called for a deficit neutral reserve fund related 'to protecting Medicare and Medicaid.' Sen. Ron Wyden (R-Ore.) argued the language in the amendment 'is code for kicking Americans with Medicaid coverage off their health insurance if they’re not sick enough, not poor enough, or not disabled enough.' In their race with the House, Senate GOP members are largely for whichever item they are able to pass. They also see value in going through the two-bill exercise to keep the pressure on their colleagues in the lower chamber. 'I’m for whatever can get the 218 [votes] in the House and 51 in the Senate,' Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said about those concerns on Thursday. 'What we’ve been doing in the Senate has been an impetus for the House to take more action.' The House Budget Committee advanced its budget resolution last week and the full chamber is expected to vote on it in the coming days. 'What we’re doing here is responding to the needs that we’re hearing from the president, Tom Homan, [Homeland Security Secretary] Kristi Noem. They need the money to secure the border. They need it now. We need to rebuild the military now. We need to unleash American energy now,' Barrasso continued. 'These are the immediate needs,' he added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/senate-adopts-budget-resolution-after-marathon-overnight-vote-a-rama/	2025-02-21T02:08:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25042747531987-e1740084347233.jpg?w=900
VA Sec. Doug Collins defends veteran’s care, benefits amid layoff...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins said Democrats are trying to 'scare' voters by claiming the agency is 'cutting veterans benefits.' 'No critical services cut. And they keep saying that to scare people because that's the only tool they have left, is to try and scare people,' said Collins. Top Republicans say they trust Collins to lead the department. Democrats, however, have not expressed faith that cutting $98 million through dismissals won’t harm veterans. 8 cartels designated as foreign terror organizations by State Department 'We're not cutting critical health care, we're not cutting health care benefits. We're not cutting benefits,' Collins said on NewsNation’s 'The Hill.' U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth said Wednesday she is seeking answers about how the layoffs may have affected efforts to prevent suicide through the confidential Veterans Crisis Line. In a call with journalists, the Illinois Democrat said her staff heard from VA employees who worked for the crisis line or supported the VA claims process. She said two from Illinois may have been reinstated after she intervened, 'but they’re still locked out of their portal, so I don’t know if they actually have been rehired.' Mangione receives large donation after Trump death penalty order Collins vehemently denied that veteran care was impacted.

Judge rules Trump administration can move ahead on mass governmen...	A federal judge Thursday refused a group of government employee unions’ request to block the Trump administration from moving ahead with plans to dramatically reduce the federal workforce. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper ruled that federal law mandates the unions bring their challenge before the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), which adjudicates labor relations within the federal bureaucracy, rather than a federal district court. The decision notches another victory for Trump’s Justice Department, which is defending against dozens of lawsuits challenging a broad range of the president’s executive actions, including the administration’s efforts to slash spending and reshape government agencies. 'The first month of President Trump’s second administration has been defined by an onslaught of executive actions that have caused, some say by design, disruption and even chaos in widespread quarters of American society,' wrote Cooper, an appointee of former President Obama. 'Affected citizens and their advocates have challenged many of these actions on an emergency basis in this Court and others across the country,' he continued. 'Certain of the President’s actions have been temporarily halted; others have been permitted to proceed, at least for the time being. These mixed results should surprise no one.' The unions’ lawsuit challenged mass terminations of probationary employees, the administration’s plans for additional mass layoffs, known as a reduction in force (RIF), and its offer for most federal employees to accept a buyout. Another federal judge previously rejected an attempt to block the buyouts in a separate lawsuit, but litigation against the probationary employee firings remains ongoing after a coalition of unions filed yet another lawsuit Thursday. The case at hand was brought by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), the National Federation of Federal Employees, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the International Federation of Professional &amp; Technical Engineers and United Auto Workers. The unions argued that the administration’s plans violates the separation of powers and regulations for how the federal government can carry out RIFs. Cooper took no position on those issues, instead ruling that the unions brought their challenge in the wrong forum. 'The Court acknowledges that district court review of these sweeping executive actions may be more expedient. But NTEU provides no reason why it could not seek relief from the FLRA on behalf of a class of plaintiffs and admits that it would ask other agencies to follow an administrative judge’s ruling in its favor,' Cooper wrote.

CEO confidence hits highest point in 3 years: Survey	The confidence of CEOs has hit its highest point in three years, according to a new survey. The survey, from The Conference Board, found a 2025 first quarter 9 point rise in the confidence of CEOs, up to 60. The first quarter point marks a three-year high for CEO confidence, per the survey. 'The improvement in CEO Confidence in the first quarter of 2025 was significant and broad-based,' a senior economist at The Conference Board, Stephanie Guichard, said in a press release. Southwest cutting nearly 1,800 jobs, airline says 'All components of the Measure improved, as CEOs were substantially more optimistic about current economic conditions as well as about future economic conditions—both overall and in their own industries.' President Trump and big tech leaders have recently cozied up with each other, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attending his inauguration. Trump and Musk have been especially close in the last year, with the tech billionaire being heavily involved in the second Trump administration. Forty-four percent in The Conference Board survey said economic conditions have become more preferable 'than six months ago,' whereas in the previous quarter it was 20 percent. The Conference Board survey took place between Jan. 27 and Feb 10., featuring 134 CEOs and The Business Council’s partnership.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/ceo-confidence-survey/	2025-02-20T16:02:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/trump-tariffs-market_AssociatedPress_f80725.jpg?w=900
How many people over 100 receive Social Security benefits?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk have spread claims implying that millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments, but publicly available data proves otherwise. Musk started the rumor over the weekend when he posted a chart on X allegedly showing more than 20 million people over 100 years old listed in 'the Social Security database.' 'These are the numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to FALSE!,' Musk said, joking that 'a lot of vampires' are collecting Social Security. He went on to say the apparent discrepancy might be 'the biggest fraud in history.' Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? Trump repeated the falsehood at a Tuesday press briefing in Florida, saying that 'we have millions and millions of people over 100 years old' receiving Social Security benefits. That's not true. The latest data shows about 90,000 beneficiaries aged 99 or older received a Social Security retirement check in December. That's lower than the estimated 101,000 centenarians living in the U.S. and nowhere close to the 'millions' Trump claimed. Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek tried to clear up the confusion Wednesday. 'The reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits,' Dudek said in a statement. Here's how many people in each age group actually get a retirement check and what to know about Social Security fraud. How many people over 100 years old receive Social Security benefits? Nearly 52 million Americans received retired worker benefits in Dec. 2024, according to data from the Social Security Administration. About 90,000 of those payments, less than 0.2%, went to people aged 99 or older. That's far below the millions Trump and Musk warned about. It's also lower than the number of centenarians living in the U.S., estimated at 101,000 in 2024. In other words, Social Security is not sending checks to millions of dead people over 100. Instead, Musk and Trump appear to be referencing a well-known, longstanding issue with a Social Security system called the 'Numident.' That database listed nearly 19 million Social Security numbers of people 100 or older but not dead, according to a 2023 agency inspector general report. Social Security head resigns following DOGE data request: Reports However, the audit found 'almost none' of those people were receiving Social Security payments. The agency hasn't updated the database because fixing it would cost anywhere from $5.5 to $9.7 million, the report said. There are other safeguards in place to make sure deceased beneficiaries aren't being sent checks. As of 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old. How often does Social Security pay people after they die? Mistakenly paying people after they die does happen, though not nearly to the extent Trump and Musk have suggested. An agency inspector general report from Nov. 2021 found that Social Security issued an estimated $298 million in payments after death to about 24,000 beneficiaries. Those individuals were mistakenly kept in 'suspended payment status' after they died. The audit said the agency recovered about $84 million, leaving an estimated $214 million unrecovered at the time of the report. But fraud wasn't the problem. The audit attributed the mistake to faults in policy and technician errors. Do I get my spouse's Social Security benefits when they die? '[The Social Security Administration] needs to enhance its policy and controls to identify deceased beneficiaries in suspended payment status and ensure technicians take appropriate action to record correct death information on their records,' the report said. The audit said maintaining better death data would help prevent identity fraud, though the inspector general 'did not identify specific instances of fraud.' Most American taxpayers would probably agree that mistakenly paying people after they died is unacceptable, no matter how much money went out. However, the problem wasn't uncovered by Musk or Trump, and the Social Security Administration agreed with the inspector general's recommended solutions back in 2021. The agency was in the process of implementing some of those changes as of last July. Separately, in January, the U.S. Treasury announced that it had clawed back more than $31 million in federal payments that mistakenly went to dead people across various programs, not just Social Security. How big of a problem is Social Security fraud? Experts Newsnation spoke to said Social Security fraud is rare. 'It's a very small issue in that program,' said Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Nowrasteh commended Musk for trying to root out problems but added, 'I don't think it does us any good to try to exaggerate the amount of fraud because the problems with Social Security are primarily not ones of fraud.' Improper payments, however, are a 'longstanding challenge' for the Social Security Administration, but again, that doesn't mean fraud is the main problem. Trump’s plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be costly A July 2024 report from the agency’s inspector general found that Social Security sent about $71.8 billion in improper payments between fiscal years 2015 and 2022 — most of which were overpayments to living people. That nearly $72 billion total represents 0.84% of the roughly $8.6 trillion paid out over the period. A portion of the overpayments have since been recovered; still, Social Security had a $23 billion uncollected overpayment balance at the end of fiscal year 2023, the audit said. Overpayments can happen for many reasons, such as if a person's income is more than they expected, their marital status changes or they don't report accurate information to the Social Security Administration. Social Security's sub-1% error rate is also fairly low compared to a program like Medicaid, which had an improper payment rate of over 5% in fiscal year 2024. Again, most of that was due to administrative mistakes, not fraud. 'If you had to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, Social Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,' said Charles Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University who specializes in Social Security.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/people-over-100-social-security/	2025-02-20T15:11:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Workforce_021525_Illustration_CJAPAdobe.png?w=900
Luigi Mangione case timeline, from UnitedHealthcare CEO killing t...	(NewsNation) — Luigi Mangione is awaiting trial for the killing of Brian Thompson, the former United Healthcare CEO. According to police, this was a planned shooting, and Mangione came to the city from Pennsylvania to conduct it. As Mangione is awaiting several trials to start, here's a detailed breakdown of what happened, according to multiple sources. What happened before the UnitedHealthcare CEO was killed? According to the indictment from December, Mangione arrived in New York City by bus on Nov. 24, 2024. He allegedly checked into the HI New York City Hostel using a fake ID under the name 'Mark Rosario.' He had extended his stay multiple times. Luigi Mangione speaks out for first time, sends message to supporters Mangione allegedly left his hotel on the morning of the shooting and traveled to Midtown Manhattan on an e-bike. The indictment claimed that Mangione stopped at a Starbucks at around 6:15 a.m. to purchase a water bottle and granola bars. Between 6:38 a.m. and 6:44 a.m., Mangione was seen standing silently against a wall across from the Hilton. The indictment said he was fully masked and wearing a hood. UnitedHealthcare CEO killed on streets of New York City On Dec. 4, 2024, UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, 50, was shot in the back and the leg by a masked gunman just before 7 a.m. It happened in front of a Hilton Hotel in New York City, according to officials. Thompson was taken to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting: Who was Brian Thompson? The suspect, Mangione, had allegedly been waiting for Thompson to arrive at the hotel for an investor's meeting. At the time, the New York Police Department was offering a $10,000 reward for information that led to the suspect's arrest. The FBI also offered a $50,000 reward at the time. This was a 'premeditated, preplanned, targeted attack,' New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch had told reporters. The suspect waited behind a parked car until Thompon passed and started shooting. He then ran through an alley, hopped on a bike, and rode through Central Park, according to officials. On the day of the shooting, UnitedHealth Group released a statement, reading in part, 'Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him.' Thompson had become CEO of the company in 2021 but had been with UnitedHealth Group since 2004. Before becoming CEO, he had led government programs for UnitedHealthcare, including Medicare. Mangione arrested in Pennsylvania After days of search, Mangione, 26, was arrested in Pennsylvania on separate weapon charges. New York prosecutors then filed a second-degree murder charge against him a few hours after his arrest. The arrest happened after a customer alerted an Altoona, Pennsylvania, McDonald's employee that Mangione was in the restaurant. Then, that employee called the police. Mangione denied bail A judge denied bail for Mangione in December as his attorneys were working to contest efforts to extradite him to New York from Pennsylvania. The state of Pennsylvania was pursuing a governor's warrant to transfer him. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 23: Luigi Mangione appears for his arraignment at Manhattan Criminal Court on December 23, 2024 in New York City. Mangione, 26, was arraigned on state murder charges in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a Manhattan street on December 4. (Photo by Curtis Means-Pool/Getty Images) As Mangione was escorted into a Pennsylvania courthouse, he shouted to reporters, 'It's completely an injustice and an insult to the American people.' On Dec. 19, Mangione was extradited back to New York City after he agreed during a hearing. Mangione pleads not guilty in UnitedHealthcare killing On Dec. 23, Mangione pleaded not guilty to state murder and terror charges. The district attorney in Manhattan had charged Mangione with several crimes, including: Stalking - Travel in interstate commerce Stalking - Use of interstate facilities Murder through use of a firearm Firearms offense Federal prosecutors also brought their own charges in New York's state trial court. Those charges could come with the death penalty if Mangione is found guilty. The maximum sentence for the state charges would be life without parole. Viral video shows Indiana police punch man during arrest Mangione's next federal court appearance has been scheduled for March 19, according to Newsweek. He will appear for his New York state case on Feb. 21 and for the Pennsylvania case on Feb. 24. Mangione's alleged manifesto Mangione, who had no prior criminal record, allegedly wrote a manifesto that is two to three pages long and talks about the insurance industry. Some quotes include: 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming.' 'I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done.' 'To the Feds, I'll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn't working with anyone.' 1979 cold case murder of Nebraska mother, son solved: Police According to NewsNation local affiliate WPIX, the words 'deny,' 'depose' and 'defend' were written on the shell casings found at the scene. UnitedHealthcare has the highest claim denial rate among insurance companies as of Dec. 2024. The company rejects 32% of submitted claims compared to the industry average of 16%. Reactions to Mangione's arrest, Thompson's death When word of Mangione's arrest started circulating, people on social media started posting in support of him. Dr. Cliff Lampe, professor of information and associate dean for academic affairs in the School of Information at the University of Michigan, told Forbes, 'It's hard to interpret for every individual what these memes mean to them, but in general they seem to represent a frustration with perceived inequities in the healthcare system and to some extent a much broader discontent with growing wealth inequality.' According to Newsweek, a fundraiser that was set up for Mangione has reached $1 million. This fund is supposed to be used for Mangione's legal defense fees. Many of those who made larger donations did so anonymously. In a statement on his website, Mangione said, 'I am overwhelmed by - and grateful for - everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support. Powerfully, this support has transcended political, racial, and even class divisions, as mail has flooded MDC from across the country, and around the globe.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangione-case-timeline/	2025-02-20T14:36:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Luigi-Mangione-1.jpg?w=900
Live: Elon Musk speaking at CPAC in Washington	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Elon Musk, who has become Trump’s close adviser, is set to meet with Argentine President Javier Milei, who is in Washington to attend the Conservative Political Action Conference. Musk was announced as a speaker for CPAC earlier Thursday by Mercedes Schlapp, a CPAC organizer. The scheduled meeting between Musk and Milei was confirmed by a person who insisted on anonymity to discuss an event that hadn’t yet been announced publicly and said the meeting was private and had been planned for weeks. Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after he won the election but before he took office. He was also invited to the inauguration.

Bird flu vaccine for chickens given conditional license from USDA	(NewsNation) — A New Jersey-based company announced last week that it received a conditional license from the United States Department of Agriculture for a bird flu vaccine that can be used for chickens. The company, Zoetis, said this license was granted on the 'demonstration of safety, purity, and reasonable expectation of efficacy based on serology data.' It noted that the decision to vaccinate commercial poultry flocks rests with national regulatory authorities and the industry itself. Mahesh Kumar, senior vice president of global biologics research and development at Zoetis, said in a statement that scientists began updating their previous bird flu vaccine when a new strain was identified in the U.S. three years ago. Elon Musk responds to DOGE check suggestion. What do we know? 'Our readiness with this most recent vaccine is another example of how we continue to live our purpose to nurture the world and humankind by advancing care for animals, ultimately providing solutions to global animal health challenges,' Kumar said. A USDA spokesperson told NBC News this conditional license doesn’t mean the vaccine has been approved for commercial use and that poultry farmers cannot yet purchase it. 'This is simply a normal step in the research and development phase, not in the implementation of a vaccine strategy,' the USDA spokesperson said. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins is expected 'in the coming days' to announce a new strategy to fight the flu, a USDA spokesperson said to NBC, though they did not say whether vaccines were included in this. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? Bird flu is currently widespread among wild birds worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States, there have been outbreaks in poultry and dairy cows. Currently, there are 69 cases of bird flu in the U.S. and one reported death. There is no person-to-person spread, and the current public health risk is low, the CDC says. However, a recently released report by the CDC said the virus may be going undetected in humans. Specifically, the report suggests the spread of bird flu between dairy cattle and humans has gone unchecked. This news comes as the Trump Administration froze external communications from the agency, which interrupted the agency’s weekly report. NewsNation digital producer Jordan Perkins contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/bird-flu-vaccine-chickens-conditional-license-usda/	2025-02-20T12:27:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b0fd24879635.20337920.jpeg?w=900
IRS to lay off 6,700 probationary workers	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The Internal Revenue Service will lay off 6,700 workers in Washington, D.C., and around the U.S. beginning Thursday, a government official told NewsNation. As of May 2024, the agency had more than 94,000 employees. About 1 out of every 7 of them have been on the job for a year or less. Another 1 of 7 have been employed there for one to two years. Making fast money on vending machines: Is it that easy? The layoffs are part of the administration's intensified efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection. They come despite IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season being told earlier this month that they would not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until mid-May after the taxpayer filing deadline. It's unclear how the layoffs may affect tax collection services this year. As the nation's revenue collector, the IRS was tasked during the Biden administration with targeting high-wealth tax evaders for an additional stream of income to the U.S., which is $36 trillion in debt. By the end of 2024, the IRS collected over $1.3 billion in back taxes from wealthy tax dodgers. Vance at CPAC: Europe ‘on the cusp of peace’ amid US talks with Russia In addition to the planned layoffs, the Trump administration intends to lend IRS workers to the Department of Homeland Security to assist with immigration enforcement. In a letter sent earlier this month, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to borrow IRS workers to help with ongoing immigration crackdown efforts. Representatives from the IRS and U.S. Treasury did not respond to requests for comment from NewsNation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/irs-layoffs-probationary-workers/	2025-02-20T11:54:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6724fb5ea2d7f2.14471130.jpeg?w=900
Senate confirms Kash Patel to lead FBI	The Senate on Thursday confirmed Kash Patel to serve as the head of the FBI, approving a pick with a string of controversial statements who has been accused by Democrats of directing a purge of bureau employees. Patel was confirmed in a 51-49 vote. Two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Main) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), voted against confirmation. Patel has said he would 'shut down' FBI headquarters on his first day in office and turn it into a 'museum to the deep state.' He’s alarmed Democrats by including a list of 'government gangsters' in a book he wrote by the same name. And Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Patel 'likely committed perjury' when he denied having insight into FBI firings that came the very next day. Durbin in a lengthy floor speech at turns called Patel 'vindictive,' 'dangerously politically extreme,' and warned Republicans 'will come to regret this vote, probably sooner rather than later.' 'When I think of giving this man a 10-year tenure as director of the leading criminal investigative agency in the world, I cannot imagine a worse choice. You want the person has that job and that power to destroy people simply by investigation to show some temperament and some judgment,' Durbin said. 'Kash Patel shows just the opposite.' FBI directors are confirmed to a 10-year term, but Patel was nominated shortly after President Trump was re-elected, a sign the returning executive planned to fire former FBI Director Christopher Wray ahead of the end of his term in 2027. A former public defender, Patel got his start in the political realm as a staffer to then-House Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). Patel played a key role there in seeking to discredit the committee Democrats’ investigation of Trump’s ties to Russia. That included authoring a report analyzing FBI and Justice Department responses in their own investigations of Russian election interference. That experience also inspired him to write a series of children's books, with a synopsis referencing 'a sinister cabal' that 'plotted to overthrow a president,' while Patel 'reveals how we can defeat the Deep State, reassert self-government, and restore our democracy.' That has sparked accusations from Democrats that Patel was chosen not for his skills but for his loyalty. Durbin referred a whistleblower tip to the Justice Department inspector general he said demonstrates Patel has already taken steps to carry out retribution, pointing to the firing of senior career FBI leaders. The Justice Department has since asked for a detailed list of all FBI employees who had a hand in the more than 1,500 cases brought against those in connection with the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6. Collins cited a purge of FBI staff as part of her rationale for not backing Patel, saying that, as well as his history of politically charged statements, 'cast doubt on Mr. Patel’s ability to advance the FBI’s law enforcement mission in a way that is free from the appearance of political motivation.' Murkowski did the same. 'My reservations with Mr. Patel stem from his own prior political activities and how they may influence his leadership. The FBI must be trusted as the federal agency that roots out crime and corruption, not focused on settling political scores,' she wrote on X amid the vote. 'I have been disappointed that when he had the opportunity to push back on the administration’s decision to force the FBI to provide a list of agents involved in the January 6 investigations and prosecutions, he failed to do so.' Most Republicans, however, see Patel as the right figure to turn around an FBI they’ve accused of being politicized and weaponized against Republicans. 'At the heart of their opposition is a fear that he’ll act like Democrats did when Democrats were in power. These Democrats are afraid the FBI, under Mr. Patel’s leadership, will use lawfare against political opponents, like the FBI used lawfare against President Trump and others,' Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a Wednesday night speech in favor of Patel. 'After reviewing Mr. Patel’s record and listening to his testimony at his hearing, I’m convinced these fears that the Democrats have are unfounded. Mr. Patel’s leadership will not be business as usual at the FBI, as it has been in previous administrations when the FBI – the people on the seventh floor, not the local agents – were used for political weaponization.' Patel served in a number of national security positions under the first Trump administration, taking on roles at the Department of Defense, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Council. But he often butted heads with other members of Trump’s team, with Democrats repeatedly pointing to criticism of Patel from former Attorney General Bill Barr and national security adviser John Bolton, who have both since become frequent Trump critics. Since leaving the Trump administration, he’s appeared on a series of right-wing podcasts and started a foundation that did fundraising for charity alongside a group of jailed Jan. 6 defendants who sold a recording of them singing the national anthem to raise money. Patel denied involvement in the matter during his confirmation hearing, despite previously boasting of helping the group record and distribute the track, including in social media posts. It was one example of many cases in which Patel dodged or demurred when asked about past controversial statements. 'We gave Mr. Patel numerous opportunities to explain, to walk back his threats. He chose not to, nor did he try to explain his so-called Deep State list of former government officials,' Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Thursday. 'He repeatedly misled the committee, dodged questions and claimed ignorance, claimed he didn't remember things he'd said just a few months before. Why would you want someone in the FBI doesn't remember things they said only a few months before? This is irresponsible at best and deceitful at worst.'

Could Los Angeles become the rattiest city in the United States?	(NewsNation) — California is the only state to ban the most lethal type of rat poison, so more rodents are living large these days, especially in Los Angeles. According to pest control experts, the rat population is booming, and service calls are way up. NewsNation headed out with rodent expert Louis Rico, and it took just 30 seconds for him to spot a rat burrow in someone’s front yard. The rodent residents were not home. Michael Strahan leaving GMA by summer: NewsNation exclusive Proponents had pushed for the ban on 'anticoagulant rodenticides' to protect pets and wildlife that might feed off toxic dead rats. When Gov. Gavin Newsom first signed the law, J.P. Rose, Urban Wildlands policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement that it was a 'relief to know the deadliest rat poisons will soon be off the market here.' 'This important legislation shows why California is an environmental leader. We’re willing to fight for wildlife protections,' Rose said in a statement. 'Birds, foxes and pumas shouldn’t be sacrificed every time there’s a pest problem.' However, according to exterminators, other types of extermination techniques just aren’t as effective as anticoagulant rodenticides. As a result, there has been a ballooning rodent population. Some say this could lead to a potential public health crisis. Chicago has claimed the top spot as the United States' rattiest city for 10 years straight, and Los Angeles is at No. 2. New York City is ranked third in cities with the most rats. San Francisco and Washington, D.C., round out the top five. The California rodenticide ban could mean a change is underway. 'My prediction is that probably by the end of the year, we will become the rattiest city in the United States, for sure,' Rico, owner of American Rat Control in Los Angeles, said. 'I’m wishing, hoping that we can get some of the old rodenticide back. That really worked.' The Southern California wildfires are another factor in the booming rat population. Social Security funds under Trump could run out in 6 years: Analysis Many people were displaced during the deadly blaze, and rodents have been as well, so many have made their way into surrounding communities. Rat sightings are up in San Francisco as well, prompting a column just yesterday in SFist on whether that city needs a rat czar like the one in New York City. In a single year, just two rats can produce thousands of offspring. Female rats can start reproducing five weeks after birth, and each can deliver litters of up to 12 every month. This is why many are pushing for more aggressive efforts in rat birth control, along with higher public awareness to combat habits that attract rats, like leaving out bird seed, pet food and garbage.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/los-angeles-rat-population/	2025-02-20T11:18:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-525973077-e1729628605321.jpg?w=800
Trump's executive order on independent agencies: What does it mea...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump’s executive order shifting independent agencies to fall under his authority appears to be a strategic move to put the definition of the president's scope of power in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court, legal experts say. Trump issued an order Tuesday requiring agencies that have long been congressionally authorized to be independent from the White House to now answer to him. This includes the Federal Communication Commission, the Postal Service and the Federal Trade Commission. The move follows a legal idea called the 'unitary executive' theory, which places executive authority on the president at the expense of Congress, according to Cornell University's Legal Information Institute. What has Trump accomplished during the first month of his second term? The Supreme Court has already shown a willingness to embrace the theory, and Trump’s presidency could be what tips the scale, Jeffrey Lubbers, a professor of administrative law at American University's Washington College of Law, told NewsNation. The nation's highest court has been trending towards this doctrine through several recent decisions, most notably its ruling to grant presidents absolute immunity from prosecution for official acts. The case stemmed from the Justice Department’s effort to prosecute Trump for allegedly trying to block the results of the 2020 election. 'It's all part of an overall strategy to take control of these 20 or 25 regulatory agencies that issue some important regulations,' he said. 'But Trump wants to do it sort of as a matter of constitutional law so that he, as president, has control over all of them.' The White House has described Trump’s directive as 'ensuring that all federal agencies are accountable to the American people, as required by the Constitution.' President Donald Trump listens as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks in the Oval Office at the White House on Feb. 13, 2025, in Washington. (Alex Brandon, Associated Press) What will happen to independent agencies in the short term? Trump has already installed Republicans to head many of these agencies, but his order takes control further, Lubbers said. These agencies will likely pull back on regulations that are pending, not enforce laws that were put forth during the Biden administration and act with less regulatory oversight, he argued. 'It's all part of trying to bring these independent agencies under the same control as the Cabinet departments and agencies that fall under the president,' he said. Many of these agencies function as multimember commissions that vote on decisions with both Republican and Democratic-appointed members to ensure fair application of the law. Trump’s plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be costly Several presidents have maintained this boundary for decades. Trump's order aims to do away with that as part of a broader push to assert authority over the government by possibly limiting the spending of congressionally approved funds, which could set up lawsuits and lead courts to step in, Shawn Donahue, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo, said. Under Trump’s order, the White House Office of Management and Budget would set performance standards and management objectives for the heads of independent agencies. The OMB could also change the funding apportioned to the agencies that might be in conflict with the president’s agenda. The heads of independent agencies would need to have special White House liaisons to coordinate with the president’s aides and advisers. Trump has already fired leaders serving terms at several independent agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Federal Labor Relations Authority. These firings have already been challenged in court.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) 'The long-term game [for Trump] is basically that eventually the court's going to start cutting back the powers of these independent agencies, and they signaled that already,' Lubbers said. 'But the short game for him is that he wants to get control right away, and that's why he's acting so fast.' Trump’s order is another road to the Supreme Court Trump’s executive order appears to be a path to the Supreme Court, which will be tasked with deciding how much power the president should have, Donahue said. 'It definitely seems like this is flowing into the unitary executive theory that says Congress really doesn't have that much of a role in setting up independent agencies. It's more up to the executive branch to have those things align with them,' he said. According to the unitary executive theory, the president possesses sole authority over the executive branch. The most controversial aspect of the theory is the president’s removal power, which allows them to remove any appointed subordinate officials of the executive branch. Advancing Trump agenda essential for American dream: Sen. Cassidy Trump likely believes he has a good shot with the Supreme Court ruling in his favor, and this appears to be one of his roads to get to them, Donahue said. The Supreme Court has been more open to expanding executive power, especially under the Trump administration, but also going after 'the administrative state,' Donahue said, referring to a court’s ruling last year that rejected a 40-year-old legal doctrine that effectively reduced the power of executive branch agencies. Some of these departments, like the FTC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, had been set up for almost 100 years to be independent, so this theory would turn that on its head, he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-order-independent-agencies/	2025-02-20T11:11:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a3f8319466e2.45436000.jpeg?w=900
State Dept. designates 8 cartels as foreign terror organizations	(NewsNation) — The Trump administration's immigration plans are shaping up, and this week, the State Department designated eight Latin American groups as foreign terrorist organizations. The groups include Venezuela-based Tren de Aragua, MS-13 from El Salvador and six groups based in Mexico, including the Sinaloa cartel. Billionaire Elon Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has also floated the idea of drone strikes against cartels. Congress would need to sign off on such an operation and give final approval. Democratic rep questions military medical deployment to Cuba The Trump administration may begin dismantling the groups inside the U.S. as they are believed to be active across the country. The Drug Enforcement Agency says the cartel is present in all 50 states. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, said he believes Tren de Aragua is present across the U.S. as well. Now that these groups have been designated as foreign terror organizations, there are legal ramifications for anyone who tries to help them, including U.S. citizens. Family members or associates of FTOs living in the U.S. are also eligible for removal and deportation. The Treasury Department will also be able to block asset transactions from the FTOs. Yesterday, a suspected TDA gang member was arrested in the Denver area for possession of a firearm. With this new designation, retired Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Victor Avila says individuals who are arrested in the U.S. with a connection to one of these groups are likely to wind up in Guantanamo Bay. Asylum-seekers: ‘The American dream is over’ 'This categorizes them, just like ISIS, al Qaeda, the Taliban,' Avila said. 'They're going to get picked up in places with different charges.' Avila said that he knows people will want them removed immediately, but he thinks the government should make an example of individuals found to be connected to an FTO. 'You're a terrorist or financing a terrorist organization. You get picked up under terrorist charges, maybe your next trip is to Gitmo, that's where we keep terrorists,' he said. Avila also said while people think military intervention is the first step in dealing with these groups, it's actually the final step. They have already done a lot of recon missions along the border and have already deployed troops, moving pieces in place to go after cartels. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has been given a month to come up with a plan to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and immigrants to the U.S. CIA expands drone flights over Mexico to locate cartels: Report Mexico has surged about 10,000 troops to the border, and the country is going after fentanyl labs, but Trump has said he wants Mexico to do more. Two generals from the U.S. and Mexico signed a joint statement of agreement to collaborate with each other, creating a pathway for open communication between the two nations. The CIA is also using Reaper drones to covertly hunt for cartels in their fentanyl labs, which Sheinbaum acknowledged was part of a coordinated effort between the U.S. and Mexico that has been going on for years.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/cartels-designated-foreign-terrorist-organizations/	2025-02-20T11:03:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GiWjQD4XEAALF34.jpg?w=360
Mitch McConnell won't seek reelection in 2026	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell is announcing on Thursday that he won’t seek reelection next year, ending a decadeslong tenure as a power broker who championed conservative causes but ultimately ceded ground to the fierce GOP populism of President Donald Trump. McConnell, the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history, chose his 83rd birthday to share his decision not to run for another term in Kentucky and to retire when his current term ends. He informed The Associated Press of his decision before he was set to address colleagues in a speech on the Senate floor. His announcement begins the epilogue of a storied career as a master strategist, one in which he helped forge a conservative Supreme Court and steered the Senate through tax cuts, presidential impeachment trials and fierce political fights. Trump Education pick Linda McMahon clears committee, heads to full Senate 'Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate,' McConnell said in prepared remarks provided in advance to the AP. 'Every day in between I’ve been humbled by the trust they’ve placed in me to do their business here. Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.' McConnell, first elected in 1984, intends to serve the remainder of his term ending in January 2027. The Kentuckian has dealt with a series of medical episodes in recent years, including injuries sustained from falls and times when his face briefly froze while he was speaking. The senator plans to deliver his speech in a chamber the famously taciturn McConnell revered as a young intern long before joining its back benches as a freshman lawmaker in the mid-1980s. His dramatic announcement comes almost a year after his decision to relinquish his leadership post after the November 2024 election. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a top McConnell deputy, replaced him as majority leader. McConnell's looming departure reflects the changing dynamics of the Trump-led GOP. He's seen his power diminish on a parallel track with both his health and his relationship with Trump, who once praised him as an ally but has taken to criticizing him in caustic terms. In Kentucky, McConnell's departure will mark the loss of a powerful advocate and will set off a competitive GOP primary next year for what will now be an open Senate seat. Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, seen as a rising star in his party for winning statewide office in Republican territory, has said he has no interest in the Senate, though he is widely viewed as a contender for higher office. McConnell, a diehard adherent to Ronald Reagan’s brand of traditional conservatism and muscular foreign policy, increasingly found himself out of step with a GOP shifting toward the fiery, often isolationist populism espoused by Trump. McConnell still champions providing Ukraine with weapons and other aid to fend off Russia’s invasion, even as Trump ratchets up criticism of the country and its leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The senator plans to make it clear Thursday that national defense remains at the forefront of his agenda. 'Thanks to Ronald Reagan’s determination, the work of strengthening American hard power was well underway when I arrived in the Senate,' McConnell said in his prepared remarks. 'But since then, we’ve allowed that power to atrophy. And today, a dangerous world threatens to outpace the work of rebuilding it. So, lest any of our colleagues still doubt my intentions for the remainder of my term: I have some unfinished business to attend to.' McConnell and Trump were partners during Trump's first term, but the relationship was severed after McConnell blamed Trump for 'disgraceful' acts in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack by his supporters. A momentary thaw in 2024 when McConnell endorsed Trump didn't last. Last week, Trump referred to McConnell as a 'very bitter guy' after McConnell, who battled polio as a child, opposed vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation as the nation’s top health official. McConnell referred to Trump as a 'despicable human being' and a 'narcissist' in a biography of the senator by The Associated Press' deputy Washington bureau chief, Michael Tackett. Before their falling out, Trump and McConnell pushed through a tax overhaul largely focused on reductions for businesses and higher-earning taxpayers. They joined forces to reshape the Supreme Court when Trump nominated three justices and McConnell guided them to Senate confirmation, tilting the high court to the right. McConnell set a new precedent for hardball partisan tactics in 2016 by refusing to even give a hearing to Democratic President Barack Obama’s pick of Merrick Garland to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Putting the brakes on the Senate's 'advise and consent' role for judicial nominees, McConnell said the vacancy should be filled by the next president so voters could have their say. Trump filled the vacancy once he took office, and McConnell later called the stonewalling of Garland's nomination his 'most consequential' achievement. Later, when liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died weeks before the 2020 presidential election won by Democrat Joe Biden, McConnell rushed Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation through the Senate, waving off allegations of hypocrisy. What is the DOGE check being floated on X? McConnell also guided the Senate — and Trump — through two impeachment trials that ended in acquittals. In the second impeachment, weeks after the deadly Capitol attack by a mob hoping to overturn Trump’s 2020 reelection defeat, McConnell joined all but seven Republicans in voting to acquit. McConnell said he believed Trump couldn’t be convicted because he’d already left office, but the senator also condemned Trump as 'practically and morally responsible' for the insurrection. McConnell over the years swung back and forth from majority to minority leader, depending on which party held power. He defended President George W. Bush’s handling of the Iraq war and failed to block Obama’s health care overhaul. McConnell, the longest-serving senator ever from Kentucky, ensured that the Bluegrass State received plenty of federal funding. Back home he was a key architect in his party's rise to power in a state long dominated by Democrats. He is married to Elaine Chao, and they have long been a power couple in Washington. In his prepared remarks Thursday, the senator referred to her as his 'ultimate teammate and confidante.' Chao was labor secretary for Bush and transportation secretary during Trump's first term, though she resigned after the Capitol insurrection, saying it had 'deeply troubled' her. McConnell's parting words reflected his devotion to the Senate and his disdain for his detractors. 'The Senate is still equipped for work of great consequence,' he said. 'And, to the disappointment of my critics, I’m still here on the job.' ___ Follow the AP's coverage of Mitch McConnell at https://apnews.com/hub/mitch-mcconnell.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-sen-mitch-mcconnell-wont-seek-reelection-in-2026-ending-long-tenure-as-republican-power-broker/	2025-02-20T08:15:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b7556f549ed6.26807974.jpeg?w=900
What has Trump accomplished during the first month of his second ...	(NewsNation) — In the first month of his second term, President Donald Trump has signed dozens of executive orders targeting issues ranging from immigration to gender identity, while his administration has held near-daily impromptu news conferences and multiple meetings with foreign leaders. Sources told NewsNation it feels like it has been 100 days since Trump took office, instead of just over 30. They expect more action in the coming days from the president, including a push to work more closely with Congress. Trump has teased an upcoming meeting with Democrats at the White House. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? Executive orders On his first day in office, Trump signed 26 executive orders. Comparatively, he signed 33 during his first 100 days in 2017. Many of the executive orders Trump has signed so far are aimed at immigration, including one that declared a national emergency at the southern border and directed the Department of Defense to send 1,500 troops to the area, adding to the 2,500 already there. Military helicopters have been deployed to deport migrants, and Immigration and Communications Enforcement officers have been conducting large-scale operations in cities across the United States. 'I think they're doing a great job. You know, you have people that are hiding. We have professionals that hiding,' Trump said of the ICE raids. NTSB investigating midair collision in Arizona The moves come as Trump reportedly expands the CIA’s use of drone surveillance flights over Mexico. The White House recently designated drug cartels and other transnational criminal groups as terrorist organizations. Other executive orders have aimed at diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government and educational institutions. Some private companies have reversed their DEI-related programs as a result. Federal agencies have also been directed to use sex, not gender, in federal policies and documents. Another executive order banned transgender athletes from competing in girls and women’s sports. Efficiency within the government Trump also created the Department of Government Efficiency, which he said would 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy were tapped to lead DOGE after Trump’s reelection. However, Ramaswamy has since left the department, and the White House has said in legal documents that Musk is not actually in charge at DOGE but is instead an adviser to the president. Members of DOGE reportedly gained access to sensitive and classified data, which has sparked concern from lawmakers. The Associated Press recently reported that DOGE gained access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security systems. DOGE agents also gained access to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency said this month. New York Magazine reported at least one DOGE worker has been to the Commerce Department’s Maryland headquarters, where they gained access to the agency’s IT system. Additionally, DOGE took control of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s funding, locked out workers, accessed classified information and removed leadership. Elon Musk responds to DOGE check suggestion. What do we know? A lawsuit filed by 14 Democratic states challenged DOGE’s authority to access sensitive government data. The attorneys general argued Musk has power that can only be given to those elected or confirmed through the Senate. While U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan said there are legitimate questions about Musk’s authority, she refused to issue a temporary restraining order blocking him from accessing government data systems or participating in worker layoffs. With federal cuts have come layoffs and firings. While no official number of those terminated has been made available, the Associated Press estimates that thousands of federal employees have been shown the door in the wake of Trump's directives. About 77,000 federal employees have accepted a deferred resignation offer spearheaded by the Trump administration. Despite court-ordered deadline extensions, U.S. District Court Judge George O’Toole ultimately declined to further pause the program, allowing the government to proceed. Cabinet picks A number of Trump’s picks for his Cabinet have been confirmed by the Senate, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Attorney General Pam Bondi; Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy; Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth; Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Hegseth is headed to Guantanamo Bay on Thursday as the U.S. ramps up migrant detention operations at the military outpost in Cuba. The visit comes one day after House Democrats sent Hegseth a letter asking why military resources such as aircraft and doctors are being diverted to the base.

Making fast money on vending machines: Is it that easy?	(NewsNation) — More Americans are picking up side hustles, and vending machines are being touted on social media as a simple way to generate 'passive' income. How-to videos on TikTok and YouTube show vending entrepreneurs unloading bricks of cash. The short, punchy clips have racked up millions of views and explain how others can turn 'snacks into stacks' with little effort. With roughly 3 million vending machines across the U.S., the sector is worth an estimated $18.2 billion, according to the NAMA Foundation’s 2022-2023 industry census report. Are millions of dead people receiving Social Security benefits? So, how hard is it to get in on the action? Claim: Vending machines are a simple, lucrative side hustle Vending how-tos on TikTok and YouTube have clicky, eye-catching titles that give the impression business is booming: 'He turned vending machines into a $500k business' (TikTok) '6 months in vending business and already made $10k' (TikTok) '2-Day Workweek Earns $700K - Vending Machine Business' (YouTube) One YouTube short with over 58 million views claims to show the start-up process from start to finish. The user says he bought five used vending machines for $4,000, loaded them up with inventory from Costco and then profited $750 per month for two hours of work. How the vending machine side hustle works Social media makes getting started look easy: buy a machine, put it somewhere with foot traffic, stock it with stuff people want and swing by occasionally to collect your cash. The videos follow a similar pattern. Vending entrepreneurs unlock their machines, pull out the cash and see which snacks or drinks are running low. From there, influencers head to big box stores like Costco or Sam’s Club to replenish their machines. Viewers get the sense that there’s little time and energy involved. What they’re not telling you about vending machines The location of the vending machines is everything 'The biggest difficulty is finding a good location and negotiating with the owner,' said Brandon Schlichter, who has two dozen vending machines across central Ohio. What are OASDI taxes? They help fund your retirement Schlichter estimates his machines bring in $3,000 to $3,500 a month — about $100 to $150 each. After factoring in costs like inventory and electricity, he said he makes around $2,000 in profit across all 24 units. 'It’s a nice little side piece of income. I’ve done well with it,' said Schlichter, a serial entrepreneur who shares business tips with nearly 2 million subscribers on his YouTube channel 'Investment Joy.' Schlichter’s machines are spread across laundromats, car washes and rental properties. Negotiating is also important Foot traffic is one factor to consider, but negotiating favorable terms with a building owner is just as important. There is no standard playbook. Some landlords charge rent to host a machine, while others may ask for a commission. 'If you're a good salesperson, you can get a location for free,' Schlichter said. 'It's a sales pitch to a business owner to get more foot traffic.' Manufacturing plants were the most popular location in 2023, making up 40% of the vending machine market, according to Automatic Merchandiser’s State of the Industry report. Offices were the second most common location at 21.5%, followed by colleges and universities at 9.2%. John Talbott, a senior lecturer focusing on retail at Indiana University, recommends scouting out locations and talking with potential landlords before buying a machine. 'Before I would invest, I'd walk around and I'd have 20 deals cut with somebody that said, ‘Yeah, you can bring one in,’' he said. Choose the right product for the vending machine Once you have a location, you’ll have to decide what to put in it. One common mistake is stocking your machine based on what you like, which can be a 'recipe for disaster,' Schlichter said. 'I've run into people that went and bought thousands of dollars worth of product for a vending machine, thinking that they could convert a factory to healthy foods, and then everything expired,' he said. Simple savings: Ways to save money when eating out Cold beverage machines are the most common and accounted for 27% of vending sales last year, the most of any category, according to Automatic Merchandiser’s report. Snacks were the second-largest product category (17%) by revenue, followed by candy (14%). As far as inventory, small operators often buy in bulk at stores like Costco and Sam’s Club. 'I know people that are in high volume, high traffic locations, and they're taking that 25-cent bag of chips, and they're reselling it for $1.50,' Schlichter said. A final point: scale matters. The more machines you have, the more money you’ll make. 'You're not going to really make a lot of money off one machine,' Talbott said. Big picture: How many people are buying vending machines? Vending machines have a relatively low barrier to entry, which makes them competitive. Schlichter said used machines can cost anywhere from $500 to $2,000 on eBay and Facebook Marketplace. New machines are more expensive, costing about $3,500 to $6,800 at Sam’s Club. Small-time operators may be less common than social media makes it seem. The NAMA Foundation found that the 'typical' operator maintains 277 machines. NAMA estimates the typical operator generates around $6,000 in revenue per machine annually, about $500 a month. At the end of the day, Schlichter sees vending machines as a low-risk endeavor that, like any other business, requires hard work and practice. 'The only way that you learn is to go out and do it,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/vending-machines-get-rich-quick-is-it-that-easy/	2025-02-20T06:59:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/image-7.png?w=900

Multiple states pushing to ban or restrict mRNA vaccines	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump's new 'Make America Healthy Again' commission is reviewing certain vaccines and possible links to chronic illnesses as some states push to restrict the use of COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccines using messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology became widespread during the pandemic. With limited long-term studies available, the Trump administration is revisiting these vaccines. RFK Jr. eyes childhood vaccine schedule review, says ‘nothing off limits’ What are mRNA vaccines? Vaccines using mRNA are based on RNA technology that dates back to the 1960s. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Pfizer and Moderna used the technology, which teaches the immune system to fight the virus without containing the virus itself, for their COVID-19 vaccines. Essentially, mRNA vaccines aim to boost the immune system's ability to defend against various diseases. Three states are independently addressing safety concerns related to mRNA vaccines. States considering mRNA vaccine bans In Idaho, lawmakers are considering Senate Bill 1036, known as the Doug Cameron Act, which seeks a 10-year pause on 'gene therapy immunizations to ensure the safety and well-being of all Idahoans.' The bill, named after an Idaho rancher who claims he became paralyzed in 2021 after taking the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, also seeks to ban RNA-based immunizations. On Monday, Idaho's Senate Health and Welfare Committee heard arguments regarding the bill for two hours but did not vote on it. In Montana, lawmakers considered similar legislation, but House Bill 371 failed after 66 representatives voted against it, with 34 in favor. In Florida, State Surgeon General Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo has urged doctors to stop recommending mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. What to know about measles outbreaks in the Southwest He raised concerns about 'nucleic acid contaminants' in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, suggesting these could introduce 'contaminant DNA' into human cells and increase cancer risks. In December, the FDA responded to a letter from Ladapo outlining the same concerns. Officials dismissed the claims as 'quite implausible' and 'misleading.' Doctor: 'You can't hold back science' Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases professor at Vanderbilt University, compared banning mRNA technology to banning artificial intelligence. 'The radio was fine, the telephone was good, the computer is better, but we're not going to do AI; we're going to ban it. So you can't hold back science. Science is constantly advancing and creating newer and better and more effective vaccines. mRNA vaccines are an example of that,' he said. A new experimental mRNA vaccine could help manage the outbreak of bird flu seen in birds and cattle, and also prevent human infections.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/mahas-multiple-states-push-mrna-vaccine-ban/	2025-02-20T05:24:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/10/651aef5172dc16.50093677.jpeg?w=900
Hamas returns bodies of 4 Israeli hostages said to include mother...	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas on Thursday released the bodies of four Israeli hostages, said to include a mother and her two children who have long been feared dead and had come to embody the nation's agony following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. The remains were said to be of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, as well as Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted. Kfir, who was 9 months old when he was taken, was the youngest captive. Hamas has said all four were killed along with their guards in Israeli airstrikes. 'Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters,' Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement. 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely.' Netanyahu appoints an adviser with Trump ties to lead ceasefire talks The militants displayed four black coffins on a stage in the Gaza Strip surrounded by banners, including a large one depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a vampire. Thousands of people, including large numbers of masked and armed militants, looked on as the coffins were loaded onto Red Cross vehicles before being driven to Israeli forces. The military planned to hold a small funeral ceremony, at the request of the families, before transferring the bodies to a laboratory for formal identification using DNA, a process that could take up to two days. Only then will the families be given the final notification. Israeli channels did not broadcast the handover. In Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, where Israelis have gathered to watch the release of living hostages, a large screen showed a compilation of photos and videos of Lifshitz and the Bibas family, including a chuckling baby Kfir and the family dressed up in Batman costumes. Israelis have celebrated the return of 24 living hostages in recent weeks under a tenuous ceasefire that paused over 15 months of war. But the handover on Thursday was a grim reminder of those who died in captivity as the talks leading up to the truce dragged on for over a year. It could also provide impetus for negotiations on the second stage of the ceasefire that have hardly begun. The first phase is set to end at the beginning of March. Infant was the youngest taken hostage Kfir Bibas was just 9 months old, a red-headed infant with a toothless smile, when militants stormed into the family’s home on Oct. 7, 2023. His brother Ariel was 4. Video shot that day showed a terrified Shiri swaddling the two boys as militants led them into Gaza. Her husband, Yarden Bibas, was taken separately and released this month after 16 months in captivity. Relatives in Israel have clung to hope, marking Kfir’s first and second birthdays and his brother's fifth. The Bibas family said in a statement Wednesday that it would wait for 'identification procedures' before acknowledging that their loved ones were dead. Palestinians should be able to leave Gaza if they choose: Israel envoy Supporters throughout Israel have worn orange in solidarity with the family — a reference to two boys' red hair — and a popular children’s song was written in their honor. Like the Bibas family, Oded Lifshitz was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, along with his wife Yocheved, who was freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Oded was a journalist who campaigned for the recognition of Palestinian rights and peace between Arabs and Jews. Hamas-led militants abducted 251 hostages, including some 30 children, in the Oct. 7 attack, in which they also killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. More than half the hostages, and most of the women and children, have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight and have recovered dozens of bodies of people killed in the initial attack or who died in captivity. It's not clear if the ceasefire will last Hamas is set to free six living hostages on Saturday in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and says it will release four more bodies next week, completing the ceasefire's first phase. That will leave the militants with some 60 hostages, all men, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he is committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Trump Gaza plan may hurt national security: Counterterrorism expert Trump's proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it, which has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries, has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. Hamas could be reluctant to free more hostages if it believes the war will resume with the goal of annihilating the group or forcibly transferring Gaza's population. Israel's military offensive killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its records.

IRS to lose thousands of jobs in small-business division: Reports	(NewsNation) — The Internal Revenue Service is expecting to terminate more than 3,500 employees who work in the small business/self-employed division. CBS News first reported the expected firings, which were announced to managers in the division Wednesday. The terminations are expected to affect probationary hires who are 'not deemed as critical to filing season.' The division helps small businesses and entrepreneurs comply with taxes and assists with debt relief, serving 57 million Americans. USDA proposes ban on buying junk food with SNAP benefits The IRS is experiencing some of the largest numbers of mass firings at an agency across departments even as the peak tax season, which goes from mid-March through mid-April, approaches. Another division, which handles large business and international issues, also received an email requesting managers come into the office Thursday to discuss firings but did not say how many people would lose their jobs. The IRS employs tens of thousands of people and the firings come as the Trump administration has worked to terminate probationary hires across federal agencies. Trump’s plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be costly In some cases, the firings have led agencies to scramble to try to get people back as people in critical roles, including those who safeguard the nation's nuclear weapons and those who play a role in preventing a bird flu pandemic, were fired in mass terminations. The Department of Government Efficiency, headed by billionaire Elon Musk, has been working to access information in federal agencies, including an internal data system at the IRS that has Americans' individual tax information.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/irs-lose-thousand-job/	2025-02-19T16:13:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b0ff7edd3ef6.53568435.jpeg?w=900
Flight simulator shows view of conditions during Toronto crash	(NewsNation) — A flight instructor gave NewsNation a glimpse of what pilots might have seen from the cockpit when a Delta flight flipped over on landing. The flight from Minneapolis to Toronto crashed and flipped upside down, injuring several people at Toronto's Pearson Airport. Pilot Robert Thomas put the weather conditions for that day into a flight simulator to show what the pilots could have experienced. NTSB investigating mid-air collision in Arizona The flight simulator was for a 737, which is larger than the CRJ-900 that flipped. But the view would be similar. As pilots approach, they would have disengaged autopilot, Thomas said, pointing out a view of a runway and lights that they would have seen as they were about five miles away. The pilots would have been landing on a runway more than 11,000 feet long in snowy and windy conditions. 'If I have a lot of wind blowing on my aircraft, it's going to change the amount of wind blowing over my wings, which affects lift,' Thomas said. 'So if I have a gust of wind that hits my aircraft and it dies off, that's going to affect how my aircraft flies.' Winds coming from any direction can also help push the plane's path. There was also a lot of snow on the ground, with Toronto having received 20 inches of snow prior to Monday's incident. Aviation firings a ‘concern’ amid increase in plane crashes The wind would be blowing snow across the runway, potentially creating optical illusions and visibility challenges for pilots. However, Thomas said airports usually do a good job of keeping runways clear. Thomas explained that when coming in for a landing, pilots would be focusing on keeping the wings level and the nose down, correcting for winds with the yoke and rudder pedals to make sure the plane doesn't get pushed off the runway. The investigation into Monday's crash is still underway and it's too soon to say if weather is the cause or what other factors could have come into play. 'The really special thing about the aviation industry is that everybody is working together to make things operate safely,' Thomas said. 'When things do get crazy, do get a little unsafe, everybody works together to make sure the best outcome is possible.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/flight-simulator-conditions-toronto-crash/	2025-02-19T14:29:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/DeltaThumb.jpg?w=900
Trump's plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be co...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump wants to eliminate income taxes on Social Security benefits, but a new analysis shows that plan comes at a steep cost and would worsen the program's financial shortfall. Ending taxes on benefits would reduce government revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7% by 2054, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model. Nixing taxes would also move up the date when the Social Security trust fund is expected to run out. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? As it currently stands, retirees could see their benefits slashed by 21% in roughly a decade if Congress doesn't fix the program, which pays out more than it brings in. Trump's plan to end income taxes on benefits would accelerate the estimated depletion date of the Social Security Trust Fund by two years, from December 2034 to December 2032, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. 'I think it is a bad idea not to tax benefits for people receiving them,' said Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Nowrasteh pointed out that the Social Security Fairness Act, which Joe Biden recently signed into law, will also accelerate the program's financial woes. 'The government is not taking seriously the fiscal problems that Social Security has,' Nowrasteh warned. Social Security head resigns following DOGE data request: Reports Experts previously told NewsNation that Trump's Social Security tax promise would be hard to keep but that hasn't stopped Republican lawmakers from trying. Representatives Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Daniel Webster, R-Fla., recently reintroduced the Senior Citizens Tax Elimination Act, which would end federal income taxes on Social Security benefits and boost the retirement income of older Americans. Who gets taxed on their Social Security benefits? About half of Social Security beneficiaries pay income tax on their benefits, according to the latest estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. The amount of tax owed varies depending on one's income. As of now, individuals who earn more than $25,000 may have to pay taxes on up to 50% of their Social Security retirement benefits. For those who earn more than $34,000, up to 85% of benefits could be taxable. One of the main critiques of the current system is that those thresholds don't go up with inflation, so over time, more retirees have been subject to taxes on their benefits. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits The counter-argument is that taxing benefits helps the government fund Social Security. Income from taxation makes up roughly 4% of what the program brings in, about $50 billion that Social Security would have to find elsewhere. The Penn Wharton Budget Model said 95% of retirees would benefit if Trump's campaign promise was implemented, but 'all future generations would be worse off.' And if taxes on Social Security benefits are eliminated, the biggest gains would go toward high-income retirees. Some high-income households, who currently pay the most in taxes on Social Security benefits, would gain more than $100,000 over their lifetimes, the analysis found. However, households in the lowest two income quintiles would see more modest gains, ranging from $1,000 to $2,000. Meanwhile, those younger than 30 would be worse off, with newborn households losing about $10,000 in lifetime welfare, the analysis said. The report concluded: 'The policy primarily benefits high-income households nearing or in retirement while harming households under thirty and all future generations across the entire income distribution.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/trumps-taxes-social-security-benefits/	2025-02-19T14:22:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67afdf41832241.40142539.jpeg?w=900
President Trump, Elon Musk sit for first TV interview	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk sat down for a joint interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity on Tuesday and defended the administration’s efforts to conduct an expansive overhaul of the federal government. The interview was the latest display of Trump sharing the spotlight with Musk, following an Oval Office appearance by the Tesla CEO last week in which he fielded several questions from reporters while the president sat at the Resolute Desk. The White House says billionaire Elon Musk is not technically part of the Department of Government Efficiency team sweeping through federal agencies, but is rather a senior adviser to the president. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? In the interview, Musk defended DOGE’s work and claimed the department is working to root out 'unelected' bureaucrats in the U.S. government. 'They wouldn't be complaining so much if we weren't doing something useful… What we're really trying to do here is restore the will of the people through the president. And what we're finding is that there's an unelected bureaucracy — speaking of unelected, there's a vast federal bureaucracy that is implacably opposed to the president and the cabinet.' He brushed aside Democratic criticisms of DOGE, insisting the try agency is trying 'to restore democracy and the will of the people.' Musk's exact role could be key in the legal fight over DOGE's access to government data as the Trump administration moves to lay off thousands of federal workers. Defining him as an adviser rather than the administrator in charge of day-to-day operations at DOGE could help the administration as it pushes back against a lawsuit arguing Musk has too much power for someone who isn't elected or Senate-confirmed.

Elon Musk responds to DOGE check suggestion: What do we know?	(NewsNation) — A suggestion by an X user to send a check to taxpayers using money saved by President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency gained traction online after Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to it. 'President Trump and @ElonMusk should announce a ‘DOGE Dividend' — a tax refund check sent to every taxpayer, funded exclusively with a portion of the total savings delivered by DOGE,' James Fishback, CEO of InvestAzoria, said on X. Should DOGE save $2 trillion it's said it aims to cut, and with 78 million tax-paying households in the United States, Fishback said this would amount to a $5,000 refund per household, 'with the remaining used to pay down the national debt.' Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? 'Will check with the President,' Musk said on X, later writing, 'Obviously, the President is the Commander-in-Chief, so this is entirely up to him.' Could we get a DOGE dividend check? It still remains to be seen whether these checks will come to fruition. The idea got mixed reactions online, with Dilbert creator Scott Adams saying, 'The worst case scenario or DOGE is our government treating DOGE 'savings' as their new piggy bank, which I fear Congress is already doing.' 'This particular idea — the $5K tax refund — has utility if it gets the public on the side of DOGE,' Adams said. 'But it also sets a precedent that can't be ignored.' In response, Musk said, 'We need to balance the budget as first priority.' NewsNation has reached out to the Trump administration for comment. What is DOGE? DOGE was created by Trump under an executive order. The president said at the time it would 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. Members of DOGE have been going into federal agencies, looking at their budgets and tapping into computer systems. The Associated Press recently reported that DOGE got access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security systems. DOGE agents also gained access to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency said this month. New York Magazine reported at least one DOGE worker has been to the Commerce Department’s Maryland headquarters, where they gained access to the agency’s IT system. In addition, DOGE took control of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s money, locked out workers, accessed classified information and removed leadership. Education Department warns schools to cut DEI programs or lose funding DOGE cuts With the new federal cuts have come layoffs and firings, with the Associated Press estimating that thousands of federal employees have been shown the door, though no official figure is available. Last Thursday, Office of Personnel Management officials met with agency leaders Thursday and directed them to start firing probationary employees. A lawsuit filed by 14 Democratic states challenged DOGE’s authority to access sensitive government data. Attorneys general argued that Musk has power that can only be given to those elected or confirmed through the Senate. While U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan said there are legitimate questions about Musk’s authority, she refused Tuesday to issue a temporary restraining order blocking him from accessing government data systems or participating in worker layoffs. The White House, meanwhile, says Musk is not technically a part of DOGE but a senior adviser to Trump. Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, said in court papers that Musk has 'no actual authority to make government decisions himself.' Social Security head resigns following DOGE data request: Reports How much has DOGE said it’s saved? DOGE claims that it has saved the government $55 billion — however, Bloomberg notes that its website only accounts for $16.6 billion of that, even without factoring in a previous error that mislabeled one contract as $8 billion. (It was actually $8 million, the New York Times reported.) Currently listed online are a 'subset' of DOGE’s contract and lease cancellations. 'We are working to upload all of this data in a digestible and fully transparent manner with clear assumptions, consistent with applicable rules and regulations,' the DOGE website says. Contracts it has cut from include USAID, the Department of Education, the Office of Personnel Management, Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Homeland Security, the General Services Administration, the Department of Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency and Housing and Urban Development. Experts, including two Republicans who spoke to Reuters, say that most of these 'savings' are driven more by ideological views than economic ones. 'They are not going to go into agencies that are doing things they like. They are going into agencies they disagree with,' Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Republican director of the Congressional Budget Office, told Reuters. Another criticism of DOGE includes a conflict of interest with Musk as his company SpaceX has received money from federal contracts.

DOGE affiliate may access IRS taxpayer records: Report	(NewsNation) — An IRS employee affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency is expected to seek access to a system that holds sensitive taxpayer information, according to NBC News. DOGE is specifically looking to get into the Integrated Data Retrieval System, which allows IRS employees to see taxpayer accounts. A DOGE staffer visited the agency Thursday to meet with executives, according to Reuters. Elon Musk’s DOGE has access to these federal agencies According to the IRS website, the IDRS is used to 'research account information and request returns' and to 'automatically generate notices, collection documents and other outputs.' It contains information such as taxpayer identification numbers and retirement account information. The move comes as DOGE is expanding its efforts to access sensitive information that the federal government holds.

Trump: Zelensky 'has done a terrible job'	President Trump on Wednesday ratcheted up his criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, accusing him of taking advantage of the United States and saying he has done a 'terrible job' leading his war-torn country. Trump went after Zelensky and questioned U.S. support for Ukraine in its war against Russia a day after he appeared to blame the Ukrainian leader for starting the conflict. Zelensky responded to those earlier comments by saying Trump 'lives in this disinformation space.' 'Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle,' Trump posted Wednesday on Truth Social. He questioned why the United States has spent billions of dollars in support of Ukraine and why the Biden administration did not demand Europe put in an equal amount, given its proximity to the conflict. 'He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden 'like a fiddle,'' Trump wrote of Zelensky. 'A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. 'In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do. Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring Peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the 'gravy train' going,' Trump continued. 'I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died – And so it continues…..' Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after amassing troops on the border and demanding a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO. The invasion took place nearly a decade after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine postponed its 2024 presidential elections because of martial law being in place amid the Russian invasion. Top Trump administration officials met Tuesday in Saudi Arabia with Russian officials in the first step toward negotiating a ceasefire agreement in Ukraine. The meeting did not include Ukrainian officials, which irked Zelensky. Trump vowed to end the war during his presidential campaign. He has shrugged off questions about which party is at fault or whether Ukraine is an equal member of peace talks, saying he wants the killing to stop. His rhetoric about ending the war, and the fact that he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week before talking to Zelensky, has marked a shift in posture from the Biden administration, which championed the concept of 'nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.' Trump on Tuesday was sharply critical of Zelensky when asked by reporters about the meeting in Saudi Arabia. 'Today I heard, ‘Oh, well we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,' he said of Ukraine. 'You should’ve ended it in three years. You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.' Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week called it 'unrealistic' for Ukraine to return to its pre-2014 borders as part of a ceasefire agreement with Russia, or to gain NATO membership. Those comments sparked criticism, as some saw it as giving away negotiating leverage for Ukraine before peace talks began in earnest. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, Congress had approved nearly $183 billion in Ukraine aid, according to a federal government oversight office. A Jan. 20 release from the State Department said the U.S. had provided roughly $66 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since February 2022, as well as billions of dollars in other forms of support.

NTSB investigating mid-air collision in Arizona	(NewsNation) — The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating a mid-air collision between two small planes in Marana, Arizona. Two people have been confirmed dead following the accident, Marana police confirmed. The collision took place just before 8:30 a.m. local time near the Marana Regional Airport and involved a Cessna 172S and a Lancair 360 MK II. Trump says ‘inflation is back’: ‘I had nothing to do with it’ Preliminary information shows the planes collided upwind of runway 12. The Cessna was able to land and the Lancair crashed nearby and a fire broke out after impact. According to the FAA, the airport is an 'uncontrolled field' that does not have an air traffic control tower in use. Pilots use a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency to communicate with other planes in the vicinity of the airport. An NTSB investigator is on the way and anyone who witnessed the accident or who has surveillance video, including doorbell camera video, of the area is encouraged to contact the agency. Aviation firings a ‘concern’ amid increase in plane crashes The accident is one in a string of several plane crashes since the start of 2025, the largest of which was a mid-air collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people. Other aviation accidents include a medical jet that crashed in Philadelphia; a plane that crashed in Alaska; a military jet that crashed into the San Diego Bay and a Delta flight that flipped over upon landing in Toronto.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/mid-air-collision-arizona/	2025-02-19T10:38:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/ArizonaPlaneThumb.jpg?w=552
USDA proposes ban on buying junk food with SNAP benefits	(NewsNation) — U.S. Department of Agriculture Chief Tom Vilsack has proposed that the 'Make America Healthy Again' commission consider banning junk food and sugary drink purchases using food stamps. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program should prioritize healthy food choices. However, many of those options are costly compared to cheap, ultraprocessed foods, and accessibility is an issue for low-income communities. The proposal follows Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s vow to remove soda from items eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits. Over 40M Americans receive SNAP benefits Last year, 41.7 million Americans received SNAP benefits, according to the USDA, which cost taxpayers nearly $94 billion. Each recipient received about $188 per month. Congress is currently considering two bills addressing SNAP benefits. One seeks to ban SNAP purchases of junk foods like cookies, cakes, pies and sodas, while the other aims to improve the nutrition and diet quality of food available to recipients. Republicans consider cuts and work requirements for Medicaid, jeopardizing care for millions Another economic argument favoring the ban is that taxpayers are indirectly paying twice: once to fund the purchase of junk food and again to fund medical costs resulting from chronic diseases linked to poor diets. Doctor: Incentives need to support farmers, fresh produce Dr. Joel Warsh, a pediatrician, supports the idea of banning junk food purchases with food stamps but also believes the government needs a plan for incentives to support local farmers and fresh produce. He notes that the American diet, 70% of which is made up of ultraprocessed foods, is a key cause of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. He also highlighted a disturbing rise in type 2 diabetes in children. 'It's called adult-onset diabetes. It wasn't even something that you would have seen when I was a kid, in a child, but now we're seeing it in teenagers and even younger children,' Warsh said. 'Going back to diabetes, like one-third of kids are diabetic or pre-diabetic, that is not okay. We have to do something about that. It's not the same all over the world.' It's unclear when or how these proposed changes to the SNAP program will be implemented and whether they'll come through Congress or the 'Make America Healthy Again' commission.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/usda-proposes-junk-food-ban-snap-benefits/	2025-02-19T06:41:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-1205050194-e1727116913367.jpg?w=800
Trump 'lives' in Russian 'disinformation space': Zelenskyy	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to President Donald Trump's latest rebuke, calling out Trump for living in a Russian 'disinformation space.' 'Unfortunately, President Trump, I have great respect for him as a leader of a nation that we have great respect for, the American people who always support us, unfortunately lives in this disinformation space,' Zelenskyy told reporters early Wednesday. His claim follows Trump's news conference from his Mar-a-Lago resort Tuesday evening, where he criticized the Ukrainian leader and claimed his approval ratings were low. Trump says he’s ordered firing of all remaining ‘Biden-era’ US attorneys Zelenskyy also pressed Trump and U.S. officials to 'be more truthful.' The request follows a high-stakes meeting in Saudi Arabia between Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian officials, who kicked off discussions about how to end the nearly three-year war and renew ties between the two countries. Ukraine was notably not invited to the negotiation table — a move Zelenskyy has denounced. He's urged European officials to muscle their way into the discussions and argued that no peace agreement should be accomplished without his country in the mix. Trump on Tuesday repeated his previous claims that he could end the Eastern European conflict and seemed to blame Ukraine’s leadership for the war, claiming that Zelenskyy 'should have never started it.' 'But today I heard, ‘Oh, well we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,' Trump said from his Florida resort. 'You should’ve ended it in three years. You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,' he continued. 'I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land, and no people would have been killed, and no city would have been demolished and not one dome would have been knocked down. But they chose not to do it that way.' ‘Zizian’ cult suspect’s friend says group was preparing for violence Zelenskyy's reply came ahead of his meeting with Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Gen. Keith Kellogg, who arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday. The Ukrainian leader said he was 'ready to go to the front line' with Kellogg so that he could 'see for himself' what was unfolding on the ground. Russia started the full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, after repeatedly warning Kyiv could not join the NATO alliance and stationing troops near Ukraine’s borders. The invasion came eight years after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/trump-zelenskyy-russian-disinformation-space/	2025-02-19T05:48:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25050391177279-e1739967405836.jpg?w=900
Trump to attend Saudi-backed conference in Miami	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is scheduled to attend a meeting in Miami on Wednesday with global financiers and tech executives hosted by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. The conference will focus on U.S. investments and business, according to a White House official. Trump is expected to deliver an in-person address at the event following his call in January for Riyadh to invest $1 trillion in the United States. The meeting also comes after Saudi Arabia slammed Trump's plan to relocate Palestinians from Gaza as part of a U.S.-led rebuilding plan. Trump blasts Zelenskyy after Russia talks On Tuesday, Trump also appeared to blame Ukraine's leaders for starting the three-year war with Russia, arguing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'should have never started it.' Trump says Zelenskyy ‘should have never started’ war with Russia 'You could have made a deal,' Trump said to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate. 'I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land, and no people would have been killed, and no city would have been demolished, and not one dome would have been knocked down. But they chose not to do it that way.' Despite his criticism, he expressed a personal liking for Zelenskyy and emphasized his focus on achieving results. Zelenksyy protests Russian attacks Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other senior officials met Tuesday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Saudi Arabia and agreed to stay in close communication to work to end the war. Zelenskyy has accused Russia of continued attacks, particularly on the city of Odesa, and of launching 150 suicide drones overnight. Zelenskyy delayed his planned trip to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday in protest and criticized Trump for living in a 'disinformation space,' as new intelligence suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin remains determined to control all of Ukraine and has no interest in peace talks. PGA seeks Trump's help with LIV Golf merger Golf legend Tiger Woods said merger talks between the U.S.-based PGA Tour and Saudi-backed rival LIV Golf are in a 'very positive place.' Are millions of dead people receiving Social Security benefits? Woods said PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan and player director Adam Scott had a productive meeting with Trump this month, seeking his involvement in talks with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. PGA and Saudi officials said they hope Trump can help ease antitrust concerns about the merger and expect regulators to be more receptive under Trump than under the Biden administration.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-saudi-conference-miami/	2025-02-19T05:06:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2199787693.jpg?w=900
Trump says Zelensky 'should have never started' war with Russia	President Trump on Tuesday appeared to blame Ukraine's leaders for the three-year war with Russia, arguing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 'should have never started it.' Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after massing troops on the border and demanding a ban on Ukraine ever joining the NATO alliance. The invasion took place nearly a decade after Russia took over Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Trump vowed to end the war during his presidential campaign and on Tuesday repeated his claim that the war would never have started if he had been president. He spoke after U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia without Ukraine officials. 'I think I have the power to end this war. And I think it’s going very well,' Trump told reporters at Mar-a-Lago on the heels of the meeting between U.S. and Russian officials. 'But today I heard, ‘Oh, well we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,' Trump continued. 'You should’ve ended it in three years. You should have never started it. You could have made a deal. I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land, and no people would have been killed, and no city would have been demolished and not one dome would have been knocked down. But they chose not to do it that way.' Trump went on to rail against former President Biden as 'so pathetic' before again criticizing Zelensky. 'Look, you have leadership — and I like him personally. He’s fine. But I don’t care about personally. I care about getting the job done. You have leadership now that’s allowed a war to go on that should have never even happened, even without the United States.' Trump’s comments came after three of his senior administration officials met with their Russian counterparts earlier Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to discuss mending relations between the two powers and ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting marked a dramatic shift in U.S.-Russia relations. Zelensky expressed frustration that Ukrainian representatives were not part of the talks. 'Decisions on how to end the war in Ukraine cannot be made without Ukraine, nor can any conditions be imposed,' Zelensky said during a visit to Turkey on Tuesday. 'We were not invited to this Russian-American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us, I think for many others as well.' Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters in Saudi Arabia that any final agreement would have to be acceptable to Ukraine and Europe, as well as Russia. Trump has over the past week moved forward with his desire to bring an end to the war in Ukraine, which began three years ago when Russia launched an unprovoked invasion of its neighbor. Trump last week spoke first with Russian President Vladimir Putin about starting peace negotiations, then with Zelensky. Trump has talked bout holding a face-to-face meeting with Putin in the near future. While Trump has stressed he wants an end to the killing, he and some administration officials have made comments in the past week that have alarmed allies and some lawmakers. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called it 'unrealistic' for Ukraine to return to its pre-2014 borders as part of a ceasefire agreement with Russia or to gain NATO membership. Trump called it an 'interesting question' when asked if he viewed Ukraine as an equal member of the peace negotiations without answering directly. 'I think they have to make peace,' Trump said last week. 'Their people are being killed, and I think they have to make peace. I said that was not a good war to go into, and I think they have to make peace. That’s what I think.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-says-zelensky-should-have-never-started-war-with-russia/	2025-02-19T03:02:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Trump_MAL_Presser_022025.jpg?w=900
Zizian' cult suspect's friend says group was preparing for viole...	(NewsNation) — Just one day after alleged 'Zizian' leader Jack LaSota was arrested, investigators say radical veganism, artificial intelligence and transgender identity connected members to the so-called 'death cult.' Authorities say the group is connected to the shooting death of Border Patrol agent David Maland and five others. The alleged crimes occurred in Vermont, Pennsylvania and California over the last three years. NewsNation reviewed court records in the recent arrest of the cult leader that tells the story of how the group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists met online and shared anarchist beliefs. Alleged Zizian ‘death cult’ leader arrested: Police Their violent rampage started in 2022 when police say 82-year-old Curtis Lind was stabbed with a sword by three members of the Zizian cult, local news media site Open Vallejo reported. Lind lost an eye in the attack and was later allegedly killed by the cult members who were squatting on his Solano County, Calif., property. 'Zizian' victim's friend says members killed to avoid rent NewsNation senior national correspondent Brian Entin spoke with one of Lind's closest friends anonymously about the tragedy. 'Basically, what led to it was the idea, I think, that these transgender, homicidal, computer scientist vegans thought that they could get away with not paying him any rent,' Lind's friend told NewsNation in a phone call. The friend said he took multiple computers from box trucks on the property containing what he believes to be instruments for surgery owned by the members, including scalpels. Border agent’s slaying could be tied to ‘death cult’: Police 'Zizian' members prepared for 'violence of some form': Acquaintance After Maland's death, investigators found pistols, ammunition, night vision goggles, face respirators, a ballistic helmet, shooting range targets and radios in the suspect's car. Jessica Taylor, who knew a member of the Zizian group, tells NewsNation her friend dropped off the radar before joining the cult. 'It seems like, based on what was in the car, they might have been preparing for some sort of operation or violence of some form,' Taylor said. 'In terms of having bullets and walkie-talkies and wanting not to be observed.' What is the 'Zizian' group? The group is reportedly comprised of students who studied artificial intelligence and computer science. The Zizians are named for LaSota, a computer engineer, who goes by the nickname 'Ziz.' Federal investigators are looking into whether Maland's killing is part of a series of deaths linked to the Zizians. Who is ‘Zizian’ member Jack LaSota? The Associated Press reported that LaSota uses she/her pronouns and says in her writings that she is a transgender woman. LaSota reportedly railed against perceived enemies in writings, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Police believe that LaSota faked her death in 2022 and is now wanted in two states, according to the media site Open Vallejo. The site reported LaSota was detained by police after a stabbing death in Northern California. LaSota’s attorney, Daniel McGarrigle, declined to comment when asked whether LaSota is connected to any of the deaths. Before LaSota’s weekend arrest, LaSota missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants were issued. LaSota was ordered held without bail after appearing in court Tuesday.

Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud?	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk said he might have uncovered 'the biggest fraud in history' when he found millions of people over age 100 listed in a Social Security database, but that's not what's going on. On Sunday, Musk posted a chart on X allegedly showing more than 20 million people over 100 years old listed in 'the Social Security database.' 'These are the numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to FALSE!,' Musk said, joking that 'a lot of vampires' are collecting Social Security. He added, 'There are FAR more 'eligible' social security numbers than there are citizens,' and said it might be 'the biggest fraud in history.' Elon Musk’s DOGE could break Social Security: Martin O’Malley While it's true that there are only 90,000 people over 100 living in the U.S., that doesn't mean millions of dead beneficiaries are receiving Social Security checks. Records with incomplete death info are a well-known, long-standing challenge for the Social Security Administration, but a 2023 agency inspector general report found 'almost none' of the 18.9 million people listed as 100 or older were receiving benefits. 'What Musk has tweeted is not primarily an example of fraud but more like the messy databases kept by Social Security,' said Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Nowrasteh said when someone turns 100, the government manually checks to make sure they are still alive and not receiving extra benefits. He pointed out that Social Security fraud is a 'very small issue' compared to the program's other challenges. Martin O'Malley, the former Social Security commissioner under Joe Biden, laughed when asked about Musk's fraud claims Monday. 'He doesn't know what he's talking about,' O'Malley told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo. Here's what's going on with Social Security's death data and why it's not necessarily an example of rampant fraud. Are millions of dead people still receiving Social Security benefits? A Social Security list known as the 'Numident' — which is what Musk is believed to be referring to — shows far more centenarians than are actually alive, but that doesn't mean they're being sent checks. The inspector general's 2023 audit found that Social Security's Numident included approximately 18.9 million people listed as 100 or older but not dead — far more than the 86,000 centenarians living in the U.S. at the time of the review. However, 'almost none' of the 18.9 million were receiving Social Security payments, the report concluded. Instead, only 44,000 people over 100 were getting benefits — closer to the actual centenarian population. 'This hardly feels like big potatoes,' economist Justin Wolfers wrote in response to Musk's findings on X. The inaccurate death information likely stems from the fact that individuals died decades before the use of electronic death reporting, according to the inspector general report. Incomplete or inaccurate info can cause discrepancies across the various databases Social Security relies on, but it doesn't mean there's rampant fraud. With that said, leaving the problem unsolved could allow 'for a wider range of potential abuse,' the 2023 audit noted. Correcting the errors would come at a cost, anywhere from $5.5 to $9.7 million, according to the Social Security Administration. President Trump speaks as he is joined by Elon Musk, and his son X Æ A-Xii, in the Oval Office at the White House on Feb. 11, 2025, in Washington. Does Social Security mistakenly pay people after they die? While the scale of the overpayment problem is almost certainly smaller than Musk has implied, improperly paying dead beneficiaries does happen. An inspector general report from Nov. 2021 found that Social Security issued approximately $298 million in payments after death to about 24,000 beneficiaries. The agency recovered about $84 million of that, meaning it had not recovered about $214 million of the payments. That doesn't mean fraud is the reason those payments went out. Instead, the report found that it was mostly because Social Security technicians did not follow policy. Social Security head resigns following DOGE data request: Reports A separate 2015 audit of Social Security found just 3 confirmed instances of employment fraud in a sample of 6.5 million deceased individuals. O'Malley said the main fraud concern is when people call in and try to switch accounts, hijacking benefits from the living, not the dead. 'That's where most of the fraud comes from,' O'Malley told Cuomo. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury announced in January that it had recouped more than $31 million in federal payments that improperly went to dead people. That result came as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration's 'Full Master Death File.' 'These results are just the tip of the iceberg,' the Treasury’s Fiscal Assistant Secretary David Lebryk said in a news release. 'Congress granting permanent access to the Full Death Master File will significantly reduce fraud, improve program integrity, and better safeguard taxpayer dollars.' The Treasury said it expects to recover over $215 million during the three-year access period, which runs from Dec. 2023 through 2026. How big of a problem are overpayments? The Social Security Administration issues over $1 trillion in benefit payments annually, which means even slight errors can cost taxpayers billions. A July 2024 report from the agency's inspector general called improper payments a 'long-standing challenge' and said more needs to be done to fix the problem. The audit found that the Social Security Administration sent about $71.8 billion in improper payments between fiscal years 2015 and 2022 — most of which were overpayments. Still, the nearly $72 billion total represents 0.84% of the roughly $8.6 trillion paid out over the period. Here's why Donald Trump's Social Security promise could be hard to keep While that is a lot of money, Social Security's improper payment rate is considered relatively low compared to other large-scale programs. 'If you had to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, Social Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,' said Charles Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University who specializes in Social Security. By comparison, the Medicaid improper payment rate was over 5% in fiscal year 2024, according to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. CMS noted that improper payments are typically related to administrative mistakes and don't necessarily indicate fraud or abuse. What's the major problem with Social Security? Social Security is facing a financial shortfall, and federal lawmakers are running out of time to fix it. Without reform, the program's trust fund could be depleted in roughly a decade. At that point, retirees could see their monthly benefits slashed by roughly 20% percent. Cracking down on Social Security mistakes is a good thing, but it won't necessarily solve the larger financial issue, Blahous pointed out. 'Social Security’s financial problems aren’t being caused by the improper payments but by legal ones exceeding what workers’ tax contributions can fund,' Blahous said. Nowrasteh agreed. 'We definitely cannot lose sight of the fact that Social Security is facing very serious fiscal problems, and reductions in fraud are not going to make a meaningful difference,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-social-security-fraud/	2025-02-18T15:52:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67af2047d18f94.20394458.jpeg?w=900
Trump signals 25 percent tariffs coming on cars, semiconductors a...	President Trump on Tuesday indicated he would unveil tariffs on imports of automobiles, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals in early April, starting at 25 percent. Trump told reporters at Mar-a-Lago that he would likely announce the tariffs on April 2, and he indicated the duty on auto imports would be 'in the neighborhood of 25 percent.' Asked about tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, Trump said it would be '25 percent and higher, and it’ll go very substantially higher over the course of a year.' 'But we want to give them time to come in,' Trump added. 'Because as you know when they come into the United States and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff. So we want to give them a little bit of a chance.' Trump has been ramping up his use of tariffs since taking office, despite warnings from many economists that imposing tariffs on imports could lead to higher prices for American consumers. The president signed off on 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports earlier this month, but ultimately delayed them for a month after those two countries took actions to address the flow of drugs at the border. Trump has also imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, along with tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Last week, Trump signed a memorandum proposing reciprocal tariffs on other countries to match tariffs and duties they place on American goods. Those tariffs will go into effect in the coming weeks, giving other nations a chance to negotiate a deal with the Trump administration.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-signals-25-percent-tariffs-coming-on-cars-semiconductors-and-pharmaceuticals/	2025-02-18T15:07:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Trump_MAL_Presser.jpg?w=900
Chutkan refuses to block Musk, DOGE from 7 federal agencies	U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan on Tuesday refused the request of 14 Democratic state attorneys general to immediately impose wide-ranging restrictions on Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The coalition of states, led by New Mexico, claims Musk’s far-reaching role heading DOGE is unconstitutional since he was not confirmed by the Senate, and the states sought to block DOGE from accessing seven federal agencies. Chutkan refused their demand to do so at the current stage of the case, saying they had not made the necessary showing of irreparable harm. 'Plaintiffs legitimately call into question what appears to be the unchecked authority of an unelected individual and an entity that was not created by Congress and over which it has no oversight,' Chutkan wrote in her ruling. 'In these circumstances, it must be indisputable that this court acts within the bounds of its authority,' she continued. 'Accordingly, it cannot issue a TRO [temporary restraining order], especially one as wide-ranging as Plaintiffs request, without clear evidence of imminent, irreparable harm to these Plaintiffs. The current record does not meet that standard.' However, in a footnote, the judge suggested that the Justice Department may have stretched the truth in court filings regarding the breadth of DOGE’s power over personnel issues. 'Defense counsel is reminded of their duty to make truthful representations to the court,' Chutkan wrote. Musk’s DOGE has moved rapidly since Trump’s inauguration to install employees at federal agencies with an aim of cutting trillions of dollars in government spending, quickly drawing legal challenges. It has put Chutkan, an appointee of former President Obama, at the center of another battle implicating President Trump. The judge previously oversaw the now-dismissed Jan. 6 criminal case against the president. The Democratic-led states have sought to block Musk and DOGE personnel from accessing confidential data at the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation and the Department of Commerce. Chutkan issued Tuesday’s order after pressing the plaintiffs about the broad scope of their request at two hearings, including one held on Monday despite the federal holiday. 'I don’t mean to be dismissive, but it's sort of like a prophylactic TRO, and that's not allowed,' Chutkan said during Monday’s hearing. The Democratic-led states raised alarm about the barrage of reports of Musk’s work to dismantle parts of the federal bureaucracy, calling it a 'one-of-a-kind situation' that demanded immediate relief. 'They're stepping well beyond the authority and the four corners of the executive order, to the extent that it said they're charged with rooting out waste and fraud,' said Anjana Samant, a lawyer representing New Mexico. Harry Graver, a lawyer for the Justice Department, said there are 'very clear paper trails' for all the actions taken by DOGE and there’s 'not a single instance' of Musk commanding the actions in his own name. 'Nowhere have my friends offered a shroud to show that Elon Musk has any formal or actual authority to make any government decision,' Graver said. 'I think you stretch too far,' Chutkan interjected. 'I disagree with you there.' After the hearing, the Justice Department submitted a sworn declaration indicating that Musk is not a DOGE employee and is instead a senior adviser to the president at the White House. The judge also questioned the government over thousands of federal employees apparently fired across several agencies on Friday, which a DOJ lawyer said he had not confirmed. The case before Chutkan is one of more than a dozen pending lawsuits that challenge DOGE’s structure or its access to systems at various federal departments. A separate judge late Monday declined to block DOGE from accessing student borrower data at the Education Department. On Friday night, a judge refused a group of unions' request to block DOGE from accessing two federal departments and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which the administration has looked to gut.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/chutkan-refuses-to-block-musk-doge-from-7-federal-agencies/	2025-02-18T14:10:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/muskelon_021325upi01_w_426006.jpg?w=900
Courts to rule over DOGE accessing Americans' personal informatio...	(NewsNation) — Several key court rulings on whether the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency can access the personal information of tens of millions of Americans could come to pass as early as Tuesday evening. Democratic attorneys general from 14 states are seeking a temporary restraining order to stop Elon Musk and his DOGE team from accessing sensitive data and firing employees at half a dozen federal agencies. DOGE is also seeking access to IRS systems that contain the private financial data of just about every American who's ever paid taxes or received a refund. That data includes banking details, Social Security numbers and employment information. Because DOGE is so new and so different in its operation, a lot of the questions about what it is and is not legally allowed to do are going to be decided in the courts. Social Security head resigns following DOGE data request: Reports The legal complaints are attempting to stop or limit the mass firing of workers in federal agencies and to limit DOGE's access to American taxpayers' data from the IRS and Treasury databases. Musk has defended DOGE's authority and says DOGE must access the data to continue its mission. District court judge for the District of Columbia, Tanya Chutkan, is expected to make a ruling Tuesday. DOGE posted on its website that it has saved $55 billion in waste or fraud. Some of what is listed is still being held up in court. It lists some half a billion dollars of savings within the Department of Education that are proposed cuts that have not been carried out. It lists another $144 million related to real estate leases it says will eventually be brought back.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/courts-doge-americans-personal-information/	2025-02-18T11:50:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67aab3f76f1bf4.15685446.jpeg?w=900
Border Patrol agents told to resume using body cameras	(NewsNation) — An order Border Patrol agents were sent telling them to stop using body cameras has now been lifted. Border Patrol sources tell NewsNation agents are now being directed to resume normal operations. Last week, Customs and Border Protection sent out a memo saying there was a 'potential security risk' associated with the cameras being used and that they should not use them 'pending completion of investigation and risk mitigation.' Which federal agencies are firing new hires? Sources said some social media posts had been circulating showing how the cameras can be tracked from 100 yards away. Bomb squad sources told NewsNation there is also concern that the radio frequencies transmitted by the cameras could be used to set off an improvised explosive device, depending on what type of switch the bomb builder uses. NewsNation has reached out to CBP for comment on the outcome of their investigation into the cameras and how they're mitigating potential risks. CBP was initially one of the first federal agencies to wear body cameras following an order from former President Joe Biden. It has publicly released many of its recordings over the past four years.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/border-patrol-agents-resume-body-cameras/	2025-02-18T11:01:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/CBP_050219_AP_Eric-Gay.jpeg?w=900
Social Security head resigns following DOGE data request: Reports	(NewsNation) — The acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration has stepped down from her role after the Department of Government Efficiency requested access to private information, according to reports. Acting Commissioner Michelle King left the agency after more than 30 years, allegedly refusing to give DOGE staffers sensitive information, according to the Associated Press. Former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley told NewsNation, 'I think she should hold her head high... I think she's a patriot if the reports I'm hearing are true.' But why does DOGE want access to Social Security information? And what would they do with that access? What is DOGE? The Department of Government Efficiency was created by President Donald Trump through an executive order. Previously, the organization was called the Office of Digital Services. Trump also moved DOGE to be under the Executive Office of the President from the Office of Management and Budget. Does DOGE have your personal information? DOGE has made many changes to some agencies, like USAID, which is responsible for offering humanitarian aid overseas. There have been leadership shakeups for DOGE and lawsuits they have had to face. After accessing USAID's systems, DOGE put most of the staff on administrative leave, recalled those who were overseas and prevented staff from accessing the USAID office in Washington, D.C. A person protesting Elon Musk's actions in the Trump administration holds a sign outside a Tesla showroom in Seattle on Thursday, Feb. 13, 2025. (AP Photo/Manuel Valdes) DOGE is not an agency or a Cabinet-level position, but it has been treated nearly the same. Because of this, Elon Musk, head of DOGE, has not had to go through a Senate confirmation hearing, which would typically be required for someone at that level of power. Musk claimed in an Oval Office press conference in February that a 'cursory examination of Social Security, and we got people in there that are 150 years old. Now, do you know anyone that's 150? I don't know. They should be in the Guinness Book of World Records... So, that's a case where I think they're probably dead.' O'Malley told NewsNation that isn't the case, and there are bigger problems with the Social Security Administration. 'He doesn't know what he's talking about... you know what the biggest problem is of Social Security? They're serving more people than ever, every single day, with staffing that House Republicans have reduced to a 50-year low.' What would DOGE do with Social Security information? It is not known what DOGE wants to do with any Social Security information it is given access to. At the beginning of February, Trump said that DOGE would not 'touch' Social Security. How will DOGE impact Social Security? Panelists debate program’s future 'Social Security will not be touched, it will only be strengthened,' Trump said during a news conference when asked if there are any limits placed on what Musk can examine. DOGE employees do have access to the Social Security numbers of many Americans, along with sensitive tax information and banking accounts for direct deposit. Demonstrators rally in support of federal workers outside of the Department of Health and Human Services, Friday, Feb. 14, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) Trump and Musk have continuously stated that DOGE is only conducting a financial audit. However, audits do not typically require direct access to the Treasury Department's payment system. The Trump administration has said that Musk has read-only access to the system, but some critics have raised the alarm about what Musk could do. Could DOGE, Trump administration close the IRS? Democratic Rep. Jake Auchincloss from Massachusetts told NewsNation, 'I think Americans are wondering right now why the heck Elon Musk has access to their Social Security numbers, why he knows who's paying child support, why he sees people's tax refunds. I think they're wondering why this unelected billionaire knows information about them that he has no business knowing.' With access to the payment system, DOGE could cut off any payments it or Trump decides should be cut. This could include: Cutting funding for school lunch programs Deciding who should or should not receive Social Security payments Who will be the new head of the Social Security Administration? According to Harrison Fields, the special assistant to the president, Trump has nominated Frank Bisignano to lead the Social Security Administration. The administration is expecting Bisignano to 'be swiftly confirmed in the coming weeks.' Until then, Social Security will be led by 'a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner,' according to Fields' X post. 74 lawsuits filed against Trump to stop his executive actions 'President Trump is committed to appointing the best and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them for far too long,' Fields said. Bisignano is currently the president and CEO of Fiserv, a global financial technology company. What is on the horizon for Social Security? Trump said that he wants to 'weed out' undocumented individuals whom he claimed were using the Social Security program. 'We have illegal immigrants on Social Security and we’re going to find out who they are and take them off… we’re not going to stand for that.' Who will never receive Social Security? However, O'Malley said that illegal immigrants pay about $22 billion per year into Social Security and never get to use the benefits of the program. Trump also said he won't 'cut one cent' from the program or raise the retirement age. But some think that this could be what breaks the Social Security program. 'This program that so many people depend on as a lifeline could very well be broken by these nitwit 19-year-olds and the co-presidents,' O'Malley told NewsNation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-social-security-head-data-steps-down/	2025-02-18T09:54:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP24354582238749-e1736086679342.jpg?w=800
Judge refuses to block DOGE’s access to student borrower data	(The Hill) - A federal judge Monday evening declined to block Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from gaining access to Education Department data on student borrowers. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the University of California Student Association (USCA), which brought the lawsuit, had not shown sufficient irreparable harm to receive such immediate relief. 'Because the Court concludes that UCSA has failed to clear that essential hurdle, the Court’s analysis also ends there,' wrote Moss, who was appointed by former President Obama. DOGE creates X accounts to crowdsource info on government ‘waste’ 'The Court leaves for another day consideration of whether USCA’s has standing to sue and has stated a claim upon which relief may be granted. Those questions are less clear cut and are better answered on a more complete record,' Moss continued. Musk’s DOGE has moved rapidly since President Trump’s inauguration to install employees at federal agencies with an aim of cutting trillions of dollars in government spending, quickly drawing legal challenges. The student government raised alarm that Musk’s team would be able to access students’ personal data, including tax information, submitted to the Education Department as part of federal financial aid applications. The lawsuit claims the access violated federal privacy laws. 'ED and DOGE staffers are obligated to use UCSA members’ information for lawful purposes within the mission of the Department of Education and to keep it confidential, in accordance with the Privacy Act, tax laws, and other federal law,' Moss noted in his ruling. The Hill has reached out to Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer advocacy group that represents the plaintiffs, for comment. Moss’s decision comes days after another judge declined to immediately block DOGE from accessing systems at the Labor Department, Department of Health and Human Services and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But under yet another judge’s ruling, DOGE personnel are blocked from accessing critical Treasury Department payment systems that are used to dole out trillions of dollars per year. Congress closing in on shutdown deadline with no clear plan A judge is also set to rule soon on whether to block DOGE from accessing systems at seven federal agencies. In that case, Joshua Fisher, the director of the White House administration office, submitted a sworn declaration earlier Monday that Musk is a senior adviser to the president. 'He is not an employee of the U.S. DOGE Service or U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization. Mr. Musk is not the U.S. DOGE Service Administrator,' Fisher wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-student-borrower-data/	2025-02-18T08:28:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/department_of_education_021725gn02_w-e1739876500197.jpg?w=900
Alleged 'death cult' leader arrested: Police	(NewsNation) — The person believed to be the leader of a cultlike group called the 'Zizians' has been arrested and faces multiple criminal charges along with another member of the group, police have announced. Jack LaSota, 34, was arrested Sunday along with Michelle Zajko, 33, of Pennsylvania, the Maryland State Police announced Monday. The pair face charges of trespassing, obstructing and hindering along with possession of a handgun. LaSota is said to be the leader of the Zizians, who authorities say are connected to the shooting death of David Maland, a Border Patrol agent who was killed in a shootout near the Canadian border in January. The Zizians have also been connected to five other homicides in California, Vermont and Pennsylvania. Immigrants could be in US a decade before their case is resolved, lawyers say Tracy Walder, a NewsNation national security contributor, told NewsNation the group is not necessarily a cult but rather a domestic terrorism group. Walder, a former CIA agent, said the group shares political ideology that springs from rationalism but radicalized that and became anarchists. Federal investigators are looking into whether Maland's killing is part of a series of deaths linked to the Zizians, a fringe online community. In addition to Maland’s death in Vermont, police are investigating whether the cult is behind a California landlord being stabbed with a Samurai sword and other crimes. Authorities described the Zizians as a 'death cult.' The group is reportedly made up of students who studied artificial intelligence and computer science. The Zizians are named for LaSota, a computer engineer, who goes by the nickname 'Ziz.' Teresa Youngblut, 21, was charged in Maland’s death on Jan. 20 in Coventry, Vermont, which is about 20 miles from the Canadian border. Police said the gun used in Maland’s death has been linked to a 2022 double homicide in Pennsylvania. 36 migrants found in tractor-trailer at remote Border Patrol checkpoint The Associated Press reported that LaSota uses she/her pronouns and says in her writings that she is a transgender woman. LaSota reportedly railed against perceived enemies in writings, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Police believe that LaSota faked their death in 2022 and is now wanted in two states, according to the media site Open Vallejo. The site reported LaSota was detained by police after a stabbing death in Northern California. LaSota’s attorney, Daniel McGarrigle, declined to comment when asked whether she is connected to any of the deaths. Before her weekend arrest, she missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants were issued. LaSota was ordered held without bail after appearing in court on Tuesday.

Education Department warns schools to cut DEI or lose funding	(NewsNation) — Schools from kindergarten to college across the U.S. are beginning to adjust their programming websites in response to President Donald Trump's policies against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Trump signed executive orders banning diversity practices across the federal government and educational institutions, with many private companies also reversing their DEI-related programs. Schools scramble to meet DEI change orders Following a Friday night letter from the Department of Education, schools and colleges are now under pressure to eliminate DEI programs or risk losing federal funding. The department's civil rights division stated it would no longer tolerate the 'overt and covert racial discrimination that has become widespread in this nation's institutions.' 74 lawsuits filed against Trump to stop his executive actions The letter cited white and Asian students as victims of discrimination, though some leaders in higher education have argued this is not the intent of DEI programs. 'This is a serious misunderstanding of DEI. Many people presume it to be about giving unearned, unfair advantages to particular groups. For the record, white women have been the single largest beneficiary of the nation's longest-standing DEI policy, and that was affirmative action,' said Shaun Harper, a University of Southern California professor. State-level DEI legislation Twelve states have already passed laws to end DEI efforts, while another 12 are considering similar measures. Other states without laws on the books are working to comply with the new policy. The University of St. Thomas in Minnesota lost a $6.8 million federal grant after the Trump administration deemed it was DEI-related. Rob Vischer, a professor at the university, said the grant, which provided scholarships for graduate students pursuing a teaching license, was predominantly awarded to white students. 'It was not a DEI initiative in terms of anyone getting a preference. The components that were going to further diversity were really making sure that our students were prepared to be effective teachers no matter what cultural background their students came from,' he said. Judge firings 'insane' as immigration backlog grows Vischer said the university is exploring options to reinstate the funding, as many believe the policy change undermines educational priorities due to a teacher shortage. Impact on funding While universities rely partly on student tuition, they also receive billions from the Education Department for scholarships, research and loans. In K-12 education, public schools rely on state and local tax funding, with the federal government providing about 11%. Title 1 schools, which serve low-income families, stand to lose the most if DEI initiatives are discontinued. After Trump's executive order, higher education groups filed a lawsuit arguing the directive violates the Constitution, suggesting the push to eliminate DEI efforts will likely face further legal challenges.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/education-department-schools-cut-dei-lose-funding/	2025-02-18T07:57:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b4168c10dac6.83474389.jpeg?w=900
Ukraine not included in peace talks as Rubio meets with Russian o...	(NewsNation) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss an end to the war in Ukraine and normalizing relations with the United States. After the meeting, Rubio said Russia and the United States agreed to appoint 'high-level' teams dedicated to stopping the conflict, and that they will lay the groundwork for future cooperation. 'Today is the first step of a long and difficult journey, but an important one,' Rubio said at a press gaggle. '(United States President Donald Trump) wants (the war) to end in a way that's fair, he wants it to end in a way that's sustainable and enduring, not that leads to another conflict in another three years.' US presented Ukraine with a document to access its minerals but offered almost nothing in return Ukrainian officials did not participate in the discussion in Riyadh, which included Rubio, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the country will not recognize any agreements made without its input. 'We cannot acknowledge anything, any arrangements about us that were made without us,' Zelenskyy said. Rubio acknowledged that 'in order for a conflict to end, everyone involved in that conflict has to be OK with it.' He added, though, that it's been 'three and half years since any sort of regularized contact between Russia and the United States — and in some cases between any of the participants in this conflict and Russia.' Which federal agencies are firing new hires? While Putin had previously refused to negotiate with Zelenskyy, the Russian president's press secretary says he is now willing to. Trump insists Putin wants peace — but hours before officials from Washington and Moscow met, Russia launched a drone attack on Ukraine. Zelenskyy said Trump's Ukraine envoy is set to visit the country next week and that he wants to take him to the front lines.

Upside down and burning': All passengers escape Delta plane cras...	(NewsNation) — All 80 passengers and crew members on board a Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis to Toronto that crashed and overturned while landing are expected to survive. Air traffic control audio was released Monday, capturing the moment officials realized Delta Flight 4819, operated by Endeavor Air, was burning on the tarmac of Toronto's Pearson Airport. 'This airplane just crashed. We just have a crash on Runway 23 here,' someone can be heard saying at around 2:15 p.m. ET. Now is an ‘opportune’ time to fix FAA: Former official Billy Nolen 'Just so you are aware, there's people outside walking around the aircraft there,' someone says moments later. 'Yeah, we've got it,' someone responds. 'The aircraft there's upside down and burning.' The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is assisting Canada’s Transportation Safety Board to investigate how the CRJ-900 overturned as it arrived from Minneapolis and touched down in Toronto. Two runways will remain closed for the investigation. It is possible the plane bounced, causing pilots to lose control, said Greg Feith, former senior air safety investigator for the NTSB. 'I'm upside down still strapped in': Delta passenger Peter Carlson, a passenger traveling to Toronto for a paramedics conference, said the landing was 'very forceful.' 'All the sudden everything just kind of went sideways, and then next thing I know it’s kind of a blink and I’m upside down still strapped in,' he told CBC News. 'Everyone on that plane suddenly became very close in terms of how to help one another, how to console one another.' SpaceX employees visiting FAA amid reported firings Carlson said when he took off his seat belt, he crashed onto the ceiling of the plane. He smelled gas and saw aviation fuel cascading down the cabin windows and knew he needed to get out, but he said his fatherly intuition and paramedic skills kicked in. He looked for those he could help. Carlson and another man assisted a mother and her young son out of the plane, and then Carlson dropped onto the tarmac. Snow was blowing, and it 'felt like I was stepping onto tundra.' 'I didn’t care how cold it was, didn’t care how far I had to walk, how long I had to stand — all of us just wanted to be out of the aircraft,' he said. How many people were injured in the crash? The airport said all passengers and crew members were accounted for. Eighteen people were injured in the crash, and three are in critical condition, according to Deborah Flint, Greater Toronto Airports Authority president and CEO. Two people were taken by separate air ambulances to a trauma center in Toronto: a man in his 60s and a woman in her 40s. A pediatric patient was taken to a children’s hospital. Other injured passengers were transported to local area hospitals. Delta plane flipping not a pattern of plane crashes: Travel expert There were no fatalities. The fact that all 80 people aboard the plane survived is amazing, retired commercial pilots Michael Coffield and Richard Levy agreed. Both nodded their heads vigorously and said, 'Miracle.' What was the weather at the time of the crash? At the time of the crash, weather reports showed Toronto experienced 31-mph winds with gusts upward of 40 mph and a temperature of 18 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind chill of -5. On Monday, the airport said on social media it expected around 1,000 flights to be delayed as airlines worked to catch up from delays caused by snow over the weekend. Toronto Pearson Fire Chief Todd Aitken confirmed the runway was dry and there were no crosswind conditions.

Gabby Petito's van was destroyed by her parents	(NewsNation) — The parents of Gabby Petito say they destroyed their daughter’s white van to prevent someone from turning it into a ghoulish trophy, but they have retained at least a couple of mementos. Gabby’s Ford Transit Connect was a regular feature in the travel reports she posted online before she disappeared in 2021. Authorities believe she was murdered by her travel companion, Brian Laundrie, in Wyoming before he took his own life in Florida. Gabby’s family felt uneasy about the vehicle, which they did not wish to keep. Gabby Petito Netflix documentary premieres in February 'We crushed the van,' Gabby’s father, Joe, told NewsNation senior national correspondent Brian Entin. 'We didn’t want the van to be out there and someone owning the van and then saying, ‘Here’s the van that Gabby was …’ So, we had it crushed.' Joe Petito, left, and his wife, Tara Petito, talk with NewsNation senior national correspondent Brian Entin. Joe and Gabby’s stepmother, Tara Petito, kept some items from the vehicle, including a gasoline cap from the van’s exterior and a sticker commemorating a stop at the Great Smoky Mountains. The mementos are displayed at home in a curio case. Entin was checking in with the family as a Netflix docuseries about Gabby began streaming. The program includes new information about the case, including claims by a former boyfriend that the 22-year-old New York woman was planning to leave Laundrie shortly before her death. Entin also talked with Gabby’s mother, Nichole Schmidt, and her husband, Jim Schmidt. Gabby Petito’s father has a mission to help the missing 'I have forgiven Brian, and I know that’s what Gabby would have wanted, and I’m moving forward so that I can help people,' Nichole Schmidt said. 'I don’t think everyone has to forgive. They can when they’re ready, or they might never be ready. But for me personally, I needed to forgive to let that anger go.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/banfield/gabby-petito-was-planning-to-leave-boyfriend-docuseries/	2025-02-17T21:22:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/gab-parents-final.jpg?w=900
Toronto plane crash outcome a ‘miracle’: experts	(NewsNation) — Several things went right when a passenger jet landing at a wintry Toronto airport lost its wings and flipped over with no loss of life, according to aviation experts reviewing preliminary information. Investigators will try to sort out what happened to the Delta Airlines CRJ-900 as it arrived from Minneapolis and touched down at Toronto Pearson International Airport at 2:15 p.m. It’s possible the plane bounced and pilots lost control, said Greg Feith, former senior air safety investigator for the NTSB. 'The good thing is ... both the wings were shed,' he said. 'That usually takes up a lot of the major impact forces. And because the tube, the fuselage tube, stayed intact, that’s what enhanced the survivability for all these people, even though there was a small fire that did break out.' What we know about CRJ-900, aircraft that flipped over in Toronto The integrity of the fuselage is a testament to advances in airplane engineering, Feith added. 'We’ve learned a lot of lessons from history,' he said. Also probably helping the outcome was that jet fuel was dispersed when the wings detached, Feith said. He praised passengers and the flight crew for the orderly evacuation of the upside-down aircraft. The fact that all 80 people aboard the plane survived is amazing, retired commercial pilots Michael Coffield and Richard Levy agreed.

Nolen served as acting administrator of the FAA from April 2022 to June 2023. He joined 'The Hill on NewsNation' just hours after Delta Flight 4819, operated by Endeavor Air, crashed and flipped on the tarmac at Toronto Pearson Airport. All 76 passengers and four crew members were evacuated, with 18 reported injured as of Monday night. Live: Delta flight flips over in Toronto, injuring 18 people Nolen didn't speculate on what he believes happened, but he told NewsNation political editor Chris Stirewalt that weather could have played a role in the incident. 'You know, they'll think about what's the crosswind here? Were they beyond the limits?' Nolen said. 'And that's just information we don't have.' At the time of the crash, weather reports showed Toronto experiencing 31 mph hour winds with gusts upwards of 40 mph and a temperature of 18 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind chill of minus 5 F.

An anonymous source from the agency told The Associated Press that impacted workers include radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance workers. 'My understanding for the folks who were let go in this round [is] that these were not folks who are the critical pieces of air traffic control,' Nolen told NewsNation. He implored the administration to keep in mind the 'unintended consequences' of the firings, though he supports the overhaul of the FAA if it helps in the long run. 'I've testified, both before the House and before the Senate, that the FAA oversees systems of systems and facilities that are between 40 and 60 years old,' Nolen explained. 'So, I think it's an opportune time for Elon, for others, to come in.'

Nolen believes this spate of accidents is just that, pointing to the tens of thousands of successful, safe flights that aren't reported on every day. 'That being said, we can never rest on our record, and we certainly can never rest on our laurels when it comes to keeping the flying public safe,' Nolen added.

What we know about CRJ-900, aircraft that flipped over in Toronto	(NewsNation) — More than seven dozen people were evacuated Monday after a Delta flight from Minneapolis to Toronto crashed and flipped over while landing. Flight 4819, operated by Endeavor Air, was involved in a 'single-aircraft accident' around 3:30 p.m. ET, Toronto Pearson Airport confirmed on X. At the time of the crash, weather reports show Toronto experiencing 31 mph hour winds with gusts upwards of 40 mph and a temperature of 18 Fahrenheit with a wind chill of minus 5 F. But what do we know about the Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-900 involved? Toronto accident: CRJ-900 specs The aircraft has a length of 36 meters (roughly 119 feet) with a wingspan of 24.9 meters (81 feet). The craft has a range of 1,784 miles and a cruising speed of 515 mph, according to Delta's official website for the aircraft. Delta flight flips over in Toronto How is the aircraft laid out? The CRJ-900 can seat either 70 or 76 people, but the layout and basic dimensions of the craft are nearly identical, no matter the capacity. There were 76 passengers on board Monday. The craft has restrooms at the very front and back of the plane. In first class, one side of the aisle seats one person, and the other has two — totaling 12. The remaining passengers in Delta+ Comfort and main cabin seats are in pairs of two on either side of the aisle. The 70-seater has four exits in total, while the 76-seater has six.

Prior to Monday, the most recent CRJ-900 incident was on Nov. 27, 2024, when a Delta flight headed from Providence-Theodore Francis Greene State Airport to Detroit-Metropolitan Wayne County Airport was forced to do an emergency landing in Albany, New York. No one was killed in the incident. FAA firings begin weeks after deadly crash near DC For a full list of incidents involving the CRJ-900, click here. How old is the CRJ-900 design? The CRJ-900 launched in 2001, but its design roots can be found in the Canadair Challenger business jet, the first iteration of which took to the skies in the 1970s, according to Simple Flying. After Bombardier bought Canadair in 1987, the company decided to revamp earlier designs and create the Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ-100) in 1991. Several more iterations of the craft came about over the decades. The CRJ-900 is newer — and bigger — than the CRJ-200, CRJ-550 or CRJ-700. It's equipped with a powerful engine and strengthened wings, Who makes the CRJ-900? Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft company, manufactures the aircraft. Delta plane flipping not a pattern of plane crashes: Travel expert Delta Air Lines' regional subsidiary Endeavor Air is the largest operator of CRJ-900s, per Simple Flying. It currently has more than 120 aircraft flying as Delta Connection. Other airlines, including PSA Airlines, Jazz Air, SkyWest Airlines and Mesa Airlines, also operate the CRJ-900.

(NewsNation) — A travel journalist says the Delta Airlines plane flipping in Canada on Monday is not a pattern of plane crashes following a string of crashes and accidents involving planes in the first month and a half of 2025. Peter Greenberg told 'NewsNation Now' that this was 'an isolated incident' and 'nobody should jump to any conclusion that we have a bigger problem with air safety.' The Delta Airlines plane flipped upon arrival at Toronto’s Pearson Airport and paramedics said 15 people were injured in the crash and none of the injuries were life-threatening.

Energy secretary blasts 'sinister' zero carbon emissions goal	Energy Secretary Chris Wright denounced efforts to achieve net zero carbon emissions by midcentury as a 'sinister goal' in remarks at a conservative policy conference Monday. 'Net zero 2050 is a sinister goal, it’s a terrible goal,' Wright said to applause at the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship forum in London, where he spoke through a video link. 'It’s both unachievable by any practical means [and] the aggressive pursuit of it — and you’re sitting in a country that has aggressively pursued this goal — has not delivered any benefits, but it’s delivered tremendous costs.' Top Democrats question IRS on DOGE access to taxpayer data Wright, a former fracking executive, claimed that countries that set net zero goals simply 'export your industry.' 'This is not energy transition, this is lunacy,' he said, echoing remarks he made in 2023 that 'there is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either.' The Biden administration set a goal of net zero by 2050 in 2021, but Wright and Trump have worked to roll back much of their predecessors’ promotion of renewable energy to shift back to promotion of fossil fuel development since taking office. Carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of climate change. Trump suggests no laws violated if he ‘saves’ country Wright’s fellow Trump Cabinet secretary, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, also set a goal of net zero for his state by 2030 when he served as governor of North Dakota. Burgum, whose state is the No. 3 oil producer in the nation, vocally backed the notion that net zero was achievable without decreasing fossil fuel production through the use of largely untested carbon capture technology. Wright’s remarks came days after he granted the first approval of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project of the Trump administration, another reversal after the Biden administration froze new LNG export approvals to research its impacts on climate change and consumer energy prices.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/energy-secretary-zero-carbon-emissions/	2025-02-17T13:44:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/chris-wright-energy-dept-pick_franzin_getty.jpg?w=900
FAA firings begin weeks after deadly crash near DC	(The Hill) -- The Trump administration has begun firing hundreds of employees at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) just weeks after a deadly crash outside of Washington, D.C., put a spotlight on the agency. In a late-night email Friday, probationary workers were notified that they had been fired, David Spero, the president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said in a statement, according to The Associated Press. Delta flight flips over in Toronto One air traffic controller told the outlet that impacted workers include personnel hired for FAA radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance. The firings come just weeks after an American Airlines flight collided mid-air with a military Black Hawk helicopter shortly before landing at Reagan National Airport. More than 60 people were killed in the crash and the FAA faced tough scrutiny in the fallout, as it was the deadliest air crash in the U.S. in two decades. Coast Guard seizes 37K lbs. of cocaine worth $275M The firings also come just weeks after the Trump administration took office and promised to revamp the federal workforce. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has agreed to work with Elon Musk’s 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) and the Trump administration to scale back federal spending, but he’s also expressed the need for the FAA to fix its 'antiquated' systems and hire more air traffic controllers. The firings began arriving in employees’ inboxes around 7 p.m. Friday, and Spero said more could be notified over the weekend. Some people could even be banned from entering FAA buildings on Tuesday after the long President’s Day weekend.

74 lawsuits filed against Trump to stop his executive actions	(NewsNation) — In nearly one month since President Donald Trump's return to the White House, at least 74 lawsuits have been filed in federal courts against his administration's wave of executive actions. As of Monday, judges have temporarily paused 18 of these measures. Trump’s only victory so far was the approval of his deferred resignation buyout for government employees, a move to reduce the federal workforce. On Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge George O’Toole declined to further pause a federal government buyout program, enabling the government to forge ahead with its 'Fork in the Road' program. Additionally, a federal judge Friday denied immediate reinstatement for eight former inspectors general fired by Trump, though the case will continue on a less urgent timeline. White House seeks to rehire nuclear weapons workers fired by DOGE Of the lawsuits, 33 are Department of Government Efficiency-related and deal with government structure and personnel, with 19 focused on immigration and citizenship. Attorneys general from 14 states filed a lawsuit challenging the authority of billionaire Elon Musk and DOGE's ability to access sensitive government data and exercise 'virtually unchecked power.' Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford argues the government can become more efficient lawfully and with compassion. Trump's 1987 bestselling book parallels presidential strategy One case, Hampton Dellinger's, is already headed to the U.S. Supreme Court, with the government petitioning to vacate the district court's decision to temporarily reinstate him to lead the Office of Special Counsel. Dellinger was nominated for the role by former President Joe Biden. Trump fired him earlier this month. By signing 26 executive orders during his first day in office alone, Trump put himself on pace to rank among the fastest-acting presidents during his first 100 days in office.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/lawsuits-trump-executive-actions/	2025-02-17T11:32:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25044679717736-e1739578095359.jpg?w=800
Bird flu likely spreading undetected in humans	(NewsNation) — Bird flu may be spreading undetected in humans, according to a recently released report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Data posted last week in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report suggests the spread of bird flu between dairy cattle and humans has gone unchecked, including in states where cattle have not tested positive. This comes after the Trump Administration froze external communications from the agency, which interrupted the agency's weekly report. Ohio reports first probable human case of bird flu Researchers analyzed blood samples from 150 veterinarians who worked with dairy and nondairy cattle across the country and found that three of them had antibodies to bird flu, which suggested a recent infection. None of them reported any flu-like symptoms and did not work with any cattle that were infected, and one reported working with infected poultry. Bird flu: Human-to-human transmission? There have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission so far, but there is concern about variants developing if infections in humans spread. ‘Mad honey’ poisoning blamed in Michigan family’s 2022 disappearance Nearly 70 people have been infected with bird flu across the country, with one person in Louisiana dead.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/bird-flu-likely-spreading-undetected/	2025-02-17T08:57:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25044543772294_7e848d.jpg?w=900
White House seeks to rehire nuclear weapons workers fired by DOGE	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The White House is reportedly working to reinstate hundreds of workers tasked with overseeing the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. Last week, more than 300 staffers at the National Nuclear Security Administration were fired as part of wider layoffs at the Department of Energy. However, the cuts may have overlooked critical roles, leading to the reveal of some terminations. While the Energy Department insists there's no need for concern, lawmakers are demanding answers. Lawmakers want answers on NNSA layoffs Washington Sen. Patty Murray and Ohio Rep. Marcy Kaptur, both Democrats, are calling for an immediate briefing from new Energy Secretary Chris Wright. They warn that until they are briefed on these 'haphazard and thoughtless firings,' they 'will not know the damage to our country and the world.' Here are the agencies purging federal workers The NNSA, responsible for protecting and managing the U.S. nuclear arsenal, reportedly planned to cut 325 to 350 employees Thursday. But by Friday, managers received an email telling them to stop all actions with terminations. The Energy Department now claims less than 50 layoffs occurred, affecting staff in administrative or clerical roles in their probationary period. The department insists these job cuts will not impact the security of the weapons. FEMA staff laid off ahead of Kentucky floods Meanwhile, other federal agencies have announced mass layoffs, including 20 immigration judges the Justice Department fired over the weekend. The firings occurred despite the massive backlog of more than 3.5 million cases, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Department of Health and Human Services cut 5,200 jobs, impacting agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration. The Department of Homeland Security let go 400 workers, including FEMA staff, just days before devastating flooding hit Kentucky. The Department of Interior laid off 2,300 workers, while 1,000 positions were eliminated at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Federal job cuts hurt Americans: Rep. Raskin Democrats accuse the White House of trying to hurt Americans. 'They're getting rid of anything in the government that supports consumers, that supports citizens against the rip-off artists who are their friends,' Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin. Some of those affected include Chelsea Milburn, a Navy veteran, who became disabled and moved to the public affairs office at the Department of Education in November. She told NewsNation the U.S. claims to support veterans but that about 30% of federal workers are veterans, many of whom were laid off this week. 'I think that all of us who were impacted by this deserve to be treated better. I especially think that people who serve their country deserve better,' Milburn said. 'Considering that about 30% of the federal workforce are veterans. This has a huge impact on the veteran community.' US leaders in Saudi Arabia for Russia-Ukraine peace talks Republicans argue the country's debt is becoming a national security risk and these decisions are necessary. More job cuts are expected as the Department of Government Efficiency continues to analyze where to downsize next. 'We hate that anybody's losing their job, but at the same time, we know that the debt that we have in this country is not manageable, and it's becoming a national security risk,' said Republican Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/white-house-rehire-nuclear-weapons-workers-doge/	2025-02-17T06:51:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67abd7fbe34323.91974328.jpeg?w=900
What Trump's 1987 book 'The Art of the Deal' shows about his stra...	(NewsNation) — It is no secret that in addition to being the leader of the free world, President Donald Trump is also a businessman, TV personality and real estate mogul. But one accolade some may forget is bestselling author. There are more than a dozen books in which Trump is listed as an author or co-author, but looking back at the very first one, 'Trump: The Art of the Deal,' may give a glimpse into how his leadership style in the boardroom shaped his leadership style in the Oval Office. Thinking big and being no-nonsense are some things Trump cited as reasons for the success of his 1987 New York Times bestseller. 'Trump: The Art of the Deal' is a mix of personal anecdotes and business how-to, and in many cases, there's a parallel between what he wrote nearly 40 years ago and his presidency. Democratic governors diverge on how to handle Trump Chapter 2 starts: 'My style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward. I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I'm after.' Compare that to what he said about the conflict in the Middle East just weeks before taking office: 'If those hostages aren't back, I don't want to hurt your negotiation. If they're not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East, and it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone. All hell will break out,' Trump said at a Jan. 7 news conference. When it comes to beating competition for a business venture, Trump wrote in his book, 'Sometimes part of making a deal is denigrating your competition.' On the campaign trail in September last year, the president notoriously said of Democratic opponent Kamala Harris, 'She's a stupid person, stupid person.' Trump says 14th Amendment is for former slaves, not migrants Some are drawing a comparison between Trump's handling of the southern border, the war in Ukraine and the economy to what he wrote about making deals and his early days in business. 'In the end, we won by wearing everyone else down,' he wrote. 'We never gave up, and the opposition slowly began to melt away.' Failing to reach a deal may have given Trump insight into what to do when losing an election. 'Sometimes by losing a battle, you find a new way to win the war. What you need, generally, is enough time and a little luck,' Trump wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-book-art-of-the-deal-strategy/	2025-02-17T06:20:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b003b5d81ed3.80637785.jpeg?w=900
US leaders in Saudi Arabia for peace talks on Russia-Ukraine war	(NewsNation) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in Saudi Arabia on Monday for peace talks aimed at ending the nearly three-year-long war in Ukraine. The talks come as European nations consider stepping up to defend Ukraine. While the U.S. has stated Ukraine will be included in the discussions this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his country had not been invited to the table, raising concerns about the effectiveness of an agreement without Ukraine's direct involvement. A drone pierced the outer shell of Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear plant. Radiation levels are normal Is Ukraine involved in peace talks? Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and special envoy Steve Witkoff are set to meet with Russian officials in Riyadh on Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Monday. It is unclear whether any Ukrainian representatives will participate in the talks. Witkoff, however, insists Ukraine has been included in discussions, citing a recent meeting in Munich and a call with President Donald Trump. Zelenskyy emphasized any deal made without Ukraine's input is unacceptable. US presented Ukraine with a document to access its minerals but offered almost nothing in return 'I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. And our people, never. And our adults, children and everybody, it can't be so. The war in Ukraine is against us, and it is our human losses,' Zelsenkyy said. Trump to meet with Putin 'soon' Witkoff spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin for hours, and Trump teased a future meeting with Putin. 'Well, it'll be soon. We'll see what happens. But they're meeting right now. And that's more. I mean, this should have been done four years ago, three years ago, before it started. But it should have been done immediately after it started, as opposed to now, three years later,' Trump told reporters on Sunday. During an NBC interview Sunday, Zelenskkyy compared the need to defend Ukraine to that of helping Israel against Iran, saying Ukraine needs similar security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said he's 'ready and willing' to deploy troops in Ukraine to enforce a peace deal.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/saudi-arabia-peace-talks-russia-ukraine/	2025-02-17T05:04:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25047026097412_e29b34.jpg?w=900
Pope to remain hospitalized as doctors treat a complex respirator...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis’ respiratory tract infection is presenting a 'complex clinical picture' that will require further hospitalization, the Vatican said Monday as concerns grew about the increasingly frail health of the 88-year-old pontiff. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the results of tests conducted in recent days and Monday indicate the pope is suffering from a 'polymicrobial respiratory tract infection' that has necessitated a further change in his drug therapy. Scientists say polymicrobial diseases are caused by a mix of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. There was no timeframe given for his hospitalization, which has already sidelined him for longer than a 2023 hospitalization for pneumonia. Bruni said the complexity of his symptoms 'will require an appropriate hospital stay.' Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital in a 'fair' condition on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors confirmed a respiratory tract infection and prescribed 'absolute rest' alongside unspecified drug therapies. Subsequent updates said his slight fever had gone away and that he was in 'stable' condition. Bruni said Francis, ate breakfast and read the newspapers Monday morning after a third peaceful night. The Argentine pope, who had part of one lung removed after a pulmonary infection as a young man, is a known workaholic who keeps up a grueling pace despite his increasingly precarious health. He uses a wheelchair, walker or cane because of bad knees and suffers from sciatica nerve pain. In 2021 he had 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed because of a narrowing, and then had a further surgery in 2023 to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair an abdominal hernia. When he had a bad case of pneumonia in 2023, he left the hospital after three days and only acknowledged after the fact that he had been admitted urgently after feeling faint and having a sharp pain in his chest. This time around, Francis insisted on finishing his morning audiences Friday before leaving the Vatican, even though he was having trouble speaking at length because he was short of breath. Francis' continued hospitalization has already forced the cancellation of some events connected to the Vatican's Holy Year and put others in question. The Holy See has only confirmed canceled appointments through Monday. Francis was supposed to have gone to Rome’s Cinecitta film studios to meet with artists as part of the Catholic Church’s Holy Year celebrations. The pope's next scheduled appointment is his weekly general audience Wednesday. Beyond that, he is scheduled to preside on Sunday at the ordination of deacons as part of a Holy Year weekend dedicated to deacons. Francis' participation in both appears in doubt, but they remain on the official Vatican schedule. When he missed the Jubilee Mass dedicated to artists this past Sunday, a cardinal stood in for him. ___ Medical writer Maria Cheng contributed from London. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

USAID mission is worthy, but agency needs reform: Whistleblower	(NewsNation) — An employee laid off from USAID last week defends the mission of the embattled agency but says it has become a bureaucracy riddled with inefficiencies. Rob Cohen, a physician and U.S. Army veteran, said he agrees Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency can find waste within the United States Agency for International Development, which the Trump administration has targeted for steep cuts. Ex-administrators of USAID defend agency targeted by Trump 'Reform is needed, and Elon Musk and his team are not totally wrong about that,' Cohen told 'NewsNation Prime' on Saturday. 'But in the process, they’re throwing the baby out with the bath water, firing lots of good employees — I would add, such as myself.' Cohen worked at USAID from 2016 as a contractor and civil servant. He said he stands behind the agency’s humanitarian work, including its successful effort to ensure millions of HIV-positive mothers gave birth to healthy babies through drug therapy. But the agency is encumbered by regulations that can lead to delays in assistance, he said. 'A lot of the dollars were targeted at a good place. It was the delay. It was the inefficiency. A lot of time the procurements would take longer than a year.' Musk calls USAID a ‘criminal organization’ that should ‘die’ Cohen said he was elevated to become USAID's deputy chief of staff but faced pushback after identifying problems.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/usaid-reform-whistleblower/	2025-02-16T18:15:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25038664521392-e1739447564581.jpg?w=900
8 dead in torrential Kentucky storm, Gov. Beshear confirms	FRANKFORT, Ky. (FOX 56) — On Sunday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear addressed the state after a day and night of heavy rainfall that caused deadly flooding from the east end of the Bluegrass to the west. The floods, along with crashes due to weather-related hazards on Saturday, took the lives of at least eight people, Beshear said during the press conference. East braces for flooding while fire-damaged California city faces mudslides 'The fatalities include motor vehicle-related deaths of men in Hart and Nelson counties; and floodwater-related deaths of a man in Clay County, a woman and a child in Hart County, two men in Pike County and a woman in Washington County,' Beshear said in a news release on Sunday. Since Saturday morning, emergency crews have reportedly carried out 1,000 rescues across Kentucky. Cars sit in floodwaters at a railroad underpass in Louisville, Ky., Sunday, Feb. 16, 2025.

Trump says 14th Amendment is for former slaves, not migrants	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump said Sunday that the Founding Fathers 'are spinning in their graves' after his bid to abolish birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally hit another snag. On Thursday, a fourth federal judge blocked the executive order issued by the president on his first day in the Oval Office. Trump argued he is abiding by the 14th Amendment, which his opposers argue he is violating the essence of it. 'The 14th Amendment Right of American Citizenship never had anything to do with modern day 'gate crashers,' illegal immigrants who break the Law by being in our Country, it had everything to do with giving Citizenship to former slaves,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. Sarah Palin ‘would love to’ join Trump administration 'Our Founding Fathers are 'spinning in their graves' at the idea that our Country can be taken away from us. No Nation in the World has anything like this. Our lawyers and Judges have to be tough, and protect America! The 14th Amendment states: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' The Trump administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli or 'right of the soil' — is applied. Most are in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-14th-amendment-slaves-not-migrants/	2025-02-16T11:04:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25044679717736-e1739578095359.jpg?w=800
8 people die in Kentucky storm that flooded roads, governor says	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — At least eight people have died in Kentucky as creeks swelled from heavy storms and water covered roads, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday. Hundreds of people stranded by flooding had to be rescued. Beshear said many of the deaths, including a mother and 7-year-old child, were caused by cars getting stuck in high water. 'So folks, stay off the roads right now and stay alive,' he said. 'This is the search and rescue phase, and I am very proud of all the Kentuckians that are out there responding, putting their lives on the line.' Beshear said the storms have knocked out power to about 39,000 homes, but he warned that harsh winds in some areas could increase outages. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Much of the U.S. faced another round of biting winter weather Sunday, with torrential rains causing intense flooding in Kentucky and resulting in at least four deaths in the Southeast. The Northern Plains faced life-threatening cold, and tornado watches were issued for parts of Georgia and Florida. A mother and her 7-year-old child were killed in Kentucky when the car they were in was swept away by flood waters in Hart County near Interstate 65, a county official told WBKO-TV. Hart County Coroner Tony Roberts said the two were swept away Saturday night in the Bonnieville community. In southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters in Clay County, County Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle Berry said. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that President Trump had approved his request for disaster relief funding. Parts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain during the weekend storms, said Bob Oravec, a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service. 'The effects will continue for awhile, a lot of swollen streams and a lot of flooding going on,' Oravec said Sunday. 'Any time there’s flooding, the flooding can last a lot longer than the rain lasts.' Severe storms also swept through parts of Florida and Georgia, where tornado watches were in effect early Sunday, the National Weather Service said. In Atlanta, a person was killed when an 'extremely large tree' fell on a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta Fire Rescue Capt. Scott Powell. He told reporters that firefighters were dispatched just before 5 a.m. after a 911 call. Elsewhere, bone-chilling cold is expected for the Northern Plains with low temperatures into the minus 30s F near the Canadian border. Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures in the Dakotas and Minnesota of minus 40 Fahrenheit (minus 40 Celsius) to minus 50 F (minus 45.6 C) are expected. Heavy snowfall amounts were expected in parts of New England and northern New York. In some areas, wind gusts could reach 60 mph (about 97 kph) and create 'hazardous whiteout conditions,' the NWS said. Kentucky faces severe flooding Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia late Saturday into Sunday. Both of the states were under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas. The National Weather Service warned residents to stay off the roads. Chilly temperatures replaced the heavy rains with snow early Sunday morning in parts of Kentucky. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in Kentucky ahead of the storms, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday. 'Widespread flooding is continuing,' Beshear said in a social media post Sunday morning. He said evacuations of people in flooded areas were continuing on Sunday. The Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said closed its emergency department and was transferring all patients to two other hospitals in the region. The hospital said it would re-evaluate conditions Sunday morning to determine when it can safely reopen. The north fork of the Kentucky River was forecast to crest nearly 14 feet (4.3 meters) above flood stage that afternoon, the weather service said. Photos posted by authorities and residents on social media showed cars and buildings underwater in south-central and eastern Kentucky. In Buchanan County, Virginia, the sheriff’s office said multiple roads were blocked by mudslides. The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in floodwaters. 'Stay home if you can,' the office said on Facebook. New England faces snow, then sleet Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet. Oravec said Sunday that snowfall in the region was relatively light, due to the freezing rain and sleet mix. Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper Plains on Saturday, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those states and Michigan, with up to 4 inches (10.6 centimeters) of snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday evening. Frigid polar vortex Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as 14 degrees (minus 10 degrees Celsius) over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those living on the streets. __ Sophia Tareen contributed to this report from Chicago.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/ap-eastern-u-s-braces-for-flooding-while-snow-will-hit-northeast-cold-temperatures-across-plains/	2025-02-16T10:17:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b22cb3223de1.34900508.jpeg?w=900
Vance scolds Europe over censorship, criticizes ‘mass migration’	Vice President Vance on Friday used his first major speech on the international stage to accuse European leaders of stifling opposing viewpoints and of retreating from 'fundamental values.' Vance delivered remarks at the Munich Security Conference, where he argued the biggest threats facing Europe were not China or Russia, but the issue of mass migration and laws that restrict free speech. 'While the Trump administration is very concerned with European security and believes we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine … the threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor,' Vance said. 'And what I worry about is the threat from within,' he continued. 'The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.' Vance’s remarks did not delve into the conflict in Ukraine, where the Trump administration is pushing for a ceasefire negotiation, nor did he discuss at length President Trump’s desire for Europe to commit more to defense spending. Instead, Vance accused European officials of using laws meant to minimize misinformation and disinformation to marginalize populist voices and voters. 'To many of us on the other side of the Atlantic, it looks more and more like old, entrenched interests hiding behind Soviet-era words like ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ who simply don’t like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion or, God forbid, vote a different way or, even worse, win an election,' Vance said. 'If you’re running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you,' Vance added. 'Nor, for that matter, is there anything you can do for the American people who elected me and elected President Trump.' Vance attacked European Union 'commissars' for censoring 'hateful content.' He called out the United Kingdom for a 'backslide away from conscience rights.' And he more broadly shrugged off the idea that outsiders weighing in on elections amounts to election meddling. Vance took issue with Romania’s decision in December to wipe out the results from the first round of presidential elections after declassified security documents alleged Russian interference that promoted a far-right outsider candidate. He also defended the conduct of Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and Trump ally who has waded into European politics and appeared virtually at a rally for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party. 'Speaking up and expressing opinions isn’t election interference. Even when people express views outside your own country and even when those people are very influential,' Vance said. 'And trust me I say this with all humor: If American democracy can survive 10 years of Greta Thunberg’s scolding, you guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk.' Vance also described mass migration as the most urgent issue facing the continent. He pointed to an incident in Munich a day earlier when a migrant drove a car into a crowd as an example of the consequences of mass migration. 'No voter on this continent went to the ballot box to open the floodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants,' Vance said. 'More and more all over Europe, they’re voting for political leaders who promise to put an end to out of control migration. I happen to agree with a lot of these concerns. You don’t have to agree with me, I just think that people care.' Vance’s speech garnered a tepid reception in the room, but it was likely to be well received by Trump back in the United States. Trump campaigned on similar culture war issues, including restrictions on migration and on claims of censorship and free speech infringement in the United States. In a nod to the change in administration, Vance told European leaders there was a 'new sheriff in town.' 'Under Donald Trump’s leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will fight for your right to offer it in the public square, agree or disagree,' Vance said. The vice president’s remarks came as the Trump team has sparked controversy with its decision to bar The Associated Press from covering events at the White House, citing disagreements with the news outlets decision to continue referring to the body of water off the Southeastern coast as the Gulf of Mexico. Trump signed an order last month declaring the body of water would be called the Gulf of America.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/vance-scolds-europe-over-censorship-criticizes-mass-migration/	2025-02-16T04:38:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25045497888527-e1739541290914_55f23a.jpg?w=900
House GOP budget resolution in jeopardy amid concerns from modera...	The House GOP’s budget resolution could be in jeopardy of not clearing the full chamber amid concerns from moderates over likely cuts to social safety net programs — particularly Medicaid — with a handful undecided on whether they will support the key measure. Reps. David Valadao (R-Calif.) and Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) — both of whom represent districts with a significant percentage of Medicaid recipients — told The Hill that they are withholding support from the budget resolution as they seek more information on the severity of the cuts and how they could impact their constituents. And they are not alone. 'There’s at least double digits of people who are severely concerned,' Valadao said. 'And I think as people start to understand the specifics of how it’s going tos affect their districts, I imagine that number grows.' Those worries are sure to raise alarm bells for Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and his leadership team — including Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) — who are looking to push the resolution through the chamber and kick-start the process to pass President Trump’s domestic policy agenda as early as the week of Feb. 24, when the House returns. Republicans can only afford to lose one vote if all members are present and the entire Democratic caucus opposes the measure, which is expected. At the current moment, key lawmakers say the resolution could be doomed to fail. 'As of right now I think it’s in jeopardy of failing,' Valadao said. 'I don’t know that the resolution passes,' Malliotakis echoed. 'I think that there are enough of us who are concerned about the arbitrary number that was thrown out there for Medicaid, that the resolution may not pass the floor.' While the worries appear to be more pronounced among moderates, some conservatives have also raised concerns about the trajectory of the reconciliation process. One House Republican who is on the whip team told The Hill that two conservatives reported Friday that they were undecided on the measure. 'I know a bunch of people are whipping undecided because they want to let leadership know that if these cuts hurt people they aren't doing them,' the lawmaker said. That narrative jives with the sentiment described by Valadao, who said, 'I think there’s a lot of people in pretty conservative districts that this has a really negative impact on their districts and their states.' 'I think there’s a lot more people concerned than just moderates,' he added. The pessimistic outlook surrounding the budget resolution became apparent less than 24 hours after the House Budget Committee advanced the measure in a party-line, 21-16 vote, sending it to the full chamber for consideration. Republicans are looking to advance Trump’s legislative agenda using the budget reconciliation process, which would allow the party to circumvent Democratic opposition in the Senate. The first step in the reconciliation process is approving a budget resolution. The budget resolution unveiled by House Republicans this week outlines a $1.5 trillion floor for spending cuts across committees with a target of $2 trillion, a $4.5 trillion cap on the deficit impact of the Republicans’ plan to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, and $300 billion in additional spending for the border and defense. It also increases the debt limit by $4 trillion. On the spending cuts front, the measure sets an $880 billion floor for the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid. That figure — the largest of any panel — signaled that Republicans would likely go after Medicaid to reach the threshold, a plan that lawmakers are openly acknowledging. 'There’s only one place you can go, and that’s Medicaid. That’s where the money is,' Rep. Russ Fulcher (R-Idaho), who sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee. 'There's others, don’t get me wrong, but if you’re gonna get to $900 billion, something has to be reformed on the Medicaid front.' Malliotakis said she is worried about the committee potentially lowering the the portion of Medicaid the federal government covers for the traditional population, which could generate up to $387 billion, or capping Medicaid spending on a per capita basis, which could generate $900 billion in savings per year. She did, however, note that she would be on board with instituting work requirements for the program and removing non-U.S. citizens as beneficiaries. In 2023, 26.8 percent of Malliotakis’s constituents in New York’s 11th Congressional District had Medicaid coverage, according to Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. 'To make up $880 billion, I need more clarity on how they’re going to make up that entire number and how that could potentially affect beneficiaries before I move forward in this process,' the New York Republican said. 'And I’ve expressed that with the Speaker, with the whip, and we’ll see if we get more answers.' Additionally, Malliotakis raised concerns about the $4.5 trillion cap on deficit increases that the Ways and Means Committee will have to abide by to enact Trump’s tax agenda. Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), the chair of the panel, has noted that just implementing a 10-year extension of the expiring provisions in the 2017 tax cuts would cost more than $4.7 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a number that exceeds the budget resolution instructions — and does not include Trump’s other tax demands, including no taxes on tips or Social Security. Included in the tax portion of the package will be an effort by Republicans to increase the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, which is a key ask of Trump and several GOP lawmakers who represent high-tax blue states. Many of those members have said they will not support the final package if there is not substantial SALT relief. Asked if the $4.5 trillion figure provides enough room for reasonable SALT relief, Malliotakis, a member of the SALT Caucus, responded: 'There better be.' Adding to the concerns, Republicans on the Budget Committee adopted an amendment to the budget resolution Thursday night that would require the committee chair to lower deficit increase allowances for the tax portion if the $2 trillion in cuts to mandatory spending is not reached, meaning the allowance for tax cuts and other priorities would be curtailed. The language, crafted by hard-line conservatives and GOP leadership, was key to securing support for the resolution among House Freedom Caucus members who sit on the panel. Malliotakis called the provision 'ridiculous.' 'It boxes us in and I think it limits our ability to deliver on President Trump’s agenda and the tax relief for the middle class,' she said. Other lawmakers, meanwhile, are firing off warning shots about being pushed into complicated corners. 'I ran for Congress under a promise of always doing what is best for the people of Northeastern Pennsylvania. If a bill is put in front of me that guts the benefits my neighbors rely on, I will not vote for it,' Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-Pa.), a first-term lawmaker who flipped a blue district in November, wrote on the social platform X. 'Pennsylvania’s Eighth District chose me to advocate for them in Congress. These benefits are promises that were made to the people of NEPA and where I come from, people keep their word.' It is not, however, all bad news for Johnson and GOP leadership. Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.), who represents a purple district on Long Island, told The Hill on Friday that he will support the budget resolution, calling it an 'easy vote' while signaling that the hard part will come when lawmakers have to craft the measure. 'This document doesn’t change anything, it merely allows for a second step, and there’s no reason right now to get worked up over the first step,' he said. 'When we see substance on step two, that’s when there’ll be a real time to fight and to haggle. Just now is, now’s not the time.' Johnson and leadership, to be sure, have been clear-eyed about the lengthy effort it will take to clear the reconciliation bill, which has historically been a heavy lift, while remaining optimistic that the party will get the job done. 'The Budget Committee will mark up the resolution that will kick-start the reconciliation process and it will go on in earnest for the next several weeks,' Johnson told NewsNation’s Leland Vittert in an interview earlier this week. 'You’ll hear a lot of debate and discussion and deliberation about how to deliver that, but we’ll get it done. We will find the equilibrium point that makes it all work.' The path to that point, however, is sure to get messy, with Republicans making it clear that they have no plans to rubber-stamp any legislation. 'Right now I’m in a, we’ll see,' Malliotakis said. 'I need some assurances and some clarity to move forward.'

What Elon Musk did before DOGE	(NewsNation) — Long before he became the face of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk always carried lofty aspirations in both business and beyond. Musk elevated himself to the world’s richest man with a net worth of just more than $400 billion, according to Forbes, after successful business forays with Tesla, SpaceX and other endeavors built around his love of technology. But for the 53-year-old South African-born businessman and father of 12 children who moved to Canada at the age of 17 in 2008, dreaming big was always part of his life plan. Your student loans won’t be forgiven if DOGE violated FERPA 'I was definitely inspired by science fiction with books and movies,' Musk said during a panel discussion on advancing technology in 2012. 'It creates this sense of possibility that you want to make real. Making it real is a very difficult process but over time, we’ve been able to do that.' Elon Musk is seen in the U.S. Capitol after a meeting with Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., while on the Hill to talk about President-elect Donald Trump's 'Department of Government Efficiency,' on Thursday, December 5, 2024. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Musk’s move to North America as a teenager was made against his wishes, but it allowed him to attend college in Canada and avoid mandatory service in the South African military, according to 'Biography.' Musk also saw coming to Canada as an easier path to American citizenship, which became official in 2002. The move also opened up doors. 'I came to North America because I felt this was where there was an opportunity to do great things in technology,' Musk said in an interview with Queens University, where he attended college and met his first wife. Elon Musk co-founds Tesla Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 with the mission of accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, according to his company bio. The company’s first vehicle, the Roadster, debuted in 2008, followed by the Model S sedan (2012) and Model X SUV (2015). Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk stands in front of the newly unveiled all-electric battery-powered Tesla Cybertruck at Tesla Design Center in Hawthorne, Calif., Nov. 21, 2019. By helping to launch the electric vehicle brand, Musk said his goal for the company was to accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation and use Tesla as the catalyst for that transition. Tesla also contributed technology to other automotive manufacturers, such as Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, long before the concept of electric vehicles took hold across the country as a viable means for sustainable automobiles. Musk and PayPal Before he entered the automotive world, Musk co-founded and sold PayPal, the world's leading internet payment system, and Zip2, one of the first internet maps and directions services. Does DOGE have your personal information? But regardless of what direction his business took him, Musk remained focused on creating a better world and keeping an eye on the past rather than dwelling too much on the past, 'In general, there’s a lot of discussion about his problem or that problem, and a lot of people are sad about the future, and they’re pessimistic,' Musk told TED in 2022. 'This is not great. We want to wake up in the morning and look forward to the future. We want to be excited about what’s going to happen.' Musk and SpaceX Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with a vision of decreasing the cost of space launches and travel but ultimately with the plan of the colonization of Mars. Who is part of DOGE leader Elon Musk’s family? Musk serves as the lead engineer at SpaceX and oversees the development of rockets and spaceships for missions to Earth and, ultimately, to other planets, including Mars.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) The company’s first rocket, Falcon 1, was the first privately developed liquid-fuel rocket to reach orbit. Musk said the United States’ advancement in space travel has not matched other technologies, including communications and computing. Elon Musk’s DOGE has access to these federal agencies He said in 2012 he saw developing interplanetary space travel and landing someone on Mars as the ultimate adventure that the human race could achieve. 'We need a spaceship that can do interplanetary travel,' Musk said. 'It’s about time.' Musk's Mars Colonization Goals SpaceX developed the Starship spacecraft, which the company describes as a fully reusable transportation system that is designed to carry crew and cargo to orbit the Earth, Mars and beyond. The rocket’s heat shield is designed to withstand several entries to Mars. In addition to living out the adventure of establishing a sustainable interplanetary life system on Mars, Musk wrote on the SpaceX website that spacefaring civilization is 'about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past.' Besides Elon Musk, who else is running DOGE? 'I think people should generally have more of a positive attitude because that’s the underlying reality,' Musk said in 2012. 'I think in the 21st century, we’ll see lots of exciting things happen. I think we’ll see the transformation and transportation and energy production. We’ll hopefully see a base on Mars and if SpaceX can help us make that transformation happen, I think it will enable enormous possibilities for who is able to go over there and create things on another planet.' DOGE Musk was designated to oversee DOGE by President Donald Trump after Musk campaigned for Trump throughout his campaign for a second term in the White House. Elon Musk’s net worth drops as Trump threatens tariffs The office was established to cut government spending, with Musk saying at the outset of DOGE’s formation that his goal was to cut as much as $2 trillion in annual federal spending.

Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration has led to criticism from some who maintain that he has too much influence and too much access to sensitive financial information. 'Elon is doing a great job, he's finding tremendous fraud and corruption and waste,' Trump told reporters this month.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/what-elon-musk-did-before-doge/	2025-02-15T16:59:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2194353767.jpg?w=900
Gabby Petito’s family speaks with NewsNation ahead of documentary...	(NewsNation) — The family of Gabby Petito sat down with NewsNation’s Brian Entin to discuss the Netflix documentary about the murder of their daughter and how they’re working to prevent youth domestic violence. 'When you watch the documentary, remember that this is a real person, this is a real family, it’s a real story and it’s real life,' Gabby’s mother Nichole Schmidt told NewsNation. 'It’s not just true crime. This can happen to anyone. We never in a million years thought this would happen to our family. That’s why we’re trying to help people so we can prevent this from happening to them.' NewsNation Senior Correspondent Brian Entin spoke with Gabby Petito's parents ahead of the release of a Netflix docuseries about her case. Watch his full report on 'Morning in America' on Monday starting at 6a/5c. In July 2021, Gabby and her boyfriend Brian Laundrie went on a road trip across America, but only Laundrie returned to his parent’s house in North Port, Florida. Historian who discovered Jack The Ripper’s real identity says ‘100% him’ Authorities said Laundrie killed Gabby and left her at the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. Her body would be found weeks later in mid-September, days after Laundrie went missing in the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park in Florida. Laundrie’s remains were found in the nature preserve in October 2021. Investigators said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and left a notebook confession saying he killed Gabby. Gabby’s family will share their story in 'American Murder: Gabby Petito,' a three-part documentary set to premiere on Feb. 17.

Historian who discovered Jack The Ripper's real identity says '10...	(NewsNation) — A historian and true crime sleuth may have cracked a case for the ages, sharing his bombshell findings with NewsNation’s 'Banfield' Friday night. Russell Edwards identified a 100% DNA match to locate the real identity of serial killer 'Jack The Ripper.' The infamous killer who terrorized London women may have been 23-year-old Aaron Kosminski, who had long been considered a suspect at the time. 'Oh, without a doubt, 100% it’s him,' said Edwards, who in 2007 bought a shawl that was found at the scene of the murder of Catherine Eddowes. Jack the Ripper’s identity revealed after DNA match, historian says Who is the real Jack The Ripper? He tested the shawl using DNA provided by Kosminski’s oldest brother’s great-great-granddaughter. Kosminski, a Polish immigrant, became a barber in Whitechapel, England, and was in a mental health facility with schizophrenia at the time of his death in 1919. A composite drawing was done to recreate Kosminksi’s image. A historian began researching Jack The Ripper's real identity, linking DNA evidence to a man named Aaron Kosminski. This is a composite drawing the historian, Russell Edwards, commissioned of Kosminski. 'This face is a facial reconstruction by an expert from the family photos that were given to me by one of the family members, by one of the descendants,' he said. 'That's actually what he looked like.' Edwards turned his discovery into a book, 'Naming Jack the Ripper: The Definitive Reveal.' Jack The Ripper victim’s descendant wears her brooch to this day 'With the evidence that we have, we can actually place Aaron Kosminski at the murder scene,' he said. What evidence helped identify Jack The Ripper? Russell Edwards, a historian, holds a shawl he bought in 2007 that was found at the murder scene of one of Jack The Ripper's victims. Edwards used the shawl to test for DNA evidence, leading him to discover the real identity of the serial killer, he claims. The most interesting piece of evidence, he said, is the 9-foot long and 2.5-foot wide shawl that helped bridge history’s mystery with forensic DNA. It was in a police filing cabinet for over a decade, according to Edwards. Now, it’s in a bank vault, likely to go untested by police. 'They've never knocked on the door. And when we originally did this, they certainly weren't interested. It's curious that they sort of just not bothered,' Edwards said. The curious case of 'Jack The Ripper' became not a British fascination, not an American fascination, but a global one. Edwards said, 'It's the eternal ‘who done it.’'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jack-the-ripper-real-identity-discovered-historian-claims/	2025-02-15T06:01:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-71901552.jpg?w=900
East braces for flooding while fire-damaged California city faces...	SIERRA MADRE, Calif. (AP) — Much of the Eastern U.S. braced for a renewed round of harsh, soggy weather on Saturday, with thunderstorms and melting snow combining to pound the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. The lower Mississippi valley was facing the threat of strong tornadoes. Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were under flood warnings, and residents were warned by the National Weather Service to stay off roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up to 8 inches of rain. 'This may be a major, potentially historic, flash flood event,' the NWS said. Heavy snow, meanwhile, was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible, the NWS said. In northern New York, heavy mixed precipitation is expected throughout the weekend. Weather forecasters said residents should expect snow, sleet and ice accumulations of six to 13 inches and wind gusts as high as 45 mph (72 kph) late Saturday and Sunday. 'Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice and strong winds. Travel could be very difficult to nearly impossible, the NWS said. California struggles with mudslides In Southern California on Friday, a mountain community near the Eaton Fire burn scar dug out of roads submerged in sludge after the strongest storm of the year swept through the area, unleashing debris flows and muddy messes in several neighborhoods recently torched by wildfires. Dry weather returned to the region but the risk of rock and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued Friday since dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in scorched areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away. Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several home garages with mud and debris. Bulldozers on Friday were cleaning up the mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people. 'It happened very quickly but it was very loud and you could even hear the ground or feel the ground shaking,' Bull Duvall, who has lived in Sierra Madre for 28 years, said of the debris flows. Sierra Madre officials issued evacuation orders for areas affected by the Eaton Fire, warning that fire, police and public works personnel would not enter areas experiencing active mud and debris flows and anyone who remained in a home under evacuation orders would need to shelter in place until areas are deemed safe for city personnel to enter. Residents of the city also had to evacuate during the Eaton Fire, which destroyed 15 homes in the community. In Pacific Palisades on Friday, some residents washed their mud-covered driveways and bulldozers worked to clear mud-coated roads not far from where, just weeks ago, officials moved abandoned cars after people fleeing last month's wildfires got stuck in traffic and fled on foot. The vehicle of a member of the Los Angeles Fire Department was pulled out of the water in Malibu after it was pushed into the ocean on Thursday. A fire department employee was able to exit with minor injuries, department spokesperson Erik Scott said. Southern California reported 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7 centimeters) of rain in coastal areas and valleys and 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) across the coastal slopes on Thursday, said Mike Wofford, a meteorologist with the weather service. The precipitation was badly needed, as much of Southern California remains in extreme or severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. In neighboring Nevada, the weather service said it recorded a measurable amount of rain in Las Vegas, ending a streak of 214 days without precipitation. A storm in the Sierra Nevada mountains dumped 6 feet (1.8 meters) of snow over 36 hours. Two ski patrol staff from Mammoth Mountain were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. More winter weather is descending on the U.S. Meteorologists warn that the U.S. is about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains on Saturday and then stick around all next week. In Denver, where temperatures are expected to dip as low as 14 degrees (minus 10 degrees Celsius) over the weekend, the city has extended its cold weather shelters for those living on the streets. The Denver Coliseum — an arena with some 10,000 seats — will be opened Saturday for additional space, while a free bus will loop between the shelters across the city. In the Rocky Mountains, skiers eager for the long Presidents' Day weekend are already facing a closure on a section of Interstate 70 due to snow as officials warn of hazardous conditions on the mountain roads over the weekend. ___ Rodriguez reported from San Francisco.

Black Hawk pilots may have flown on 'bad' altitude data before cr...	(The Hill) — The Black Hawk pilots who collided with an American Airlines plane last month may not have heard vital information given by air traffic control to fly behind the passenger jet seconds before the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed Friday. Seventeen seconds before impact, a radio transmission from the control tower directed the Black Hawk to pass behind the jet. But data from the Army helicopter indicated that 'the portion of the transmission that stated ‘pass behind the’ may not have been received by the Black Hawk crew,' NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said at a Friday news conference. It is likely the Black Hawk pilots 'stepped on' the communication for less than a second by pressing the microphone key to communicate back to the control tower, she said. Furthermore, the Black Hawk pilots may have had 'bad data' on the altitude they were flying at outside Washington D.C. at the time of the Jan. 29 collision, which killed all 67 people aboard both flights, according to the agency. The Black Hawk crashed into Flight 5342 just before 9 p.m. as the jet was en route to Reagan National Airport from Wichita, Kan. The collision sent both aircraft plunging into the Potomac River, the deadliest such accident since 2001. 'We are seeing conflicting information in the data,' Homendy said, noting that the helicopter was flying at 278 feet when it crashed — far above the 200-foot limit for that location. But 'that does not mean that’s what the Black Hawk crew was seeing on the barometric altimeters in the cockpit,' she cautioned. At one point, the pilot indicated they were flying at 300 feet, but the instructor pilot said they were at 400 feet, according to recordings. 'We are looking at the possibility that there may be bad data,' she said. Investigators also believe the helicopter pilots were wearing night vision goggles and had been the whole flight. She said that the on-scene phase of the investigation into the disaster had been finished, but because of the conflicting data with the Black Hawk’s altitude, the NTSB is not yet releasing information for the helicopter’s entire route. Earlier this month, the Federal Aviation Administration ruled that helicopters and airplanes would no longer be able to share the airspace above the Potomac River, a decision made after speculation the Black Hawk had been flying too high. The accident has also prompted widespread concern over the staffing shortages at the FAA with President Trump vowing to overhaul the agency and air traffic control.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/black-hawk-pilots-may-have-flown-on-bad-altitude-data-before-crash/	2025-02-15T04:18:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25045729678068-e1739582653613.jpg?w=800
Hamas parades 3 Israeli hostages before crowd in handoff to Red C...	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas on Saturday paraded three Israeli hostages before a large crowd in the Gaza Strip ahead of their handover to the Red Cross as part of a shaky ceasefire deal that requires Israel to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange. The three hostages are Iair Horn, 46, a dual citizen of Israel and Argentina; Sagui Dekel Chen, 36, who is American-Israeli; and Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov, 29, who holds Israeli and Russian citizenship. All were abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. The truce that began nearly four weeks ago had been jeopardized in recent days by a tense dispute that threatened to renew the fighting. U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial proposal to remove more than 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and settle them elsewhere in the region has cast even more doubt on the future of the ceasefire. But Hamas said Thursday it would move ahead with the release of more hostages after talks with Egyptian and Qatari officials. The group said the mediators had pledged to 'remove all hurdles' to assure Israel would allow more tents, medical supplies and other essentials into Gaza. It will be the sixth swap since the ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19. So far, 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners have been freed during the first phase of the truce. Red Cross vehicles arrived at the location where Hamas was set to release the hostages Saturday morning. As with previous exchanges, dozens of masked, armed Hamas fighters lined up near a stage festooned with Palestinian flags and the banners of militant factions while music blared from loudspeakers. The militants are will hand the hostages over to the Red Cross, which will then transport them to Israeli forces Who are the hostages and prisoners being released? The three hostages were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, one of the hardest-hit communities in southern Israel during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the devastating war. Horn was abducted along with his brother, Eitan Horn, who had been staying with him at the time. Eitan remains in captivity. Dekel Chen had been working outside when militants stormed the kibbutz. His wife hid in a safe room with their two daughters. She gave birth to their third daughter two months later. Troufanov was taken hostage along with his grandmother, mother and girlfriend. The three women were released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. Troufanov’s father was killed in the Oct. 7 attack. The Hamas-linked Prisoners’ Information Office said Friday that 369 Palestinians were set to be released from Israeli prisons on Saturday. It said 36 of those were serving life sentences. Among the most prominent Palestinian prisoners set to be released is Ahmed Barghouti, 48, a close aide of Marwan Barghouti, a militant leader and iconic Palestinian political figure. Israel sentenced Ahmed Barghouti to life on charges that he dispatched suicide bombers during the Second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in the early 2000s to carry out attacks that killed Israeli civilians. He was arrested alongside Marwan Barghouti in 2002. Concerns are high about the remaining hostages’ condition Of the 251 people abducted, 73 remain in Gaza, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Nearly all the remaining hostages are men, including Israeli soldiers. Concern has been growing about the remaining hostages’ condition, particularly after the release of three last Saturday, who emerged looking emaciated and frail. One of them, 65-year-old Keith Siegel, said Friday in a video message addressed to Trump that his captors treated him worse as the 15-month war intensified, kicking him, spitting on him and holding him without water or light. The truce remains very fragile The ceasefire appeared dangerously close to collapse in recent days. Hamas had said it would delay the release of the hostages after accusing Israel of not adhering to their agreement by not allowing in enough shelters, medical supplies, fuel and heavy equipment for clearing rubble. Israel said it would resume fighting Saturday unless hostages were freed. While the immediate crisis may have been averted, the truce faces a much bigger challenge with the deal’s first phase set to conclude in early March. There have not yet been substantive negotiations over the second phase, in which Hamas would release all remaining hostages in return for an end to the war. At its height, the fighting displaced 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million. Hundreds of thousands have since returned to their homes as the ceasefire took hold, though many found only rubble, buried human remains and unexploded ordnance. The war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Trump’s plan increases uncertainty Trump’s proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and settle them elsewhere in the region has thrown the truce’s future into further doubt. The idea has been welcomed by Israel’s government. But it has been strongly rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries. Human rights groups say it could amount to a war crime under international law. Trump has proposed that once the fighting ends, Israel would transfer control of Gaza to the United States, which would then redevelop it as the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right allies are already calling for a resumption of the war after the first phase with the goal of destroying Hamas and implementing Trump’s plan. The militant group remains in control of the territory after surviving one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. Hamas may be unwilling to release any more hostages if it believes the war will resume. The captives are among the only bargaining chips it has left. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-hamas-is-set-to-free-3-more-israeli-hostages-after-dispute-threatened-to-reignite-war-in-gaza/	2025-02-15T00:19:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b04d74b5b1f8.60498139.jpeg?w=900

Area 51 veterans getting cancer as DOD denies they were there Dutton showed Ashleigh Banfield a brooch that was left by Eddowes, which she still wears in her honor, 137 years later. 'It's been treasured from generation to generation,' Dutton said. Who was Jack the Ripper? Jack the Ripper has lived in infamy and lore for more than a century after he committed the murders of at least five women in Whitechapel between August and November of 1888. Police never found the suspect, who was also referred to as the 'Whitechapel Murderer' and the 'Leather Apron.' He was infamous for slitting the throat of his victims before removing the internal organs of at least three people. According to Dutton, Jack the Ripper ripped Eddowes' bladder and kidney out from her body. Possible abduction attempt under investigation in Wichita, Kansas Is it a confirmed match to Jack the Ripper? Historian Russell Edwards says he identified Jack the Ripper as Aaron Kosminski through a DNA match of a shawl found at the scene of one of his murders. According to the Daily Mail, Edwards has hired a legal team to help gain an inquest after he found a 100% DNA match. Descendants of both Eddowes and Kosminski have backed this move. As he told 'Today,' Edwards and his team have sent a letter to the attorney general requesting permission to go to Britain's High Court for a further inquest. The hope is that Kosminski can be legally tied to the murder.

Sarah Palin ‘would love to’ join Trump administration	(NewsNation) — Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin tells 'On Balance with Leland Vittert' she’d be honored to serve in President Donald Trump’s second administration but hasn’t been contacted. 'I thought that there’d be a position in energy, in that department, because that's my baby ... but that hasn’t happened,' Palin said on Friday. She pointed to 'gatekeepers' within the administration, telling NewsNation: 'It gets frustrating for those with a heart to serve.' Trump’s framed mug shot hangs outside Oval Office 'I didn’t even get credentials to attend the GOP convention if you can believe it,' she added. 'They’re tight, they’re tight.' The former governor told NewsNation that she's the only living Republican to have run for vice president or president — and support Trump — who was not at the event. Of his current administration, Palin said she thinks recent unforced errors from the administration show why some experience matters. Particularly, experience in local government: 'You learn, from the bottom on up, how important it is to be on the same sheet of music. And not to have blind loyalty.' New ad showcases Trump’s vision for the military Palin predicts that, if Trump’s policy changes aren’t implemented in a timely manner, the administration might see some early turnover. 'If his agenda is not going to be ushered in — per the vote of the people, that’s the wishes of the people —then I think they will regroup and maybe, already, change some persons,' Palin explained.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/sarah-palin-would-love-to-join-trump-admin/	2025-02-14T19:06:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-1440123049.jpg?w=900
Lawsuit against Jay-Z, Diddy dismissed by accuser's attorney	(NewsNation) — The lawsuit accusing Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, and Sean 'Diddy' Combs of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000 has been dismissed by the accuser’s attorney, according to new court filings. The voluntary dismissal filing, obtained by Variety, said the accuser 'hereby gives notice that the above-captioned Action is voluntarily dismissed, with prejudice.' Prejudice prevents the accuser, identified only as 'Jane Doe,' or her lawyers from refiling the lawsuit as it was first written. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits: Timeline Roc Nation, Jay-Z's entertainment company, issued a statement calling the dismissal 'a victory.' 'The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed. This civil suit waswithout merit and never going anywhere. The fictional tale they created was laughable, if not for the seriousness of the claims,' reads the statement, which was signed by Jay-Z. The statement mentioned that his wife, Beyonce, and their three children have endured trauma as a result of the accusations. 'The court must protect victims, OF COURSE, while with the same ethical responsibility, the courts must protect the innocent from being accused without a shred of evidence. May the truth prevail for all victims and those falsely accused equally,' the statement continued. Lawsuit accuses Jay-Z and Diddy of rape Originally filed in October 2024, the suit named only Diddy. An amended complaint in December identified Jay-Z as 'Celebrity A,' who was accused of raping the 13-year-old while 'Celebrity B,' a female, watched. Following the filing, Jay-Z released a lengthy response accusing the lawyer behind the accuser’s suit of attempting to blackmail him. What we know about the Diddy investigation 'What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle,' Jay-Z’s statement reads in part. 'No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!' Diddy indictment Diddy has pleaded not guilty to federal sex trafficking charges contained in an indictment unsealed the day after his Sept. 16 arrest. Charges include allegations he coerced and abused women for years, aided by associates and employees, and silenced victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings. He has remained incarcerated pending a May 5 trial after his bond request was denied for a third time in late November. Combs’ indictment came after months of speculation about a possible federal investigation tied to civil lawsuits alleging abuse and sexual assault spanning more than 30 years. Diddy’s ‘inner circle’ breaks silence in new documentary The indictment alleges Combs lured in women with promises of a romantic relationship before using intimidation and threats to have them engage in prostitution at reported so-called 'freak offs.' There, victims were allegedly drugged and told to engage in sex acts with male sex workers for an extended period while someone filmed them. Combs allegedly kept some of the videos, sometimes without the victims’ knowledge. The indictment states that Combs and the victims often required IV fluids afterward due to physical exertion.

US Army bans transgender people from enlisting	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Army has banned transgender people from joining its ranks and ended gender-affirming care for service members, the military branch announced Friday. In a post on X, the official U.S. Army account said that 'all new accessions for individuals with a history of gender dysphoria are paused, and all unscheduled, scheduled, or planned medical procedures associated with affirming or facilitating a gender transition for Service members are paused.' The new policies are effective immediately, the Army's post confirmed. Judge extends order blocking DOGE from treasury systems The change comes just weeks after President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for a revision of gender policy in the military. The president said that transgender service members' identities conflict 'with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle.' The president's order points to those diagnosed with gender dysphoria, or distress felt when assigned sex and gender don't match. The U.S. Army's thread of posts point to this term as well, concluding: 'Individuals with gender dysphoria have volunteered to serve our country and will be treated with dignity and respect.' In the wake of the order, six active duty service members filed a lawsuit challenging the ban. 'I’ve spent more than half my life in the Army, including combat in Afghanistan,' Army Sgt. 1st Class Kate Cole told The Associated Press. 'Removing qualified transgender soldiers like me means an exodus of experienced personnel.' Foreign aid freeze temporarily lifted but damage may already be done The lawsuit is being filed by the same legal team that spent years during Trump’s first administration fighting the Republican ban on transgender troops, which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect even as the legal fight against it continued in the courts. Joe Biden scrapped the ban when he took office. One of the plaintiffs, Army Capt. Gordon Herrero, said in a statement: 'There’s nothing about being transgender that makes me better or worse than any other soldier I serve alongside. We are all here because we are committed to our country, and we are passionate, willing, and able to serve effectively.' According to the Associated Press, estimates place the number of transgender troops at 9,000 to 12,000, though it's hard to know for certain due to medical privacy laws. Just last week, the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s Board of Governors voted to change its policy on transgender athletes.

Cartels trade 'cocaine of the sea' for fentanyl chemicals	(NewsNation) — A cartel made up of Chinese and Mexican nationals is taking a new route to smuggle drugs and trade on parts from an endangered species. A new memo from Canada's border service revealed a group known as the Dragon Cartel, where members are trading the endangered totoaba fish for the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl. The fish is an endangered species that swims in the Gulf of California. Mexican cartels discovered there is a demand for the totoaba fish on the black market in Asia for its swim bladder. Could DOGE, Trump administration close the IRS? One kilogram of totoaba swim bladder is worth $80,000 on the black market, which has led to the fish becoming known as the 'cocaine of the sea.' The swim bladders are used in traditional cuisine, traditional Chinese medicine and even in cosmetics. According to the memo, west coast ports are used to exchange the goods, with the port of Vancouver particularly vulnerable to the trade. Officials are fighting an uphill battle when it comes to cracking down on the totoaba trade. One reason for that is the volume of trade through Vancouver; another is it is extremely difficult to identify illegally traded bladders among other legal fish products. Mexico continues to dig for border tunnels, US watches Totoaba bladders are often smuggled alongside frozen fish and squid and transported by crews in backpacks. Criminal networks are now expanding their methods to include smuggling them in gasoline tanks, spare tires, or hidden vehicle compartments. Experts say that officials do not have the infrastructure to detect and crack down on the totoaba bladders. They also say that fentanyl coming through the port largely flows to Mexico, with only a small portion remaining in Canada.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/cartels-totoaba-fentanyl/	2025-02-14T13:51:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/12/657275fd7d0442.53146274.jpeg?w=457
Could DOGE, Trump administration close the IRS?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency might be considering making changes to the Internal Revenue Service, as a staffer at DOGE visited IRS headquarters Thursday, according to Reuters. DOGE investigating IRS Sources told Reuters that staffer Gavin Kliger was meeting with senior executives, marking the first time that Elon Musk's DOGE has visited the IRS. DHS seeks to deputize IRS agents to help with deportation efforts Reuters reported that IRS senior executives received an email Thursday that told them to find all 'non-essential' contracts that could be terminated. The email said, 'Consistent with the goals and directives of the Trump administration to eliminate waste, reduce spending, and increase efficiency, GSA has taken the first steps in a government-wide initiative to eliminate non-essential consulting contracts.' Trump also responded to DOGE being at the IRS on Thursday, stating, 'I think that the Internal Revenue Service will be looked at like everybody else, just about everybody is going to be looked at. They're [DOGE] doing a hell of a job, it's an amazing job they're doing,' according to The Hill. DOGE has been heavily criticized by many Democrats, with Democratic Senator Ron Wyden posting on X on Thursday, 'My office is hearing that DOGE is now at the IRS. That means Musk's henchmen are in a position to dig through a trove of data about every taxpayer in America.' Elon Musk’s DOGE has access to these federal agencies Can Elon Musk's DOGE close the IRS? Since the IRS was created by Congress, it would require an act from Congress to shut the organization down. It is not clear how Trump's administration or DOGE would clear any legal hurdles that might come with using an executive order to close the IRS. In January, Georgia Republican Earl L. 'Buddy' Carter introduced the Fair Tax Act, which would replace the current tax code and 'eliminate the need for the Internal Revenue Service.' As of February, this bill has only been introduced. However, if it passes the House and Senate and is signed by Trump, it would become law. George W. Connelly, senior counsel at Chamberlain Hrdlicka Attorney at Law, talked about the importance of the IRS in 2020, saying, 'Those of us in the tax profession who deal with the IRS frankly prefer dealing with IRS personnel and the administrative system in place over what we encountered in the state regimes.' Connelly also said that changing the name of the IRS wouldn't remove 'the tax man.' 'No matter what we call him, his job will never change. Meanwhile, calls for abolishing the IRS simply distract the attention that needs to be placed on making the IRS more effective, starting with adequately funding it and reviewing the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights,' he said. What would happen with our taxes if the IRS closed? According to the Tax Policy Center, the IRS is anticipating 140 million tax returns this year. Potential staffing cuts and the IRS having a temporary acting commissioner could make it harder for taxpayers to reach a representative to get assistance with filing. With Trump's administration encouraging federal employees to resign or retire and about 77,000 workers accepting that offer, the IRS could be short-staffed. This could lead to a delay in filing your return or distributing your refund. Filing taxes late will cost you, but how much? These cuts could also potentially affect the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs, which offer free tax prep for those who make $67,000 or less, have a disability or don't speak English as their first language. According to the IRS, these programs helped prepare and file more than 2.7 million tax returns. Remember, there are penalties for not filing your tax return on time, not paying taxes you owe on time and not providing accurate information on your return.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/what-happens-irs-abolished-doge-taxes/	2025-02-14T11:59:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/675b1d4b88e754.35435350.jpeg?w=900
Diddy accused of threatening, assaulting woman in 2016: Lawsuit	(NewsNation) — Sean 'Diddy' Combs has been sued by a woman who claims the embattled music producer threatened then sexually assaulted her at a Los Angeles club in 2016 in a new lawsuit which follows a growing pile of complaints against the rapper. The woman claims Combs and his entourage approached her when she was at Club Playhouse in Los Angeles, according to a complaint filed in New York State Supreme Court, reported People. Combs allegedly offered her a drink, but when she refused, he allegedly responded, 'B----, I’m not asking you. Drink that s--- and shut the f--- up,' the complaint states. The plaintiff claims she 'felt compelled to drink the beverage after he forcefully slid the glass towards her.' Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits: Timeline He then allegedly placed his arm around her and 'shoved his left hand up her skirt, forcefully penetrating her with his fingers while telling her, 'B---, I do what I want, take that s---.'' The woman alleges that she tried to push Combs away but that he laughed 'appearing amused by her distress.' She claimed in her suit that Combs eventually allowed her to leave, but she was already feeling disoriented when she hailed a cab back to her hotel saying she 'felt dizzy, light-headed, and unable to stand without support.' The plaintiff claimed that hotel staff had to help her get to her hotel room. The following morning, the complaint claims that she found tearing and bruising around her genital area, 'likely resulting from the assault.' Her complaint did not allege that the drink was spiked. Combs’ attorneys denied the accusations in a statement to People: 'No matter how many lawsuits are filed—especially by individuals who refuse to put their own names behind their claims—it won’t change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone—man or woman, adult or minor,' The musician already faces a mounting list of civil lawsuits that allege abuse and sexual assault by multiple victims spanning over 30 years. Combs was charged with federal racketeering and sex trafficking last year after two of his homes in Miami and New York were raided by federal investigators. His trial is set for May. The indictment says Combs often lured victims by promising a romantic relationship before using threats, intimidation and abuse to get them to engage in various sexual activities. Those included so-called 'Freak Offs' where victims were directed to engage in extended sex acts with male sex workers on film. Prosecutors allege Combs drugged victims during those sessions and sometimes kept the footage without the victim being aware he was doing so.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/diddy-threatening-assaulting-woman-2016/	2025-02-14T10:20:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-459349060.jpg?w=900
These are the 10 cities where renters pay the highest 'singles ta...	(NewsNation) — The cost of living alone is rising, and the so-called 'singles tax' is now at an all-time high, according to a new Zillow analysis. Nationwide, solo renters pay an extra $7,562 per year for a one-bedroom unit compared to couples who split rent with their partners. That premium, known as the singles tax, is up by more than $450 from a year ago. In high cost-of-living areas like New York City and San Francisco, the singles tax is much higher. Rents for single-family homes 41% higher than prepandemic Singles in the Big Apple pay an average of $20,100 more per year to live alone, the highest premium of any U.S. city. 'As anyone on the dating scene in NYC will tell you, it’s not easy to be single here, and the lack of affordable rentals just adds another layer to that struggle,' Casey Roberts, home trends expert at Zillow's New York City brand StreetEasy, said in a statement. California's Bay Area also comes at a steep price for singles; San Francisco ($14,793) and San Jose ($14,254) had the second and third highest singles tax in the country. Boston ($12,289) came in fourth followed by Washington, D.C. ($12,019). What does January’s inflation report mean for me? The sky-high singles tax won't come as a surprise to most. Rents have been steadily increasing and are up in 47 of the 50 largest metro areas from a year ago, according to Zillow. The typical U.S. asking rent hit $1,968 in January, up 3.5% from a year earlier and up more than 33% since the beginning of the pandemic. The latest inflation report further underscored the nation's housing affordability challenge. Shelter accounted for roughly 30% of the overall increase in the consumer price index last month. But it's not all bad news for renters. Zillow's data shows landlords are increasingly offering concessions to attract renters. Last month, more than 41% of the real estate company's rental listings featured incentives — a record high in Zillow data. Those freebies are expected to slow down in the months ahead when competition in the rental market picks up. A lot of that will depend on what happens with mortgage rates, which have kept potential buyers on the sidelines. Zillow determined each city's singles tax based on the median-priced one-bedroom rental in December 2024. That number was multiplied by 12 to get the typical annual rent and then halved to figure out how much more it costs to live alone versus with a partner splitting the cost. Top ten U.S. cities with the highest singles tax, according to Zillow: New York City, NY: $20,100 San Francisco, CA: $14,793 San Jose, CA: $14,254 Boston, MA: $12,829 Washington, D.C.: $12,019 San Diego, CA: $11,897 Seattle, WA: $11,556 Los Angeles, CA: $10,470 Long Beach, CA: $10,228 Denver, CO: $9,676	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/10-cities-renters-singles-tax/	2025-02-14T10:16:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2179858600.jpg?w=900
Live: DC plane crash investigation update	(NewsNation) — New details were revealed Friday during a National Transport Safety Board briefing into the Jan. 29 crash between an American Airlines passenger jet and a Black Hawk military helicopter that killed 67 people in Washington, D.C. In the weeks since the crash, the NTSB has been analyzing flight data and damage to determine the cause of the crash. In what was the deadliest aircraft collision in nearly two decades, the helicopter was performing a 'check ride,' otherwise known as a practical test to become a pilot. Egg prices are surging, so why are chicken prices stable? All 67 victims have been identified, and debris from the two aircraft has been recovered from the Potomac River. There is a chance during the news conference that investigators reveal what was said in the final moments from the cockpit of the plane and the cockpit of the helicopter. That audio was contained in the black boxes of the aircraft. Should those details emerge, we would not hear the exact audio from those black boxes; instead, transcripts would be made public. Investigators have interviewed air traffic controllers working at the time of the collision, and information about their experiences may also be revealed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/dc-plane-crash-updates-today/	2025-02-14T09:08:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2196164305.jpg?w=900

Adams letting ICE operate at Rikers after meeting with Tom Homan	(NewsNation) — Immigration and Customs Enforcement will soon be allowed to operate in Rikers Island, New York City's largest jail, Mayor Eric Adams announced after a meeting with President Donald Trump's 'border czar' Tom Homan. In a statement, he called the meeting with Homan productive, adding that he doesn't want to go to war with the Trump administration. Part of the plan discussed with Homan includes reopening ICE's office on Rikers Island. Also discussed were ways to embed more New York Police detectives into federal task forces focused on violent gangs and criminal activity. Area 51 veterans getting cancer as DOD denies they were there The alliance comes a day after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced a lawsuit against the state of New York, accusing officials of impeding ICE's work — and two days after the Department of Justice issued a memo directing bribery charges be dropped against Adams. Charges against Adams are to be dropped without prejudice, which means they can be refiled. Critics point to the DOJ's move as a possible motive for Adams' willingness to work with Trump administration officials. When asked directly, Adams said the Biden administration, which implemented sanctuary city laws that limit how much local law enforcement can work with ICE, went too far. 'I thought the intention was there, but the application was wrong,' Adams said. 'I asked the city council, 'Can we modify when it comes down to dangerous individuals?' They refused to do so, so we need to operate in the parameters that we have.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/adams-letting-ice-operate-rikers-meeting-tom-homan/	2025-02-14T06:26:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2189641961.jpg?w=900
OPM directs agencies to fire government workers still on probatio...	Office of Personnel Management (OPM) officials met with agency leaders across government Thursday and directed them to begin firing employees still in their probationary period a year or more after being hired. Federal employees remain on probation anywhere from one to two years after being hired, depending on their agency, a status that still comes with workplace protections but makes them easier to remove. The move could impact as many as 200,000 federal employees. A source familiar with OPM said agency leaders have directed agencies to fire all probationary employees 'with some exceptions.' It was not immediately clear what those exceptions were or the extent of discretion given to agencies. 'The probationary period is a continuation of the job application process, not an entitlement for permanent employment. Agencies are taking independent action in light of the recent hiring freeze and in support of the President's broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government to better serve the American people at the highest possible standard,' an OPM spokesperson said in a statement. The move is a reversal from an OPM directive just days earlier, when agencies were told to remove probationary employees only if they were poor performers. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest federal employee union, pledged to fight the layoffs, saying they would hinder government performance. 'This administration has abused the probationary period to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office,' AFGE president Everett Kelley said in a statement. 'These firings are not about poor performance -- there is no evidence these employees were anything but dedicated public servants. They are about power. They are about gutting the federal government, silencing workers, and forcing agencies into submission to a radical agenda that prioritizes cronyism over competence. The Trump administration has also used two other methods to cull the workforce: an executive order from President Trump directing agencies to undertake a reduction in force and the 'Fork in the Road' program offering federal workers a buyout. Agencies across government have already begun carrying out their layoffs of probationary employees. That was even true at OPM, where the agency fired its probationary staff, cutting them off from systems at 3 p.m. EST, according to Gov Exec. The move appears to have affected 70 employees there. Employees were asked to join a remote meeting where their cameras, mics and chat features were turned off, a now former employee told The Hill. The employees were then sent a link to a presentation from OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell informing them they were fired, the employee said. They lost access to systems within 15 minutes of the 3 p.m. firing. Reports from numerous outlets spelled out plans to fire probationary workers at the Department of Energy, the Department of Education and the Small Business Administration. It’s not clear whether such widespread firings of employees still on probation is legal. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) last week asked congressional leaders to investigate the plans, warning that such mass layoffs would violate laws saying workers can only be fired for cause. 'Mass layoffs of federal employees of the sort that have been reported to be under consideration are presumptively and inherently illegal,' the ACLU wrote. The ACLU argues the law requires reviewing each employee’s performance on a case-by-case basis, while any large-scale firings would have to follow existing law for shrinking the workforce. Despite their probationary status, the employees are still afforded much of the same protections as the broader federal workforce, meaning they must be informed of 'inadequacies' in their performance before being fired. 'While the law allows for the termination of probationary employees for performance or conduct reasons, a mass firing on this scale without any sort of individualized assessment or following of Reduction in Force (RIF) procedures raises serious legal concerns,' the ACLU wrote.

Area 51 veterans getting cancer as DOD denies they were there	NewsNation Anchor Natasha Zouves has much more on the Area 51 veterans fighting for benefits. To watch her full report, tune into 'NewsNation Prime' this Saturday at 7p/6C. (NewsNation) — Dave Crete adds another name to a growing memorial list, now more than 400 in total — men and women he says he served with on a secretive range in the Nevada desert that encompasses Area 51. Crete and his fellow veterans were hand-picked and tasked with top-secret work. They couldn’t even tell their wives what they did every day. 'We couldn’t even tell them the weather,' said Crete. Now, Crete says he is discovering this group has more in common than their years of service those decades ago. Many are developing serious health issues, multiple tumors and, in too many cases, deadly cancers. A group of these veterans are telling NewsNation’s Natasha Zouves that they are unable to get the care and benefits they need because the Department of Defense refuses to acknowledge they were ever stationed in the desert. The DOD records sent to Veterans Affairs lists the same two words between asterisks in black and white: 'DATA MASKED.' 'They keep us classified to protect themselves,' said Crete. Crete says the average age on the memorial list is 65. Backyard barbecue leads to shocking discovery A 2016 reunion barbecue at Crete’s Las Vegas home was supposed to be a chance for Air Force buddies to reminisce after almost three decades apart, serving together in the mid-1980s and early 1990s. It was veteran Randy Groves who suddenly brought up the subject of tumors — a comment that stopped Dave Crete in his tracks. Live: Trump announces reciprocal tariffs 'We're just sitting around drinking beers,' recounted Groves. 'I said, ‘You guys, I got this this lump on my back. Does anybody else got that?’ And Dave goes, ‘Yeah, I had a big one cut out.’' Randy Groves Dave Crete says he had, in fact, developed more than 20 lipomas on his body, ranging from his forehead to his arms to his torso; one of them grew so large that it had to be excised from his back. 'I said, ‘Yeah, I had one of those. I had it removed. It was the size of a grapefruit,’' he recalls. The veterans discovered that out of the eight men sitting around that circle, six of them had developed tumors. The seventh man said, 'I don’t have any, but my son was born with one.' 'It just kind of confirmed it. There was an issue where we were. That's the one common denominator. We were all there,' said Groves. 'There' was the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), an area encompassing the infamous Area 51. This remote site, known for its nuclear testing since the 1950s, both underground and atmospheric, hosted highly classified military operations. The veterans still can’t talk about most of their work on the range, but the one declassified mission they can now disclose involves guarding the F-117 Nighthawk, America’s first stealth bomber. The full scope of their work will likely never be known by the public, but Crete says he takes refuge in a conversation he had with the late Sen. John McCain. 'We never talked about what I had done, but I knew he knew. He was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, so he knew. And he came up to me and he says, ‘Your unit ended the Cold War.’ If you ever wanted a validation what you did was important, that’s just about it,' said Crete. 'It’s a matter of betrayal' Veteran Mike Nemcic had the same tumors as his crewmates at the barbecue, starting around his eye, followed by multiple cancers. 'I was to the point where I felt forsaken. I thought, 'My God has forsaken me,'' said Nemcic. Nemcic endured four bouts with cancer — throat, salivary gland, bladder and colon — starting at just 38 years old. He says his biggest fear was leaving his young family behind without a father or provider. FBI group investigating UFOs: Former Navy pilot There is also a persistent guilt that won’t leave Nemcic: watching the young men he selected for his team go on to develop serious health issues. This includes Bob Morton, who passed away in 2021 from lung cancer. He was 58 years old. 'I would repeat my military service over again without hesitation because I know it was important to our country. The only regret I have is, once I was there, I got to choose who my team was going to be. I selected Bob to be part of my team. And he’s on my mind. If I wouldn’t have done that, he would still be here,' Nemcic said, holding back tears. Nemcic is far from alone. Robert Krouse is a former DOD contractor who worked alongside these vets. He endured two cancers, having 80% of his tongue removed along with his vocal cords and all of his teeth. He can’t speak and can’t eat. Despite this, he says he feels blessed to be alive. 'I have a feeding tube, but I saw friends who passed away or are paralyzed and can’t walk,' said Krouse. 'I’m just blessed I’m functional but not as handy. I feel blessed. I’m much better off than some.' Krouse says he 'assumed it was safe,' as did all of these men and women. Documentation has been unearthed since their service showing what the government knew before deciding to send these Air Force members into the desert. 'It’s like a kick in the gut. It’s just a matter of betrayal,' said Nemcic. 'These folks knew, and they purposefully kept it quiet because it was more beneficial to them not to tell us.' What the government knew: An unearthed 1975 report Before Pomp Braswell became a pro golfer and a Harlem Globetrotter, he served. 'You’re hand-picked, you know, you’re the top of the top,' said Braswell. 'It felt very special, especially at a young age. My mom knew absolutely zero about what I was doing. She knew there was a phone number if she needed to get ahold of me, that’s it.' NJ residents in disbelief over White House answer on drones The Air Force vet is now fighting thyroid cancer. 'Our government knew that the area was contaminated. So knowing that, and they willfully put us there, that’s giving somebody a death sentence,' said Braswell. Pomp Braswell Hundreds of nuclear weapons tests were conducted in the area of the range from the 1950s to the early 1990s. In the 1970s, the government began exploring the idea of building a military installation there to house classified projects. A 1975 Environmental Report from the U.S. Energy Research &amp; Development Administration acknowledges nuclear contamination — depleted uranium, beryllium and plutonium — present before these men and women were sent by the government to the range. But the report adds, 'Discontinuing the work done … would be against the national interest.' Environmental Assessment TTR September 1977 (002) by mhobenexstar on Scribd 'It's one thing to be ignorant or to be naive to not know,' said Dave Crete. 'But they've understood for a long time.' The issue is that now, these veterans are telling NewsNation their claims are being denied by Veterans Affairs, their work so top secret that their records from the DOD are what’s called 'Data Masked,' as if they were never there. Many reported drone sightings were not drones: Ex-Navy pilot 'I feel pushed aside,' said Braswell. 'That our government has chosen to use national security as their excuse to not take care of the people who took care of them.' Crete has decided to go public despite risks he believes could be involved. He now runs The Invisible Enemy, a nonprofit fighting for government transparency, pushing for legislation that would provide medical treatment and compensation for military personnel and their families who were exposed to contamination at the Nevada Test and Training Range. Ripple effects: Sickened families Along with worries about their own health, many of these veterans carry something else: guilt. They fear they have also exposed their families, both through the genetic material they contributed and the contamination brought home on their boots and uniforms. They were routinely covered in dust from the range. ‘We were in the dirt all the time. I can recall the times where when we perspire, that our uniforms would turn kind of a yellowish orange,' said Nemcic. Mike Nemcic Nemcic says he and his fellow veterans would serve for days at a time on the base and then return home, handing their uniforms caked in dirt to their wives to launder. 'We would fly home with this stuff on us,' said Nemcic. 'The part that’s the most difficult is that there was someone who knew, or a group of people who knew that this could happen, and withheld that information — and then allowed us to basically poison our families and ourselves. That hurts. That hurts.' 'Everybody’s wives were having miscarriages,' said Dave Crete. 'And then you get the birth defects.' Dave’s wife, Aylin Crete, suffered three miscarriages. The couple says three of their four children have serious health issues. Their oldest son was born with a brain tumor and was later diagnosed with neurofibromatosis. 'It’s the worst. Those are the most innocent victims,' said Crete through tears. 'They have nothing to do with nothing. I went to work every day. And I did my job. And my kids suffer.' Jack the Ripper’s identity revealed after DNA match, historian says Nemcic believes he’s seen the ripple effects of his service in the health issues of his two children: a son who has a thickening of the walls of the heart and a daughter with breast cancer. Randy Groves, the USAF veteran who initially brought up his tumor at the reunion barbecue, says his wife miscarried twice while they were stationed there. 'Many wives were having miscarriages while there. We had two sons born with health issues. My youngest was born with a heart defect,' said Groves. 'I’m proud of my service to my country, but I feel we should’ve been told. Our country knew.' Randy Groves A mother’s dying act Jennifer Callahan Page says the contamination on the range 'took out my whole family.' Her father and grandfather both served for 10 and 20 years, respectively, and her mother worked on the range for 30 years as a civilian who was tasked with hiring guards for the test site. Page says she watched all three of them die. 'They're all gone. And that's my entire family. So I don't have anybody left,' said Page. She says her father died at 56 years old, with lungs that came back on imaging tests as 'infiltrated with white.' 'All of the stuff they were exposed to, the plutonium and uranium. It was ruining the pockets of their lungs,' said Page. 'Eighty percent of his lungs were filled. My father was my best friend. We talked daily. He called me sometimes several times a day just to say, ‘Hey, I got a great joke.’ And he’d laugh and say, ‘Love you,’ and hang up.' She moved her mother in with her in Las Vegas, with plans to travel the world and spend time with her grandkids. Then, her mother also got sick. 'About a month after she got here, we had to put her into the hospital. They found tumors and said her entire body cavity was filled,' said Page. 'She had Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She had already had a hysterectomy from cervical cancer and a mastectomy from breast cancer. They said there's no hope, and you just need to make your peace and say your goodbyes.' Audio from Titan submersible implosion released by NOAA Page says it was in hospice where she asked her mother how this happened — what occurred on the range? 'I sat at her bedside every day just holding her hand. She just said, ‘I knew I was exposed. And I knew someday I might need to prove where I was at and what I had done and what I was exposed to in order to get treatment.’ So she started collecting documents,' said Page. Her mother gave Page a cache of photographs that she had worked to get declassified before she retired. Page has given the cache to NewsNation so they can be seen by the public for the first time. 'There are pictures at the test site. There's pictures of the control rooms, and the range and what the entire map looks like, pictures of the vent holes and the main craters,' said Page. '[My mom] apologized to me, crying, saying, ‘I’m sorry I ever worked there. I know that’s what's killing me.’' Page recalls there was a sense of pride and fond memories growing up in a home where her family members did such important work. There was also a deep understanding of the secrecy, of the highly classified nature of their day-to-day activities on the range. 'When I was a little kid, I’d say, ‘Gosh, you know, everybody’s talking bout this spaceship,’ and [my grandfather] would go, ‘Oh yeah, we don’t talk about that.’ I learned very quickly not to ask questions,' said Page. Ohio reports first probable human case of bird flu Page describes the situation now, of the DOD continuing to refuse to acknowledge the veterans’ service on the range, as 'maddening.' 'They were there. They have badges. They have IDs that show where they were. How do you not cover that and just go nope, they weren’t there. No, they weren't exposed. That doesn't make it go away. It makes the suffering worse. That's compounding the issue,' said Page. 'The guy who cooked the cheeseburger in the chow hall is covered' The veterans say they are further confused by who the government has chosen to cover. The Department of Energy workers who worked alongside these veterans on the very same base, but often for fewer hours, are currently provided for. Under the 2000 EEOICPA Act signed by President Bill Clinton, DOE workers who had presumptive nuclear exposure at the exact same site were provided medical benefits, but the act does not cover veterans or DOD workers. 'The guy who cooked the cheeseburger in the chow hall for me is covered. If they've had problems, they have lifetime medical, and they've received financial compensation of up to $400,000. The guys that would go out and build the hangers that I had to guard have been compensated, and we can't be,' said Crete. 'The folks that work for the Department of Energy out there have been taken care of. You put us in a place that you knew would harm us. All we're asking for is the benefits that anybody exposed to the same things anywhere else would be entitled to.' NewsNation reached out to the Department of Defense for answers. We asked them about the 1975 Environmental Report and the veterans’ claims that their diseases are linked to contamination on the range. We also asked why DOE workers received coverage and compensation, but these veterans have not. What are Ukraine’s critical minerals and why does Trump want them? The DOD said they would not comment and referred us to the Air Force. The Air Force said, 'We don’t have any information available from that time frame.' NewsNation went to Veterans Affairs. The VA told us there is no presumptive exposure for these veterans who served at the range, and these veterans will need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to prove their illnesses are related to their service. The vets tell us this is difficult, if not impossible, when their data is masked. Their new fight: A path forward Dave Crete and the other veterans say their hope lies in legislation. His nonprofit, The Invisible Enemy, has been working with Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada, hoping to pass a bill that would guarantee medical treatment and financial compensation to all military personnel who were sickened as a result of exposure to radiation and toxins on the NTTR. Moves toward legislation have been slow and have suffered several setbacks. Crete and the other veterans hope that by coming forward with their stories, the public will support their mission. Crete says time is of the essence. 'Yesterday, I added the 446th name to the memorial list. And we suspect that we probably know of about a third of the people that are dead who served up there,' said Crete. 'We did something important. We did good work. We changed things. … We don't deserve being ignored by saying we don't exist.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/area-51-veterans-cancer-dod-denies-they-were-there/	2025-02-13T16:00:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/cache006_8e7588.png?w=666
Egg prices are surging, so why are chicken prices stable?	(NewsNation) — A widespread bird flu outbreak has sent egg prices skyrocketing, but that doesn't mean chicken nuggets are about to get more expensive. That's because chickens that are raised for meat, known as 'broilers,' haven't been hit nearly as hard as egg-laying hens, and there's little overlap between the two. 'These are really two different paths and two different industries,' said David Anderson, a professor and extension economist at Texas A&amp;M University. Americans have surely noticed that difference at the grocery store. Egg prices soared more than 15% in January alone and are now up 53% from last year, according to the latest Labor Department data. Meanwhile, the price of chicken meat has hardly budged, up less than 1% from a year ago. Here's why egg-laying chickens have been more affected and where prices could go from here. What does January’s inflation report mean for me? Why aren't chicken prices surging? 'The simple answer is that it's a numbers game,' said Tom Super with the National Chicken Council, which represents the country's chicken producers. Of the more than 147 million birds affected by the outbreak over the past three years, less than 9% have been broilers, roughly 13 million, according to data from the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Those 13 million broiler chickens represent just .0005% of broiler production over the same period, Super said. In other words: Chicken prices have remained stable because broiler producers have had an easier time keeping up with demand. Egg-laying chickens have fared much worse, accounting for more than 75% of all the birds affected by the outbreak between Feb. 8, 2022, and Jan. 29, 2025. Costco limits egg purchases: What are other stores doing? Why have egg-laying chickens been hit harder? Broiler chickens aren't immune to bird flu, but their shorter life cycle could leave flocks less susceptible to major outbreaks. Broilers are typically slaughtered within two months, whereas egg-layers take longer to mature and only start producing after four to five months. Once those hens start laying eggs, the cycle can last over a year. Less time on the farm means broilers have less of an opportunity to be exposed to the virus. 'I tend to think that's a pretty good explanation,' Anderson said. 'I don't know that anybody knows for sure.' The shorter life cycle also means that when a broiler flock is lost, it can be replaced faster. Is raising chickens the best way to combat egg prices? Geography matters, too. Broilers are primarily produced in the Southeast, which hasn't been as affected by the recent outbreak compared to major egg-producing states like Iowa and Ohio. Super said different housing styles could also be a factor. When a test comes back positive for bird flu, the whole flock gets culled to help prevent the spread of the virus, and egg-laying chickens are typically housed in larger flocks. For commercial operations, egg-laying barns can contain hundreds of thousands of chickens on multiple layers, whereas broiler houses, on average, hold about 25,000 birds on one level, Super said. Where will prices go from here? The bad news for consumers is that egg prices are expected to rise by 20% in 2025, according to the USDA. On the other hand, Anderson said the volatility of the egg market means prices could drop quickly if the bird flu outbreak subsides. In fact, that's exactly what happened a couple of years ago. In Jan. 2023, U.S. consumers were paying an average of $4.82 for a dozen eggs, but just six months later, in June, the average price had fallen to $2.22 per dozen. 'For lower prices, all we need is some time and the disease to quit happening,' Anderson said. In the meantime, businesses are taking steps to combat 'egg-flation.' Budget-friendly chain Waffle House has added a $0.50 per egg surcharge to all of its menus. Grocers like Costco and Trader Joe’s have also taken action, limiting the number of cartons customers can buy. As for chicken meat, the USDA predicts wholesale poultry prices will decrease by about 1% this year.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/egg-prices-chicken-prices/	2025-02-13T14:59:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-480207837-e1723408795963.jpg?w=800
How ICE tracks down criminal migrants	(NewsNation) — More than 1.4 million migrants who have previously been ordered to leave the country are among those being targeted for apprehension by federal immigration officials as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation mission. As federal officials seek to ramp arrests, increased collaboration between Immigration Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement agencies, including criminal investigators within the Internal Revenue Service, is changing how migrants with criminal backgrounds are found and taken into federal custody. Border czar Tom Homan in NYC to meet with Mayor Eric Adams Former Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Victor Avila said devoting more bodies to the nationwide search moves agencies closer to achieving higher levels of national security. 'It’s becoming a well-oiled machine,' he told NewsNation. What areas are ICE targeting? The biggest hotbeds for the 1.46 million targeted migrants include Miami (156,559), Los Angeles (143,672) and New York (134,645), according to data obtained exclusively by NewsNation from the Department of Homeland Security. Atlanta was the only other region where more than 100,000 migrants who had been previously ordered to leave the U.S. were found to be living. Although federal agencies know where these migrants are located, making arrests requires complicated investigations by ICE’s 25 regional field offices. Avila told NewsNation that the operations are 'methodical' and that contrary to public opinion, agents are not looking to apprehend innocent people, which has been among the complaints lodged by officials in sanctuary cities and within migrant advocacy groups. 'They’re not randomly looking (and saying), ‘You look Hispanic – I’m going to come get you,’' the former HSI special agent said. How ICE makes arrests The agency accesses numerous databases, including commercial databases, motor vehicle and driver’s records as well as utility records to locate 'removable non-citizens,' according to ICE's website. Each of ICE’s field offices works from informational packets that are generated by officers working within that agency’s 'criminal alien program.' Agents assigned to that team use databases and information from state or local law enforcement and court dockets to compile target lists for that region. Data is also collected by statewide offices of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which provide information for informational packets. The order in which migrants are sought after can be determined by a variety of factors, including the age of a migrant’s case, that person’s criminal history or the type of crimes that particular office may be targeting, such as sex offenses or other violent crimes. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents knock on the door of a residence during a multiagency targeted enforcement operation in Chicago on Jan. 26. (Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Data compiled by the Migration Policy Institute shows that the majority of migrant arrests are custodial, meaning that ICE takes migrants who were already in the pipeline after being arrested or identified by state or local law enforcement. In 2024, custodial cases resulted in the majority of the 113,431 arrests that were made by ICE, the agency’s annual report states. Jury hands Megan Boswell life sentence after guilty verdict Comparatively, 33,243 arrests fell into the 'at-large' category, meaning that migrants were located while living in communities around the country. That job falls to local ICE agents who are now partnering with organizations such as the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and other agencies who are tasked with taking criminal migrants into custody. 'This is a good thing,' Avila said of the collaboration. 'It reminds everyone in federal law enforcement that you all actually play on the same team. You may happen to have different insignias and different letters in front of your names, but we’re all on the same team combating the same thing.' Surveillance operations can often last days and sometimes weeks, John Fabbricatore, the former director of ICE’s Denver Field Office, told NewsNation. He said agents use residential and automobile information to help agents locate targeted migrants. How ICE works in ‘sanctuary cities’ Because sanctuary cities like Chicago, Denver, New York and Los Angeles prohibit their police departments from cooperating with immigration enforcement, federal agents must often work on their own to make arrests. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson touted the creation of the Reparations Task Force to develop a Black Reparations Agenda at a city ceremony to raise the Juneteenth flag on June 17, 2024. Some lawmakers working within sanctuary cities fear that resistance to working with ICE can lead to bigger problems. 'It’s outrageous that we allow and give cover to those kind of individuals,' Chicago Alderperson Raymond Lopez told NewsNation. Lopez was one of two Chicago alderpersons who tried to change the city's sanctuary city law, which was soundly defeated by the city council. He said that a city’s sanctuary laws also allow communities to protect those ICE is searching for, making tracking migrants on the dockets even more difficult. What does January’s inflation report mean for me? President Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has repeatedly said that although migrant criminals are the target of the mass deportation efforts, other immigrants who entered the country illegally may be swept up if they are found in the company of those being sought. Once Trump took office, restrictions on sensitive locations such as schools, houses of worship and hospitals were lifted, giving federal agents more room to work. Opponents of the ICE raids maintain that the agent’s mere presence in local communities has struck fear among local residents. 'What this administration is attempting to do is to get us to surrender our humanity,' Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told reporters after Homan visited the city when ICE conducted raids. 'We're not going to do that in Chicago.' Despite the marching orders ICE receives, Fabbricatore argued there are still rules that need to be followed. 'It’s all about safety and about being humane. We’re not stacking these people in warehouses,' he told NewsNation, adding, 'The American public doesn’t understand that. They think you arrest an illegal alien, and you’re just giving them the boot across the border. It doesn’t happen that way.'

Trump meeting with India PM Modi, expected to talk tariffs	(NewsNation) — India Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting with Donald Trump at the White House on the same day the president signed a memorandum proposing reciprocal tariffs. Modi and Trump have had a good relationship and have been allies to a certain extent. However, India is a country that the United States operates at a trade deficit with. That issue, as well as tariffs, could come up during their discussions Thursday. Before speaking with Trump, Modi met separately with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a Trump administration official, and national security adviser Mike Waltz. Trump’s buyout offer accepted by about 77,000 federal workers Trump has already imposed tariffs on China and threatened them against Canada and Mexico. On Monday, he expanded tariffs on steel and aluminum initially imposed during his first term. The president has repeatedly dubbed India a 'tariff king.' In response, New Delhi has shown a willingness to buy more American oil while lowering its own tariffs on U.S. goods, including on some Harley-Davidson motorcycles, from 50% to 40%. India also dropped retaliatory tariffs on United States almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils and walnuts in 2023. According to the Associated Press, the Indo-U.S. goods and services trade totaled around $190.1 billion in 2023. U.S. exports to India were worth nearly $70 billion and imports $120 billion.

Live: Trump announces reciprocal tariffs	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is planning to announce new tariffs Thursday, according to a post on Truth Social. The president did not specify what he meant by reciprocal tariffs. He has already made tariffs a major element of his economic policy despite warnings from economists that tariffs will increase inflation and harm American consumers. Trump has already levied a 10% tariff on China and put a 25% tariff on aluminum and steel, with some exemptions for trading partners. China, in response, put tariffs on an array of American goods, with impacts disproportionately targeted toward areas that voted for Trump in the election. What does January’s inflation report mean for me? He also proposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico but paused both tariffs after the countries agreed to take action toward controlling the borders. The pause is set to end in March, raising the possibility the tariffs will go into effect then. Canada has already threatened to take action in response to tariffs, with sellers previously pulling American alcohol from shelves and catalogs in response to the initial announcement. While Trump has described tariffs as a tax on foreign companies, the tariffs are paid by the importing company and economists say the cost is usually passed on to the consumer. Ohio reports first probable human case of bird flu The move is likely to raise the price of goods when Americans are already struggling. Trump has admitted there will be economic pain associated with the policies. Already inflation, which had been trending downward, has increased since Trump took office.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-announce-reciprocal-tariffs/	2025-02-13T09:37:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2196996771_734cd3.jpg?w=900
Senate panel advances nomination of Kash Patel, Trump's pick to l...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines on Thursday to advance the nomination of Kash Patel, Donald Trump's pick for FBI director, pushing past Democratic concerns that he would operate as a loyalist for the president and target perceived adversaries of the White House. The committee voted 12-10 to send the nomination to the Republican-controlled Senate for full consideration. It was not immediately clear when the final confirmation vote will occur, but so far even nominees once seen as having uncertain prospects — including new Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence — have been able to marshal sufficient support from Republicans eager to fall in line with Trump's agenda. Patel has raised alarm for his lack of management experience compared to other FBI directors and because of a vast catalog of incendiary past statements, which include calling investigators who scrutinized Trump 'government gangsters' and describing at least some defendants charged in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S Capitol as 'political prisoners.' At his confirmation hearing last month, Patel said Democrats were taking some of his comments out of context or misunderstanding the broader point that he was trying to make, such as when he proposed shutting down the FBI headquarters in Washington and turning it into a museum for the so-called 'deep state.' And Patel denied the idea that a list in his book of government officials, who he said were part of a 'deep state,' amounted to an 'enemies list,' calling that a 'total mischaracterization.' Patel, who was selected by Trump in November to replace Christopher Wray as FBI director, would inherit an agency riven by turmoil amid the recent forced departures of a group of senior executives and by a highly unusual Justice Department demand for the names of all agents who participated in investigations related to Jan. 6. A letter this week from Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the committee, cited undisclosed sources in saying that Patel was covertly involved in that process despite telling the panel at his confirmation hearing that he was unaware of any plans to fire agents. A Patel spokeswoman called the allegations 'gossip' aimed at pushing what she said was a 'false narrative.' Democrats portrayed Patel as a dangerous and inexperienced loyalist who would abuse the FBI's law enforcement powers at a time when the country is facing an escalated threat including from China and international terrorism. 'This is a guy whose judgment is beyond questionable. It’s appallingly bad,' said Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. He added: 'Mark my words: this Patel guy will come back to haunt you.' Durbin told his colleagues 'we are inviting a political disaster if we put Kash Patel into this job.' Addressing Republicans on the committee, Durbin said, 'I know you want to vote for all these nominations. I know none of you want a call from Elon Musk reminding you what he might do to somebody who votes the wrong way, but this really gets down to the heart of the future of an agency that is critical to the security of this nation.' Republicans, by contrast, praised Patel as the right person for the job, insisting he was needed to fix an FBI that they claim has been tainted by bias amid criminal investigations into Trump. 'The American people are sick and tired of two tiers of access, tiers of treatment and two tiers of justice. And during the Biden years, this was writ large in the acts of the DOJ and the FBI,' said GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. GOP Sen. Ashley Moody of Florida said that Patel 'might not have served in the upper echelons of the FBI, but aren’t we asking this agency to set a new course? Don’t we want a nontraditional candidate at this moment in time, with extensive federal experience?' A former Justice Department prosecutor, Patel attracted Trump's attention during his first term when, as a staffer on the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee, he helped author a memo with pointed criticism of the FBI's investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Patel later joined Trump's administration, both as a counterterrorism official at the National Security Council and as chief of staff to the Defense Department.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-senate-panel-advances-nomination-of-kash-patel-trumps-pick-to-lead-the-fbi/	2025-02-13T08:39:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67ae20ca032186.84028760.jpeg?w=900
Linda McMahon faces confirmation hearing before Senate committee	(NewsNation) — Linda McMahon will go in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions to seek approval to lead the Department of Education — which President Donald Trump has said he wants to abolish. Closing the Department of Education is an issue Trump campaigned on in the 2024 election, and he has said it was infiltrated by 'radicals, zealots and Marxists.' 'I told Linda, ‘Linda, I hope you do a great job and put yourself out of a job,’' Trump previously said, adding he would like to end the department through executive order, NewsNation partner The Hill writes. Trump’s buyout offer accepted by about 77,000 federal workers The Department of Education sends billions of dollars a year to schools, manages a $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio and enforces civil rights in education. It would also require an act of Congress to shut down the department. In their statements introducing McMahon, Republican Senators Tim Scott and Katie Britt criticized the department. 'For far too long, the department of education has catered to far left bureaucrats at the expense of moms and dads,' Britt said. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Andy Kim said in a letter to McMahon this week that she'll be asked if she supports Trump's plans, and what she will do to carry them out, The Associated Press reported. According to the AP, this letter asks McMahon to commit to preserving the department’s student loan operations and civil rights office, among other programs. It also mentions her lack of experience in the education sphere. Formerly the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon is also likely to face questions over a lawsuit stating that she and her husband, Vince, ignored rampant abuse of so-called 'ring boys' by ringside announcer Melvin Phillips Jr. in the 1980s and 1990s. The alleged assaults were sexual in nature, the suit alleges. McMahon previously was the head of the Small Business Administration during Trump's first term.

(NewsNation) — Marc Fogel's attorney Martin De Luca said he is doing 'extremely well' after being released Tuesday from Russia but that it is 'way too early' to discuss potential legal action. 'The focus is on the opportunity this is creating,' De Luca said. 'Mark Fogel is now part of history.' De Luca said Fogel's return has set the stage for opening U.S.-Russia peace negotiations over Ukraine. Fogel, an American teacher, was arrested in 2021 for bringing medical marijuana into Russia and sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2022.

Watch live: House panel convenes hearing on USAID amid DOGE overh...	The House Foreign Affairs Committee is holding a hearing Thursday morning looking into what GOP leadership has called the 'betrayal' of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The panel comes as President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by billionaire Elon Musk, has set its sights on overhauling the federal agency amid its crackdown of government spending. The administration's perceived efforts to dismantle USAID have sparked criticism across the board, with a group of House Democrats earlier this week unveiling legislation to stop the move. Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, seemingly gave a thumbs up to placing USAID under the State Department's purview, after Secretary of State Marco Rubio was named the acting leader. 'After receiving formal consultation about the State Department’s potential reorganization of USAID, I’m excited to work with President Trump and Secretary Rubio to fix our broken foreign assistance system,' he wrote last week in a statement. William Steiger, former chief of staff at USAID under Trump's first term, is among the witness list. Thursday's hearing is scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m. EST. Watch the live video above.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/watch-live-house-panel-convenes-hearing-on-usaid-amid-doge-overhaul/	2025-02-13T06:06:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25038664521392-e1739447564581.jpg?w=900
Leavitt defends Trump's federal worker buyout program	(NewsNation) — White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the Trump administration’s federal buyout program Thursday and said more than 77,000 federal workers have accepted an offer that will save taxpayers money. 'We are saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars with this buyout,' Leavitt told NewsNation's 'Morning in America' on Thursday. 'We are saving taxpayers money at the end of the day. This is going to make our government more efficient.' The deferred resignation offer deadline was reached at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday, after U.S. District Court Judge George O’Toole declined to further pause a federal government buyout program, enabling the government to forge ahead with its 'Fork in the Road' program. The buyout offer gives those who choose to resign eight months of pay and benefits. IRS workers involved in 2025 tax season can’t take buyout until after the taxpayer filing deadline Leavitt previously called the program the 'first of many legal wins' for President Donald Trump. Time for US government to run as a business: Leavitt on DOGE Trump will reveal some of the Department of Government Efficiency's findings in a Thursday news conference, Leavitt said. 'This is long overdue. It's about time that our federal government runs like a business, just like every other small business and large business in our country has to look at money in, money out. It's a common-sense solution,' she said. The remarks come amid DOGE's launch of 'a war on waste' and plans to reshape the federal government. Trump claimed Tuesday that DOGE has uncovered tens of billions of dollars in fraud and abuse, blaming bad government contracts. Leavitt highlighted federal agencies likely to be eradicated, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of Education, after DOGE has completed its investigations. Trump administration working to drive down inflation Leavitt also said the Trump administration is working to put more money in Americans' pockets and drive down prices, adding that Trump has already taken significant steps to do so. What does January’s inflation report mean for me? 'Number one, he signed an executive order to launch a massive deregulatory campaign. We know more regulation leads to higher inflation,' she said. 'The president is also committed to historic tax cuts, which will ultimately put more money back into the pockets of the American people.' Leavitt's remarks follow new data from the Labor Department, which shows the consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago. It is the fourth consecutive increase in the annual inflation rate since September, when it fell to 2.4%. Leavitt said Thursday’s inflation report was 'not a surprise' and is proof the 'Biden administration left us with a mess.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/leavitt-defends-trumps-federal-worker-buyout/	2025-02-13T05:19:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/snapshot-2025-02-13T071116.662.jpg?w=884
Senate to hold final vote on RFK Jr. to lead HHS	(NewsNation) — The Senate will vote Thursday on whether to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's pick for Health and Human Services secretary. Kennedy's nomination was advanced earlier this month in a party-line vote. During a previous hearing, lawmakers pressed him on his past comments about vaccines. A former 2024 independent presidential candidate who dropped out and endorsed Trump, Kennedy has sparked concerns with his record of spreading misinformation regarding vaccines, including from Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Kennedy can only afford to lose three Republican votes in the Senate. Trump’s buyout offer accepted by about 75,000 federal workers In previous hearings, Kennedy touted the 'Make America Healthy Again' movement and decried the United States’ rising rates of diseases such as obesity, addiction and diabetes. If confirmed, Kennedy will control a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees food and hospital inspections, hundreds of health clinics, vaccine recommendations and health insurance for roughly half the country.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/rfk-jr-confirmation-final-senate-vote/	2025-02-13T04:52:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25030570461551_4dde42.jpg?w=900
Pope Francis encourages South Texas nun to help the unfortunate	SAN JUAN, Texas (Border Report) -- Fresh off her trip to the Vatican, Sister Norma Pimentel says she is heartened by a recent letter from Pope Francis condemning the deportation of immigrants. 2 top ICE officials reassigned amid White House’s frustrations over immigration arrests In his letter to U.S. bishops, the pope called the mass deportations a 'major crisis that is taking place in the United States.' President Donald Trump has promised his administration will deport millions of immigrants who he says have no right to remain in the country. 'The rightly formed conscience cannot fail to make a critical judgment and express its disagreement with any measure that tacitly or explicitly identifies the illegal status of some migrants with criminality,' the pope wrote. Pope Francis did say countries have a right 'to defend itself and keep communities safe from those who have committed violent or serious crimes while in the country or prior to arrival.' But he added 'the act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness.' Pimentel, who is executive director of Catholic Charities Rio Grande Valley, told Border Report that she recently traveled to the Vatican and was among a group who met with the pope. She said he encouraged them to help the unfortunate. Gangs not only ones preying on migrant women, boys 'We cannot criminalize, as our Holy Father says, an immigrant for coming to our country fearing for the lives of their children and wanting to be in a space where they're safe. You know that’s not a crime,' Pimentel told Border Report on Wednesday from her offices in San Juan, Texas. 'We should be able to create pathways where people can actually be welcome.' Migrants wait to enter the Catholic Charities Humanitarian Respite Center near the U.S.-Mexico border in McAllen, Texas, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2022. (Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Pimentel has run the Humanitarian Respite Center in downtown McAllen for over a decade. It is a migrant shelter where over half a million immigrants have gone for food, shelter, toiletries and travel help after being legally released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 10th anniversary of Humanitarian Respite Center coincides with new asylum rules 'Every single person that we help at the Respite Center has been processed by Border Patrol actually has permission to be in the United States. They have a document that gives them permission temporarily, but until they can resolve their legal status. And so people that we receive are actually those that are in the system,' she said. However, she says lately there have been days when the Border Patrol doesn't send anybody. 'If nobody's brought to us, our numbers are basically almost zero,' she said. 'We do have one, three families that maybe one day arrive, and the next day nobody, and then the next day maybe one family. So it's very uncertain right now as to who we're receiving, you know, and and how many.' She says the Rio Grande Valley border community also is fearful of deportations and raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. She also told Border Report an immigrant woman was arrested as she tried to pick up her child from school on this week in the Rio Grande Valley. She said on Wednesday she was called by a local priest who said his parishioner was arrested while picking her child up from school. 'I just got a call from a priest from here, from the Valley, and he said, ‘Norma, help me. There's a family from our parish that went to pick up her child at the elementary school, and she was arrested,'' Pimentel told Border Report. Pimentel would not specify the priest or where this happened but she said she wants to help community leaders to prepare legal documents to pass on custody of children in the cases of parents being deported from the South Texas border. Pimentel said the child's mother asked that her child be handed over to school staff but was told they couldn't because they didn't have a legal documents to authorize that. 'So, I said, 'Father, I'm going to try to see what I can do to help your families.' If there's anyone that needs some kind of a legal document to give somebody, you know, we have to be there for our families.' Pimentel was heading to New York on Wednesday to participate in a meeting on immigration.

Stars flee Kennedy Center groups after Trump seizes chair	President Donald Trump’s ascension to chair of the Kennedy Center on Wednesday led to multiple departures from the Washington, D.C., institution. Trump last week announced he was replacing several members of the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees and would name himself chair. On Wednesday, the new board elected Trump as chair of the board. At approximately the same time that Trump announced his chairmanship, musician Ben Folds said he would resign as artistic adviser to the National Symphony Orchestra, 'given developments at the Kennedy Center.' 'It’s been a wonderful 8 years' the former Ben Folds Five singer wrote on Instagram on Wednesday, saying he and the Kennedy Center’s staff encouraged 'thousands of fresh new audiences to appreciate symphonic music.' Trump made millions on meme coin, over 800K people lost money: Report The award-winning opera singer and actress Renée Fleming said she would depart from her role as artistic adviser at large to the Kennedy Center. She praised David Rubenstein, whom Trump replaced as chair, saying his leadership is 'just one of the many ways he has contributed to America’s cultural and historic heritage. He is the greatest patriot I know.' Fleming also praised Deborah Rutter, whom the board fired Wednesday as president of the Kennedy Center, saying she 'has been a tireless, creative leader, successfully expanding our National Center for the Arts in visionary ways.' 'They have both been an inspiration to me; and out of respect, I think it right to depart as well,' Fleming continued. 'I’ve treasured the bi-partisan support for this institution as a beacon of America at our best. I hope the Kennedy Center continues to flourish and serve the passionate and diverse audience in our nation’s capital and across the country.' Shonda Rhimes, the renowned television writer and producer, also reportedly resigned from the board after serving as the Kennedy Center’s treasurer. Ted Nugent praises Trump’s deportations: ‘This is war’ 'Please be advised that as of today, Shonda Rhimes has resigned from the board of the Kennedy Center,' a spokesperson for Rhimes told Deadline. The Hill has reached out to her representation for comment. Trump said Wednesday it is a 'Great Honor' to serve as chair of the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees, saying on social media, 'We will make The Kennedy Center a very special and exciting place!' A White House official told The Hill the president participated in the board meeting on Wednesday to elect him. The Kennedy Center confirmed Trump as its board chair in a Wednesday news release, saying that and other leadership changes were 'effectively immediately.' 'The Board also terminated Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter’s contract and announced Richard Grenell as interim Kennedy Center President,' it said in its statement. Some of the board’s new members include 'God Bless the USA' singer and ardent Trump supporter Lee Greenwood, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, second lady Usha Vance and senior adviser Dan Scavino, among others. —Judy Kurtz contributed	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/stars-flee-kennedy-center-trump-chair/	2025-02-13T03:45:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/MixCollage-12-Feb-2025-07-29-PM-8152.jpg?w=900
Trump’s buyout offer accepted by about 75,000 federal workers	(NewsNation) — Approximately 75,000 federal employees have accepted a 'deferred resignation' offer spearheaded by the Trump administration as it looks to reduce the federal workforce. The Office of Personnel Management confirmed the final buyout tally to NewsNation after the offer's deadline was reached at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday. The tally, which includes less than 4% of the federal workforce, is short of the 5 to 10% goal laid out by the White House. McLaurine Pinover, a spokesperson for the OPM, told NewsNation they're pleased the court rejected the effort to strike down the program. 'There is no longer any doubt: the Deferred Resignation Program was both legal and a valuable option for federal employees. This program was carefully designed, thoroughly vetted, and provides generous benefits so federal workers can plan for their futures,' Pinover said. While White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt calls this the 'first of many legal wins' for Trump, another group of unions looking to stall the buyout effort filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C. late Wednesday. Judge clears way for federal worker buyouts On Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge George O’Toole declined to further pause a federal government buyout program, enabling the government to forge ahead with its 'Fork in the Road' program. O'Toole had extended the deadline for federal employees to decide whether to accept the buyout, which gives employees eight months of pay and benefits if they resign. Attorney general: US sues New York officials over immigration enforcement In his ruling, O’Toole found unions that had sued over the directive did not have standing. The decision allows the Trump administration to enforce the deadline, which was originally planned for Feb. 6. That deadline was extended as O’Toole weighed a bid by unions to temporarily block the OPM from carrying out the offer entirely. Union workers cautioned against buyout Unions had warned employees against taking the deal and Democrats warned the government would fail to uphold its commitment. They cautioned that with government funding set to expire in March, their pay and benefits could be at risk. The move has sparked protests in Washington and across the nation. The buyout is part of President Donald Trump’s aim to reduce the federal workforce and aligns with plans to cut staffing for U.S. aid projects worldwide as part of the administration’s efforts to dismantle USAID.

Hamas says it will release more Israeli hostages as planned	CAIRO (AP) — Hamas said Thursday it would release the next group of Israeli hostages as planned, apparently resolving a major dispute that threatened the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The militant group said Egyptian and Qatari mediators have affirmed that they will work to 'remove all hurdles,' and that it would implement the ceasefire deal. The statement indicated three more Israeli hostages would be freed Saturday. There was no immediate comment from Israel after Hamas’ announcement. A look at the hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, by the numbers Hamas' move would allow the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip to continue for now, but its future remains in doubt. Hamas had threatened to delay the next release of Israeli hostages, accusing Israel of failing to meet its obligations to allow in tents and shelters, among other alleged violations of the truce. Israel, with the support of U.S. President Donald Trump, had threatened to renew its offensive if hostages were not freed. Hamas said its delegation held talks in Cairo with Egyptian officials and was in contact with Qatar’s prime minister about increasing the entry of shelters, medical supplies, fuel and heavy equipment for clearing rubble into Gaza. Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV, which is close to the country’s security services, reported that Egypt and Qatar had succeeded in resolving the dispute. The two Arab countries have served as key mediators with Hamas and helped broker the ceasefire, which took effect in January, 15 months into the war.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-hamas-says-it-will-release-hostages-as-planned-apparently-resolving-ceasefire-dispute/	2025-02-13T02:35:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67adca0df21324.78523278.jpeg?w=900
