Norfolk Southern tops third-quarter expectations with insurance b...	Norfolk Southern's streamlined operations delivered strong earnings last quarter, even excluding boosts from insurance payouts related to the disastrous derailment in East Palestine and the sale of two rail lines. The Atlanta company recorded a $287 million gain on the sale of rail lines in Virginia and North Carolina, and for the second quarter in a row it collected more insurance payments than it paid out for last year's derailment near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. Norfolk Southern earned $1.1 billion, or $4.85 per share in the quarter, up significantly from a year ago, when profits were hurt by mounting costs related to the derailment. Excluding one-time items, the railroad earned $737 million, or $3.25 per share, beating the $3.15 forecast by analysts surveyed by FactSet Research. Thousands of migrants heading for southern border Before the opening bell Tuesday, shares of Norfolk Southern Corp. rose 3%. New CEO Mark George, who took over last month, isn't expected to implement any strategic changes because he helped craft the plan a couple years ago that calls for keeping more employees on hand during a downturn, so the railroad can respond better when the economy recovers. 'It’s really about building out consistent, safe, reliable service with a network that’s resilient and can bounce back from events,' like it did when Norfolk Southern got all its major lines running again within 72 hours after Hurricane Helene hit, said George, who was promoted from Chief Financial Officer after Alan Shaw was fired for an inappropriate relationship with an employee. Norfolk Southern has been in the spotlight ever since the February 2023 derailment in East Palestine triggered a national focus on railroad safety. Earlier this year, the railroad also had to fend off a takeover bid from investment firm Ancora Holdings. The investor ultimately won only three seats, insufficient to make the sweeping changes it sought. The railroad redoubled its efforts to lower costs in the spring, hiring Chief Operating Officer John Orr to help reduce the number of times railcars get switched and enable Norfolk Southern to operate fewer, longer trains. It’s operating expenses, when adjusted to remove costs related to the Ohio derailment and other one-time items, fell 6% to $1.93 billion. Norfolk Southern is working to improve its profit margin enough to catch up with the other major freight railroads. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

And I don’t have a whole lot of patience for lack of execution or acceptance of mediocrity,' George said. The railroad’s revenue of $3.05 billion was just below analyst expectation for $3.09 billion. Norfolk Southern is one of the nation's largest railroads, with tracks crisscrossing the Eastern United States.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/ap-railroad-norfolk-southern-tops-third-quarter-forecasts-with-added-boost-from-insurance-rail-sales/	2024-10-22T05:28:33-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67179b33c9c796.92187766.jpeg?w=900
What is pink cocaine? Autopsy finds drug in Liam Payne's body	SALT LAKE CITY (KTVX/KUCW) — A partial autopsy conducted on former One Direction singer Liam Payne found multiple substances in his system when he fell to his death from the third-floor balcony of a hotel room in Argentina last week, according to a new report from ABC News. Among them were cocaine, benzodiazepine, crack and a fourth drug known as 'pink cocaine.' Fans gather for Liam Payne memorial at Centennial Park in Nashville What is pink cocaine? Despite its name, pink cocaine does not actually have any cocaine in it. The National Capital Poison Center describes the drug as a powdered cocktail of drugs, typically including ecstasy, ketamine, caffeine and a psychedelic drug known as 2-CB. The drug can also be referred to as Tusi -- a phonetic translation of '2C' -- and often comes in the form of a vibrant pink powder. The color reportedly comes from the addition of colored dye and sometimes from strawberry flavoring. The National Capital Poison Center said pink cocaine is not as addictive as other drugs such as opioids or fentanyl but can have some potential for addiction. Poison Control said pink cocaine is often used in a party or club setting and can cause a variety of effects including hallucinations, anxiety, elevated body temperature, increased heart rate and nausea, among other side effects. 'Physical and sexual assaults, as well as traumatic injuries, have occurred when people are impaired by this type of drug,' the NCPC warns. 'It is also important to know that pink cocaine may be contaminated with drugs beyond those mentioned here, so unanticipated effects can occur depending on what is in the mixture.' Liam Payne's death Moments before Liam Payne's death, hotel staff called the police in Buenos Aires reporting an 'aggressive man' who was believed to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The hotel manager could be heard on a 911 call obtained by the Associated Press saying there was a guest 'destroying the entire room.' Liam Payne’s 1D bandmates, Cheryl, Simon Cowell and more mourn singer Responding officers arrived just as Payne had 'thrown himself' from the balcony of his room, according to a spokesperson for the Security Ministry of Buenos Aires municipality. Authorities said Payne suffered 'very serious injuries' in the fall and there was no possibility of resuscitation. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Liam Payne’s hotel called for ‘urgent’ assistance before his death A preliminary autopsy report had concluded Payne died of 'multiple traumas' as well as 'internal and external bleeding' caused by the fall. Buenos Aires police reported finding Payne's hotel room in 'complete disarray' with several drugs scattered about. Sources told ABC News that police also found an improvised aluminum pipe to ingest drugs. ABC News, The Associated Press, and Nexstar Media contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/liam-payne-pink-cocaine-autopsy/	2024-10-21T13:43:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1240550919-e1729530378461.jpg?w=900
Thousands of migrants heading for southern border	(NewsNation) — A large caravan of migrants is heading from southern Mexico toward the United States' southern border. These thousands of people are part of a group called 'God Guides Us,' with members from multiple nationalities, including Venezuelan, Colombian, Haitian, Afghani and Nepalese migrants who desire to enter the United States. The hope for many is to cross the border before former President Donald Trump could be elected back to the White House, where he has promised mass deportation of those who have entered the country illegally. Trump overtakes Harris for first time in Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast Caravans such as 'God Guides Us' rarely make it to the southern border as a group. Some splinter off in and around Mexico City. In some cases, they can end up with the cartel and then come into the United States in smaller groups. GOP Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security, provided an exclusive statement to NewsNation on this latest wave of migrants attempting to enter the U.S. 'Would-be border crossers know that their best chance to be released into American communities is under the open border policies of Joe Biden and his border czar Vice President (Kamala) Harris,' Green said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/thousands-migrants-southern-border/	2024-10-21T12:29:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/immigration-data_bernal_AssociatedPress_f9b684.jpg?w=900
Stock gains will be lower over the next decade: Goldman Sachs	(NewsNation) — The stock market has been booming over the past decade but returns could be much lower in the years ahead, according to a new forecast. The S&amp;P 500 — the broad market index — is expected to produce an annualized nominal return of just 3% over the next decade, Goldman Sachs' equity strategy team said in an analysis reviewed by CNBC. If that happens, it would be a significant decrease from the 13% annual return the last decade, which was higher than the long-term average of 11%. With interest rates falling where should I keep my savings? 'Investors should be prepared for equity returns during the next decade that are toward the lower end of their typical performance distribution,' the team wrote in a note dated Oct. 18, per Bloomberg. One of the main reasons for the lower forecast? High market concentration. The so-called 'Magnificent Seven' stocks — companies like Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia — have driven much of the recent returns and it's 'extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time,' the strategy paper noted. Is the stock market in an AI bubble? In other words, if a few stocks dip it could drag down the overall stock market. The Magnificent Seven generated nearly 60% of the S&amp;P 500 Index’s return year to date through June, according to a report from investment firm Boston Partners. In 2023, that figure was 62%. In fact, the recent rise in stock market concentration has been the steepest in 60 years and is now at a multi-decade high, J.P. Morgan wrote in a report earlier this year. U.S. equities have surged over the past decade and the S&amp;P 500 is on track to outperform the rest of the world in eight of the last 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&amp;P 500 has notched 47 record highs so far in 2024 and could go higher after the election as has historically been the case, Bloomberg said. JPMorgan Chase, the world's biggest bank, has also warned investors to brace for lower returns over the next decade. The analyst team there is slightly more optimistic, forecasting a 5.7% average annual return for the S&amp;P 500 over the next ten years in a report last month.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/stock-lower-next-decade-goldman-sachs/	2024-10-21T10:49:31-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66fdb96ae67819.73820626.jpeg?w=900
Blue wall blitz: Harris courts undecided voters with Republican h...	MALVERN, Pa. (NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris is barnstorming three must-win states on Monday, trying to court undecided voters, especially suburban women. And she’s bringing along what her campaign hopes is her secret weapon: former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney. With the campaign heading into its final two weeks, Harris is trying to woo disaffected Republicans, specifically those who voted against former President Donald Trump and for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Harris and Cheney will blitz through suburban counties Haley won prior to dropping out of the Republican presidential primary contest: Chester County, Pennsylvania; Oakland County, Michigan; and Waukesha County, Wisconsin. You can watch the event in Oakland County, Michigan live here at 4:10p/3:10C. GOP-leaning polls trigger questions about accuracy Harris hopes to capitalize on what her team says are Trump’s 'unprecedented weakness' among women and white, college-educated voters. In Chester County, for instance, more than 9,000 people voted for Haley in the Republican primary after she had dropped out of the race. Cheney, who has been campaigning with Harris under the slogan 'country over party,' will be joined by longtime Republican strategist Sarah Longwell and conservative radio host Charlie Sykes. Despite the Harris campaign's efforts, Trump and Haley officials are discussing the two appearing together in the final stretch of the election, a source familiar with the matter confirms to NewsNation. During a 'Fox and Friends' interview Friday, Trump noted that although he soundly defeated Haley, he would still tap the former United Nations ambassador during his administration to help him win. Participate in NewsNation’s town hall with JD Vance 'I’ll do what I have to do,' Trump said. Haley offered her 'strong endorsement' of Trump in July in her Republican National Convention speech. Last month, Haley told listeners of her SiriusXM show that while she does not always agree with Trump, she still supports him because she thinks he will 'make the country better.' 'I have not forgotten what he said about me. I’ve not forgotten what he said about my husband or his, you know, deployment time or his military service,' Haley said. 'I haven’t forgotten about his or his campaign’s tactics from, you know, putting a birdcage outside our hotel room to calling me ‘bird brain.' 'But politics is not for thin-skinned people. It’s just not. And I think that if you really want to do a service for your country, you have to be able to put the personal part of it aside,' Haley added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-cheney-campaign-blue-wall-states/	2024-10-21T10:18:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2179103377.jpg?w=900

Jury selection set to begin in NYC subway chokehold death trial	(NewsNation) — A former marine charged in the 2023 chokehold, subway death of a homeless man is set to stand trial with jury selection set to begin in Manhattan on Monday. Daniel Penny, now 25, is accused of 'recklessly causing the death' of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old former street performer who witnesses say was acting erratically on the train on May 1, 2023, when Penny moved to restrain him. Penny, who served four years in the Marines before being discharged in 2021, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. He has been free on a $100,000 bond but faces up to 19 years in prison if convicted. The trial is expected to last between four to six weeks. Asheville woman's home burglarized after Helene Protesters took to the streets to demand that authorities arrest Penny — who is white; Neely was Black — while others rallied in support outside the courthouse once he was charged. The case also became a cause celebre among Republican presidential hopefuls. Jordan Neely's death Witnesses to the incident said Neely — who had struggled with drug addiction, mental illness and homelessness — had been shouting and demanding money when Penny approached him. Penny pinned Neely to the ground with the help of two other passengers and placed him in a chokehold for more than three minutes until Neely’s body went limp. The medical examiner’s office ruled the death a homicide caused by compression of the neck. Daniel Penny's case arguments Penny’s lawyers have argued that the Long Island native didn’t intend to kill Neely, just to hold him down long enough for police to arrive. Penny has claimed Neely shouted, 'I’m gonna’ kill you' and that he was 'ready to die' or go to jail for life. The defense said it plans to offer up other potential causes for Neely’s death, including high levels of the synthetic cannabinoid known as K2 found in his body. Oregon man guilty of kidnapping after woman escapes makeshift cell They’ll also argue that the video shared widely on social media proves Penny was not applying pressure consistently enough to render Neely unconscious, much less kill him. Prosecutors, in their court filings, have argued Penny’s actions were reckless and negligent even if he didn’t intend to kill Neely. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office declined to comment ahead of the trial. Neely’s surviving family members say they’ve been anticipating this moment and intend to attend the trial.

July Trump shooting attempt ‘should not have happened’: Task forc...	(NewsNation) — The July assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump 'clearly shows a lack of planning and coordination between the United States Secret Service (USSS) and its law enforcement partners before the rally,' according to the preliminary investigation conducted by a Congressional task force. 'Put simply, the evidence obtained by the Task Force to date shows the tragic and shocking events of July 13 were preventable and should not have happened,' the report’s executive summary concludes. The strong words are contained in a 53-page document labeled 'Interim staff report: Investigating the stunning security failures on July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pennsylvania.' How has Donald Trump’s Secret Service security detail changed? The report immediately condemns the 'lack of planning and coordination between the Secret Service and its law enforcement partners before the rally.' It cites the failure of clear guidance from the Secret Service to the state and local agencies about managing the areas outside the secure event perimeter. For example, 'there was no joint meeting on the day of the rally between USSS and all state and local law enforcement agencies assisting USSS.' It also blasts USSS for deciding to put the American Glass Research building, from which Thomas Matthew Crooks fired on Trump, outside the secure perimeter. Another major failure, according to the report, was the failure to engage Crooks at several 'pivotal moments' that day. HSI agents at Trump rally ‘ill-prepared’ for assassination attempt 'Throughout the afternoon, as Crooks’s behavior became increasingly suspicious, fragmented lines of communication allowed Crooks to evade law enforcement and, eventually, climb on to the roof of the AGR complex and fire eight shots at the rally stage and crowd, killing a rally attendee and injuring three others, including former President Trump,' the report states. The task force staff writes that it will continue to 'rigorously' investigate the July assassination attempt. It will also look at the September 15 incident in West Palm Beach, Florida in which an armed man was arrested near the Trump International Golf Course. The Congressional panel’s interim comes eight days after an independent review panel also detailed the failures in Butler and listed several 'remediations' for USSS. Among them: a 're-focus on the Secret Service’s protective mission.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-shooting-attempt-task-force/	2024-10-21T02:42:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24196223710960-e1727351283559.jpg?w=900
Stunning security failures' led to Trump assassination attempt, ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally in July was 'preventable and should not have happened,' according to a bipartisan House panel that is investigating the shooting and what it calls the 'stunning security failures' at the event. The report from a House task force, released Monday, is just the latest look at the cascading and wide-ranging law enforcement failings that preceded the July 13 shooting at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally where Trump was struck in the ear by gunfire. One rallygoer was killed in the shooting and two others were wounded. Members of both the House and Senate have repeatedly questioned why the Secret Service, an agency tasked with protecting the country’s top leaders, didn’t do a better job communicating with local authorities during the campaign rally, particularly when it came to securing the building that was widely agreed to be a security threat but that ultimately was left so unprotected that gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to climb up and shoot. Lawmakers in their report focus on 'the fragmented lines of communication and unclear chains of command' between Secret Service and Pennsylvania state and local police but place the majority of the blame on the Secret Service for the security breakdown. 'Federal, state, and local law enforcement officers could have engaged Thomas Matthew Crooks at several pivotal moments,' the report stated. Lawmakers added that throughout the afternoon, 'as Crooks’s behavior became increasingly suspicious, fragmented lines of communication allowed Crooks to evade law enforcement' and climb onto the unsecured roof where he would eventually open fire. 'Put simply, the evidence obtained by the Task Force to date shows the tragic and shocking events of July 13 were preventable and should not have happened,' the report continued. The preliminary findings are drawn from thousands of pages of documents, nearly two dozen transcribed interviews with state and local officials as well as a series of both classified and non-classified briefings from senior officials at the Secret Service and the FBI. The report breaks little new ground, as the failed Secret Service response has been already documented by an independent commission, an interim Senate report as well as congressional testimony and news media investigations. The House report, like others before it, does not identify specific individuals who may be to blame. But The Associated Press has previously reported that at least five Secret Service agents have been placed on modified duty. The director of the Secret Service at the time, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned shortly after the shooting, saying she took full responsibility for the lapse. The task force — comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats — showcased some of the report's findings during a public hearing last month. Lawmakers say they plan to issue a final report, including recommendations to avoid future assassination attempts against political candidates, by mid-December. The task force has also begun investigating the second assassination attempt on Trump last month where a man with a rifle camped outside one of his golf courses in southern Florida.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-stunning-security-failures-led-to-assassination-attempt-at-trump-rally-house-report-finds/	2024-10-21T02:04:31-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671619b325b827.97366582.jpeg?w=900
Dodgers finish off Mets with 10-5 win in NLCS and advance to face...	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shohei Ohtani carried the injury-riddled Los Angeles Dodgers to baseball's best record during the regular season. Tommy Edman joined the team in late July and helped them reach the World Series. It's been that kind of year for the big-spending Dodgers. When Ohtani isn't amazing with his power at the plate and prowess on the basepaths, someone else is stepping up. Edman and Will Smith homered to send Ohtani into the World Series for the first time, and the Dodgers eliminated the New York Mets with a 10-5 victory in Game 6 of the NL Championship Series on Sunday night. Los Angeles opens the World Series against the New York Yankees on Friday. 'I really feel like we finally arrived, I finally arrived at this stage,' Ohtani said through a translator. 'A lot of the games we played were really tough and hard to win, and it was truly a team effort to get here.' The Dodgers clinched their record 25th NL pennant, their fourth in eight years and first won at home since beating the Mets over seven games in 1988. They moved on to their 22nd World Series — 13th in Los Angeles — and first since 2020, when they beat Tampa Bay during the pandemic-delayed season. 'Every year I get to spring training and I wonder how we’re going to make a baseball team fit because we have so many talented players,' reliever Evan Phillips said. 'I wouldn’t say we planned for injuries but we planned to have multiple guys contribute throughout the year.' Next up for Ohtani and Co. is Aaron Judge and the Yankees, back in the World Series for the 41st time and first in 15 years. The matchup, which opens at Dodger Stadium, features the top two home-run hitters in Judge (58) and Ohtani (54). 'It’s kind of what the people wanted, what we all wanted,' Dodgers star Mookie Betts said. 'It’s going to be a battle of two good teams, a lot of long flights across the country.' It’ll be the 12th time the franchises meet in the World Series and the first in 43 years. The Yankees have beaten the Dodgers eight times, while the Dodgers’ three championships against the Bronx Bombers came in 1955, 1963 and 1981. 'It’s the place that I’ve dreamt of playing all my life,' Ohtani said, 'and to be able to finally come to this stage and be able to play and hopefully win it is my next goal.' Playing his first season with the Dodgers after agreeing to a record $700 million, 10-year contract as a free agent, Ohtani had two hits and scored two runs in Game 6. He hit .364 with two homers and six RBIs in the NLCS. 'The goal was to get to this far,' Ohtani said. 'And I also pictured myself getting this far with the contract that I’ve signed.' Ohtani spent his first six MLB seasons with the Los Angeles Angels, who never had a winning record or reached the playoffs during his tenure. 'We wouldn’t be here without him,' Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy said. 'We went through a lot of injuries and there was a good stretch during the regular season where he singlehandedly carried us.' The Dodgers, who were eliminated in the Division Series the previous two years, spent a combined $1 billion last winter to sign Ohtani and pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto to lucrative long-term contracts in hopes of winning the franchise’s eighth World Series title. Rookie Ben Casparius got four outs for the win and Blake Treinen the save in his first two-inning outing since the 2021 NLCS. Los Angeles trailed after Pete Alonso's run-scoring single against starter Michael Kopech. Edman gave the Dodgers the lead for good with a two-run double in the bottom half off Sean Manaea that drove in Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández, who both singled. Hernández snapped an 0-for-18 skid. Edman drove in the Dodgers' first four runs and his 11 RBIs in the NLCS tied a franchise record set by Corey Seager in 2020 against Atlanta. Edman, who won the NLCS MVP award, joined the Dodgers at the July trade deadline from St. Louis. 'I think the common theme for this season has been a lot of people, different guys have been stepping up over the course of the season,' Ohtani said. Edman sent a 406-foot shot to left-center for a two-run homer in a four-run third that included Smith’s 416-foot drive to center off Phil Maton that extended the lead to 6-1. 'I never imagined once we acquired him, he’d be hitting fourth in a postseason game,' Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said of Edman. 'But I trust him. The guys trust him. He’s made huge defensive plays for us and had huge hits.' Vientos hit his fifth postseason homer, a two-run drive in the fourth Ryan Brasier that cut the deficit to 6-3 in the fourth. The Dodgers, whose starting pitching has been decimated by injuries, used seven pitchers in finishing off the Mets, whose $332 million payroll was the biggest in baseball. New York twice stranded the bases loaded, when Anthony Banda struck out Jeff McNeil in the third and when Jesse Winker flied out against Phillips in the sixth. Los Angeles outscored New York 40-26 in the six games. The Mets came within two wins of reaching the World Series after overcoming a 22-33 start and earning the NL’s last wild card. 'This should be our expectations moving forward every year, we should be playing games deep into October,' first year-manager Carlos Mendoza said. Manaea lasted just two innings, giving up five runs and six hits. Alonso had two hits and drove in a run in what could have been his final game for the Mets. The first baseman is eligible for free agency after the World Series. 'I love this team. I love this organization. This fanbase has treated not just myself, but my family so, so well,' Alonso said. The sellout crowd of 52,674 included Tom Hanks, John Legend and Chrissy Teigen, Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Magic Johnson, Rob Lowe, Josh Groban, Jenny McCarthy and Vanessa Bryant.

4 dead in Houston radio tower helicopter crash: Police	HOUSTON (AP) — A helicopter reportedly crashed Sunday in Houston after hitting a radio tower, killing four people on board, including a child, fire officials said. Houston authorities said the aircraft, an R44 helicopter, went down just before 8 p.m. in Houston's Second Ward, east of the city's downtown, after apparently taking off from Ellington Field about 15 miles away. The identities of the victims and their ages have not yet been released. 'PIO is en route to a reported helicopter crash at Engelke &amp; Ennis,' the fire department said Sunday evening on X. 'The helicopter that crashed in Second Ward was not an HPD helicopter, it was a private touring helicopter,' Houston City Councilmember Mario Castillo said on X, although that could not be immediately confirmed. Local media outlets reported a large amount of emergency personnel responding to the scene. Police and fire officials have urged residents near the crash site to call 911 if they find anything on their property that could help in their investigation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/ap-helicopter-crashes-in-houstons-second-ward-after-hitting-radio-tower-killing-4-officials-say/	2024-10-20T21:52:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1801085827.jpg?w=724
Trump overtakes Harris for first time in Decision Desk HQ/The Hil...	Former President Trump on Sunday overtook Vice President Harris for the first time in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast this cycle. The model predicts Trump has a 52 percent chance of winning the presidency while Harris has a 42 percent chance, as of Sunday. Republicans head to court in expanding battle about overseas ballots Since late August, the election forecast put Harris’s chances of winning at approximately 54 to 56 percent, with Trump’s chances at approximately 44 to 46 percent. In early October, however, those dynamics began to shift, and the election forecast predicted both candidates’ chances to be closer to 50 percent. On Oct. 17, the model predicted the two candidates were equally likely to win next month, and Trump took the advantage on Oct. 20. The shift in election forecast coincides with the Republican candidate’s improved polling averages in Wisconsin and Michigan, two battleground states that previously leaned slightly toward Harris. Trump already had a slim advantage in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. Of the seven swing states seen as decisive in determining the outcome of the 2024 election, Pennsylvania is alone in still favoring Harris in its polling average. Top 5 ways education would look different under Harris vs. Trump Nonetheless, the race remains a toss-up, according to the election forecast, since the polling in all seven states remains within the margin of error, meaning typical polling inaccuracies could shift the results in either direction. These states are expected to be decisive in determining which candidate reaches the crucial 270 electoral votes. Currently, neither Trump nor Harris has a clear lead in enough states to secure that number.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/decision-desk-hq-the-hill-election-forecast/	2024-10-20T16:39:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Donald-Trump-Kamala-Harris-campaigning-10.18.png?w=900
Raffensperger: Republican voting claims will 'really hurt' GOP tu...	Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) said Sunday that claims about vote integrity from Republicans will 'really hurt' turnout for his party. Raffensperger had already pushed back on a claim from fellow Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene about a Northern Georgia 'voter’s printed ballot' being 'changed from their selections made on' a Dominion Voting Systems machine in the interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt. Raffensperger denies voter fraud amid Georgia’s historic early-vote turnout Stirewalt noted that 'some people, including those in your own party, don't want … don't agree with that, and they're pushing these kinds of stories.' 'What do you say to them, who are pushing this kinda stuff out there, here in the eve of the election?' Stirewalt asked Raffensperger. 'Well, at the end of the day, if you start [spreading] … stories like that, all you’re gonna do is to … we’ll really hurt our turnout on our side,' Raffensperger said. 'And I'm a conservative Republican, so I don't know why they do that … self-defeating.' As the election has inched closer, former President Trump’s denial of the 2020 election results has made its way back into the headlines. Trump notably called Raffensperger following the election, asking him to find over 11,000 votes that would have overturned President Biden’s win in the Peach State. 'When you get high marks by the Heritage Foundation, you know, they're giving us a top ranking, that means that we're doing the right things,' Raffensperger said in the interview Sunday. Trump is currently leading Vice President Harris in the battle for the White House in Georgia, up by 1.6 percent according to an average of polls from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ. Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon urges ‘respect’ for election The Hill has reached out to Greene’s office and the Republican National Committee. 'The false claim that voting machines can switch votes has been repeatedly debunked,' a spokesperson for Dominion said in a statement emailed to The Hill Sunday, adding that 'as both state and local election authorities have confirmed' the incident Greene described 'was due to voter error.'

Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon urges 'respect' for election	Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) in a Sunday interview urged 'respect' for 'our elections' as the 2024 election looms. 'We have to respect our elections, and I get it, candidates have the right to go to court and appeal, or to challenge versus … various processes,' Bacon told NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt in an interview on 'The Hill Sunday.' Elon Musk’s daily $1 million payouts at Trump rally draw legal scrutiny Bacon, alongside five other Republicans, signed onto a bipartisan letter released in September headed up by centrists vowing to respect the results of the November election. 'In America, we respect election results especially once the courts and appeals work through the process,' Bacon said in a statement at the time. 'We fight hard to win during campaigns and then respect the results when the votes are counted. Bacon said that there should be no 'reticence at all to say we’re gonna support the winner of the elections, period.' Former President Trump’s denial of the 2020 election results has returned to the headlines as Election Day has neared. In a debate against Vice President Harris last month, Trump expressed pushback toward the idea that he had accepted losing to President Biden four years ago. Republicans, Democrats preparing for legal battles over election 'No, I don’t acknowledge that at all,' Trump said. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also recently said that the former president didn’t face a loss against Biden in 2020 'by the words that I would use.' 'I think there were serious problems in 2020. So did Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use,' Vance said at a campaign event in Pennsylvania.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) denied there is voting fraud happening in the state as it sees historic early-voting turnout this month. Raffensperger weighed in on claims made by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) about voter fraud in the state after a county experienced an issue with its machines. Republicans, Democrats preparing for legal battles over election He said the issue was 'blown out of proportion' online. 'We’re going to respond quickly to these sorts of things in 2024 because it’s not supported by the facts,' Raffensperger said. 'The equipment’s working. We’ve done all sorts of audits since the last election and coming up to this election.' Georgia residents have cast ballots early in historic numbers — more than 1 million Georgians have already voted. 'I’m going to make sure that whoever wins this race, this is what gets certified.

Trump works the drive-thru at Pennsylvania McDonald’s	Former President Trump on Sunday stepped behind the counter at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, working the drive-thru for a short time after he spent weeks mocking Vice President Harris's past experience at the fast-food chain. Trump traded his suit jacket for an apron at a McDonald's location in Bucks County. He worked the fry cooker and handed an order to a customer at the drive-thru. Elon Musk’s daily $1 million payouts at Trump rally draw legal scrutiny The former president stopped at the fast-food chain ahead of a town hall in Lancaster, Pa., later Sunday. He is also expected to attend the Pittsburgh Steelers game against the New York Jets on Sunday night. Trump has been fixated for weeks on Harris's past experience working at McDonald's in college. The Harris campaign launched an ad in August highlighting the vice president’s upbringing in an effort to appeal to middle-class voters. The ad noted that Harris worked at McDonald’s while earning her college degree at Howard University. She had referenced the experience during past campaigns as well. Republicans, Democrats preparing for legal battles over election Trump and his allies have repeatedly suggested Harris did not actually work at McDonald's because it was not listed on her resume. 'I've now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala,' Trump quipped Sunday. The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment about Trump's McDonald's visit.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-pennsylvania-mcdonalds/	2024-10-20T12:01:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24294650830394-e1729449052463.jpg?w=900
Driving the vote: New Jersey GOP tries to flip state to red	(NewsNation) — It's the place where the first rock and roll song was ever performed, where the dance 'The Twist' first originated, and it's where Republican former president Donald Trump held a rally in May, declaring he was going to win the state in the 2024 presidential election. The place is New Jersey, a state that hasn’t gone red since 1988, when the original 'Beetlejuice' was haunting theaters. Latest polls show Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris having a comfortable lead over Trump.

Trump to work behind McDonald's counter in Pennsylvania	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump has a busy Sunday schedule ahead of him, 16 days until Election Day -- he's scheduled for a work shift at McDonald's. Trump will be hosting a rally in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, attending the Jets-Steelers NFL game in Pittsburgh, and is set to work behind the counter at a McDonald's in Lower Southampton Township, his campaign says. But for Rep. Scott Perry, R-PA, this will 'highlight he's for the working class,' he said on NewsNation's 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' on Sunday. Where are Trump, Harris, JD Vance and Tim Walz campaigning today? Pennsylvania is one of seven battleground states both presidential candidate needs to reach 270 Electoral College votes. The Keystone State gets 19 of those votes, making last-minute campaigning all the more urgent to get undecided voters, well, decided. 'President Trump is showing that he is very different from the party of the coastal elites and that he understands the average citizen that gets up every day, oftentimes in the dark, packs a lunch, and heads out to work just to pay their bills,' Scott said. The former president has questioned the summer job Harris said she held in college, working the cash register and making fries at McDonald’s while attending Howard University in Washington. Trump has claimed the vice president never worked there, repeating the claim Friday night at a campaign rally in Detroit, saying Harris 'lied about working at McDonald’s.' A Trump-endorsed candidate also running for reelection, Scott is not worried about Trump's rhetoric and language alienating groups of independent voters, including votes of Black males. Harris makes last-ditch appeal to disenchanted Republicans 'I think he speaks plain, you know, I think most people understand the point that he's trying to make and have probably made the same point themselves behind closed doors,' Scott said. 'He's reminding them about how bad it's been for the past essentially four years, which is also a reminder of how great it was four years prior to the Harris-Biden regime.' Though admitting he wouldn't use the language Trump uses. 'But then again, I'm not President Trump, and I don't draw tens of thousands of people to my rallies week after week, day after day, so I'm going to let President Trump be President Trump.' Election Day is Nov. 5, but early in-person voting is already underway.

Israeli strikes on northern Gaza leave at least 87 dead or missin...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes on multiple homes in the northern Gaza Strip overnight and into Sunday left at least 87 people dead or missing, the territory's Health Ministry said. It said another 40 people were wounded in the strikes on the town of Beit Lahiya, which was among the first targets of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago. The strikes came as the United States is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel’s plans to attack Iran, according to three U.S. officials. A fourth U.S. official said the documents appear to be legitimate. The documents, attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and marked top secret, indicate that Israel was moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. The U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The U.S. is urging Israel to press for a cease-fire in Gaza following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week. But neither Israel nor Hamas has shown any renewed interest in such a deal, after months of negotiations sputtered to a halt in August. Iran supports Hamas and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, where a year of escalating tensions boiled over into all-out war last month. Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon at the start of October. There was no immediate comment on the strikes in Beit Lahiya from the Israeli military, which said it was 'continuing to operate across Gaza in both aerial strikes and ground operations.' Among the dead were two parents and their four children, and a woman, her son and her daughter-law and their four children, according to Raheem Kheder, a medic. He said the strike flattened a multi-story building and at least four neighboring houses. Mounir al-Bursh, director general of the Health Ministry, said the flood of wounded from the strikes compounded 'an already catastrophic situation for the health care system' in northern Gaza, in a post on X. Internet connectivity went down in northern Gaza late Saturday and had not yet been restored by midday Sunday, making it difficult to gather information about the strikes. Israel has been carrying out a major operation in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, also in northern Gaza, for the last two weeks. The military says it launched the operation against Hamas militants who had regrouped there. The north has already suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, and has been encircled by Israeli forces since late last year, following the deadly Hamas' attack on Israel. Israel ordered the entire population of the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, to evacuate to the south in the opening weeks of the war and reiterated those instructions earlier this month. Most of the population fled last year, but around 400,000 people are believed to have remained in the north. Palestinians who fled the north at the start of the war have not been allowed to return. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

US investigating unauthorized release of classified documents on ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel's plans to attack Iran, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press. A fourth U.S. official said the documents appear to be legitimate. The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and note that Israel continues to move military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran's blistering ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The documents, which are marked top secret, were posted online to Telegram and first reported by CNN and Axios. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained — including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the U.S. intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack — and whether any other intelligence information was compromised, one of the officials said. As part of that investigation, officials are working to determine who had access to the documents before they were posted, the official said. The documents emerged as the U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and press for a ceasefire in Gaza, and has likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand military operations in the north in Lebanon and risk a wider regional war. However, Israel's leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let Iran's missile attack go unanswered. In a statement, the Pentagon said it was aware of the reports of the documents but did not have further comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-us-investigating-unauthorized-release-of-classified-documents-on-israel-attack-plans/	2024-10-19T17:52:17-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67144be3531cd4.94854082.jpeg?w=900
Trump compares imprisoned Jan. 6 rioters to Japanese Americans du...	(The Hill) - Former President Trump on Friday alleged nobody had been treated worse than those imprisoned for storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, other than Japanese Americans who were put in internment camps during World War II. Trump appeared on 'The Dan Bongino Show,' where he questioned why those prosecuted for their actions on Jan. 6 were still being held after a Supreme Court ruling in June found an obstruction law used to charge scores of rioters was improperly applied. 'The other thing is as you know they really won in the Supreme Court. The Fischer case and the various cases,' Trump said. 'Why are they still being held? Nobody’s ever been treated like this. Maybe the Japanese during Second World War, frankly. But, you know, they were held, too.' Trump, who went on to attack the House committee that investigated the events of Jan. 6, called it 'a very sad day in the country’s life.' Democrats look to quash threat from Green Party’s Jill Stein Roughly 120,000 Japanese Americans were held in internment camps during World War II after then-President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order. The treatment of Japanese-Americans during that period has been widely condemned in the decades since, with President Biden calling it 'one of the most shameful periods in American history.' On Jan. 6, 2021, a pro-Trump mob violently clashed with law enforcement at the Capitol to try to halt the certification of President Biden’s 2020 victory. The riot followed weeks of claims from Trump that his defeat was fraudulent. The Justice Department charged roughly 1,500 defendants in connection to the attack on the Capitol that day. Roughly 550 have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees. The Justice Department said nearly 900 individuals have pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges in relation to the events of Jan. 6. Trump, who himself was charged over his attempts to remain in power, has in recent days repeatedly downplayed the attack on the Capitol. At a Univision town hall event, he told one voter concerned about the events of Jan. 6 that it was a 'day of love.' The former president during a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait claimed there was a peaceful transfer of power in 2020 because he eventually left office.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/dc-riots/trump-compares-imprisoned-jan-6-rioters-to-japanese-americans-during-wwii/	2024-10-19T17:28:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Trump_economicclub_detroit_4d0ba4-e1729279526437.jpg?w=900
Democratic Party eyes Swifties with new youth voter campaign	(NewsNation) — As pop megastar Taylor Swift returns to the United States for the final leg of her 'Eras Tour,' the Democratic National Committee is looking to target her audience with a new series of Snapchat filters, billboard signs and voter outreach. The DNC is hoping to tap into the star's pool of young people and get them excited about the election, kicking off with a mobile billboard on a boat near Swift's concert venue in Miami and around the city. Another Swift-themed DNC ad is a Snapchat filter, which denotes that the user is in their 'Kamala Era,' and will prompt users to choose what they're being 'Fearless' for this November. Taylor Lorenz: Musk draws more political ire than Cuban because of X Options include reproductive rights, racial justice, student loan debt relief and more. The filter will then give instructions on how to cast their ballot in November for the only candidate they say will put them first, Vice President Kamala Harris. Swift endorsed Harris following her debate with former President Donald Trump, Her favorability among Republicans plummeted in the weeks following, with Musk taking to X to react to her endorsement, writing: 'Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.' Decision Desk '24 Election Newsletter The GOP nominee joined in, posting 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!' just days after she announced her support for Harris.

What's going on in Dolton? Illinois town has 'America's worst may...	(NewsNation) — Politician Tiffany Henyard, the current mayor of the village of Dolton, Ill. who just announced her reelection bid, has faced myriad controversies during her tenure in the Chicago suburb. Accusations range from opponent sabotage to misuse of taxpayer dollars, with the embattled elected official at the center of it all. Who is Tiffany Henyard? Henyard is both the supervisor of the largest township in Illinois, Thornton Township and the mayor of Dolton, Ill. Both towns are located roughly 30 miles from bustling Chicago. Henyard, who calls herself a 'supermayor' because of her dual positions, grew up in the area. According to her bio on the city's website, Henyard was elected in 2021 with 82% of the vote, making her the 'village of Dolton’s first and youngest woman mayor in the village’s 130-year history.' She's also likely the most controversial mayor ever elected in the town of 20,000, with the two governments under control racking up expenditures on fine dining, first-class travel, an armed security detail and more. Politics aside, she also runs the Tiffany Henyard Cares Foundation, a cancer charity which has garnered criticism for its inability to show how it helps cancer patients. Mayor Tiffany Henyard's controversies Henyard faces many allegations, but some of the most damning include spending tax dollars on her own lifestyle, throwing lavish parties with community resources and retaliating against those who go against her or her allies. Henyard, her political committee, her cancer charity, her boyfriend, two of her relatives, four trustees who are allies, her deputy police chief and even her defunct burger business have all been named in the FBI subpoenas regarding financial mismanagement in the town. Most recently, Henyard has come under fire for an $85,000 party backed by taxpayer funds and named after 'Friends of Tiffany A. Henyard,' her campaign fund. Trustees in both Thornton and Dolton attempted to prevent public money being used for the festivities, which included flying in R&amp;B singer Keke Wyatt and rapper J. Holiday for a mini-concert for the 'Taste of Thornton Township.' 'Let me make sure I’m crystal clear about this: I ain’t never took a goddamn thing in my life,' Henyard told Facebook viewers during a livestream from the outdoor gathering. JD Vance town hall on NewsNation: What you need to know Henyard has defended her taxpayer-funded events as important to the community, saying 'this is all for the babies' in a Facebook video taken at one of them. Residents don't believe her. 'I was flabbergasted,' said Lansing resident Jennifer Robertz. 'I was pissed off. That’s my money. That’s the people’s money.' The extravagant party and its backlash is far from the first public outcry about Henyard's spending. Lori Lightfoot investigates Henyard In August, former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a lawyer, was hired to investigate Henyard after years of chaotic meetings and accusations from her constituents. Lightfoot’s findings, released in August 2024, included exorbitant spending that landed the village in a nearly $5.5 million deficit. Just two years before, Dolton had been in a surplus. Charges to the village included: Three Amazon purchases – all made in a single day – totaling $43,000 A $7,699 Wayfair purchase PayPal money transfers and gift cards NewsNation local affiliate WGN also uncovered pricey travel expenses of $67,000 over four months by Henyard and her allies. Some of the expenditures included first-class airfare and a $9,000 stay at a Four Seasons hotel. Only after our affiliate sued Henyard did her office release spending records from July to November 2023. Travel expenses from Henyard’s 'conferences' tallied up to nearly $70,000, with $20,000 spent in Texas alone. Besides the travel, other notable Dolton credit card charges include: $24,778 at retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target $14,425 at Amazon $5,009 at Uber Eats and local restaurants $3,491 for Henyard’s personal photographer Henyard’s three vehicles also cost residents more than $374,000. One of Henyard’s top aides, Keith Freeman, has been charged in federal court with bankruptcy fraud. Another aide, former acting police deputy chief Lewis Lacey, was indicted in August on bankruptcy fraud charges for collecting more than $200,000 in overtime during the previous four fiscal years. Sentencing hearing begins for former sheriff who stole millions Butting heads: Henyard vs. trustees The ongoing power struggle has stayed mostly between Henyard, the village’s trustees and other community leaders. Trustee Carmen Carlisle, who used to be Henyard's assistant, sent an email to WGN breaking her silence about the mayor’s alleged wrongdoings. 'I am standing up, not just for myself, but for others who have been affected by what I see as Henyard’s abusive leadership,' Carlisle’s statement said. 'I believe there are many more victims who have been retaliated against, fired or lied to by Henyard, but have yet to speak out.' In front of a packed audience at an August meeting, Henyard responded by saying: ''I think I’m going to get you a new nickname: ‘Lyin’ Carlisle.' 'I’m tired of everyone in here,' Henyard said. 'There always has to be a show.' Residents have also been caught in the cross-fire. What's next for Dolton? Trustees have instituted layoffs and say they’re now crafting their own budget to try to get the village’s finances in order. Henyard filed a lawsuit last week against a majority of the village's trustees, alleging that one of the meetings held at the Dolton Park District was illegal. Henyard announced on social media Tuesday that she is running for a second term. 'So again the time is now to run for office,' she wrote, also using the hashtag 'IStandWithTiff.' Meanwhile, Dolton’s mayor pro-tem Trustee Jason House plans to run for mayor, so far Henyard's only challenger in the February Democratic primary. House supported Henyard in her 2021 election. The deadline for election filings is Oct. 28. If defeated in the mayoral election, House would be off the Village Board because his position is up for reelection as well. Comments on Henyard's reelection announcement varied from support to opposition. 'Tiffany is going to win. She’s the incumbent. The opposing slate has no chance,' one Facebook user wrote. 'Only place your (sic) going is jail,' another commented. 'Y'all must have some good weed up there cuz I can't think of any reason y'all would vote for this lady after all she's done to bankrupt her town,' yet another user posted. Someone else questioned why Henyard isn't in federal prison. But the incumbent mayor also has an equal amount of support. 'You should run for Governor of Illinois. I'll vote for you,' someone said. Another: 'Praying you win reelection there's nobody else cares like you do even if I'm not from Dolton I see the good you do for those that do live there.'

3 killed and 8 injured by gunfire following a Mississippi school'...	LEXINGTON, Miss. (AP) — Three people were killed and eight others were injured in central Mississippi early Saturday when at least two people opened fire into a group of several hundred people who were celebrating a school's homecoming football win at an outdoor trail several hours after the game had ended, authorities said. The gunfire was proceeded by a fight between some of the men at the celebration, but deputies hadn't yet learned what sparked the fight, said Holmes County Sheriff Willie March. Anywhere from 200 to 300 people were on the trail celebrating, and the gunfire sent them fleeing, the sheriff said in a phone interview. 'It was chaos, to tell you the truth,' March said. 'The shooting just started and people started running.' The shootings about five miles (3 kilometers) outside of Lexington, Mississippi, followed a football game several hours earlier at the Holmes County Consolidated School’s homecoming celebration. After the victory, scores of young people headed to the trail to celebrate. Lexington is located more than 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of Jackson. Two of the victims who died were 19 and the third was 25. The injured victims were airlifted to local hospitals. Deputies were collecting ammunition at the scene in an effort to determine how many weapons were fired, March said. Shootings by young men have been an 'off and on' problem recently in the county, which has a population of almost 16,000 residents. The young men who talk to the sheriff tell him that it's often because they have a 'beef,' or disagreement with someone. 'It’s hard to see what they are fighting over. I don’t think they are fighting over turf or drugs,' March said. 'These are young men walking around with weapons. I wish I had an answer.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/ap-3-killed-and-8-injured-by-gunfire-following-a-mississippi-schools-football-game/	2024-10-19T09:21:17-07:00	
Drone strike launched toward Israeli prime minister's house. At l...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli government said a drone was launched toward the prime minister’s house Saturday, with no casualties, as Iran’s supreme leader vowed that Hamas would continue its fight against Israel following the killing of the mastermind of last year’s deadly Oct. 7 attack. Sirens wailed Saturday morning in Israel, warning of incoming fire from Lebanon, with a drone launched toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in Caesarea, the Israeli government said. Neither he nor his wife were home and there were no casualties, said his spokesperson in a statement. In September, Yemen’s Houthi rebels launched a ballistic missile toward Ben Gurion Airport when Netanyahu’s plane was landing. The missile was intercepted. Meanwhile, in Gaza, more than 50 people have been killed in several Israeli strikes, including children, in less than 24 hours, according to hospital officials and an Associated Press reporter. Saturday's strikes into Israel come as its war with Lebanon’s Hezbollah — a Hamas ally backed by Iran — has intensified in recent weeks. Hezbollah said Friday that it planned to launch a new phase of fighting by sending more guided missiles and exploding drones into Israel. The militant group’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in late September, and Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon earlier in October. In addition to the drone launched at Netanyahu's residence, Israel's military said some 55 projectiles were fired in two separate barrages at northern Israel from Lebanon on Saturday morning. Some were intercepted, the army said, and there were no immediate reports of any casualties. Israel also said Saturday it killed Hezbollah’s deputy commander in the southern town of Bint Jbeil. The army said Nasser Rashid supervised attacks against Israel In Lebanon, the health ministry said an Israeli airstrike Saturday hit a vehicle on a main highway north of Beirut, killing two people. It was unclear who was in the car when it was struck. A standoff is also ensuing between Israel and Hamas, which it’s fighting in Gaza, with both signaling resistance to ending the war after the death of Hamas’ leader Yahya Sinwar this week. On Friday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Sinwar’s death was a painful loss but noted that Hamas carried on despite the killings of other Palestinian militant leaders before him. 'Hamas is alive and will stay alive,' Khamenei said. Since Israel claimed Sinwar’s death Thursday and a top Hamas political official confirmed the death Friday, Hamas has reiterated its stance that the hostages they took from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops. The staunch position pushed back against a statement by Netanyahu that his country’s military will keep fighting until the hostages are released, and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from rearming. Sinwar was the chief architect of the 2023 Hamas raid on Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped another 250. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children. More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday. The Palestinian Health Ministry said in a statement that Israeli strikes hit the upper floors of the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya, and that forces opened fire at the hospital’s building and its courtyard, causing panic among patients and medical staff. At Al-Awda hospital in Jabaliya, strikes hit the building’s top floors, injuring several staff members, the hospital said in a statement. In central Gaza, at least 10 people were killed, including two children, when a house was hit in the town of Zawayda, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital where the casualties were taken. An AP reporter counted the bodies at the hospital. Another strike killed 11 people, all from the same family, in the Maghazi refugee camp, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, where they were taken. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital. Overnight Friday, at least three houses were struck in northern Gaza killing at least 30 people, more than half of them women and children, said Fares Abu Hamza, head of the health ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. The homes were hit in Jabaliya and at least 80 people were injured. The war has destroyed vast swaths of Gaza, displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, and left them struggling to find food, water, medicine and fuel. Sinwar’s killing appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday, and it could shift the dynamics of the war in Gaza even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah with ground troops in southern Lebanon and airstrikes in other areas of the country. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. But Netanyahu said in a Thursday night speech announcing the killing that 'our war is not yet ended.' Still, the governments of Israel’s allies and exhausted residents of Gaza expressed hope that Sinwar’s death would pave the way for an end to the war. In Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza demanded the Israeli government use Sinwar’s killing as a way to restart negotiations to bring home their loved ones. There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead. — Associated Press reporters Jack Jeffery from Ramallah, West Bank and Bassem Mroue in Beirut, Lebanon contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-strike-launched-toward-israeli-prime-ministers-house/	2024-10-19T02:21:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67137b71afb217.38510193.jpeg?w=900
Georgia passes 1 million votes on fourth day of early voting	(NewsNation) — A million voters have turned out in Georgia as of 11:50 a.m. on Friday, the fourth day of early voting in the critical battleground state. Georgia Secretary of State Chief Operating Officer Gabriel Sterling announced the milestone on X, celebrating record turnout in the state. He recently told NewsNation that while there are lines at polling places, they are moving fast and the secretary of state's office is committed to ensuring fair elections and being transparent with voters. Pro-Trump yard sign leads to shooting in Las Vegas neighborhood There are more than seven million registered voters in the state, where more than five million ballots were cast in the 2020 election. President Joe Biden's narrow victory in the state was critical to winning the White House. It has also been a focus for those who maintain, without evidence, that the 2020 election was stolen. In 2024, Georgia is once again expected to play a major role in deciding the next president. Both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have focused campaign efforts in the state and there have already been conflicts over election procedures. Republicans have challenged thousands of voters on the rolls and a judge recently blocked Republican-led efforts to require hand-counting of ballots and allow local election officials to delay certifying results. Trump is also facing racketeering charges in the state, related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-1-million-votes/	2024-10-18T11:12:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177861107.jpg?w=900
Middle East latest: Hezbollah says its war with Israel is enterin...	Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group said Friday it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, as the region reckons with the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a battle with Israeli forces in Gaza. Hamas acknowledged Sinwar’s death and described him as a martyr. Sinwar was a chief architect of the attack on southern Israel that precipitated the latest escalating conflicts in the Middle East. Many, from the governments of Israeli allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar’s death would pave the way for an end to the war, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing Sinwar’s death that 'Our war is not yet ended.' On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Here's the latest: Israel says it has killed the Hamas militant who guarded Sinwar JERUSALEM — Israel’s military says it killed the militant who guarded the late Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar was killed by Israeli troops on Wednesday in Rafah, Gaza. In a statement released Friday night, the military identified the militant as Mahmoud Hamdan. It says troops killed Hamdan on Friday, 200 meters (650 feet) away from where Sinwar was killed. The military says Hamdan acted as a guard for six hostages who were killed in August as Israeli troops drew near to where they were being held in the Gaza tunnel network. It did not provide evidence for the claim. The six hostages included an Israeli-American, Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Biden says it may be easier to reach a cease-fire in Lebanon than Gaza BERLIN — President Joe Biden has suggested that negotiating a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hezbollah could be easier than forging one between Israel and Hamas. Biden says he discussed the way ahead to end the Middle East conflict following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza when he met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin on Friday. Biden told reporters that the leaders 'think that there is a possibility of working for a cease-fire in Lebanon and it’s going to be harder in Gaza.' He continued: 'But we agree there has to be an outcome of what happens the day after.' Sinwar was killed Wednesday by Israeli forces in Gaza, and Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone the following day. Biden declined to say whether Netanyahu gave him assurance during that conversation that the Israelis are ready to get back to negotiations toward a cease-fire and the release of hostages. 'We’re in the middle of discussions about that,' Biden said, adding: 'I’m not going to get into that.' Asked whether he had an understanding of when and how Israel may respond to Iran’s missile barrage on Israel earlier this month, Biden responded, 'Yes and yes.' He declined to offer any further details on Israel’s potential retaliation. Netanyahu plans to meet with ministers to discuss hostages JERUSALEM — Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to convene a special meeting with government ministers to discuss hostage negotiations in the light of Israel's killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. It’s unclear when the meeting will be held or what exactly is on the agenda. Israelis have urged the government to use the opportunity to seal a deal for the hostages’ release since Sinwar was killed by Israeli forces Wednesday. Among hostage families, there’s hope Sinwar’s death could restart the negotiations that sputtered to a stop three weeks ago, when Hamas and Israel accused each other of negotiating in bad faith. UNICEF takes action after cholera case confirmed in northern Lebanon BEIRUT — The U.N.’s children’s agency says it has activated an emergency cholera response to help protect children and families by containing the disease. The announcement by UNICEF Friday follows the confirmation of a cholera case in the Akkar governorate in North Lebanon. The health ministry said in a statement that the cholera case was unrelated to the growing displacement crisis in Lebanon. However, the country remains vigilant in controlling the spread of communicable diseases amid the ongoing displacement. Lebanon says 6 more killed in fighting in the past 24 hours BEIRUT — Lebanon’s crisis response unit says six people have been killed and 69 wounded in the past 24 hours in the war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The new numbers raise the total toll over the past year of conflict to 2,418 killed and 11,336 wounded, the Lebanese Health Ministry said Friday. The crisis response unit report also records 87 airstrikes and shellings in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon and the Nabatiyeh province. Some 1,098 centers — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities, and other institutions — are sheltering 191,501 people, including 44,646 families, displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report says. Among these shelters, 902 are full. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the U.N. children’s agency. The Lebanese Ministry of Education reports that 77 % of public schools are out of service, either due to their use as shelters or their location in areas directly affected by the war. Despite a major border crossing between Lebanon and Syria being out of commission after an Israeli strike on the road, crowds continue to flow across the border seeking safety in Syria. Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 18, Lebanese General Security recorded 335,948 Syrian and 135,181 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syria, the report says. UK prime minister says ‘dire humanitarian situation’ in Gaza cannot go on BERLIN — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told Israel that 'the world will not tolerate any more excuses on humanitarian assistance' to people in Gaza. Speaking Friday during a visit to Berlin to meet President Joe Biden and European leaders, Starmer said 'the dire humanitarian situation cannot continue. … Civilians in northern Gaza need food now.' The Biden administration warned Israel on Sunday that it must increase the amount of humanitarian aid it allows into Gaza within the next 30 days or risk losing access to U.S. weapons funding. Starmer says the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar should be a precursor to a cease-fire. Starmer says 'no one should mourn' the death of Sinwar, who had 'the blood of innocent Israelis' on his hands, as well as the blood of Palestinians 'who suffered in the chaos and violence that he sought and celebrated.' He says he strongly supports Israel’s right to self-defense, 'particularly in the face of the Iranian regime’s actions' and that Sinwar’s death 'provides an opportunity for a step towards that cease-fire that we have long called for.' Italy’s prime minister says Europe wants a ‘sustainable ceasefire’ in Gaza and Lebanon BEIRUT — Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni says European countries are working for a 'sustainable cease-fire' in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Speaking in Beirut after meeting Friday with her Lebanese counterpart, Najib Mikati, Meloni said European nations also support negotiations for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza since October last year. Mikati says 'a diplomatic solution should overcome' war that has intensified in recent weeks into an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon, and that Israel must agree to a cease-fire. Meloni says targeting U.N. peacekeepers deployed along the Lebanon-Israel border is unacceptable and that both sides must 'ensure at all times the safety of each of these soldiers.' She says the peacekeepers will be needed in any post-conflict scenario. Over the past two weeks, U.N. posts along the border have been subjected to fire that that has wounded at least five peacekeepers. She says the peacekeeping force in south Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, must be strengthened and that UNIFIL and Lebanese troops should be the only armed forces in the area south of the Litani river along the border with Israel. According to a 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 34-day Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006, Hezbollah should have no presence in the area along the border with Israel. Putin hopes the conflict in the Middle East won’t escalate further MOSCOW — Asked about the possibility of an all-out war between Iran and Israel, Russian President Vladimir Putin has voiced hope that tension can be defused in the region. Speaking Friday during a meeting with media representatives he said 'no one is interested in the escalation of the conflict for both economic and security reasons.' He says there is a possibility 'to find a settlement, but that will depend on the parties involved in the confrontation.' He notes that Russia has maintained contacts with Iran and Israel and stands ready to play mediator if asked, describing those relationships as 'quite trusting.' He says: 'We are ready to do what depends on us, if our role is viewed positively, to also help end those horrible strikes on civilians in the Gaza Sector and help normalize the situation in southern Lebanon to end an exchange of strikes there.' Israel says aid shipment reaches northern Gaza Israel’s military says it allowed 30 trucks of humanitarian aid into northern Gaza, the latest delivery over the past week as Israel faces pressure from the U.S. to ramp up aid. The military body in charge of humanitarian aid, COGAT, said Friday that the trucks carried food, water, medical supplies and shelter equipment. There has been no confirmation from the U.N. that the aid arrived and is being distributed in the north. Aid crossings to the north of Gaza were closed for the first two weeks of October, the U.N. says, sending food and water levels plunging in an area of Gaza where some of the heaviest fighting is taking place. The closures raised fears that Israel was implementing an extreme plan proposed by Israeli generals to besiege northern Gaza and starve out Hamas militants there. Following a letter from the U.S. saying the continual closures could risk continued weapons funding for Israel, Israel says crossings have reopened and aid is continuing to flow. White House watches to see who will succeed Sinwar BERLIN — The Biden administration says it does not have any early insight on who might succeed Yahya Sinwar or whether the new Hamas leader might be more willing to revive a cease-fire and hostage deal. White House national security spokesman John Kirby has called Sinwar the main obstacle preventing the negotiations from moving forward. But he says it remains to be seen if the killing of the Hamas leader could reinvigorate negotiations. He adds it’s 'too soon' to assess who Hamas 'might anoint as Sinwar’s successor and what that individual may be willing to pursue.' Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel’s military will keep fighting until the hostages are released and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from rearming after a year of devastating war. Khalil al-Hayya, who was Sinwar’s Qatar-based deputy, says Hamas will not return any of the hostages 'before the end of the aggression on Gaza and the withdrawal from Gaza.' Iran condemns Sinwar's killing and vows to continue resistance TEHRAN, Iran — Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has condemned the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and says his death will not disturb Islamic resistance. The state-run IRNA news agency on Friday quoted Pezeshkian as saying, 'Martyrdom will not create a disturbance in the Islamic Ummah’s resistance against force and occupation.' Pezeshkian also expressed condolences to the people of Gaza and all the freedom-seekers of the world. Israel releases footage of gunfight in which Sinwar died JERUSALEM — Israel’s military has released new footage showing what it says is the killing of Yahya Sinwar, including a tank firing at a home where the Hamas leader took refuge after a firefight with Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military says Sinwar was killed in the southern Gaza Strip on Wednesday when the tank shell hit the building where he had fled following a gunfight. Israeli soldiers killed Sinwar after encountering three militants fleeing between buildings in Rafah, Israeli military spokesperson LTC Col. Nadav Shoshani told reporters Friday. Under Israeli fire, two militants whose faces were covered by cloth fled into one building while another — Sinwar — entered a second. Before night fell, soldiers killed the two militants in one building and fired a tank shell at the other. It wasn’t until the following day, that soldiers inspecting the rubble noticed the body of a man who looked like Sinwar. His identity was confirmed by forensic tests in Israel. Shoshani says the military has intelligence that troops killed Sinwar during a rare moment when the Hamas leader was outside rather than in Gaza’s extensive tunnel network. At one point, Shoshani said, Sinwar spent time in the same tunnel complex where six hostages were held. The military says they were killed by their Hamas captors as Israeli soldiers drew near. Hezbollah sends condolences to Palestinians for Sinwar's death BEIRUT — The militant group Hezbollah has expressed its condolences to the Palestinian people and Hamas for the killing of Yahya Sinwar, head of Hamas’ political bureau. A statement issued by the group’s leadership Friday referred to Sinwar as a 'martyr' and praised his role in leading Hamas on 'the path of resistance.' Hezbollah describes him as the leader 'who stood in the face of the American project and the Zionist occupation, and sacrificed his blood for that.' 'We in the leadership of Hezbollah, who are facing with our resistant and steadfast Lebanese people the repercussions of the criminal Zionist aggression, confirm our standing with our Palestinian people,' Hezbollah says. — By Sally Abou AlJoud Biden urges Israel to use Sinwar's death to move toward peace BERLIN — U.S. President Joe Biden is reiterating his call for Israel to use the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar as an opportunity to move toward peace. Biden said as he met German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin Friday that Sinwar’s killing 'represents a moment of justice.' He says Sinwar 'had the blood of Americans and Israelis, Palestinians and Germans and so many others on his hands.' Biden says he 'told the prime minister of Israel yesterday, let’s also make this moment an opportunity to seek a path to peace, a better future in Gaza without Hamas.' Scholz, also a staunch ally of Israel, has said Sinwar’s death should open 'the concrete prospect of a cease-fire in Gaza, of an agreement to release the hostages held by Hamas.' Hamas calls Sinwar a martyr who died brandishing his weapon BEIRUT — Hamas has heralded Sinwar as a hero who 'ascended as a heroic martyr, advancing and not retreating, brandishing his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the forefront of the ranks.' The Hamas statement released Friday appears to refer to a video circulating of Sinwar’s last moments, in which he sits on a chair in a badly damaged building, severely wounded and covered in dust. He then suddenly raises his hand and flings a stick at an approaching Israeli miniature drone in an apparent final act of defiance. UN peacekeepers stick to their positions in southern Lebanon GENEVA — Forces in the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon are maintaining their positions despite 'demands' to move from the Israeli Defense Forces. Spokesperson Andrea Tenenti of UNIFIL, the interim force in Lebanon, said Friday that a 'unanimous' decision was taken by its 50 troop-contributing countries and the U.N. Security Council to hold its positions. They will also continue to monitor the conflict and ensure aid gets to civilians. 'The IDF has repeatedly targeted our positions, endangering the safety of our troops, in addition to Hezbollah launching rockets toward Israel from near our positions, which also puts our peacekeepers in danger,' he told a U.N. news briefing in Geneva by video. Tenenti says deteriorating security in the recent fighting between Hezbollah and Israeli forces has forced UNIFIL — which has some 10,000 personnel — to suspend most, but not all, of its patrols near the U.N.-imposed Blue Line boundary separating Lebanon and Israel. He says UNIFIL has seen 'hundreds of trajectories, and sometimes more, crossing the Blue Line each day, forcing our peacekeepers to spend extended hours in shelters to ensure their safety, which remains our top priority.' Tenenti says UNIFIL is maintaining its positions 'despite IDF demands to move from positions close to the Blue Line.' Israeli soldiers wounded and two militants killed in exchange of fire south of the Dead Sea JERUSALEM — Israel’s military says two soldiers have been injured in a gunfight with militants who crossed from Jordan into Israel. At least two militants crossed into Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea Friday morning, before being shot dead by Israeli troops. The military says two soldiers were injured during an exchange of fire and that troops are searching the area for another militant who may have infiltrated. The identities of those who crossed the border remain unclear. Hamas praised the incursion but did not claim responsibility, calling it an 'important development' in the war in Gaza and a 'natural response' to the 'brutal crimes of the occupation against our Palestinian people.' The statement is one of the first public comments by Hamas since Israel killed its leader, Yahya Sinwar, in Gaza. Hamas indirectly admits that its leader Sinwar was killed BEIRUT — A statement issued by one of Hamas’ political leaders abroad has tacitly but not directly confirmed the death of the group’s leader, Yahya Sinwar, in Gaza. Hamas said Friday that Israel is mistaken if it 'believes that killing our leaders means the end of our movement and the struggle of the Palestinian people.' Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim says past leaders have also been killed and 'Hamas each time became stronger and more popular, and these leaders became an icon for future generations to continue the journey towards a free Palestine.' He says it is 'painful and distressing to lose beloved people, especially extraordinary leaders' but that the Palestinian militant group is sure it will be 'eventually victorious.' When asked if the statement confirms Sinwar’s death, Naim said it does not. Israeli prosecutors to indict East Jerusalem man police say was planning to attack protest JERUSALEM — Israeli prosecutors are set to indict a Palestinian from East Jerusalem who police say planned to carry out an attack on a hostage protest in Tel Aviv. In a statement Friday, the police and Israel’s Shin Bet security agency said the man was a supporter of Hamas and other militant groups, and planned to carry out multiple attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers in retribution for Israel’s offensive in Gaza. Police say the man had not yet acquired a weapon or explosives to carry out any of the attacks, but that he was planning to attack a protest calling for the return of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Such protests occur weekly in Tel Aviv. Hezbollah says its war with Israel is entering a ‘new phase’ BEIRUT — Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group says it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, adding that it has introduced new weapons over the past days. A statement from the group’s operations room early Friday says Hezbollah’s fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones for the first time. The statement appears to refer to a drone laden with explosives that evaded Israel’s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The statement also says Hezbollah’s air defense units shot down this week two Israeli Hermes 450 drones. Hezbollah says its fighters are working according to 'plans prepared in advance' to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. Iran commemorates Hamas leader whom Israel says it killed UNITED NATIONS — Iran’s Mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, after Israel said he had been killed in fighting. It says: 'When U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed. However when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield — in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy — the spirit of resistance will be strengthened. He will become a model for the youth and children who will carry forth his path for the liberation of Palestine. As long as occupation and aggression exist, resistance will endure, for the martyr remains alive and a source of inspiration.' Iran and Iraq fought a brutal war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. It killed more than 1 million people on both sides.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-middle-east-latest-hezbollah-says-its-war-with-israel-is-entering-a-new-phase/	2024-10-18T11:03:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6712a3c16deee9.26068330.jpeg?w=900
Trump calls Jack Smith ‘sick puppy’ as latest Jan. 6 evidence uns...	Former President Trump on Friday railed against special counsel Jack Smith and the judge overseeing his case on efforts to subvert the 2020 election as Smith released a slew of new documents. 'The judge is allowing him to do it. And it’s not even believable,' Trump said Friday morning on 'The Dan Bongino Show' shortly before the documents were made public. 'This guy is a sick puppy. And they’re going to release something else. And always before the election. It’s election interference. No, it’s a terrible thing what’s happening.' Trump also blasted U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who a day earlier rejected an effort from Trump's team to delay the release of additional documents from Smith. Close Thank you for signing up!

'They all said, 'Well make sure you don’t get Chutkan.' And who did I get? I got Chutkan.' Chutkan last week agreed to a request from Smith to unseal exhibits that accompany his 180-page brief asserting that prosecutors can still bring much of their Jan. 6 case against Trump in the wake of a Supreme Court decision granting former presidents broad criminal immunity. Smith argues Trump’s efforts to thwart the transfer of power were the unlawful actions of a private citizen, not of a president. Chutkan granted Smith’s motion to post redacted versions of the exhibits, which could include grand jury transcripts, texts and other evidence assembled by prosecutors. Trump was indicted on federal charges in Washington, D.C., last year over his efforts to remain in power after losing the 2020 election. Smith charged Trump with four counts, alleging he was the director of a conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and was also central to a campaign to block the certification of votes on Jan. 6, 2021.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-jack-smith-january-6-evidence/	2024-10-18T09:53:30-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Jack-Smith-Donald-Trump-09.05_5f338d.png?w=900

Delphi murders: Opening statements underway in Richard Allen tria...	(NewsNation) — Opening statements are underway Friday in the long-awaited trial of the man accused of killing two teens in Delphi, Indiana, nearly eight years ago. Richard Allen, 52, is accused of killing Liberty German, 14, and Abigail Williams, 13, in February 2017 after allegedly luring them to their deaths while they were on a hike not far from their home. Their deaths had gone unsolved for more than five years when Allen, then a pharmacy worker, was arrested in the case that has drawn attention from true crime enthusiasts. Delphi killings: Timeline of events in Richard Allen case After an evidence leak, several legal filings, the removal and reinstating of the original court-appointed defense team and other delays in the Delphi murder case, Allen’s trial is now in full swing. Allen had been there all along in Delphi, living and working in the community of about 3,000 people in northwest Indiana. He faces two counts of murder and two counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping. If convicted, Allen could face up to 130 years in prison. State looks to nix composite sketches The initial sketch was released in 2017 (left) and the revised sketch was released in 2019 (right) After the girls were found dead, investigators released a grainy image of the suspected killer. However. it would be another five years before Allen was arrested and charged with their murders. In October 2022, Allen was taken into custody. He’s now charged with four counts of murder in connection with the girls’ deaths. As the trial begins, attorneys for Allen laid out their argument for why widely circulated composite sketches should be admitted as evidence. Earlier this week, Carroll County Prosecutor Nick McLeland filed a motion in limine asking the court to prohibit the use of composite sketches during Allen's trial. The sketches, released in 2017 and 2019, have been part of the Delphi murders investigation for years. Indiana State released them in hopes of generating leads about the deaths of Williams and German. McLeland argued the sketches were not used to identify Richard Allen and said using them during the trial could confuse or prejudice the jury. Attorneys discussed the motion during a hearing in Allen County on Thursday. Judge Fran Gull took it under advisory and has yet to rule. The state argued that the sketches were produced as part of the investigation for the purposes of recognition, not identification, of a suspect. What do we know about Delphi suspect Richard Allen? Delphi murder trial jury selection Jury selection in the trial began on Monday. Around 300 summons were sent to prospective Allen County jurors. Eventually, 12 jurors and four alternates were selected. The three-day process of culling the jury pool began in Allen County on Monday with 100 prospective jurors scheduled to appear in the courtroom. Allen was present during the proceedings, arriving in a purple shirt, khaki pants and a pair of shackles. Due to the high-profile nature of the case, Allen’s defense team asked for a change of venue. Special Judge Fran Gull, appointed by the Indiana Supreme Court to oversee the case after the original judge recused himself, determined that was logistically challenging. She decided to bring in jurors from Allen County and transport them to Carroll County for the trial. Jury selection began Monday. The jurors will be sequestered for about a month. More than 100 people were expected to testify between the defense and prosecution. Delphi murders: Prosecutors don’t want jury to visit Delphi crime scene Richard Allen's defense arguments Defense lawyers for Allen made a startling admission during Tuesday’s jury selection. Allen’s defense team revealed that hair was found in Abby Williams’ hand that didn’t match Richard Allen. That’s the first time that information has been made public. Attorney Andrew Baldwin made the comments during 'mini opening statements' preceding jury selection. While prosecutors say an unspent bullet found at the scene is linked to a gun owned by Allen and cite dozens of confessions from him, Allen’s defense argued those confessions were made under duress and weren’t trustworthy. They said Allen confessed to details from the crime that were inaccurate. He also confessed to other crimes that didn’t happen, his defense team said.

Hezbollah vows revenge for Hamas leader Sinwar's death	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden says securing a cease-fire and bringing hostages home are the main focuses after the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war isn't over. Meanwhile, Hezbollah says Sinwar's death only stands to escalate its war with Israel. US responds to death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar Israeli, US response to Sinwar's death Following Thursday's announcement, Israel’s military released a drone video that shows a person they say is Sinwar just before he died by Israeli tank fire. Biden spoke with Netanyahu after Sinwar’s death and congratulated him on the news. Despite a renewed push for a cease-fire, however, Israel said the war isn’t over. Netanyahu said he wants Israel to maintain long-term control over Gaza and added that any Hamas member who helps with hostage rescue and turns their weapons in will be offered amnesty. In Iran, Sinwar’s death has strengthened the spirit of resistance, the country’s UN team said. The U.S. military has boots on the ground in Israel operating an air defense system to protect against a possible Iranian attack. Bolton calls death of Hamas leader ‘a good day for the whole world’ Hostages in Hamas detention About 101 Israeli hostages remain in Hamas custody and dozens are believed to be dead. Twenty-three-year-old Israeli American soldier Omer Neutra is one of those remaining hostages believed to be alive. Hamas took him in October 2023. His parents called for peace after the announcement of Sinwar’s death. 'We are at an inflection point where the goals set for the war with Gaza have been achieved, all but the release of the hostages,' Neutera’s father, Ronen Neutra, said. Sinwar was described as a major obstacle to a deal. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel to Israel early next week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/hezbollah-revenge-hamas-leader-sinwars-death/	2024-10-18T06:08:45-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/655e7f0006f8d1.34963862.jpeg?w=900

Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar killed in Gaza: Who was he?	(NewsNation) — Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, one of the masterminds behind the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, has been killed, the Israeli military confirmed Thursday. 'Eliminated: Yahya Sinwar,' the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) wrote on X. Sinwar — who had been the de facto head of Hamas since Ismail Haniyeh was killed in July — was a U.S.-designated terrorist and had been at the top of Israel's most-wanted list since the start of the Israel-Hamas war a year ago. Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is dead, IDF source confirms He was one of the chief architects of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw at least 250 others taken hostage. Foreign Minister Israel Katz called Sinwar’s killing a 'military and moral achievement for the Israeli army,' saying it would 'create the possibility to immediately release the hostages,' in a statement shared with The Associated Press. Hamas had not confirmed Sinwar's death as of early Thursday afternoon. Here's what we know about Sinwar. Who was Yahya Sinwar? Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in the Gaza town of Khan Younis. He was an early member of Hamas, which was formed in 1987. Later, he went on to form the group's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, which became known for sending suicide bombers into Israel and firing rockets from Gaza into Israeli towns. Sinwar developed a reputation for brutality and earned the nickname 'the butcher of Khan Younis' after he admitted to killing 12 suspected collaborators. In 1988, Sinwar was arrested by Israel for his terrorist activity. He was sentenced to four life terms for abducting and murdering two Israeli soldiers but was later released in 2011 as part of a prisoner swap for kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. After his release, Sinwar returned to Gaza, where he rose to power. The U.S. State Department designated Sinwar a global terrorist in 2015. By 2017, Sinwar had been named the new leader of Hamas in Gaza, with The New York Times describing him as a 'militant hard-liner.' 'He carries a reputation as a harsh enforcer of loyalty within the group, and as an unstinting enemy of Israel,' the Times wrote. In May, the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor sought an arrest warrant for Sinwar for his alleged role in the Oct. 7 attack. According to the AP, Sinwar was killed in Rafah after an Israeli tank launched a shell at a building, causing it to collapse. Photos of Sinwar published by Israeli media show a man wearing a bulletproof vest, surrounded by grenades, lying in the rubble of a building with a head wound, the AP reported. The Associated Press and NewsNation's Robert Sherman contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/who-was-yahya-sinwar/	2024-10-17T11:36:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1251837467.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Liam Payne, a former member of One Direction, fell to his death from his balcony at the CasaSur Palermo hotel in Buenos Aires Wednesday, a sad end to a recently turbulent life. Liam Payne's death at Argentina hotel First responders were called at 5:04 pm on Wednesday by the hotel — half an hour after he was carried out of the hotel’s lobby and just minutes before Payne fell from his third-floor balcony at 5:07 pm. A newly released emergency call from the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires manager to the police was chilling. Friends and musicians express heartbreak at the death of singer Liam Payne at age 31 The frantic manager 'begged for law enforcement and requested urgent’ assistance, alleging the out-of-control singer was ‘putting his life at risk’,' according to the NY Post. 'Hello, good morning. I just called and my line got disconnected. I’m calling (from) the CasaSur hotel in Palermo, Costa Rica 6032,' the manager is heard saying in Spanish in audio obtained by the Sun UK and La Nacion. The manager, 'Esteban,' claimed that Payne was destroying his hotel room and was under the influence of 'drugs and alcohol., saying: 'Well, we have a guest who is drunk on drugs and alcohol. And, well, he’s … When he’s conscious, he’s breaking up the whole room. And, well, we need you to send someone, please.' 'We need you to send someone urgently because, well, I don’t know if this guest’s life is at risk. They must be in a room that has a balcony. And well, we’re a little bit worried he’ll do something, that he’ll put his life at risk.' 'How long has he been there or is it a residential hotel?' the operator asked. 'No, no, he’s been there for two or three days,' the manager said.

(Photo by Dave J Hogan/Getty Images ) Liam Payne posts about 'lovely day' before death An insider told Page Six that 'Liam had been cycling through periods of ruinous behavior for a long time,' adding that 'his demons were much worse than he let on.' Shortly before his death, Payne claimed he was having a 'lovely day in Argentina' in a since-deleted Snapchat story during his vacation with girlfriend Kate Cassidy. Death of ex-One Direction member Liam Payne at 31 shocks fans around the world Cassidy flew back to Miami on Monday — two days before the tragedy insinuating she’d had enough of the elongated trip (the couple were set to leave weeks before after catching former One Direction Niall Horan’s show in the city but stayed on for 14 more days). 'I was so ready to leave,' Cassidy shared in a TikTok video. 'Honestly, love South America but I hate staying in one place for too long. And we were supposed to be there for, like, five days, turned into two weeks… I was just like, ‘I need to go home.'' Liam Payne struggled with issues linked to Maya Henry Payne — who has battled drink and drugs for years — was also dealing with his ex. According to People: 'Payne was struggling with issues related to his ex-fiancée, Maya Henry'. A source with knowledge of the situation told the magazine that Payne 'was extremely overwhelmed by all of the legal issues' involving Henry. The Texan model, 23, instructed lawyers to issue a cease and desist letter to Payne a few days earlier, accusing him of 'obsessively contacting her friends and family including her mother Azteca Henry'. Henry posted a video to TikTok that said: 'Ever since we broke up he messages me, will blow up my phone, not only from his phone, it's always from different phone numbers too, so I never know where it's gonna come from.' 'He'll create new iCloud accounts to message me — it's always a new damn iCloud account. Every time I see one pop up on my phone I'm like, 'here we f---ing go again' 'Also, he will email me... not only me, but he'll blow up my mom's phone. Is this normal behavior to you?' Henry also accused Payne of 'weaponizing' fans whom he 'preys' upon against her. Liam Payne open about struggles with drugs and alcohol Since skyrocketing to fame at the age of 16 with One Direction, Payne has been open about his struggles with drugs and alcohol. Regarding alcohol, Payne told Men’s Journal: 'It's almost like putting the Disney costume on before you step up on stage and underneath the Disney costume I was (drunk) quite a lot of the time because there was no other way to get your head around what was going on.' Speaking on the Diary of a CEO podcast in 2021, Payne told host Stephen Bartlett that he had struggled with 'severe suicidal thoughts' and heavy drug use while he was in the band. 'I was worried how far my rock bottom was going to be,' he said in the interview. 'Where's rock bottom for me? And you would never have seen it. I'm very good at hiding it. No one would ever have seen it. 'There is some stuff that I have definitely never, never spoken about… it was really, really, really severe. And it was a problem. And it was only until I saw myself after that, I was like ‘Right, I need to fix myself.’' Liam Payne and his bandmates all sought solo success after One Direction fame Payne spent 100 days in a Louisiana rehab in 2023. Before leaving for Argentina, Payne told fans in an Instagram story that he had things 'to square up' with Horan but didn’t get into specifics about it. Liam Payne died of 'cranial fracture and extremely serious injuries' Medical officials confirmed that Payne died of 'a cranial fracture and extremely serious injuries' sustained in the fall. 'Our role was to head there quickly, give medical attention, and try to resuscitate him, but his injuries were incompatible with life,' said Buenos Aires emergency services chief Alberto Crescenti, according to La Nacion. The Argentine newspaper also ran pictures from Payne’s damaged hotel room showing drugs, drug paraphernalia, booze and a broken TV. 'Liam will forever live in our hearts': Liam Payne's family On Thursday, Payne’s family issued a statement to the BBC which read: 'Liam will forever live in our hearts and we’ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul. We are supporting each other the best we can as a family and ask for privacy and space at this awful time.' Payne isn’t the only member of One Direction to struggle with fame and a solo career. His former bandmate Zayn Malik has been very public about his anxiety and anorexia issues since leaving the band.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/liam-payne-death-hotel-urgent-assistance/	2024-10-17T11:08:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/gettyimages-1134037682-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is dead, IDF confirms	(NewsNation) — Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is dead, Israeli military sources confirmed to NewsNation, following an initial DNA check. Sinwar is believed to be the architect behind the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel. Israeli operations in Gaza killed three Hamas militants, including Sinwar, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced. The IDF said it couldn’t confirm the identities of the other alleged Hamas members who died. 'There were no signs of the presence of hostages in the area,' Israel’s military wrote on X. 'The forces that are operating in the area are continuing to operate with the required caution.' This story is developing.

The Israeli military is investigating whether top Hamas leader Si...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli military says it is looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a military operation in Gaza. The military said in a statement Thursday that three militants were killed during operations in Gaza, without elaborating. It said the identities of the three were so far not confirmed, but it was 'checking the possibility' that one of the three was Sinwar. Sinwar was one of the chief architects of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. He was chosen as the group’s top leader following the assassination of Ismael Haniyeh in July in an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. An Israeli strike on a school sheltering the displaced in northern Gaza on Thursday killed at least 15 people, including five children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The Israeli military said the strike targeted dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants who had gathered at the Abu Hussein school in Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp in northern Gaza where Israel has been waging a major air and ground operation for more than a week. In a separate development, a building in central Beirut that houses offices of the Al Jazeera news network and the Norwegian Embassy was evacuated after a warning. Mazen Ibrahim, Al Jazeera's Lebanon bureau chief, said the building’s administration received three calls telling everyone to leave the building, which he said houses the embassies of Norway and Azerbaijan, as well as dozens of offices. He said it was unclear who called in the warning. Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ragnhild Simenstad said the building was evacuated after a 'bomb threat,' without elaborating. Israel has ordered the evacuation of several buildings, as well as entire cities, towns and villages, as it strikes what it says are targets linked to the Hezbollah militant group. There have also been several instances of evacuation warning calls and text messages that turned out to be bogus, which Lebanese security agencies say they are investigating. Israel has struck central Beirut on two occasions in its latest war against Hezbollah, and both came without warnings. In northern Gaza, Fares Abu Hamza, head of the ministry's local emergency unit, confirmed the toll from the Israeli strike and said dozens of people were wounded. He said the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital was struggling to treat the casualties. 'Many women and children are in critical condition,' he said. The Israeli military said it targeted a command center run by both militant groups inside the school. It provided a list of around a dozen names of people it identified as militants who were present when the strike was called in. It was not immediately possible to verify the names. Israel has repeatedly struck tent camps and schools sheltering displaced people in Gaza. The Israeli military says it carries out precise strikes on militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its strikes often kill women and children. Hamas-led militants triggered the war when they stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Some 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. Northern Gaza was the first target of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, with entire neighborhoods in Gaza City and other towns reduced to rubble. Most of the population fled after Israel issued evacuation orders in the opening days of the war, but about 400,000 are believed to have remained despite the harsh conditions. Earlier this month, Israel once again ordered the full-scale evacuation of the north, and allowed no food aid to enter the area for around two weeks. That led many Palestinians to fear that it had adopted a surrender-or-starve strategy suggested by former Israeli generals. Israel allowed two shipments of aid to enter the north earlier this week after the United States warned it might reduce its military aid if its ally did not do more to address the humanitarian crisis. Since the start of the conflict, Israeli forces have launched repeated operations into Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. The military says militants have repeatedly regrouped there after major operations. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Panel looking into Trump assassination attempt says Secret Servic...	WASHINGTON (AP) — An independent panel investigating the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally faulted the Secret Service for poor communications that day and failing to secure the building where the gunman took his shots. The review also found more systemic issues at the agency such as a failure to understand the unique risks facing Trump and a culture of doing 'more with less.' The 52-page report issued Thursday took the Secret Service to task for specific problems leading up to the July 13 rally in Butler as a well as deeper one within the agency's culture. It recommended bringing in new, outside leadership and refocusing on its protective mission. 'The Secret Service as an agency requires fundamental reform to carry out its mission,' the authors wrote Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of the Homeland Security Department, the Secret Services' parent agency, in a letter accompanying their report. 'Without that reform, the Independent Review Panel believes another Butler can and will happen again.' One rallygoer was killed and two others wounded when Thomas Michael Crooks climbed onto the roof of a nearby building and opened fire as Trump spoke. The former president was wounded in the ear before being rushed off the stage by Secret Service agents. That shooting, along with another incident in Florida when Trump was golfing — a gunman there never got a line of site on the president or fired a shot — has led to a crisis in confidence in the agency. The report by a panel of four former law enforcement officials from national and state government follows investigations by members of Congress, the agency's own investigators and by Homeland Security's oversight body. A look at the report's key findings and recommendations: Poor communications, no plan for key buildings The panel echoed previous reports that have zeroed in on the failure to secure the building near the rally that had a clear line of site to where Trump was speaking and the multiple communications problems that hindered the ability of the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement to talk to each other. 'The failure to secure a complex of buildings, portions of which were within approximately 130 yards of the protectee and containing numerous positions carrying high-angle line of sight risk, represents a critical security failure,' the report said. The panel faulted the planning between Secret Service and the local law enforcement, and said the Secret Service failed to ask about what was being done to secure the building: 'Relying on a general understanding that ‘the locals have that area covered’ is simply not good enough and, in fact, at Butler this attitude contributed to the security failure.' The panel also cited the fact that there were two separated command posts at the Butler rally: one with various local law enforcement and another with the Secret Service: 'This created, at the highest level, a structural divide in the flow of communications.' There were other communications problems. The Secret Service had to switch radio channels because radio traffic of agents protecting first lady Jill Biden at an event in Pittsburgh was popping up on the channels of agents covering the Butler rally. The panel also noted that all the law enforcement personnel on the ground were using a 'chaotic mixture' of radio, cell phone, text, and e-mail throughout the day to communicate. Also the panel said it was unclear who had ultimate command that day. Cultural issues within the agency The report delved into the agency's culture and painted a picture of an agency struggling to think critically about how it carries out its mission, especially when it comes to protecting Trump. The panel said agency personnel operated under the assumption that they effectively had to 'do more with less.' The report said the additional security measures taken to protect Trump after the Butler shooting should have been taken before. 'To be clear, the Panel did not identify any nefarious or malicious intent behind this phenomenon, but rather an overreliance on assigning personnel based on categories (former, candidate, nominee) instead of an individualized assessment of risk,' the panel wrote. The panel also noted the 'back-and-forth' between the Trump security detail and Secret Service headquarters regarding how many people were needed to protect him. The panel also faulted some of the senior-level staff who were involved in the rally for what they called a 'lack of ownership.' In one example, the panel said a senior agent on site who was tasked with coordinating communications didn't walk around the rally site ahead of timen and did not brief the state police counterpart before the rally about how communications would be managed. It cited the relative inexperience of two specific agents who played a role in security for the July 13 rally. One was the site agent from Trump's detail whose job it was to coordinate with the Pittsburgh field office on security planning for the rally. The panel said the agent graduated from the Secret Service academy in 2020, and had only been on the Trump detail since 2023. Before the Butler rally the agent had only done 'minimal previous site advance work or site security planning.' Another agent assigned to operate a drone detection system had only used the technology at two prior events. What did the panel recommend? Having a unified command post at all large events where Secret Service and other law enforcement representatives are all physically in the same place; overhead surveillance for all outdoor events; security plans must include a way to mitigate line of site concerns out to 1,000 yards and who's in charge at the event; and more training on how to get protectees out of dangerous scenarios. The panel said the agency also needs new, outside leadership and a renewed focus on its core protective mission while expressing skepticism that the agency should continue with the investigations it currently conducts. While the Secret Service is well known for what it does to protect presidents and other dignitaries, it also investigates financial crimes. 'In the Panel’s opinion, it is simply unacceptable for the Service to have anything less than a paramount focus on its protective mission, particularly while that protective mission function is presently suboptimal,' the report said. The panel members were Mark Filip, deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush; David Mitchell, who served in numerous state and local law enforcement roles in Maryland and Delaware; Janet Napolitano, homeland security secretary under President Barack Obama; and Frances Fragos Townsend, Bush's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/ap-panel-looking-into-trump-assassination-attempt-says-secret-service-needs-fundamental-reform/	2024-10-17T05:04:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6710fde506f230.58156373.jpeg?w=900
Video: Marshals raid Atlanta mansion occupied by squatters	(NewsNation) — Georgia is cracking down on squatters, fed up with people ignoring property laws. Fulton County marshals raided a 15,000-square-foot mansion in Atlanta on Wednesday after a group of squatters showed signs they possibly identified as 'sovereign citizens,' people who believe they are exempt from U.S. law. They allegedly showed up to the property, set up camp and dared anyone to remove them. Menendez family: We suspected abuse from the beginning The video of the raid was posted to social media by the marshal's office. In the video, heavily armed officers swept through the mansion during the early morning raid. At one point, officers even used a drone to ensure the area was secure. NewsNation reached out to the Fulton County Marshal’s Department for comment but has yet to hear back. In July, the Georgia Squatter Reform Act was enacted, stating that squatters caught inside a home will now be cited and given three days to present a lease. If they can't do so, or the lease is found to be a forgery, a misdemeanor charge immediately becomes a felony. The new law also states that it doesn't have to be the property owner who reports the squatters, meaning it could be a neighbor or a homeowners association member who calls the police.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/marshals-raid-atlanta-mansion-squatters/	2024-10-17T04:40:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/image-1.png?w=900
US long-range B-2 stealth bombers target underground bunkers of Y...	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. military unleashed B-2 stealth bombers to target underground bunkers used by Yemen’s Houthi rebels early Thursday, a major escalation in the American response to the rebels' attacks on Mideast shipping lanes that appeared to be a warning to Iran as well. While it wasn't immediately clear how much damage the strikes caused, the attack appeared to be the first use of the B-2 in combat in years and the first time the flying wing targeted sites in Yemen. In announcing the strikes against the Houthis, who have been attacking ships for months in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made a point to offer a warning likely heard in Tehran as well. 'This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened or fortified,' Austin said. Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, has targeted Israel with ballistic missile attacks twice over the past year. The B-2 would be used in any American attack on hardened Iranian nuclear facilities like Natanz or Fordo given it is the only aircraft in service that can drop the GBU-57, known as the 'Massive Ordnance Penetrator.' Iran offered no immediate comment on the strike Thursday. Its foreign minister has been visiting Arab nations ahead of an expected Israeli retaliatory strike over Tehran's Oct. 1 missile assault. The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes around Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014. They also reported strikes around the Houthi stronghold of Saada. They offered no immediate information on damage or casualties. Austin said the B-2 bombers targeted 'five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' Both he and the U.S. military's Central Command offered no immediate assessment on the damage done. However, Central Command said it believed no civilians had been killed. The Red Sea has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships traveling through the waterway, which once saw $1 trillion of cargo pass through it yearly. Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel and have shot down U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper drones. The rebels have threatened new attacks in response to Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon and its killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Hamas' initial Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war killed some 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israeli miltary action in the time since has killed over 42,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, hundreds more in the West Bank and over 2,300 people in Lebanon. Meanwhile, the combat edges ever closer to a full-on regional war. The locations named by the Houthis on Thursday correspond to known underground bases operated by the rebels, who have been locked into a stalemated war with a Saudi-led coalition since 2015 that’s decimated the Arab world’s poorest nation. The Houthis have refurbished tunnels that once held Scud missiles when Yemen was ruled by strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, according to an analysis in April by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Those sites include the al-Hafa and Jebel Attan military bases, the former Presidential House and the Yemen state television compound in Sanaa, analyst Fabian Hinz wrote. The Houthis have built what appears to be their own large-scale tunnel network near Saada as well, Hinz added. 'The fact that the Houthis began constructing major new installations after the agreement of the cease-fire with the Saudi-led coalition suggests that the group is focused on entrenching themselves and bolstering their military capabilities,' he wrote. Iran similarly relies on a network of underground missile bases. The nuclear-capable B-2, which first saw action in 1999 in the Kosovo War, is rarely used by the U.S. military in combat as each aircraft is worth some $1 billion. It has dropped bombs in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya as well. The aircraft are based at Whiteman Air Base in Missouri and typically conduct long-range strikes from there, though some B-2s were in Australia in September. The U.S. last used the B-2 in combat in 2017 against Islamic State group targets in Libya, killing more than 80 fighters in a mission defense officials at the time said disrupted possible militant attacks in Europe. The B-2's use in Yemen comes just two days after U.N. Special Envoy Hans Grundberg warned Yemen's frozen war could heat back up given the Mideast wars and the Houthis' taking captive U.N. and aid workers in an internationally criticized crackdown. 'This cycle of retaliation is pulling Yemen deeper into the regional conflict, jeopardizing its hopes for peace and stability,' Grundberg said Tuesday. 'Moreover, it distracts from the urgent need to address Yemen’s own internal crisis.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-us-long-range-b-2-stealth-bombers-target-underground-bunkers-of-yemens-houthi-rebels/	2024-10-17T03:34:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6710e79a005580.23710202.jpeg?w=900
Flight attendants in crisis: Stripping, struggling, homeless	(NewsNation) — After a long day assisting travelers on a major airline, a flight attendant by the name of 'Bree' takes off her wedding ring and begins her second shift. 'I am definitely not a girl that you would normally see in a strip club, and I come from a great family. I grew up with a lot of morals, a lot of Christian morals. I have a partner, I have a job,' Bree told NewsNation’s Natasha Zouves. Bree spoke under the condition of anonymity, concerned about keeping her job. After years of flight attending and trying other avenues of earning additional income, like delivering for DoorDash, she says the decision to strip simply came down to 'the need for survival.' 'If you tell somebody that you’re a flight attendant, they normally think you make a lot of money,' said Bree. 'The public looks up to flight attendants, and it’s like you have this glamorous life.' In reality, Bree said, 'You’re dirt poor. You’re very, very poor. So poor, you become a little scrappy. You get paid under $30,000 a year.' ‘Everybody’s angry’: Thousands of autoworkers unemployed Bree said this new line of work has exposed her to a world that was wholly foreign to her before. 'I never saw a pimp before. I never looked at a drug dealer and knew what they did for work before. I never had people asking me for blow jobs, and they would pay $500. I would never get asked all the time if I could go home and have sex with somebody for money. This was not how I grew up. This was not my way of life,' said Bree. She said a constant risk and worry is exposure to fentanyl at the strip club. She said the use of the synthetic opioid was so common among the clientele that she learned to recognize its distinctive scent. 'It smells like peanut butter,' said Bree. 'I carry Narcan with me, just little nasal injections of Narcan, and I told my boss, ‘Just in case anything happens, if you find me on the floor — I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t do drugs — and there’s Narcan in my backpack. That’s what you should treat me with.’' Bree is one of many flight attendants who spoke exclusively with NewsNation for this story, saying they are in crisis, struggling to make ends meet. Kim: Living in a shed with three children Like Bree, 'Kim' also flies with a major airline. She said her passengers would have no idea she lived in a shed with her three children with no running water. One night, she said the temperature fell to minus 20 degrees. Then, the power went out. 'I had taken all my kids basically into bed with me. And I kind of, you know, used hand warmers,' said Kim. ‘'We’re just gonna have a sleepover in mommy’s bed!’ That’s what you can tell them. You can’t say anything else. That was really rough. Actually, that was probably the worst experience of my life.' Like the other flight attendants NewsNation spoke with, Kim said she only gets paid for about half of the hours she actually works. At many airlines, there is no pay for waiting at the gate, during boarding or disembarking. 'In all reality, I’m paid less than a McDonald’s worker,' said Kim. 'You do training for six weeks, and you aren’t paid for any of that. Sometimes, you work 10 1/2-hour days, and you get paid five.' Kim said she had tried to never let the struggle show on her flights. Child care costs more than rent across 100 largest US metros 'People love me. When I get on the plane, I’m super nice, and no one would know anything about me unless I told them because my hair is done, my makeup is done. I have a uniform. I’m smiling, I’m interacting.' Kim has no plans to leave the industry. She described herself as financially 'trapped' due to the fact that she pulled a loan from her 401(k): 'If I were to quit right now, I would have to pay all that back, and it’s money I don’t have.' Kim has managed to provide for her children, moving them into a better living situation as she now looks for a second job on top of flight attending. 'Sometimes, I wish I didn’t wake up in the morning,' she says, but it is her children who keep her going. Nasstasja: Eating leftover passenger meals Nasstasja Lewis told NewsNation she will never forget receiving her first paycheck as a flight attendant for a top airline. 'My paycheck that I got was 250 bucks. And that could only buy probably one trip for me and my son at the grocery store and probably pay a bill that was lingering. So it was really, really hard. Ramen noodles were a thing,' said Lewis. She recalled wondering, ''How am I going to survive for the next month until I get paid again?' It was really, really scary.' Lewis said what attracted her to the job was the appearance of traveling to glamorous destinations and the promise of financial freedom. Instead, in order to prioritize her son, she has resorted at times to eating passengers’ leftover meals. McDonald’s largest fry producer closes factory; CEO blames $5 meals 'You have to just put your pride aside and say, ‘Hey, I have to eat, or I don’t.’ It does make you feel some kind of way during those times because you’re just like, 'What am I doing here?'' said Lewis. On top of the financial hardship, Lewis recalled an incident where she was physically shoved by a passenger. She said she made the decision not to report it. 'We’re already overwhelmed, and I just wanted to go home. It was a long trip. We had delays that day, and we were supposed to be home hours before, so I just took it and swallowed it and got home,' said Lewis. Flight attendant Nasstasja Lewis tells NewsNation she has eaten passengers' leftover meals to make ends meet. (Photo courtesy of Nastassja Lewis, founder th|AIR|apy) Lewis said the COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated challenges at the job. During the pandemic, the incidence of depression among cabin crew increased from 8% to 23%. Reports of stress similarly increased from 8% to 24%. Even before the pandemic, flight attendants faced a higher rate of suicide as well as alcoholism. According to the CDC, in 2012, flight attendants were found to have a suicide rate that is 1 1/2 times higher than the general population. Lewis said even as she posted smiling photos showing her job on social media, internally, she struggled with burnout and mental health. 'I experienced suicidal ideation during my time as a fourth, fifth-year flight attendant,' said Lewis. 'Feeling like you don't want to be here anymore. Depression, anxiety, all those things are impacted within this profession, and more needs to be done about it.' If you or someone you know needs help, resources or someone to talk to, you can find it at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline website or by calling 1-800-273-8255. People are available to talk to 24/7. Liam: Living in an apartment with 20 flight attendants Liam Horgan is a first-year flight attendant with United Airlines. He has lived on food stamps and in a 'crash pad' with 20 flight attendants in the Bay Area. 'I was paying $455 a month to share a two-bedroom apartment with 20 flight attendants,' said Horgan. 'The amount of things that would pile up, the amount of trash, the amount of bodies. It drops cold at night, but for it to be that cold outside and still be 80 degrees inside the bedroom because there are so many bodies and bunk beds. It was hard.' Liam Horgan, a first-year flight attendant with United Airlines, takes a selfie in an airport. (Photo courtesy of Liam Horgan, AFA union member) Many new hires work 'on reserve,' essentially a system of being on call. They can wait for several days for an assignment. Horgan described picking up as many hours as he could to the extent that 'there were certain months that I would only be home about 3 days a month.' Horgan added he would earn about $2,300 a month before taxes were taken out. 'I don’t think a single person who applied for this job knew what it was going to be like. Because I certainly didn’t know,' said Horgan. Horgan said that when new flight attendants exit training, they are assigned to a base, typically in a city with a high cost of living like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, New York or Washington, D.C. Rent has risen faster than wages in most US cities Horgan said it made an impression when management at his new base explained how he could apply for food stamps. 'I just feel like it’s kind of embarrassing that corporate greed has gotten to the point that management at these corporations are telling new hires, 'Hey, we know we don’t pay you a living wage, so here’s how you can apply for welfare,'' said Horgan. 'This is a career. This is not just starting out at an entry-level job.' Horgan said he had no concept of the extent of the mental health struggle he’d witness in his colleagues. One of the flight attendants he lived with in a crash pad attempted suicide. 'There’ve been a lot of mental health issues with a lot of flight attendants, especially new hires,' said Horgan. 'I’ve felt the pressure of it myself. There have been nights that I’ve sat in bed, almost crying myself to sleep, because I’m like, ‘What am I doing with my life?’ I was working retail, and I was not struggling to make ends meet like I am right now.' Flight attendant union president: 'They can’t survive' 'A week doesn’t go by that I don’t hear another heartbreaking story from a flight attendant, and it’s from every single base,' said Ken Diaz, United AFA Union president. Diaz described hearing reports of flight attendants all over the country experiencing 'bankruptcies, going through their life savings, taking loans against their 401(k)s. Some are living in their cars, credit cards to the max, marriages breaking up over financial debt. My heart breaks for them because it shouldn’t be this way. It shouldn’t.' The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) is the country’s largest flight attendants union.Diaz said he has been unable to reach an agreement with United after three years of negotiations. 'They’re asking for concessions during a time when they’re making billions in profits, billions,' said Diaz. United CEO Scott Kirby made nearly $19 million in 2023. 'We got these airlines through some difficult times. Whether it be bankruptcies during the eighties to the pandemic. We helped them get the government loans that allowed them to survive, and then, they just forgot about us afterward,' said Diaz. The median pay for flight attendants in 2023 was roughly $68,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, Diaz said that new hire pay is projected to be much lower. 'It was always tough in the past, but no one’s ever experienced the cost of living like it is today. And when you put that wage rate in today’s cost of living, it’s nothing. They can’t survive,' said Diaz. Flight attendants ‘fed up’ over stagnant wages: Union leader The AFA told NewsNation first-year flight attendants can expect to make about $23,000 at Frontier; $25,000 at Alaska Airlines; $26,000 at United Airlines; $31,000 at American Airlines; and $32,000 at Delta Air Lines. 'When people see the actual wage rate, they say, ‘Oh, those are good.’ What they don’t realize is United flight attendants do not get paid until that aircraft starts moving back from the gate. So the time they check in, the safety checks, in between flights, all of that is unpaid for. You’re only paid almost for half the time that you’re at work,' said Diaz. 'The morale is at the lowest point I have ever seen morale at United Airlines in the 28 years I’ve been here.' NewsNation reached out to United Airlines. It did not respond. Alaska Airlines provided this statement: 'Our goal is always to provide our flight attendants and employees with market-competitive wages and benefits. We appreciate how financially challenging the beginning of any career path can be and it’s one of the reasons we are so anxious to get a contract in place so our flight attendants can start benefiting from increased wages and improved benefits.' Flight attendants helping one another Thresia Raynor has been a flight attendant with Alaska Airlines for almost 17 years. She said she only realized how many of her colleagues were homeless when she’d offer to drive them home after a flight, only to find their 'home' was a car on the side of the road. 'Every day at my job, I have to drop off a girl from a trip who has no car and transportation to a place of homelessness, or take her to a car where she lives, or quite often share meals with her at work because she has no food and no money for food. That’s what I experience quite often in my job,' said Raynor. She cofounded a Facebook group called 'Alaska Airlines Flight Attendants Experiencing Hunger and Homelessness' and did not expect the response. Flight attendant Thresia Raynor was amazed by the response to the Facebook group she made to support her struggling peers.

(Photo courtesy Nastassja Lewis, founder th|AIR|apy)A message from a struggling flight attendant sent to the th|AIR|apy advocacy group. (Photo courtesy Nastassja Lewis, founder th|AIR|apy) 'Overnight, it was over a thousand members,' said Raynor. 'We just had no idea that there is that many people struggling. We wanted them to have a safe place to come and talk and be heard and just to scrape away all that shame and embarrassment. To have people come forward and talk about where they park their cars at night to sleep, how they go to back alleys in the back of restaurants. People sharing how they survive homeless and hungry.' Nastassja Lewis also turned her personal experience into the nonprofit Th|AIR|apy, which focuses on flight attendant mental health. It has grown to more than 17,000 followers on Instagram. Lewis said it provides an emergency crisis line that is used every single day. 'When you’re getting messages from your peers saying, ‘Thank you for this. It’s keeping me going,’ or ‘Thank you, I really needed someone to talk to at 2:30 in the morning, and you were here for me,' said Lewis, 'it lets me know the work we’re doing is really vital.' Bree: 'I don’t have a lot to show for it' Bree said as dangerous as working at the strip club can be, there is an unfamiliar feeling — a flood of financial relief — that she hasn’t felt in her years of flight attending. She said at the strip club, she could earn roughly $300 to $1,000 a night. 'When I would take home money at the end of the night, I would sit down on the floor, and I would just count it because I need to make sure that the time I put in was worth it,' said Bree. 'It feels good to finish a job in one day and be like, ‘Okay, I made rent,’ and then the next day, ‘Okay, I paid for all of our groceries.’' Bree described herself as 'resilient' and 'optimistic.' She said this has also been a time of taking stock. Bree is now several years into embarking on the 'dream' of flight attending. 'I’m a good employee. Any job that I’ve had, I’ve gone up the ranks quickly. I’m a hard worker. And I’m creative, I’m kind. I feel like I’ve been working so hard. And I don’t know, I don’t have a lot to show for it. I don’t even have my own car. I sold my truck to help pay for flight attending,' said Bree. When asked if she would recommend being a flight attendant, she hesitated. 'I did not realize how little I’d be getting paid. I’ve been poor before; this was a new level of stress. People selling their eggs or becoming sperm donors, flight attendant groups recommending selling your plasma if you have a longer layover in a certain city. We are literally trying to find parts of our body that will produce money. I don’t think it should be like this in this country.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/going-broke-flight-attendant-strips-on-the-side-to-survive/	2024-10-17T03:24:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/A234D08CA7C21AC04ACF8D5DEF51AC89.jpg?w=900
Vance says 'no' when asked whether Trump lost 2020 election	In the months since he became Donald Trump ’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance has repeatedly deflected questions about whether the Republican presidential nominee lost the 2020 election, saying he was focused on the future. During a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, where Vance was asked by a reporter about his lack of straight answers so far, he was more declarative. 'What message do you think it sends to independent voters when you do not directly answer the question ‘Did Donald Trump lose in 2020?’' the reporter asked, eliciting boos from the crowd before Vance responded, saying he has answered the question 'a million times.' 'No. I think there were serious problems in 2020,' Vance said. 'So, did Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use, OK?' The answer was the most specific Vance has been on the subject, and a departure from the series of evasions he has offered about the election Trump continues to say without evidence was decided fraudulently in favor of Democrat Joe Biden. During a debate with Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz this month, Vance was asked about the 2020 election but responded that he was 'focused on the future.' Vance’s refusal to say whether Trump lost was widely considered his weakest debate moment with Walz, the governor of Minnesota, who called the response 'a damning non-answer.' The campaign for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris quickly turned the exchange into a television ad. During an interview with The New York Times, Vance refused five times to acknowledge Biden won. Trump's continued denial that he lost the election to Biden is a widely held opinion among the Republican's base of supporters. He warned an audience in Nevada last week, 'We never want to have happen what happened in 2020.' Trump has continued to say without evidence that he expects his opponents to 'cheat' in the 2024 election and has urged his supporters to turn out in numbers to make his vote tally 'too big to rig.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-vance-says-no-when-asked-whether-trump-lost-2020-election/	2024-10-16T19:44:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67107aa1e62a12.77687679.jpeg?w=900
One Direction singer Liam Payne found dead in Buenos Aires: Repor...	(NewsNation) — Former One Direction singer Liam Payne died outside a hotel in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, local officials said. Buenos Aires police said in a statement Payne, 31, fell from the third floor of the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentina’s capital, resulting in 'extremely serious injuries.' Medics confirmed his death on the spot, the statement said. Pablo Policicchio, the spokesperson for the Security Ministry of Buenos Aires municipality, said in a statement to The Associated Press that Payne 'had thrown himself from the balcony of his room.' He said police were dispatched to the hotel in response to an emergency call about an 'aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.' Arriving police heard a thud and found Payne’s body in the hotel courtyard, Policicchio said. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, said on Argentina’s Todo Noticias TV channel that authorities were investigating the circumstances of his death and conducting an autopsy. He declined to answer further questions about the incident, including whether Payne jumped from the balcony or fell by accident. Florida continues building in high-risk areas Payne reunited with One Direction in Argentina earlier this month for a Niall Horan concert, according to Teen Vogue. He was one of five band members of One Direction, which formed in 2010 when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series 'The X Factor.' After each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands — even though they lost the competition. The band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits like 'What Makes You Beautiful.' They had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016. They had a loyal fan base, many of whom were teen girls, who became known as 'Directioners.' Once the group disbanded, Payne pursued a solo career, putting out the album 'LP1' in 2019. His last release was a single called 'Teardrops' in March. In 2021, Payne said he had problems with addiction and mental health during his One Direction fame. 'It was really, really, really severe. It was a problem,' Payne told 'The Diary of a CEO' podcast host Steven Bartlett. He said his early boy band days were filled with 'pills and booze' and 'moments of suicidal ideation.' One Direction fans flocked from across Buenos Aires to the Casa Sur Hotel after the news broke, forming lines that spilled into the street as police stood sentinel outside. Young women at the scene expressed shock and heartbreak. 'I didn’t think he was going to die so young,' 21-year-old Isabella Milesi told The Associated Press. Video showed dozens gathered on the cordoned-off street outside the hotel, with many recording videos on their cellphones. A forensic investigator was seen exiting the hotel, where Payne’s body remained Wednesday evening.

Oct 16 (Reuters) - Former One Direction singer Liam Payne died outside a hotel in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, local newspaper La Nacion reported on Wednesday. The 31-year-old British musician was found dead after falling from the hotel's third floor, it said, citing emergency services. Several witnesses at the hotel told TMZ Payne fell from his room at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel. It's unclear if the fall was intentional or accidental. Witnesses say Payne 'had been acting erratic in the hotel lobby earlier,' according to TMZ. He reportedly smashed his laptop and had to be carried back to his room.

FEMA leader: Misinformation about hurricane operations must stop	(NewsNation) — The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) now has four disaster recovery centers in western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. FEMA says it has approved disaster assistance for more than 75,000 households, but there is a lot of confusion regarding FEMA, militia groups and hurricane recovery in the state. Over the weekend, national media outlets reported on threats from armed militias to FEMA, causing them to temporarily pause work in North Carolina. Efforts have since resumed. One North Carolina resident, William Parsons, was arrested after posting a message on Facebook calling for people to 'overtake' the FEMA site in Lake Lure, claiming that the agency was withholding supplies from hurricane survivors. Parsons said after his arrest that the law enforcement agents who arrested him were lying. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters 'They want to sit here and lie and say I was carrying guns around. I had one gun on me, which was legally owned and sitting on the side of my hip, and I had a rifle and another pistol that were in my vehicle that were both lawful and legal to own,' Parsons said. Last Saturday in Carter County, Tennesee, which was also hit by the hurricane, volunteers with the International Alliance of Community Chaplains witnessed a group of people confronting and threatening FEMA workers, NewsNation local affiliate WJHL reported. Tracy Elder, president and founder of the International Alliance of Community Chaplains, said the people who confronted the FEMA workers were armed but didn't have their guns drawn. 'They had surrounded them, and there was a lady there that was yelling and threatening them,' Elder said. FEMA says they made operational changes to keep personnel safe. Deanne Criswell, FEMA's administrator, had a very specific message Tuesday. Group associated with polygamous sect builds fences on US Forest Service lands 'The ongoing spread of misinformation about operations is not OK. It has got to stop,' Criswell said. 'The federal family has been here, working side by side with the state since Day 1. These are people who put their lives on hold to help those who have lost everything.' Adam Smith, who leads a volunteer organization called Savage OPs, which is made up of special operations forces, nurse practitioners and civil engineers who help with hurricane recovery efforts, says the rumors about armed militias are directed at groups like theirs. Smith, a former Green Beret, said those threats are hurting their ability to get aid into the community. 'Misinformation is not coming from the ground up. I think the misinformation is coming from the top of FEMA down,' Smith said. 'When you have contractors that are afraid to go out into the areas they are supposed to work, and they are saying you have to carry, and you have to pack, you know, watch out people are going to come after you, not true — the people in the mountains might be suspicious of the government in general, but they are the most welcoming people you could possibly imagine.' Smith says they aren’t going anywhere and just want to help and support the community. 'The conversations that we've had with county state officials as well as National Guard personnel (is like), 'Hey, there's going to be a point when the transition happens, when the National Guard has to demobilize, when the 101st has to the mobilize,'' Smith said. 'And when that transition happens, we're not going to have those forces in the area and we're going to still be here. Moreover, we've we've been told, 'Hey, keep doing what you're doing.''	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/fema-leader-misinformation-hurricane-operations/	2024-10-16T12:33:21-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175616737-1-1.jpg?w=900
Florida continues building in high-risk areas	(NewsNation) — One week since Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida cleanup efforts are underway, and so is new construction. New data shows tens of thousands of new properties have been built in high-risk flood areas despite the growing risk of destructive hurricanes. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said hurricanes will not weaken the demand for homes on Florida's Gulf Coast because there's always going to be a demand to live in beautiful places. Hurricane fallout threatens to hinder voting More than 16 million people in Florida currently live in coastal counties and that number continues to go up despite the risks of hurricanes and flooding. Climate modeling firm First Street Foundation told NewsNation that real estate developers have actually built 77,000 new properties in high-risk flood areas since 2019. That's the highest number in the nation. Nationally, close to 300,000 new properties were built in high-risk flood areas between 2019 and 2023, a number that has been concerning for disaster-risk experts who say that in many states, it would only take one good-sized hurricane to break the entire insurance system. 'We got to a situation in our country that, while we don't lose as many lives in storms, our losses are rising because we have more people coming to the coast and we have therefore grown our exposure to these storms,' said Tracy Kijewski-Correa, a disaster-risk reduction specialist. 'We have a climate that's changing, that's going to be, regrettably, the perfect storm.' Kijewski-Correa said that while Helene was an outlier in terms of lives lost, the property damage from hurricanes could lead to some major changes. to insurance. Retired therapy dog goes back to work after Hurricane Milton 'That is probably going to require us to reimagine insurance, maybe in painful ways, and to start having more candid discussions about retreat,' she said. 'Because there will be, for some families, very little possibility of ensuring or building to withstand what might be coming.' The Federal Emergency Management Agency recently looked at what are called severe, repetitive lost properties, a designation that covers homes that have severely flooded more than once. The agency found that there are 45,000 of those properties in the U.S. at the end of 2022, with about 3,100 of those in Florida alone. Ratings for Morningstar DBRS said, in a report released this week, that it expects Hurricane Milton to be among the top five costliest natural catastrophes in the U.S., with insured losses approaching $60 billion. Experts warn we are entering a difficult situation with the insurance industry across the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, saying we need to build better before storms hit to mitigate the toll of damage.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/florida-building-high-risk/	2024-10-16T11:58:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177760605.jpg?w=900
Retired therapy dog goes back to work after Hurricane Milton	(NewsNation) — Before Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida, tornadoes ripped through the state, with St. Lucie County being one of the areas hit hardest. A local therapy dog, Ben, came out of retirement and now goes door-to-door, offering a head to pet for residents who are now picking up the pieces after the storm. 'He has come a long way, but I'm very proud of him, and he's a natural at what he does,' Olivia Chasse, Ben's owner, said. Report names ‘Immaculate Constellation’ UAP program: Journalist Ben worked at a nursing home, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, they stopped allowing visitors, so Chasse decided the time had come to let him 'just be a dog and enjoy life.' After the hurricane, though, Chasse saw people donating food, time and supplies and also wanted to help. 'I thought, 'Well, we've got something a little bit different that we can offer,'' Chasse said. '(Ben) got pretty excited about going to work. He knew he was going to get some back scratches.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/retired-therapy-dog-helps-after-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-16T07:36:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Milton.jpg?w=350
Delphi killings trial: State seeks to nix composite sketches	CARROLL COUNTY, Ind. – The state doesn’t want a pair of composite sketches that were highly publicized early in the investigation to be part of the Delphi murders trial. On Monday, Carroll County Prosecutor Nick McLeland filed a motion in limine asking the court to prohibit the admission of the sketches or any reference to them during the trial. 13-year-old Abby Williams and 14-year-old Libby German. (Credit: Family) The motion refers to a pair of widely circulated composite sketches of the Delphi suspect. Law enforcement released two sketches—one in July 2017 and another in April 2019.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } The second sketch showed a suspect who looked considerably younger than the person seen in the original one. The sketches were based on the recollections of witnesses and were released to the public to generate tips about the February 2017 murders of Abby Williams and Libby German. For several years, online sleuths attempted to match various suspects to the sketches. The initial sketch released in 2017 (left) and the revised sketch released in 2019 (right) McLeland’s motion argued that 'a composite sketch is not relevant, admission would result in undue prejudice, confuse or mislead the jury, or is impermissible hearsay, and the witnesses who participated in the preparation of composite sketch(s) will not be presented by the State for the purpose of in-court identification of the defendant.' McLeland went on to argue that the sketches were not related to the identification of Allen as a suspect and weren’t relevant to his trial, which started with jury selection this week in Allen County. Allen is charged with four counts of murder in connection with the girls’ deaths near the Monon High Bridge. McLeland argued that 'the witnesses who assisted in the preparation of composite sketches of the Bridge Guy would testify that they did not see the person depicted in their sketch for a sufficient length of time to allow them to positively identify the defendant.' Richard Allen Mugshot - Oct. 13, 2024 He added that it was the state’s belief that Allen’s defense intended to 'use composite sketches from the investigation as demonstrative evidence and for impeachment purposes.' The sketches were not 'instrumental in identifying' Allen, McLeland wrote. The motion contended that the 'prejudicial effect' of admitting the sketches would far outweigh their 'probative value' in court. Accused Gilgo Beach killer Rex Heuermann due in court The motion asks the court to order the defendant, his counsel and witnesses to 'refrain from mentioning, commenting, or making any reference whatsoever, either directly or indirectly, to composite sketches without first obtaining permission of the Court outside the presence and hearing of the jury.'

Family pushes to free Menendez brothers after nearly 30 years	(NewsNation) — Nearly two dozen family members of Erik and Lyle Menendez, the two brothers convicted of killing their parents in 1996, are holding a news conference Wednesday in Los Angeles in hopes it will move the needle in the brothers' appeal of their conviction. Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón announced earlier this month that he was reviewing new evidence in the case against the brothers. New evidence allegedly includes a letter from Erik Menendez to a cousin before the killings. In it, Erik Menendez details some of the sexual abuse he survived at the hands of his father, Jose Menendez. Plus, new allegations against Jose Menendez from a second, young boy claiming to have been raped by him at 14 have come into the spotlight. Accused Gilgo Beach killer Rex Heuermann due in court Family stands by Menendez brothers Family members have said the Menendez brothers should not have been charged with murder, but manslaughter — but that wasn't an option. The brothers' extended family will advocate for the brothers’ release from prison during the news conference as prosecutors review new evidence to determine whether they should be serving life sentences for killing their parents. Erik Menendez, now 53, and his 56-year-old brother, Lyle Menendez, are currently incarcerated in state prison without the possibility of parole after being convicted of killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion more than 35 years ago. Lyle Menendez, who was then 21, and Erik Menendez, then 18, admitted they fatally shot their entertainment executive father, Jose Menendez, and their mother, Kitty Menendez, in 1989. However, they argued self-defense, saying they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent the disclosure of the father’s long-term sexual molestation of Erik. While testimony and evidence about the sexual abuse was allowed in the brothers' first trial that ended in a hung jury, it was not allowed in the second trial that ended in guilty verdicts. 'I always believed that they were sexually molested,' Karen Vandermolen Copley told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo earlier this month. 'My sister Diane lived with them, and they have evidence that was not allowed. We have always supported the boys once we knew and understood the facts.' The extended family’s attorney Bryan Freedman previously said they strongly support the brothers’ release. Comedian Rosie O’Donnell also plans to join the family Wednesday. Texas man facing execution in shaken baby syndrome case awaits clemency ruling New evidence sparks case review Earlier this month, Gascón said there is no question the brothers committed the 1989 murders, but his office will be reviewing new evidence and will make a decision on whether a resentencing is warranted in the notorious case that captured national attention. The brothers’ attorneys said the family believed from the beginning they should have been charged with manslaughter rather than murder. Manslaughter was not an option for the jury during the second trial that ultimately led to the brothers’ murder conviction, attorney Mark Geragos previously said. The case has gained new traction in recent weeks after Netflix began streaming the true-crime drama 'Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.' The new evidence includes a letter written by Erik Menendez that his attorneys say corroborates the allegations that he was sexually abused by his father. A hearing was scheduled for Nov. 29. Prosecutors at the time contended there was no evidence of any molestation. They said the sons were after their parents’ multimillion-dollar estate. In a recorded conversation in a Netflix documentary, Erik Menendez claimed the spending was to 'cover up the horrible pain of not wanting to be alive.' Jurors in 1996 rejected a death sentence in favor of life without parole. NewsNation reached out to relatives and the brothers' attorney for comment. However, they said they would not comment on the case until after Wednesday's news conference.

Accused Gilgo Beach killer Rex Heuermann due in court	(NewsNation) — The man accused of killing six women over the course of 30 years near Gilgo Beach, New York, is due in court Wednesday. Rex Heuermann will go before a Suffolk County judge at 9 a.m. EDT, marking his first court appearance since July. He pleaded not guilty in June to all charges filed against him. Texas man facing execution in shaken baby syndrome case awaits clemency ruling Heuermann is charged with murder in connection with the deaths of six women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Costello, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla. He was initially charged with murder in the deaths of the first four women, and prosecutors later charged him in the deaths of Taylor and Costilla. Heuermann, an architect, lived across the bay from where officials discovered the bodies. His attorney said he’ll seek to separate the cases so the charges relating to the first four women are tried independently from the two most recent charges. Police spent the past 14 years investigating the deaths of at least 10 people — most of whom were sex workers — whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway near Gilgo Beach on Long Island.

Harris peppered with questions by Charlamagne tha God’s audience	Vice President Harris was peppered with questions Tuesday about her plan for Black Americans from radio host Charlamagne tha God and his listeners in an interview that’s part of a late-campaign media blitz before Election Day. The interview began with Charlamagne asking Harris to respond to criticism about the quality of her responses to questions and the notion that she is repetitive, which she characterized as 'discipline.' She also addressed 'the weight of the moment' in her role running for president against Trump. 'I feel an extraordinary weight of responsibility right now to do everything I can,' Harris said. 'When I go to bed at night, in addition to my prayers, I will ask, ‘Have I done everything I could do today?’' 'This is a margin-of-error race. It's tight,' she added. 'But I'm going to win. I'm going to win.' Throughout the interview, Harris shared her position on topics such as reparations — which she said she supports studying — building up Black homeownership and the opportunity to grow generational wealth. The interview was an opportunity for Harris to speak directly to Black voters, a group that polls show overwhelmingly support her over Trump. But some of the interview questions also revealed some disenchantment about voting and whether the candidate could fulfill the promises she’s making on the campaign trail. At one point, Charlamagne pointed out that Harris is facing the issue of misinformation in this year’s election, particularly on her history as a prosecutor. 'One of the biggest pieces of misinformation, one of the biggest allegations against you, is that you targeted and locked up thousands of Black men in San Francisco for weed,' Charlamagne said. 'Some say you did it to boost your career. Some say you did it out of pure hate for Black men. Please tell us the facts.' Harris immediately denied the allegations and instead said she was 'the most progressive prosecutor' in California. She then pledged to work to decriminalize marijuana if elected president. 'I know exactly how those laws have been used to disproportionately impact certain populations, and specifically Black men,' Harris said. Questions around Black men and what Harris plans to do for them popped up repeatedly during the interview — unsurprising as polls show her support among the demographic slipping while Trump’s numbers are improving. Harris released an 'Opportunity Agenda for Black Men' on Monday, but one caller asked her why she didn’t do so sooner and why support for Black men is only sought out during election cycles. 'I've been in this race about 70 days. You can look at all my work before those 70 days to know that this, what I'm talking about right now, is not new, and is not for the sake of winning this election,' Harris responded. 'This is about a long-standing commitment, including the work that I've done as vice president and before, when I was senator.' Harris’s time as a senator came up at another point in the interview when a caller from Nevada asked what she plans to do to address police brutality and its disproportionate impact on Black Americans. The vice president quickly pointed to her work on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) during her time in the upper chamber. 'We couldn't get the votes in Congress,' she admitted. 'But what we did when we came in office and during the time that I've been vice president, is we passed an executive order … that says that for federal law enforcement, the following things have to happen, which we, for the first time, put in place: no knock warrants, barring chokeholds, a national database for us to collect information and track police officers who have broken the law.' 'I'm still going to always work on getting the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed,' she added. 'Part of the work that I'm doing as a candidate for president of the United States includes lifting up those candidates who are running, either for reelection or for the first time to Congress, who are supportive of what we need to do on all of the issues we've been discussing.' While the interview was Harris’s chance to speak directly to Black voters, Charlamagne also pressed her on recent comments that she said she would not do anything specifically for Black people. Harris denied making the statement, reminding Charlamagne of the start of the conversation around misinformation. Later, she added that she is running 'to be a president for everybody.' 'But I am clear-eyed about the history and the disparities that exist for specific communities and I'm not going to shy away from that,' Harris said. 'It doesn't mean that my policies aren't going to benefit everybody, because they are. Everything I just talked about will benefit everybody.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-peppered-with-questions-by-charlamagne-tha-gods-audience/	2024-10-16T02:16:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24289047511075-e1729028318895.jpg?w=900
Georgia judge blocks ballot hand-count rule from taking effect be...	(NewsNation) — A new Georgia election rule that would require a hand-count of ballots on election night will not take effect before November’s contest, a state judge ruled. In a decision late Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Judge Robert McBurney agreed to block the rule’s application, writing that the public is 'not disserved by pressing pause.' 'This election season is fraught; memories of January 6 have not faded away, regardless of one’s view of that date’s fame or infamy,' McBurney wrote in an eight-page ruling. 'Anything that adds uncertainty and disorder to the electoral process disserves the public.' The rule, passed by the Republican-led State Election Board, was set to go into effect Oct. 22, just two weeks before the election, and after early voting in the state is underway. Under the rule, three poll workers at each facility would have been required to count the physical ballots — not votes — 'separately' and 'independently' in stacks of 50 until all three counts matched. The hand-count would be completed on election night unless a scanner had more than 750 ballots by the end of voting, at which point a poll manager could push counting to the next day. Election officials and poll workers vocally objected to the change, warning that hand-counting ballots is overly burdensome and prone to error. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has called the rule 'misguided' and suggested it would delay the reporting of election results. Additionally, the state would have little time to train poll workers under the new guidance. During a bench trial over the matter Tuesday, a lawyer for the Cobb County Board of Elections told McBurney that 444 county poll officers would have to be trained to comply with the new rule. Lawyers for the State Election Board pushed back by saying the panel was tasked by Georgia’s Legislature with defining election rules — and put under no time constraints to do so. McBurney said in his ruling that his decision was not final and would be further detailed at a later date, but not until after the election. He said that the county election board made a sufficient showing of irreparable harm, pointing to the chaos that could ensue if the '11th-and-one-half hour' rule was implemented. 'Our Boards of Election and Superintendents are statutorily obligated to ensure that elections are ’honestly, efficiently, and uniformly conducted,’' he wrote. 'Failure to comply with statutory obligations such as these can result in investigation by the SEB, suspension or even criminal prosecution.' He added, in parentheses, 'While the latter is far-fetched, it is not an impossibility in this charged political climate.' The judge did not issue a decision on five other rules, which were discussed at the hearing Tuesday, nor weigh the merits of the hand-count rule. The Cobb County election board did not seek to halt implementation of the other rules. The Democratic National Committee intervened in the case. Following McBurney's ruling, DNC acting co-Executive Director Monica Guardiola, Georgia Democratic Party Chair Rep. Nikema Williams and Harris-Walz Deputy Campaign Manager Quentin Fulks issued a statement in support of the decision. 'From the beginning, this rule was an effort to delay election results to sow doubt in the outcome, and our democracy is stronger thanks to this decision to block it,' they said. 'We will continue fighting to ensure that voters can cast their ballot knowing it will count.' McBurney’s decision is the second major ruling he made Tuesday. Earlier, the judge established that county election officials may not delay or decline to certify election results, rejecting a challenge from a Fulton County election board member who refused to certify during Georgia’s spring primary. That board member is one of at least 19 Republican county officials in the state who have refused to certify election results since 2020 in a marked increase from previous years, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Georgia is one of seven critical battleground states that could shape the election's outcome. McBurney is also weighing two other new State Election Board rules, which would allow for a 'reasonable inquiry' before election certification and let election workers 'examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections.' He has not issued any decision on the matter.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-judge-blocks-ballot-hand-count-rule-from-taking-effect-before-election/	2024-10-15T19:39:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/c75854e51ef346528ac6c8dd13ca9ff4-e1677590583917.jpg?w=900
Georgia judge blocks ballot hand count rule from taking effect be...	A new Georgia election rule that would require a hand count of ballots on election night will not take effect before November’s contest, a state judge ruled. In a decision late Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Judge Robert McBurney agreed to block the rule’s application, writing that the public is 'not disserved by pressing pause.' 'This election season is fraught; memories of January 6 have not faded away, regardless of one’s view of that date’s fame or infamy,' McBurney wrote in an 8-page ruling. 'Anything that adds uncertainty and disorder to the electoral process disserves the public.' The rule, passed by the Republican State Election Board, was set to go into effect Oct. 22, just two weeks before the election, and after early voting in the state is underway. Under the rule, three poll workers at each facility would have been required to count the physical ballots – not votes – 'separately' and 'independently' in stacks of 50 until all three counts matched. The hand count would be completed on election night unless a scanner had more than 750 ballots by the end of voting, at which point a poll manager could push counting to the next day. Election officials and poll workers vocally objected to the change, warning that hand-counting ballots is overly burdensome and prone to error.

ISIS-K orchestrated foiled Election Day terror plot: Report	(NewsNation) — The Afghan branch of the Islamic State, ISIS-K, orchestrated an Afghan man's foiled Election Day terror plot, two senior U.S. officials briefed on the matter told NBC News. Afghan native Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, was arrested in early October and accused of planning to target large groups of people on Nov. 5. He told investigators he and a co-conspirator — whose identity has not been released — planned to die as martyrs. Tawhedi first arrived in the United States in September 2021. In the weeks leading up to his arrest, the Oklahoma City resident bought AK-47 rifles, liquidated his family’s assets and purchased one-way tickets for his wife and child to travel home to Afghanistan, charging documents revealed. Did migrants from Hamas cross into US after Oct. 7? Those same documents show that Tawhedi, who officials say consumed Islamic State propaganda, was in contact with an ISIS affiliate named 'Mailk.' A family member of Tawhedi was arrested and charged by French law enforcement this past weekend for allegedly planning a similar terror scheme, according to NBC News reporting. NewsNation has reached out to federal officials about these reports but has not yet heard back. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/hold-isis-k-orchestrated-foiled-election-day-terror-plot-sources/	2024-10-15T16:49:32-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/656d2230f211b4.02876582-e1724104809132_d640ae.jpeg?w=900
Majority find 2025 Social Security COLA bump insufficient: Survey	(NewsNation) — The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment for recipients in 2025, the smallest such increase since 2021. On average, Social Security retirement benefits will increase by about $50 per month starting in January, a minor increase for most. And recipients are feeling the pinch, with a recent survey from the Motley Fool showing a majority (54%) view this year's COLA adjustment as insufficient. A similar number, 50% — have considered going back to work to make ends meet. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits An even wider majority, 81%, agreed that the 2025 COLA will help 'very little' or not 'at all' with key expenses like food, housing and energy costs. Social Security cost-of-living adjustments have varied over the past few years. Here’s how they have changed: 2025: 2.5% 2024: 3.2% 2023: 8.7% 2022: 5.9% 2021: 1.3% The recent drop is due to a cooling pace of inflation, which is good for the overall economy but may leave retirees struggling to cover costs. Often, retirees rely heavily (32%) or exclusively (28%) on payments despite Social Security being designed to cover 40% of the average worker's salary. Medicare open enrollment begins Tuesday Most respondents, 71%, don't think the formula to determine the COLA accurately reflects how retirees experience inflation. How is Social Security COLA determined? Each year, the government determines the COLA by comparing the average inflation rate from July to September to the same period the year before. That calculation is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Some senior advocacy groups want the government to determine the COLA based on the CPI-E, a different inflation index specifically for seniors, arguing it would more accurately reflect the spending patterns of those 62 and older. The vast majority of Social Security beneficiaries, roughly 75%, are retired workers who received an average monthly check of $1,920 as of August. That’s about $80 more than the year prior. What’s the average amount of credit card debt Americans carry? Social security shortfall Thursday’s COLA announcement comes as the national social insurance plan faces a looming financial shortfall. In roughly a decade, Social Security recipients could see their benefits cut by 21% if Congress doesn’t take action. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have vowed to protect the program and promised not to slash benefits, though neither has offered many specifics. The 2025 COLA increase will be reflected in your January Social Security check.

Millennials doing better financially than baby boomers were: Stud...	(NewsNation) — Contrary to popular belief, millennials are better off financially than previous generations at the same age, according to a new study. LendingTree found that millennials ages 26 to 41 had a median net worth of $84,941 in 2022 — more than Gen Xers ($78,333) and baby boomers ($58,101) at similar ages after adjusting for inflation. The findings suggest millennials’ net worth is 8.4% higher than Gen Xers’ and 46.2% higher than baby boomers’ at the same age. Tracking debt: Which generation owes the most? 'The scars from the Great Recession and the pandemic have helped shape millennials’ views on money, forcing them to be more focused on their finances than other generations have had to be,' said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief credit analyst. Millennials have more money partially because they're better educated than their predecessors, allowing for superior employment opportunities. The report found that midpoint millennials — those born in the middle of the generation — earned a median cumulative income of $446,570 between 2014 and 2023. By comparison, midpoint baby boomers earned about 20% less, $362,330, between 1980 and 1989 after adjusting for inflation. With interest rates falling where should I keep my savings? But it's not all good news for millennials. One of the reasons their finances are in better shape is because they're delaying major milestones like marriage and homeownership, the report noted. Millennials are also more likely to live at home than previous generations — a win for their wallets but potentially a negative for overall life satisfaction. As for debt, LendingTree found millennials have nearly twice as much as baby boomers did at the same age but because their assets are worth significantly more, millennials come out ahead on net worth. One important caveat: More millennials (12.7%) had a negative net worth compared to Gen Xers (11.5%) and baby boomers (11.9%) at similar ages. That finding is supported by other research pointing to a widening wealth gap within the millennial cohort. What about the cost of housing? The cost of housing is one area where millennials are worse off. That's true for both renters and home buyers. In 1990, midpoint baby boomers paid a median monthly rent of $1,174 adjusted for inflation. That's $307 less than millennials' current median rent of $1,481. Homeownership is also more expensive today. A 20% down payment on a median home purchase in 2024 is $85,960 for midpoint millennials compared to $57,107 for baby boomers in 1990. However, millennials have benefitted from lower mortgage rates, which were much higher, around 10%, in 1990. Overall, millennials ages 25 to 34 spent an average of $15,429 on shelter in 2022 — 26% more than baby boomers did at the same age. Are millennials really doing better financially? Academics and media organizations have continued to debate whether younger generations are worse off than their parents — and that discussion is likely to continue. On the whole, recent research suggests younger generations in the U.S. are doing better than many expected compared to a few years ago, and, inequality within, not between, generations is growing. In August, the Wall Street Journal highlighted 'the dramatic turnaround in millennials' finances.' The report cited research showing the median household net worth of older millennials skyrocketed from $60,000 in 2019 to $130,000 in 2022. 'The turnaround has been so dramatic that millennials — mocked at times for being perpetually behind in building wealth, buying homes, getting married and having children — now find themselves ahead,' WSJ wrote. Researchers at the University of Cambridge found that U.S. millennials were not 'universally worse off' than baby boomers in a 2023 study but noted a 'vast and increasing wealth gap.' 'The wealthiest millennials now have more than ever, while the poor are left further behind,' the study's lead author Rob Gruijters said in a statement. He added: 'Individuals with typical working-class careers, like truck drivers or hairdressers, used to be able to buy a home and build a modest level of assets, but this is more difficult for the younger generation.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/millennials-financially-baby-boomers/	2024-10-15T15:05:16-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/PayingBillsGettyImages-1313653794.jpg?w=900
Mystery drones flew over US base	(NewsNation) — New details are emerging about drones that flew over U.S. military bases last year, though there is still no explanation for where they came from. Air Force officials confirmed several drones flew over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December of 2023, an incident that has been brought up in a number of congressional hearings and even brought to the attention of President Joe Biden. Langley houses one of the Defense Department's largest and most important military infrastructures and is home to some of the nation's most advanced fighter jets. ‘Once in a lifetime’ comet viewing in Utah — here’s how It's still not clear exactly what the objects were, and if the Pentagon has an answer, it has not released that information publicly. A recent Wall Street Journal report says that the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which is tasked with studying reports of unidentified aerial phenomena, was involved in the investigation alongside the FBI. That means the Pentagon had at least some indication that these might be something we can't fully explain. Exclusive video given to NewsNation by someone who lives near the base shows lights in the sky with the person who took the video describing the drones being the size of cars. Some of the new reporting has corroborated that description. According to The Wall Street Journal's reporting, Pentagon officials who have seen the drones in person say they were about 20 feet long, traveling at around 100 mph or faster and at an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Some speculate that the drones were not part of intelligence-gathering efforts by a foreign adversary like China or Russia, in part because they were out in the open with no apparent effort to hide them. Former Air Force pilot Ryan Graves, an advocate for pilots who have seen UAPs, told NewsNation the objects don't fit usual patterns. Maybe advanced civilizations aren’t all that advanced: Scientist 'We are seeing these objects blinking with white lights, not in the strobe pattern that one would expect due to FAA regulations, but patterns that don't seem to meet anything I'm aware of,' he told NewsNation. 'Additionally, the objects apparently have been lit up while they're operating over the base itself. So it did not appear, at least from the information I received, that these objects were trying to conceal their location or presence.' Senators who spoke to NewsNation also said they are not sure what the objects are either. NewsNation has reached out to the Pentagon for comment but has not received a response.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/mystery-drones-us-base/	2024-10-15T11:50:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/DroneLangley.jpg?w=900
What is the 'blue wall,' and what does it mean for 2024 election?	(NewsNation) — With less than a month until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris is making stops this week in three states that experts say are critical to winning the White House. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, is visiting Michigan on Tuesday for an event with Charlamagne tha God and another one with Black entrepreneurs in Detroit following a Monday trip to Pennsylvania. Next, she’s set to travel to Wisconsin. How to register to vote Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump also stopped in Pennsylvania this week for a rally in Pittsburgh. All three states are part of the so-called 'blue wall,' a set of states that have typically voted for Democrats in presidential elections since 1992. Which states are part of the blue wall? California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin are included as part of the 'blue wall.' Of these, California is the largest, as it has 54 electoral votes, followed by New York with 28. Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, especially, are top priorities for candidates in the 2024 election. Trump, in 2016, flipped the states to Republican, but Biden was able to win them back in 2020. ‘False allegations’: Man arrested near Trump rally speaks out Could Trump break the blue wall? NewsNation partner The Hill writes that Harris and Trump are polling within close margins of each other in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Harris has a 0.7% lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, according to Decision Desk HQ/The Hill’s poll aggregate, while Trump has a 0.8% advantage in Michigan and 0.1% more than the vice president in Wisconsin. 'There’s no getting around the fact that those three states in the so-called blue wall are pivotal to both campaigns,' Al Mottur, a Democratic strategist and bundler at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, told The Hill.

McDonald's largest fry producer closes factory; CEO blames $5 mea...	(NewsNation) — 'Do you want fries with that?' America's largest fast food chain may have a fry issue as its largest supplier shuts off production and cuts costs at its Connell, Washington, plant. Lamb Weston, an Idaho-based company, announced the closure and a 4% cut in its workforce at the beginning of the month. The news comes as part of a restructuring plan expected to generate nearly $55 million of pre-tax cost savings for the company in 2025. Listeria meat recall hits Walmart, Target, more stores 'Lamb Weston is confident in the world’s ongoing love of fries — the closure of one of our older facilities accounts for less than 5% of our production capacity, so this adjustment simply helps address a current supply-and-demand imbalance,' Lamb Weston spokesperson Teresa Paulsen said in a statement to TODAY.com. Now, Tom Werner, the CEO of Lamb Weston, is blaming McDonald's $5 meal deal, which was introduced back in May. The meal deal is supposed to provide an affordable option for American families, especially during a time when inflation remains the highest in recent history. 'Restaurant traffic and frozen potato demand, relative to supply, continue to be soft, and we believe it will remain soft through the remainder of fiscal 2025,' Werner said. He said the steps to close one of its plants and cut costs is an effort to remain proactive to improve operating efficiency, profitability and cash flows.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/food/mcdonalds-french-fries-production/	2024-10-15T10:43:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/GettyImages-94500987-1-e1708631223656.jpg?w=800

Nevada says volleyball match will go on despite players' forfeitu...	(NewsNation) — The University of Nevada in Reno said an upcoming women's volleyball match will still be held despite the team's players saying they would forfeit the match. As Outkick.com first reported Monday, the Nevada volleyball team decided via player vote to forfeit the Oct. 23 game against the San Jose State Spartans following reports that the team has a transgender woman on its roster, redshirt junior Blaire Fleming. 'We, the University of Nevada Reno women’s volleyball team, forfeit against San Jose State University and stand united in solidarity with the volleyball teams of Southern Utah University, Boise State University, the University of Wyoming, and Utah State University,' the team said in a statement provided to Outkick. Georgia university leaders ask NCAA to ban transgender women from sports Hours later, the university acted in opposition to the 'majority' of its women's volleyball team, providing a statement to Outkick saying the game would go ahead. 'The players’ decision and statement were made independently, and without consultation with the University or the athletic department. The players’ decision also does not represent the position of the University,' the school said. 'The University and its athletic programs are governed by the Nevada Constitution and Nevada law, which strictly protect equality of rights under the law, and that equality of rights shall not be denied or abridged by this state or any of its subdivisions on account of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, ancestry or national origin. 'The University is also governed by federal law as well as the rules and regulations of the NCAA and the Mountain West Conference, which include providing competition in an inclusive and supportive environment. 'The University intends to move forward with the match as scheduled, and the players may choose not to participate in the match on the day of the contest. No players will be subject to any team disciplinary action for their decision not to participate in the match.' Jean-Pierre blocking Kirby from White House podium, report says Southern Utah was the first team to forfeit against San Jose State before its Sept. 14 match. Boise State, Wyoming and Utah State followed suit, surrendering their games on Sept. 28, Oct. 5 and 23, respectively. The teams did not cite Fleming or any other reason for their forfeiture. Fleming has played in all 12 of San Jose State's games this season and has been part of the Spartans' squad for three seasons after one season at Coastal Carolina in 2020-21. San Francisco, Saint-Mary's, Fresno State, Colorado State, San Diego State, and Nevada Las Vegas have all played against the Spartans since Southern Utah's decision. The Spartans' next game is Thursday at New Mexico. San Jose State team co-captain Brooke Slusser claimed the school tried to sweep 'under the rug' the fact that Fleming is transgender after a report in April brought it to public consciousness. Slusser transferred to San Jose State in 2023 after playing two seasons at Alabama. Transgender swimmer Lia Thomas fails in challenge to rules that bar her from elite women’s races 'When that first article came out, it was quite literally just a media meeting talking about, 'Don't make comments. If media people come up to you, it's not your story to tell,'' Slusser told Outkick on Monday. 'And that was really it. It wasn't, ‘How do we feel about this? Are we OK?’ It was how to handle the media and not make it look like there's a problem, and almost just the feeling of just sweeping it under the rug, and that was really it.' Slusser is among numerous female athletes suing the NCAA for alleged violations of Title IX by allowing transgender athletes to play on women's teams. She supports the decision of teams to forfeit. 'There's obviously a part of me that it's sad because there's only so many volleyball games you get in your career. On the other hand, I'd be doing the exact same thing,' she told Outkick the Morning on Monday. 'I fully support every school that is deciding to find the courage, take this stance and not play against us because those are the steps in the right direction of women standing up and finding that courage to say 'No, this isn't OK.''	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/nevada-volleyball-match-forfeit-trans-athlete/	2024-10-15T09:35:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175714174.jpg?w=900
Delphi murders trial: Defense claims hair found with victim didn'...	ALLEN COUNTY, Ind. – Defense lawyers for Richard Allen made a startling admission during Tuesday's jury selection. Allen's defense team revealed that hair was found in Abby Williams' hand that didn't match Richard Allen. That's the first time that information has been made public. Attorney Andrew Baldwin made the comments during 'mini opening statements' preceding jury selection. Allen is charged with four counts of murder in connection with the deaths of Abby and her friend Libby German in February 2017. Indiana State Police announced his arrest in October 2022. 14 jurors seated so far in Delphi murders trial While prosecutors say an unspent bullet found at the scene is linked to a gun owned by Allen and cite dozens of confessions from him, Allen's defense argued those confessions were made under duress and weren't trustworthy. They said Allen confessed to details from the crime that were inaccurate. He also confessed to other crimes that didn't happen, his defense team said. During Tuesday's proceedings, three previously selected jurors were dismissed from the trial, bringing the total number of selected jurors down to 11. One was removed because of childcare issues, another over health concerns. A third was dismissed as well. By noon, four new jurors were selected, bringing the total to 15. The group now includes 12 jurors and three alternates, with one alternate still needing to be seated. The current makeup of the jury is 10 women and five men. Due to the high-profile nature of the case, Allen’s defense team asked for a change of venue. Special Judge Fran Gull, appointed by the Indiana Supreme Court to oversee the case after the original judge recused himself, determined that was logistically challenging. What to know ahead of the Delphi murders trial She decided to bring in jurors from Allen County and have them transported to Carroll County for the trial. Jury selection began Monday. The jurors will be sequestered for about a month. More than 100 people were expected to testify between the defense and prosecution. Gull is scheduled to hear some evidentiary motions in the afternoon. Wednesday will mark a break in the trial before an additional hearing on Thursday in Allen County concerning the admissibility of widely circulated composite sketches in the case. The state filed a motion asking the sketches to be excluded from the trial. Opening statements are scheduled to begin on Friday, when the proceedings shift to Carroll County.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/delphi-murders-trial-defense-claims-hair-found-with-victim-didnt-match-richard-allen/	2024-10-15T09:07:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Allen-Co-courthouse-VO-ININDOF1ENC002_mxf_00.04.10.20.jpg?w=900
Pandas arrive in the US. Next stop is the National Zoo	WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Zoo's long dark panda drought is coming to an end. Eleven months after the zoo sent its three wildly popular pandas — Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — back to China, a new pair of bears arrived in the United States on Tuesday. They will be transported from Dulles International Airport in suburban Virginia to the zoo. A pair of three-year old giant pandas, named Bao Li and Qing Bao, have left a research facility in the southwestern Chinese city of Dujiangyan and will soon be flown to Washington, according to a statement by the China Wildlife Conservation Association. 'Food prepared for the trip includes corn bread, bamboo and carrots, as well as water and medicine,' the statement said, adding that the partnership will 'make new contributions in protecting global biodiversity and enhance the friendship of the people from the two countries.' Once the bears arrive in Washington, there will likely be an extended quarantine and acclimation period before they are introduced to the public. On Monday evening, the zoo's website posted an alert that the entire facility would be closed Tuesday, without giving a reason. The lead article on the site still said the pandas would be coming sometime before the end of the year. Bao Li (precious vigor) and Qing Bao (green treasure) arrive in Washington as part of a new 10-year agreement with Chinese authorities. The previous deal expired last year, leading to some concern among American panda-lovers that Beijing was gradually pulling its furry friendship ambassadors from American zoos amid rising diplomatic tensions. Breeding pairs in zoos in Memphis and San Diego had already returned to China earlier and the four pandas in the Atlanta zoo left for China last week. That anxiety turned to optimism last November when Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly stated a desire to continue the panda exchange programs. This year, a new pair of bears has been delivered to the San Diego Zoo, while another pair has been promised to San Francisco. In Washington, National Zoo officials remained conspicuously silent about negotiations for a new panda agreement, but they expressed optimism about striking a new deal and launched a multimillion-dollar renovation of its panda enclosure in anticipation. Then in late May, zoo director Brandie Smith teamed up with first lady Jill Biden to announce that Bao Li and Qing Bao would be arriving by the end of this year. The Chinese announcement said the National Zoo had sent 'three experienced keepers and veterinary experts' to China to assist the transport and accompany the bears. Zoo officials on Monday declined to confirm the Chinese announcement. Zoo spokesperson Jennifer Zoon said in an email, 'For the safety of animals and staff, we are not able to confirm any details at this time.' But signs at the zoo and on its social media site have heralded the planned return of the pandas and panda-themed merchandise still dominates the gift shops. 'The giant pandas are an iconic part of the Washington, D.C., story, both for locals and incoming travelers alike,' said Elliott L. Ferguson, II, president and CEO of Destination DC. 'The interest and excitement associated with their return directly benefits the entire city, bringing further interest and visitors to our hotels, restaurants and other attractions.' The exact terms of the deal are still unclear; under previous 10-year agreements the Chinese government receives $1 million per year, per bear. Any cubs born in overseas zoos are typically returned to China before they reach age four. Pandas have become one of the unofficial symbols of the nation's capital, dating back to 1972 when the first pair — Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing — were sent as a gift from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai following President Richard Nixon's historic diplomatic visit to China. Later, a rolling series of 10-year cooperation agreements was struck. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, credited the decades of cooperation with advancing research into panda preservation and breeding. During the lifespan of these agreements, giant pandas have been reclassified from an endangered species to merely vulnerable. 'The current round of cooperation will focus on prevention and treatment of major diseases, and protection of habitats and wild giant panda populations,' Liu said in an email. 'We hope the arrival of the pandas will inject fresh impetus into exchanges between China and the U.S., and help to stabilize the broader bilateral relationship as well.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-politics/ap-the-pandas-are-coming-the-pandas-are-coming/	2024-10-15T08:52:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670e90c0126171.83675344.jpeg?w=900
Two giant pandas arrive in DC from China	(NewsNation) — Two giant pandas have landed in Washington, D.C., as they head toward the National Zoo less than a year after a previous pair were returned to China. The pandas are on loan from China to the U.S. and the zoo is closed to the public Tuesday to allow for the pandas' safe arrival. The male and female pair are named Bao Li and Qing Boa and are said to be lively 3-year-old pandas who enjoy climbing. Kidney recipient comes full circle with job at dialysis center Pandas first came to the National Zoo in 1972 after President Richard Nixon traveled to China to open diplomatic and trade relations between China and the U.S. It was the start of what's been called panda diplomacy, with China using the animals to achieve diplomatic goals. In 2000, China sent Mei Xiang and Tian Tian to the National Zoo and the pair had a cub, Xiao Qi Ji, in 2020, and all three were returned to China in November 2023. With the panda family's departure, Zoo Atlanta, which is set to return its pandas this year, became the only zoo in the U.S. to house giant pandas. This summer giant pandas returned to the San Diego Zoo, and now the National Zoo will once again be home to the species that is considered a national treasure in China. Hurricanes Helene, Milton devastate Florida animal rescue The black and white bears are considered vulnerable, and U.S. zoos are only allowed to import giant pandas if they can ensure China uses half the loan fee for conservation efforts. Bao Li, the male panda, has a D.C. connection, as his mother Bao Bao was born at the National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute in 2013. Upon arrival at the zoo, the pandas will be quarantined for at least 30 days and after that will be given a few weeks to settle into their habitat before being viewed by the public.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/giant-pandas-arrive-dc/	2024-10-15T07:55:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/20240516-817A0262-03RP.webp?w=900
Hurricanes Helene, Milton devastate Florida animal rescue	(NewsNation) — The double dose of damage caused by two major storms in less than two weeks has locals in Florida questioning their ability to rebuild. That includes efforts at a Bradenton Beach wildlife sanctuary, where several animals did not survive the hurricanes. Floridians are still reeling from Hurricane Milton, which has killed at least 23 people across the state. Couple Gail and Ed Straight run the nonprofit Wildlife Inc. Education and Rehabilitation Center about 60 miles south of Tampa. Ed Straight, who is on dialysis and was away during the storms, has worked tirelessly with volunteers to rescue and rehabilitate about 150,000 injured or orphaned animals over the years. Now, the rehab center faces a double disaster. Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment Hurricanes Helene and Milton hit the sanctuary hard. The first storm’s floodwaters surged into the Straights’ home within minutes. Although Gail Straight stayed put during Helene, she was forced to evacuate ahead of Milton. As for the animals, most were evacuated before Hurricane Helene, including multiple 100-pound tortoises. Despite the owners' efforts, they lost some animals to the storms. 'It got really scary pretty quick,' Gail Straight said. 'It's the fastest I've ever seen it. We’ve had hurricanes here before, but not like this one.' Helene’s flooding destroyed thousands of dollars worth of food and equipment. Mold took over the sanctuary, and Gail was electrocuted while trying to move appliances when the floodwaters started to recede. The couple also lost two cars. Now, they don’t know if or when they’ll be able to rebuild. After dedicating more than 30 years to rescuing animals for free, the ordeal could put Gail Straight into lifelong debt, she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/florida-hurricanes-helene-milton-animal-wildlife-inc-sanctuary/	2024-10-15T06:22:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/ECA63689D66F794B02C3DFD38B7A9D7B.jpg?w=900
Massive meat recall includes hundreds of products sold at Walmart...	(NEXSTAR) — Check your fridge and freezer: A massive meat recall linked to possible listeria contamination has impacted hundreds of ready-to-eat meals sold at major grocery store chains across the U.S., including Walmart, Trader Joe's and Target. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released an updated list of affected products, some featuring popular brand names like Dole, Taylor Farms, Great Value and Michelina's. The recall, initiated by BrucePac, involves more than 9.9 million pounds of pre-cooked meat and poultry items that were produced from June 19, 2024, to October 8, 2024. Major home improvement retailer files for bankruptcy, announces sale plans The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service discovered the issue during routine testing, when Listeria monocytogenes was found in poultry samples. Subsequent testing traced the source of the bacteria back to BrucePac’s ready-to-eat chicken. The affected products were shipped to distributors across the country and later reached restaurants and other food service providers. They appeared in a variety of items, from frozen dinners to pre-made salads. Photos provided by USDA Aside from Walmart, Trader Joe's and Target, some other retailers affected by the recall include: 7-Eleven, Albertson's, Aldi, Amazon Fresh, H-E-B, Kroger, Meijer, Publix, and Save Mart.

Man arrested outside Trump rally says it's 'all false allegations...	(NewsNation) — Vem Miller, the Las Vegas man arrested Saturday for possessing multiple guns and fake press passes outside of a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump, tells 'Dan Abrams Live' he had no such things on him. 'I didn't have fake passports. They were valid passports. I didn't have fake IDs. That's a false accusation,' Miller said. A self-proclaimed 'kindergarten kid when it comes to guns,' Miller said he was stopped and arrested because gun laws vary from Nevada to California. 'I've never owned guns in in California. I've owned guns in Nevada. And in Nevada, you're allowed to have the mag loaded up in the gun. Apparently, in California, they have to be separated,' he said. Who is Vem Miller, man arrested outside Trump rally? While that legal difference is true, NewsNation's Jesse Weber pointed out that whether the guns were loaded or not, bringing a weapon to a former president's rally after two previous attempts on his life would be reasonable cause for law enforcement concern. Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, gestures while walking onstage for a campaign rally on October 12, 2024 in Coachella, California.Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Calhoun Ranch in Coachella, California, on October 12, 2024. Miller, a registered Republican, pointed to police misconduct and his own past as the founder of 'The America Happens Network,' which he claims has gotten him some death threats for 'exposing corruption.' 'Are you saying that you were specifically targeted by the sheriff in law enforcement, or that you were picked up for a reason or being made a scapegoat?' Weber asked. 'I'm being made whatever you call it, a targeted scapegoat. But nothing they did is lawful. I did not do anything that they were claiming I did,' Miller responded. What we know about arrest outside Trump’s California rally He reportedly claims to be a sovereign citizen, an anti-government group that Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco associated with him during a Sunday news conference. Miller also pointed to reports of his release on a $5,000 bond Sunday as false, telling NewsNation 'there was never a bail in the situation at all, whatsoever.' Multiple outlets, including USA Today and Fox News, reported his bail release. Federal agencies said the Republican nominee 'was not in any danger' at the event, and have not released any further information about pursuing higher charges against Miller. Miller, however, has promised a lawsuit against those who arrested him. 'The sheriff is going to be investigated, is going to lose his position,' he said. 'The deputy sheriff that was part of this is going to be investigated, is going to lose his position. There's going to be a massive lawsuit.' Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco also joined 'Dan Abrams Live' on Tuesday, saying his agency did all it needed to do to prevent any violence at the former's president's rally. New suits filed Monday accuse Diddy of sexual assault On Sunday, Bianco told a room full of media: 'If you are asking me right now, I probably did have deputies that stopped the third assassination attempt.' Federal agencies haven't announced any movements to classify Miller's arrest as a third assassination attempt, as Trump wasn't even at the rally when the arrest happened. It's something Bianco told NewsNation he can 'understand ... in a factual perspective and context.' 'I believe that they are still going to be looking into Mr. Miller and why he could have been there, or making sure it was legitimate,' Bianco said. 'But we are outside of their investigation, and ours was strictly the stop with the guns, and that's what we arrested him for.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Detroit police officer killed in shootout with other officers	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — An officer with the Detroit Police Department is dead and two others are injured after a mental health call turned into a shootout. Around 2:26 p.m. Monday, DPS got a 911 call for a 'suicide in progress' on East Davison Service Drive and Saint Aubin Street in Detroit. The caller was identified as a member of the DPS Special Response Team, who was off-duty. He was threatening suicide and 'asking for suicide by cop,' according to Police Chief James E. White. Responding officers heard shots and White said the suspect was shooting in the air. The officers retreated and took cover behind a vehicle. The suspect shot the back of the vehicle multiple times, hitting two officers, one in the leg and one in the thigh. Whitehall buys $49,000 drone as privacy questions linger One of the officers returned fire, killing the suspect. White called it a 'very tragic situation.' 'He was struggling with a mental crisis. Tragically, we are not immune to mental crisis, we’re just like everyone else. Our officers deal with this every single day,' White said at a news conference. He said the 45-year-old man who died had been suffering with a 'very serious degenerative condition' and had returned to work just over a week earlier, after working on a restricted schedule due to his illness. He had been working with the department for 13 years. The two officers who were shot were in stable condition, according to White. The mayor noted their injuries were not life-threatening. Murder trial of man in Cash App founder's death begins Detroit Mayor Mike Duggin commended the courage of the responding officers. 'It’s a reminder of the courage that the officers of this department show every day. They went to that scene knowing they were going to be confronted by a highly trained and armed officer in the department who was having a significant mental issue,' Duggin said. Grief counseling will be made available and White said the department will work with the families involved to 'make sure they get what they need.' Michigan State Police is handling the investigation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/detroit-police-officer-killed-in-shootout-with-other-officers/	2024-10-14T18:23:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Detroit-Police-Department-030420.jpg?w=650
With interest rates falling where should I keep my savings?	(NewsNation) — High savings rates have been a bright spot in the recent interest rate environment but with the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates further, savers are likely to see their returns dip. Last month, the Fed slashed its benchmark interest rate for the first time in over four years and additional rate cuts are expected. Further cuts could mean lower rates on mortgages, car loans and credit cards, but also lower returns for savers who have been able to get 4% to 5% on their cash in recent years. But even if yields on certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) drop, they'll still be attractive saving options for many. Is now the time to lock in a good CD rate? 'It may not be as much as you were getting pre-rate cut, but it's still a lot more than you would have if you just left (your money) in something that's not going to yield as much interest,' said Elizabeth Ayoola, a personal finance expert at NerdWallet. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), the national average annual percentage yield (APY) on savings accounts was 0.46% as of 09/16/2024. By comparison, the best high-yield savings accounts have APYs that are about ten times higher. Here's what to know about falling interest rates and your savings. Are high-yield savings accounts still a good idea? High-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) are like traditional savings accounts, except they pay a higher interest rate which means your money grows faster. That will still be true even if the Fed cuts rates further. 'I don't think high-yield savings accounts ever become 'unattractive,'' Ayoola said. 'They are evergreen in the sense that they usually offer higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts do.' As it stands now, several banks are offering HYSAs with APYs between 4% and 5%. Over a year that can mean much better returns than a traditional savings account: $10,000 in a traditional savings account at 0.46% APY Interest earned: $46 $10,000 in a HYSA at 5.0% APY Interest earned: $500 Unlike investments in stocks or bonds, HYSAs are essentially risk-free. Just make sure you're using an FDIC-insured bank, which protects your money up to $250,000. The other benefit of a HYSA is liquidity. You can pull out or transfer money without penalty, which makes it a popular place for savers to keep their emergency fund. Do I have to pay taxes on my high-yield savings account? The main caveat is that HYSA interest rates can change at any time, so your return could be lower tomorrow than it is today. Another thing to keep in mind: HYSAs typically offer better rates than brick-and-mortar bank accounts but if you want to build wealth, investing in the stock market provides higher average returns. 'It's not recommended that you put tons of money in a high-yield savings account. Usually, it's used for things like an emergency fund or a short-term goal,' Ayoola said. Don't forget, the interest you earn from your HYSA will get taxed so prepare to fork over some of those returns to Uncle Sam. Are certificates of deposit (CDs) a better option? Unlike HYSAs, which have interest rates that fluctuate, certificates of deposit (CDs) allow savers to lock in a fixed rate for a set period. The downside is that your money is tied up for the duration of the CD. With interest rates likely to fall in the coming months, CDs are one way to guarantee a return at today's rates. As of late September, the median APY on a 6-month CD was 4.55%, down from 5.00% in January, according to NerdWallet. The rate on a 1-year CD was slightly better, 4.60%. The math works out like this: A $10,000 deposit on a 6-month CD at 4.55%: You are guaranteed a return of roughly $225 after six months. A $10,000 deposit on a 1-year CD at 4.60%: You are guaranteed a return of $460 after one year. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits Whether CDs are better than a HYSA will depend on your financial goals. CDs offer less liquidity and generally have penalties for early withdrawals, meaning it's harder to access your funds in a pinch. Then again, if you know you won't need the money for several months, CDs offer a stable return while HYSA yields could drop. 'If — and when — rates do drop as fed cuts continue, you'll still have the same rate locked in,' Ayoola said. 'At the moment, short-term CDs are still relatively attractive.' What about the stock market? High-yield savings accounts and CDs are low-risk options compared to stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and cryptocurrency but they potentially come with less upside. The S&amp;P 500 is up 34% over the past year and nearly 23% year to date. Historically, the average annual return on the stock market is around 10% per year, significantly higher than the typical HYSA yield. The bottom line is that HYSAs are savings accounts, not investments. They are a stable option for those hoping to earn interest on cash that might otherwise be sitting dormant in a traditional bank account but they aren't intended to hyperdrive your retirement savings.

'Consumers could put money needed for a medium-term goal in a CD and then they could put money for an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account,' she said. 'It doesn't have to be either or.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/interest-rates-falling-savings/	2024-10-14T14:41:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/6446a16b9873b3.00956252.jpeg?w=900
New suits filed Monday accuse Sean 'Diddy' Combs of sexual assaul...	This article mentions sexual assault. If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-4673. (NewsNation) — Six lawsuits were filed Monday against music producer and rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs that allege he sexually assaulted two men and two women between 1995 and 2021. These suits were filed anonymously in the Southern District of New York. Among them is one by a man who says he was a minor at the time of the assault. 'Defendant Sean Combs routinely recruited individuals to parties, drugged them, and then sexually exploited them,' according to a complaint. A lawsuit filed by a man from North Carolina states Combs was talking to him about the music industry when he ordered the then 16-year-old to drop his pants. 'Don’t you want to break into the business?' the lawsuit alleges Combs asked him. Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment Then, the lawsuit said, Combs grabbed and began feeling the teenager's genitals. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani tells 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that if the accusations made by a minor against Diddy were included in his federal indictment, much of his defense’s argument about consenting relations between adults would go out the window. But that's only if these civil suits influence the trial — which Rahmani said would only happen if the victims come forward and testify. Monday’s suits were filed by Texas attorney Tony Buzbee, who previously said he’s representing 120 people who’ve experienced sexual misconduct by Combs. 'There’s an overarching theme here, as you probably can see, which is basically Sean Combs feels like he can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants to do it,' Buzbee said in an interview with NBC News before filing the documents. In addition to multiple civil suits filed, the first being one by Combs’ ex-girlfriend Cassandra 'Cassie' Ventura, the producer is also criminally charged with sex trafficking and racketeering. A grand jury indicted Combs, who is now being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn despite attempts by his defense attorneys to get him freed on bail. NewsNation has reached out to a representative for Combs. Erica Wolff, Combs’ lawyer, said in a previous statement to NewsNation that the rap mogul 'cannot address every meritless allegation in what has become a reckless media circus.' 'That said, Mr. Combs emphatically and categorically denies as false and defamatory any claim that he sexually abused anyone, including minors,' Wolff said in a statement. Another suit filed Monday alleges Combs raped a woman when she was a college freshman in a locked hotel room in 2004. Combs, the lawsuit said, invited the woman, identified as 'Jane Doe,' and a friend to a party there, where he gave them drinks and told them to snort cocaine. The woman said in the lawsuit that Combs forced her friend to perform oral sex on him and threatened to have them both killed if they didn’t do what he wanted. Diddy accuser’s lawyer: Combs used oil, knife In a different lawsuit, a separate Jane Doe says Combs attacked her in the bathroom at a 2005 party celebrating the late rapper Biggie Smalls’ music video, 'One More Chance.' Combs, according to the lawsuit, brought the woman into the bathroom and started kissing her. The woman tried to pull away, she said, but he slammed her head against the wall, and she fell to the floor. When she tried to get away, Combs hit her and raped her, the woman says. After, Combs allegedly told her not to tell anyone, 'or you will disappear.' A man identified as John Doe said that Combs gave him an alcoholic drink at his white party in 2006 that he believes included a drug that made him sick. Then, the lawsuit said, Combs pushed John Doe into a van and sexually assaulted him. Other incidents detailed in lawsuits include a man stating he was forced to give Combs oral sex in a Macy’s stockroom in Manhattan’s Herald Square, as well as one where a man says the producer gave him a drugged beverage. At one point, the man, who says multiple men assaulted him, saw Combs naked above him, according to the lawsuit.

Dad accused of fatally shooting man found with missing child	LONOKE COUNTY, Ark. (KARK) – Officials in Arkansas said a man is facing a murder charge after a confrontation turned deadly early Tuesday morning. According to authorities, deputies with the Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office responded to a home shortly after 1 a.m. after a juvenile was reported missing. The deputies were told on the way to the home that Aaron Spencer, the father of the juvenile, had found the juvenile in a car with Michael Fosler, according to officials. Authorities said there was an altercation between the two men which led to Fosler being shot. Officials said Fosler was pronounced dead at the scene. Man accused of threatening FEMA workers with assault rifle Deputies said they took Spencer into custody on a preliminary charge of first-degree murder, and he was taken to the Lonoke County Detention Center. As of Monday, no formal charges have been filed against Spencer, and no additional details have been released. A woman claiming to be Spencer's wife claimed they had a no-contact order for Fosler, accusing him of stalking their child. In an online fundraiser, the woman said Spencer began driving around to search for their child after discovering she was missing. She explained that her husband happened to pass a man driving with their child in his vehicle and chased him. 'The chase ended in an accident. Aaron was able to retrieve our child alive, but in the process, he was attacked and did what he had to do to protect himself and our minor child,' the woman wrote. US soldier given 14-year sentence for plotting to help ISIS She added that they are working to 'retain a legal team' to help keep her husband, a combat veteran, 'home with us where he belongs.' 'We are private people, so all of this being public has been very difficult,' she wrote on Facebook last week. Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley told USA Today that Fosler, the man who was killed, was arrested earlier this summer for internet stalking of a child and sexual assault, but was out on bond. He added that his agency was investigating what led to the Oct. 8 incident.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/arkansas-dad-accused-fatally-shooting-man/	2024-10-14T11:50:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1801085827.jpg?w=724
Who is Vem Miller, man arrested outside Trump rally?	(NewsNation) — Over the weekend, authorities in Riverside County, California, stopped an armed man outside a rally for former President Donald Trump. Vem Miller, 49, was taken into custody by local sheriff's deputies after multiple IDs and weapons were allegedly found in his vehicle outside the rally in Coachella Valley. Authorities described the incident as having stopped a third assassination attempt against Trump. Delphi killings: Timeline of events in Richard Allen case In July, Trump was grazed on the ear after a gunman opened fire at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. One rally attendee was killed and two more seriously injured. In September, Secret Service agents fired at a man who was allegedly waiting outside Trump's golf course with weapons.

6 jurors seated so far in Delphi murders trial	ALLEN COUNTY, Ind. – Six people have been chosen to sit on the jury in the Delphi murders trial after jury selection began Monday in Allen County. What to know ahead of the Delphi murders trial Richard Allen faces four counts of murder in connection with the February 2017 deaths of Abby Williams and Libby German near the Monon High Bridge. Indiana State Police announced his arrest in October 2022. 13-year-old Abby Williams and 14-year-old Libby German. (Credit: Family) Around 300 summons were sent to prospective Allen County jurors. Eventually, 12 jurors and four alternates will be selected. The three-day process of culling the jury pool began in Allen County on Monday. During the proceedings, six jurors were seated. Six additional potential jurors were excluded, including one individual who claimed to have psychic abilities. Six jury seats remain open, as do positions for four alternates. The jury will be sequestered for up to a month as it decides Allen’s fate. During Monday's proceedings, Carroll County Prosecutor Nick McLeland told prospective jurors that Allen is the 'Bridge Guy' who killed the girls and whose image was widely seen in a grainy still taken from Libby German's phone. Richard Allen Mugshot - Oct. 13, 2024 The prosecution said an unspent round found next to the bodies matches a gun owned by Allen. The state also said Allen has confessed dozens of times. Defense attorney Bradley Rozzi said Allen made those confessions under duress. He also suggested infighting between federal and local law enforcement left some evidence unanalyzed. The prosecution seemed to indicate it may not have conclusive DNA or phone data or weapon evidence. The defense appeared to lay the groundwork to keep Allen off the witness stand. Jury selection is ongoing.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/6-jurors-seated-so-far-in-delphi-murders-trial/	2024-10-14T09:03:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Allen-Co-courthouse-VO-ININDOF1ENC002_mxf_00.01.32.14.jpg?w=900
Georgia sheriff calls deputies after Burger King got order wrong	(NewsNation) — A Georgia sheriff up for reelection in his county was seen on body camera videos asking his deputies for help after Burger King got his order wrong. The footage from March 4, 2023, was obtained by WSB-TV last week and was also posted on Facebook by the sheriff's opponent in the upcoming election, David Cavender. It shows deputies responding to a Burger King in Mableton and approaching Cobb County Sheriff Craig Owens Sr., who is in his truck. 'Hey, do me a favor,' Owens told one deputy in the video. 'I need to get, all I need is the owner name of whoever owns this damn facility or the manager.' Referring to a passenger in the vehicle, Owens says, 'I wanted her a Whopper, no mayo, cut in half, right?' He then says he doesn't need his money back, but to 'find out who owns this place so I can do an official complaint.' Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment Employees locked themselves inside the restaurant but opened the doors for the three deputies. A deputy told the assistant manager that 'nobody is in trouble. We just want to get some names' and that there wouldn't be a report written. After getting the name of the manager and the company that owns that Burger King location, the deputy brought this information to Owens. Mike Dondelinger, who is running for chief deputy with Cavender, called Owens' actions an 'abuse of power' as well as a waste of resources. 'I’m shocked the sheriff feels so flippant about this issue that he would have deputies run lights and sirens, placing citizens at risk and his deputies at risk, just so he could get information from a business owner that clearly could have been followed up on another day,' Dondelinger said. Medicare open enrollment begins Tuesday However, Owens characterized what happened in the video as a 'business dispute call.' 'The type of call referenced in the video is a business dispute call. This is a call that ANY citizen can make, and law enforcement will respond,' Owens said Friday in a statement posted to Facebook. Owens said he was not in uniform during the incident and went through the drive-thru as a regular patron. 'At no point did I indicate my position, nor did I ask the responders to do anything that they would not, had not, or have not done for anyone else who makes a business dispute call,' Owens said. While Owens said the call is 'being politicized' by Cavender to win votes, he apologized. 'Whether as a Command Sergeant Major, or a major in the Cobb Police Department, or as sheriff, I have always worked to build confidence and trust in leadership,' Owens said in the statement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/georgia-sheriff-deputies-wrong-order-burger-king/	2024-10-14T07:56:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/police-lights-e1707156650724.jpg?w=800

Florida aims to fix hurricane-caused power outages by Tuesday	(NewsNation) — Nearly a week after Hurricane Milton left a trail of destruction in Florida, power should be restored to all residents by Tuesday night, according to state and utility company officials. President Joe Biden visited the hard-hit areas of Saint Petersburg and Saint Pete Beach on Sunday, where he announced $600 million of aid after Hurricanes Milton and Helene. Residents face an uphill battle as they rebuild from the back-to-back storms that devastated Florida communities. Aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Biden is on the way as many locals struggle with debris, power outages and fuel shortages. What $35 trillion in US national debt means for Americans Restoring electricty after Helene, Milton Power restoration efforts are progressing, but more than 400,000 Floridians remained in the dark as of 9 a.m. ET Monday, according to poweroutage.us. Electricity has been restored to 3.25 million customers by crews working around the clock with help from out-of-state teams, Gov. Ron DeSantis said. Duke Energy and Florida Power &amp; Light both said they expect to have power restored to nearly all customers in all impacted areas by Tuesday night, except for those in areas heavily damaged by flooding, tornadoes or storm surge. Biden also announced $612 million in funding to strengthen the power grid, with $94 million earmarked for Florida. Both state and federal leaders are pushing to restore full power as quickly as possible. Fetterman unworried by tight Pennsylvania race Gasoline shortages Fuel shortages remain a critical challenge as long lines persist at the few operating gas stations in the hardest-hit areas. About a quarter of all of the nearly 7,900 gas stations in the state of Florida didn't have gas or power Thursday. Damage to a pair of major fuel ports in the area created the largest barriers to fuel. Port Tampa Bay's fuel terminals lost power after Hurricane Milton, which prevented fuel distribution to the community. Power had been restored to all seven private fuel terminals as of Friday. The state has also set up free fuel distribution sites in Bradenton, St. Petersburg and Plant City, offering up to 10 gallons per vehicle. For many, those free fuel stations have been a lifeline, helping families stay connected and mobile during the crisis. DeSantis said more sites will open soon and additional fuel is on the way via the Tampa shipping port. Debris cleanup Debris removal could take up to a year, despite the nearly 3,000 workers assisting with cleanup, DeSantis said. Biden has approved 100% federal reimbursement for those efforts for 90 days. 'The (removal of) debris has to be 24/7 over this 90-day period,' DeSantis said while speaking next to a pile of furniture, lumber and other debris in Treasure Island, an island city near St. Petersburg that has been battered by both recent hurricanes. 'That’s the way you get the job done.'

Hurricane Helene victims vow to rebuild and return	(NewsNation) — One couple lost the Asheville, N.C. business they spent ten years building. Another became instantly homeless when part of their apartment complex along the Swannanoa River was swept away. All four are alive and thinking about rebuilding their lives – and processing what happened. 'It was terrifying,' Jacqueline Twohig told 'NewsNation Prime' about the flooding river that destroyed two buildings of the riverfront apartment complex in which they lived. 'At first we thought it was going to be just a little flooding in the apartment,' she said. That notion quickly changed when she and her husband, Doug Frieders, saw the water covering the 20-foot stilts on which the complex’s buildings sit. New tropical disturbance pops up in the Atlantic, NHC monitoring 'We got out as fast as we could,' which means scaling a cement barrier on the complex and then walking through ankle-deep water to their car. Todd and Megan Walsh didn’t have to run for their lives, but they quickly realized how different their lives would be when they returned to Asheville to find their business, Atomic Furnishing and Design, destroyed. 'This is our dream business,' said Todd Walsh. 'We started from nothing, and we built it to this point, and it's kind of unreal that it's gone. It's hard to look at the pictures of what it was like before, and now seeing what it's like.' 'The day we saw the river over top of our store, we knew immediately it was gone,' said Megan Walsh. 'We immediately started thinking, okay, we need to secure a new space,' for not just their business but the dozens of vendors who occupied the space, she said. Still recovering from Helene, SC county rattled by cluster of 8 earthquakes 'Most of our vendors are week-to-week, month-to-month. We care about them greatly. Their kids come into our stores. They play with our children. And so our main priority and focus right now is to find a new, secure, new place and get back to business as soon as possible,' she added. Meanwhile, Twohig and Frieders are not only dealing with the loss of their home but the fact that two of their neighbors were killed when two of the apartment complex’s six buildings were washed away. 'The survival guilt is immense,' she said. 'It just feels awful. We knew them. We saw them every single day. Had we known that this was going to be the case, that the apartment was going to fully collapse, we would have gone banging on doors.' FEMA makes ‘operational adjustments’ following safety concerns in North Carolina Jacqueline Twohig and Doug Frieders have set up a GoFundMe page and so have the Walshs to help their neighbors, vendors and friends to rebuild and return. 'We are, 100%, going back to Asheville,' said Twohig. 'We want to help rebuild. Asheville is a wonderful city. We love it. We love the mountains. We love the art. We love everything there,' she added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/hurricane-helene-victims-vow-rebuild-return/	2024-10-13T19:46:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/83220109_1728399582493092_r.jpeg?w=900
What we know about arrest outside Trump’s California rally	(NewsNation) — The Las Vegas man arrested Saturday for possessing multiple guns and fake press passes outside of a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump never made it inside while Trump was there, an official said Sunday. The man was released on a $5,000 bail on Sunday, less than a day after his arrest. Federal agencies said the Republican nominee 'was not in any danger' at the event and the incident is under investigation. In a Sunday press conference, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a noted supporter of Trump, addressed the media and discussed safety measures taken at the event in Coachella, California. Man arrested outside of Trump's SoCal rally on gun charges Man arrested outside Trump rally Authorities stopped 49-year Vem Miller at a checkpoint outside the Coachella, California, rally just one minute before it was scheduled to start on Saturday. Trump was not yet at the venue. Bianco said Miller presented fake VIP and press presses at the sheriff's office's inner checkpoint, leading to a further search of his vehicle. That vehicle was unregistered and had a homemade license plate that Bianco said could connect him to the anti-government 'Sovereign Citizen' extremist movement. Inside Miller's black SUV was a shotgun, a loaded handgun and a high-capacity magazine along with his fake entry passes. Miller had already successfully passed through an outer checkpoint and gave officials 'all indications that he belonged there,' Bianco clarified. The outer perimeter was not manned by Riverside deputies. Trump says national abortion ban is ‘off the table,’ but ‘we’ll see what happens’ Riverside County Sheriff’s Office personnel took Miller into custody and transferred him to the John J. Benoit Detention Center, where he was released on Sunday on $5,000 bail. Miller is a registered Republican in Nevada, a fact which Bianco said he 'couldn't care less' about. 'It’s fringe one way or the other, I couldn’t care less,' Bianco said. 'It's people trying to do harm, and thank God we prevented it.' Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Calhoun Ranch in Coachella, California, on October 12, 2024.Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, gestures while walking onstage for a campaign rally on October 12, 2024 in Coachella, California. Sheriff: Deputies 'probably' prevented assassination attempt Previous reporting cited Bianco as saying the incident was 'probably' a third assassination attempt on the former president, a statement he echoed after some back-and-forth during Sunday's press conference. 'I will be honest with you, I don’t remember saying that, but it certainly would be something that I did say,' he told a reporter, instead focusing on the prevention of any potential bloodshed. 'I certainly wouldn’t want to be saying, after the fact, that I wish we would have done something to prevent that shooting. And there is absolutely no way that any of us are going to truly know what was in [Miller's] head,' Bianco said, adding that 'it’s all going to be speculation.' Few Americans believe Donald Trump will concede election: Poll Minutes later, Bianco changed his tune again, saying: 'If you are asking me right now, I probably did have deputies that stopped the third assassination attempt.' He clarified that the FBI and United States Secret Service would have to lead the investigation classifying Saturday's arrest as an assassination attempt. Neither organization has done so. 'From my perspective … the firearms charges is what we arrested him for and booked him on. Anything further will come from the federal government and, quite frankly, I don’t know if we will be a part of that,' Bianco said. 'Trump was not in any danger': Federal officials The U.S. Attorney's Office released the following statement just minutes after the press conference concluded: 'The U.S. Attorney’s Office, U.S. Secret Service, and FBI are aware of the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office’s arrest on Saturday. The U.S. Secret Service assesses that the incident did not impact protective operations and former President Trump was not in any danger. While no federal arrest has been made at this time, the investigation is ongoing. The U.S. Attorney’s Office, U.S. Secret Service, and FBI extend their gratitude to the deputies and local partners who helped ensure the safety of last night’s events.' Attempts on Trump's life The arrest comes as multiple high-profile attempts of violence against the former president have taken place during the heated election cycle. On July 13, Trump was grazed in the ear by a bullet coming from the gun of 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. Crooks was shot and killed by a member of the Secret Service. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, is currently being prosecuted on gun charges after he hid out near a Florida golf course in an alleged attempt to have a clean shot at the former president and current Republican presidential nominee on Sept. 15.

What $35 trillion in US national debt means for Americans	(NewsNation) — The United States currently carries nearly $35.7 trillion in federal debt, which is only expected to grow regardless of whether former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris is elected next month, political analysts believe. A recent analysis completed by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the national debt could grow by $3.5 trillion over the next 10 years under Harris. The Democrat has vowed at campaign rallies that her economic plan, which focuses on the middle class, would be fully offset by her plan to raise the corporate tax rate and her plans for taxing the wealthy, the Associated Press reported. The same analysis found that the national debt could add another $7.5 trillion onto the national debt should Trump be elected – a number that could grow to $15.2 trillion under some scenarios, the AP reported. Trump says national abortion ban is ‘off the table,’ but ‘we’ll see what happens’ What is the US national debt? In basic terms, the national debt is the amount of money that the country has borrowed to cover the outstanding balance of its expenses over time. According to the U.S. Treasury, in each fiscal year when the country's revenue does not cover its spending, a budget deficit is created. The federal government borrows money to cover the deficit by selling securities such as Treasury bonds, bills, notes and other securities. The national debt is the ongoing accumulation of this spending plus the interest that is owed to investors who purchased the securities, the government says. How the US national debt breaks down According to an analysis completed by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, the $35 trillion of debt owed by the United States equals the value of the economies of countries such as China, Germany, Japan, India and the United Kingdom. It also amounts to $266,000 being owed by each American household or $104,000 worth of debt for every person living in the United States. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits The organization found that even if each U.S. household contributed $1,000 per month to pay off the debt, it would take 22 years to pay off. It also estimates that the $35 trillion would cover four years of college education for every graduating American high school senior for the next 103 years. The federal debt tally has grown year-over-year, including from 2023, when, according to figures, the U.S. government spent $6.1 trillion while taking in only $4.4 trillion from sources such as corporate tax, payroll tax and individual income tax. This resulted in a deficit of $1.7 trillion. Meanwhile, the government continued to pump money into expenditures such as Medicaid and Obamacare ($707 million), Medicare ($832 million) as well as other mandatory spending programs on which federal officials doled out $893 million. Social security topped the spending at $1.32 trillion, according to federal figures. Meanwhile, interest payments on the national debt were expected to reach $892 billion in 2024, according to reporting by Econofact, which is more than the U.S. was projected to spend on defense. It is almost one-third higher than the interest payments totaled in 2023, which is a combination of higher interest rates and a jump in the amount of debt the country is carrying, the report indicated. Groceries more affordable than in 2019, but consumers not feeling it Although interest rates are expected to drop in the coming years as inflation falls off, the Congressional Budget Office expects that the amount the country is paying in interest as a percent of the Gross Domestic Product will just continue to grow, the Econofact report indicated. In 2023, the Congressional Office found that the debt held by the public amounted to $26.2 trillion, which represents 97% of the GDP, according to the Peterson Foundation. Where does the national debt go from here? The Associated Press reported that as of this month, the federal debt held by the public has risen to more than $28 trillion – which is expected to only get higher as the U.S. cannot generate enough revenue to keep up with its spending. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the country’s debt load will only get bigger regardless of who wins the White House in next month’s election. Mortgage calculator: Calculate your monthly payment Other forecasts show that Trump’s pledge to have other countries pay tariffs would not generate nearly enough revenue to cover spending. One analysis showed that Trump tariffs could generate $2.7 trillion, but that at the same time, tax cuts would cost the country an estimated $9.2 trillion with an additional $350 million being spent on securing the border and a promised mass deportation of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally. One analysis projects that if elected, Harris would introduce $4.6 trillion in tax cuts but that an estimated $4 trillion that could be generated through a higher corporate tax rate would not cover the spending. 'Debt would continue to grow faster than the economy under either candidate’s plans and in most scenarios would grow faster and higher than under current law,' the report by the Committee for A Responsible Federal Budget concluded.

US will send a missile defense system and troops to run it to Isr...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States will send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it, the Pentagon said Sunday, even as Iran warned Washington to keep American military forces out of Israel. Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin authorized the deployment of the THAAD battery at the direction of President Joe Biden. He said the system will help bolster Israel's air defenses following Iran’s ballistic missile attacks on Israel in April and October. The delivery of the sophisticated missile defense system risks further inflaming the conflict in the Middle East despite widespread diplomatic efforts to avoid an all-out war. The Iranian warning came in a post on the social platform X long associated with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who noted the earlier reports that the U.S. was considering the deployment. Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets over the border in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza. Late last month, Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon. Israel is widely believed to be preparing a military response to Iran’s Oct. 1 attack when it fired roughly 180 missiles into Israel. In a brief exchange with reporters before leaving Florida on Sunday, Biden said he agreed to deploy the THAAD battery 'to defend Israel.' Biden spoke at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa after making a quick visit to to see the damage caused by Hurricane Milton and meet with first responders, residents and local leaders. Ryder, in his statement, said the deployment 'underscores the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran.' It was not immediately clear where the THAAD battery was coming from or when it will arrive. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli army spokesman, declined to provide any timeline for its arrival, but thanked the U.S. for its support. The U.S. deployed one of the batteries to the Middle East along with additional Patriot battalions to bolster protections for U.S. forces in the region late last year after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas militants. Ryder also said that the U.S. sent a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 for training. It also is not unusual for the U.S. to have a limited number of troops in Israel, which the U.S. considers a key regional ally. There generally has been a small number of forces there consistently as well as routine rotational deployments for training and exercises. The THAAD will add another layer to Israel's already significant air defenses, which include separate systems designed to intercept long-range, medium-range and short-range threats. Israel recently retired its U.S.-made Patriot systems after decades of use. According to an April report by the Congressional Research Service, the Army has seven THAAD batteries. Generally each consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, radio and radar equipment and requires 95 soldiers to operate. The THAAD is considered a complementary system to the Patriot, but it can defend a wider area. It can hit targets at ranges of 150 to 200 kilometers (93 to 124 miles), and is used to destroy short-range, medium-range and limited intermediate-range ballistic missile threats that are either inside or outside the atmosphere. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency is responsible for developing the system, but it is operated by the Army. An eighth system has been funded and ordered and is expected to be in the field sometime next year. ____ Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Aamer Madhani in Tampa, Florida, and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-us-will-send-an-air-defense-battery-and-american-troops-to-israel-to-bolster-defenses-against-iran/	2024-10-13T13:43:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670c31b4af48b5.15954439.jpeg?w=900

A man was arrested outside of a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump in Southern California, and multiple guns were illegally in his possession, according to authorities. The arrest took place at a checkpoint at the intersection of Avenue 52 and Celebration Drive in Coachella at 4:59 p.m. on Saturday, the Riverside County Sheriff's Office said. The rally was scheduled to start at 5 p.m. The driver of a black SUV, who was later identified as 49-year-old Vem Miller of Las Vegas, was found to be in illegal possession of a shotgun, a loaded handgun, and a high-capacity magazine. Miller was then taken into custody and booked at the John J. Benoit Detention Center on suspicion of possession of a loaded firearm and possession of a high-capacity magazine. According to the Riverside County Inmate Information System, Miller was released from the detention center Sunday on $5,000 bail. The Sheriff's Office said the incident had no impact on the safety of rally attendees or former President Trump. No additional details were immediately made available.

Drone strike in Israel wounds more than 60 as Hezbollah claims re...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A drone strike hit central Israel on Sunday, wounding more than 60 people, some of them critically, rescue services said, in one of the bloodiest attacks in Israel in a year of war. The Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group claimed responsibility, saying it targeted a military camp. Hezbollah said the strike was retaliation for two Israeli strikes in Beirut on Thursday that killed 22 people. With Israel’s advanced air-defense systems, it's rare for so many people to be hurt by drones or missiles. Israeli media reported that two drones were launched from Lebanon, and the military said one was intercepted. It was not immediately clear whether military members were hurt or what was hit in the city of Binyamina. There were no details from Israel's military, which earlier reported that at least 115 rockets were fired from Lebanon. It was the second time in two days that a drone has struck in Israel. On Saturday, during the Israeli holiday of Yom Kippur, one hit a suburb of Tel Aviv, causing damage but no injuries. The latest strike came on the same day that the United States announced it would send a new air-defense system to Israel to help bolster its protection against missiles, along with the troops needed to operate it. An Israeli army spokesperson declined to provide a timeline. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — both Iran-backed militant groups — and is expected to strike Iran in retaliation for a missile attack earlier this month, though it has not said how or when. Iran has said it will respond to any Israeli attack. Netanyahu calls UN peacekeepers ‘human shield’ for Hezbollah The U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon known as UNIFIL said Israeli tanks forcibly entered the gates of one of its positions early Sunday and destroyed the main gate, and later fired smoke rounds near peacekeepers in that location, causing skin irritation. UNIFIL said the incident was a 'further flagrant violation of international law.' International criticism is growing after Israeli forces have repeatedly fired on U.N. peacekeepers since the start of the ground operation in Lebanon. Five peacekeepers have been wounded in attacks that struck their positions in recent days, with most blamed on Israeli forces. The military says Hezbollah operates in the vicinity of the peacekeepers, without providing evidence. Israel’s military said a tank trying to evacuate wounded soldiers backed into a U.N. post while under fire. It said a smoke screen was used to provide cover. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani asserted that Israel has tried to maintain constant contact with UNIFIL and that any instance of U.N. forces being harmed will be investigated at 'the highest level.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday called for UNIFIL to heed Israel’s warnings to evacuate, accusing them of 'providing a human shield' to Hezbollah. 'We regret the injury to the UNIFIL soldiers, and we are doing everything in our power to prevent this injury. But the simple and obvious way to ensure this is simply to get them out of the danger zone,' he said in a video addressed to the U.N. secretary-general, who has been banned from entering Israel. Israel has long accused the United Nations of being biased against it, and relations have plunged further since the start of the war in Gaza. Israel has accused the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees of being infiltrated by Hamas, allegations the agency denies. Israeli strike in Lebanon destroys Ottoman-era market Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel a day after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, drawing retaliatory airstrikes. The conflict dramatically escalated in September with Israeli strikes that killed Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground operation earlier this month. More than 1,400 people have been killed in Lebanon since September, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were Hezbollah fighters. At least 54 people have been killed in rocket attacks on Israel, nearly half of them soldiers. Israeli airstrikes overnight destroyed an Ottoman-era market in Lebanon’s southern city of Nabatiyeh, killing at least one person and wounding four more. Lebanon’s Civil Defense said it battled fires in 12 residential buildings and 40 shops in the market, which dates back to 1910. 'Our livelihoods have all been leveled,' said Ahmad Fakih, whose shop was destroyed. Rescuers searched pancaked buildings as Israeli drones buzzed overhead. The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah targets, without elaborating, and said it continued to target the militants on Sunday. Separately, the Lebanese Red Cross said paramedics were searching for casualties in a house destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon on Sunday, when a second strike left four paramedics with concussions and damaged two ambulances. The Red Cross said the operation had been coordinated with U.N. peacekeepers, who informed the Israeli side. Bodies rot in the streets in northern Gaza A year into the war with Hamas, Israel continues to strike what it says are militant targets in Gaza almost daily. A strike hit a home in the Nuseirat refugee camp late Saturday, killing parents and six children ages 8 to 23, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies there. 'They were safe, while he was sleeping, and he and all his children died,' said the man’s brother, Mohammad Abu Ghali. Women stroked the body bags, in tears. Israel’s military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas and other armed groups because they operate in densely populated areas. In northern Gaza, Israeli air and ground forces have been attacking Jabaliya, where the military says militants have regrouped. Over the past year, Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to the built-up refugee camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, and other areas. Israel has ordered the full evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. An estimated 400,000 people remain in the north after a mass evacuation ordered in the war's opening weeks. Palestinians fear Israel intends to permanently depopulate the north to establish military bases or Jewish settlements there. The United Nations says no food has entered northern Gaza since Oct. 1. The military confirmed that hospitals were included in evacuation orders but said it had not set a timetable and was working with local authorities to facilitate patient transfers. Fares Abu Hamza, an official with the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service, said the bodies of a 'large number of martyrs' remain uncollected from the streets and under rubble. 'We are unable to reach them,' he said, asserting that dogs are eating some remains. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked a year ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still held in Gaza, a third believed to be dead. Israel's bombardment and its ground invasion of Gaza have killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and left much of the territory in ruins. The ministry doesn't distinguish between militants or civilians, but says women and children make up over half the deaths. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

SpaceX Starship pulls off historic launch with booster intact	(NewsNation) — SpaceX successfully launched its Starship rocket into orbit for its latest test flight on Sunday morning, but did so with a historic twist. The rocket, which stands almost 400 feet tall, launched and then successfully caught its returning booster at the launch pad with mechanical arms that are called 'chopsticks' which caught the booster in mid-arm to keep from damaging it. The feat, which is considered an engineering marvel by many aerospace experts, was lauded by SpaceX founder Elon Musk on social media. Former astronaut Jose Hernandez told NewsNation that the main booster provides the thrust of the power to the rocket. 'You go from zero to 17,500 mph in about 8 ½ minutes,' Hernandez said. 'It’s the best ride Disney can ever hope for.' Rare comet visible in the night sky won’t return for 80,000 years SpaceX's Starship is the largest rocket ever built and weighs more than 10 million pounds. The spacecraft, which is produced by Musk's SpaceX company, is sustainable and will be completely reusable, Hernandez said. The reusable aspect of the rocket will significantly reduce the price of future missions, the former astronaut said. SpaceX is hoping to use Starship to eventually transport humans to the Moon and Mars. In addition to the historic nature of the booster being caught by the mechanical arms, Hernandez said other aspects of Sunday’s test flight are important. 'You’re going to be landing the whole rocket in two separate pieces,' Hernandez told NewsNation. 'The upper stage is going to land softly in the Indian Ocean and the primary booster is going to come back and land in a launch pad that has this chopstick, scissor-like contraption that sort of hugs it as it comes down and safely lands it so it can be re-used.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/spacex-starship-pulls-off-historic-launch/	2024-10-13T09:20:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-2081837995_b0e774.jpg?w=900
Walz defends using the term 'socialism': 'It's what the right use...	Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) on Sunday defended his use of the word 'socialism' over the summer, saying he believes 'capitalism works' but that there are things society must do collectively. In an interview on 'Fox News Sunday,' host Shannon Bream asked Walz about his use of the word 'socialism' during a 'White Dudes for Harris' livestream in July. 'One person’s socialism is another person’s neighborliness,' Walz said in the July livestream. Bream began by citing the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition of socialism, which defines it as 'a system of society or group living in which there is no private property,' adding that 'means of production are owned and controlled by the state.' 'Did you mean to advocate for that here in the U.S.?' Bream asked Walz. Walz responded with an enthusiastic no, adding that he is a capitalist. 'Republicans oftentimes talk about socialism, and what I would make the case of is we build our roads collectively together,' he said. 'I don't think anybody's arguing that you should have to build your own road from your house to your business place or whatever. So I said this definition that the right uses about these things that we collectively do together.' He added, 'I believe in moral capitalism. I believe capitalism works and lifts everyone up, but I also believe you have to make sure there's things we collectively do together.' That includes public education and public health, Walz said. When pushed by Bream as to whether the use of the word was a 'knucklehead thing,' Walz continued to defend using the term, saying it is 'what the right uses.' 'Look, the point being is, is Donald Trump says that this is a socialist or Marxist government,' he added. 'Kamala Harris is actually doing just the opposite [of] that — creating a free economy that works and people can grow into the middle class.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/walz-defends-using-the-term-socialism-its-what-the-right-uses/	2024-10-13T08:16:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24276789570862-e1728480295345.jpg?w=900

Few Americans believe Donald Trump will concede election: Poll	(NewsNation) — While much of the country remains uncertain about who will emerge victorious in the race for the White House, more American voters are confident in who will concede the election should they lose, a new Pew Research poll shows. Research shows that just 24% of those polled believe that former President Donald Trump will concede next month’s election should he lose to Vice President Kamala Harris. Of those 24% who responded, only 4% of Harris’ supporters expect Trump to acknowledge the vice president as the winner should she win the White House. Trump doubles down on insults and mockery in attacks on Harris Among Trump supporters, 46% of those polled believe that Trump will concede the election. Meanwhile, 72% of the more than 5,100 Americans surveyed believe that Harris will acknowledge that she lost the election if Trump claims enough electoral votes to earn a second term in the White House. The research showed that 95% of Harris supporters believe that the Democrat will acknowledge a Trump victory while about half (48%) of Trump backers said they would expect Harris to concede. Trump has continued to tell supporters at campaign rallies that he believes the 2020 election in which he was defeated by President Joe Biden was stolen from him. The Republican has continued the claims of a rigged election despite no evidence that anything improper happened in Biden winning the White House. In the recent Pew Research poll, only 32% of Trump supporters say that should the former president lose to Harris it is very important to them that he acknowledge Harris as the legitimate president. Comparatively, 61% of those planning to vote for Harris say it is very important for the vice president to declare Trump the winner. The polling takes place as Trump and Harris are locked into a tightly contested battle. National polling shows Harris with a slight lead over the former president, but all of the polls fall within the margin of error. Polling remains especially tight in swing states that likely will determine who wins the election. The Pew Research poll shows that with less than a month remaining before election day, about 86% of those who were surveyed believe it is clear who will win. Polling done since September shows that 48% of those surveyed by Pew favor Harris or are leaning toward supporting her while 47% support Trump or are leaning toward voting for the former president. Another 5% of those surveyed say that they are leaning toward supporting a third-party candidate in the upcoming election.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/few-americans-believe-donald-trump-will-concede-election-poll/	2024-10-13T07:13:30-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66e3590b998697.70230121.jpeg?w=900
Musk's Starlink Internet free for hurricane victims through 2024	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk's internet company Starlink will offer victims of hurricanes Helene and Milton free service through the end of the year, an extension of an initial offer that received internet backlash. 'For those impacted by Hurricanes Helene or Milton, Starlink service is now free through the end of the year to help with response and recovery efforts,' the company said in a post on X, which Musk also owns. Starlink is described as 'internet from space for humans on Earth.' SpaceX, also owned by Musk, engineers it. The company initially offered Hurricane Helene victims a free month of service, but some would-be customers noticed a price tag that came with it. Even with a $0 monthly fee, the satellite dish would cost a few hundred dollars plus shipping and taxes. One woman posted to X that her total cost would be $344.52 as a 'Helene relief' customer. After 30 days, the subscription would require a monthly payment. Can someone (@elonmusk) explain why @Starlink is being offered for 'free' as an emergency srvc but when they sign up for the Hurricane Relief service ppl are being charged $345 for hardware that arrives in 1-2 weeks?! Are the trucks not the hardware for the emergency?!?! #HELENE pic.twitter.com/2ePbcTLwXb&mdash; Mary Williams (@mary_scw) October 3, 2024 Starlink offers a free 30-day trial to regular customers regardless of hurricane status. A monthly subscription for residential customers costs $120 a month for unlimited data. Following backlash, the company issued a new offer weeks later that extended the free service through the end of the year for victims of both hurricanes Helene and Milton. The free subscription applies to residential households, both new and existing customers, and provides unlimited data, according to Starlink's website. Users must enter their address on their website to see if they qualify for the offer. 'Starlink is providing free service in your area for those impacted by Hurricanes Helene or Milton. Select the ''Hurricane Relief' option below for this subscription,' the website says after inputting information. 'These will be moved to a paid, residential subscription after the end of the year.' Elon Musk unveils Tesla’s ‘Cybercab’ as stock sinks Like the initial offer, this 'free' internet service comes with a $349 charge for the hardware. Delivery will take about three weeks, according to the website. Current customers who were impacted by the hurricanes must create a support ticket requesting a relief credit. SpaceX said it has delivered more than 10,000 Starlink kits to Helene victims, as of Oct. 8. The company also said it teamed up with T-Mobile to provide 'direct to cell' satellites to provide emergency alerts for all phones and carriers in affected areas. The service works best outdoors, the company said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/musks-starlink-internet-free-for-hurricane-victims-through-2024/	2024-10-13T04:32:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-2162679051.jpg?w=900
Biden to tour Milton damage in Florida, 974K still without power	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden will tour the damage from Hurricane Milton in Florida on Sunday, four days after the storm, as just under 1 million homes and businesses remain without power. In his first visit to the Sunshine State since Milton’s landfall Wednesday evening, Biden will arrive in Tampa and depart on an aerial tour of the surrounding areas. Biden approved a major disaster declaration for Florida Saturday, the second in as many weeks. The state is still recovering from Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 storm, which hit late September. A disaster declaration allows states to use federal funds, and people in affected areas can apply for assistance through FEMA. The president is expected to meet with federal, state, and local officials in St. Pete Beach, Florida, about nine miles west of St. Petersburg where his aerial tour will end. Florida deputies help pregnant woman in labor during Milton Post-Milton cleanup efforts ongoing Day four post-Milton looks similar to the previous days: cleanup, recovery, and power restoration. Category 3 storm winds tore panels off the roof of Tropicana Field, home of MLB's Tampa Bay Rays, and a construction crane crashed into the Tampa Bay Times building. Cleanup is an ongoing effort in St. Pete Beach and statewide. The St. Pete Beach Fire Department had to erect a makeshift fire station location at a hotel because one of their stations was hit by Helene two weeks prior. 'I don’t think you ever get used to being hit by hurricanes,' Deputy Fire Chief Adam Poirrier told NewsNation’s Mills Hayes. 'Certainly two (hurricanes) within two and a half weeks was out of the norm … I don’t think we believed that was going to happen because it’s never happened in the past. Sadly, we’re getting pretty good at this now.' The number of power outages has decreased significantly from the initial 3.3 million after the storm. Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a news conference Saturday afternoon that crews from as far as Canada are working to restore power to the remaining 974,000 homes and businesses without it. Couple who moved to Florida heartbroken after Milton ruins their ‘happily ever after’ Fuel shortages across Florida Many gas stations still don’t have power, causing a statewide fuel shortage. Twenty-eight percent of gas stations in the state do not have fuel, according to GasBuddy’s Fuel Tracker. Hundreds of cars formed an hours-long line outside one gas station in Bradenton, Florida, Saturday morning. Gov. Ron DeSantis said three fuel depots opened Saturday. More will open Sunday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. ET in Port Charlotte, Pinellas County, Hillsborough County, and Sarasota County. The state’s majority of remaining power outages are in those counties. Milton barreled through the central-western part of the state upon landfall, first hitting Sarasota County.

At least a dozen tornadoes tore through St. Lucie County, Florida, in just two hours, according to St. Lucie County’s communications director Erick Gill. Officials in hard-hit counties have warned people to beware of downed power lines, trees in roads, blocked bridges, and flooding. Ft. Myers is under a foot of floodwater days later. 'You can hide from the wind, but you've got to run from the water,' said Ft. Myers Mayor Kevin B. Anderson on NewsNation Saturday morning. The National Weather Service reported almost 19 inches of rainfall in the St. Petersburg area. A storm surge of 8 to 10 feet was reported in Sarasota County. Milton rapidly weakened to a Category 1 storm as it moved inland. Polk County officials shared a harrowing tale of life in a deadly storm. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said some of the office’s deputies helped transport a pregnant woman to the hospital early Thursday morning as she was going into labor, successfully getting her to the hospital to deliver her daughter, Jade. In Venice Beach, a home was entirely buried in sand, with the pile high enough to push furniture halfway up a doorway nearly hitting the ceiling. The City of Venice said the area remains highly dangerous due to deep holes, trip hazards, exposed utilities, and sharp debris. Asheville BBQ restaurant owners trying to recover from Helene What we know about Florida's recovery All highways are open, and all commercial airports are open except for the Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, Gov. DeSantis said Saturday afternoon. The airport aims to reopen on Wednesday, Oct. 16. Other updates include: 1,000 people were rescued from floodwaters 12,000 miles of roadway have been cleared. 2,400 bridges have been inspected. 90% of traffic signals are back in operation. 43 of the 54 school districts will reopen Monday Determination to rebuild follows Florida’s hurricanes with acceptance that storms will come again Disaster assistance The IRS announced tax relief for Milton victims.

Israeli strike on Gaza kills a family of 8	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on the central Gaza Strip has killed a family of eight, Palestinian medical officials said Sunday, as Israeli forces battled Palestinian militants and pushed for the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people from the territory's north. Israel is also waging an air and ground campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and is expected to strike Iran in retaliation for a missile attack earlier this month, though it has not said how or when. The strike in Gaza late Saturday hit a home in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing parents and their six children, who ranged in age from 8 to 23, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, where the bodies were taken. It said another seven people were wounded, including two women and a child in critical condition. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies and filmed funeral prayers held at the hospital. More than a year into the war with Hamas, Israel continues to strike what it says are militant targets in Gaza nearly every day. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas and other armed groups because they operate in densely populated areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. In recent months, it has repeatedly struck schools being used as shelters by displaced people, accusing militants of hiding among them. Israel presses for full evacuation of northern Gaza In northern Gaza, Israeli air and ground forces have been attacking Jabaliya, where the military says militants have regrouped. Over the past year, Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to the built-up refugee camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, and other hard-hit areas. Israel has ordered the full evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. An estimated 400,000 people remain in the north after a mass evacuation ordered in the opening weeks of the war. The Palestinians fear Israel intends to permanently depopulate the north to establish military bases or Jewish settlements there. The military confirmed Saturday that hospitals were included in the evacuation orders but said it had not set a specific timetable. It said a medical convoy scheduled to transfer patients from the Kamal Adwan Hospital in recent days was canceled for security reasons — without elaborating — but that the convoy had delivered fuel to the hospital on Saturday. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's bombardment and ground invasions of Gaza have killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and left much of the territory in ruins. Palestinian medical officials do not say whether those killed by Israeli forces are militants or civilians, but say women and children make up over half the fatalities. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Israel expected to strike Iran as fighting rages in Lebanon Lebanon's Hezbollah, which is allied with Hamas, began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, drawing retaliatory airstrikes. The conflict dramatically escalated in September with a wave of Israeli strikes that killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground operation into southern Lebanon earlier this month. At least 2,255 people have been killed in Lebanon since the start of the conflict, including more than 1,400 people since September, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, which also does not say how many were Hezbollah fighters. At least 54 people have been killed in the rocket attacks on Israel, nearly half of them soldiers. Iran, which supports Hezbollah and Hamas, launched around 180 ballistic missiles at Israel to avenge the killing of Nasrallah, an Iranian general who was with him, and Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who died in an explosion in Iran's capital in July that was widely blamed on Israel. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/international-headlines/ap-israeli-strike-on-gaza-kills-a-family-of-8/	2024-10-13T00:23:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670b764cf03683.49775739.jpeg?w=900
1 dead, at least 9 injured after shooting reported near TSU durin...	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) -- Nashville police officers and first responders were called to a Saturday evening shooting near Tennessee State University (TSU) that killed one person and injured at least nine others. According to the Metro Nashville Police Department (MNPD), gunfire erupted between two groups at approximately 5:10 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 12 near the intersection of Jefferson Street and 27th Avenue North. A TSU spokesperson sent the following statement to News 2 around 5:45 p.m.: Nashville Metro Police are investigating a shooting at 27th and Jefferson near the House of Legends and Jefferson Street Baptist Missionary Baptist Church. Police say the suspect remains at large and everyone should use caution if traveling in the area. Just after 6:30 p.m., authorities confirmed the scene had been secured. 'At this point, there are 10 victims that have been confirmed to have been involved in that gunfire, one of which is deceased. Five of them were transported from the Nashville Fire Department to local hospitals. Five others were dropped off by private vehicles, and at least some of those that were injured at area hospitals are also suspected to have been involved in the gunfire,' MNPD Public Information Officer Brooke Reese said during a briefing shortly before 7:15 p.m. MNPD later posted on social media platform X that a 24-year-old man had died and three non-critical juvenile victims were at Vanderbilt Pediatrics. According to Kendra Loney with the Nashville Fire Department (NFD), crews were already staged throughout the area because they were participating in the TSU homecoming parade and engaging with the community amid the homecoming festivities. When the gunfire broke out, Loney said some NFD personnel thought it was fireworks, but when they realized what was happening, they jumped into action, with some even using their belts as tourniquets because they didn't have their medical bags with them. 'While we don't wish any ill on anyone, we are upset, we are angry about that disruption, we are angry that there were persons whose days were disrupted, that the innocence in this event was taken away, and that lives were endangered,' Loney said. Loney reported that one NFD employee was transported for an unrelated medical emergency, in addition to the five people injured in the shooting that NFD brought to the hospital. 'Of course, everybody knows homecoming celebration for Tennessee State University is a huge event,' MNPD Cmdr. Anthony McClain said. 'I graduated from Tennessee State University, so my family and I was enjoying this occasion today. It's unfortunate that a few folks pretty much ruined it for everybody, okay? So we have to come to the point where we stop this violence. Fortunately for us, we had quite a few officers working the area. I think they were able to mitigate the carnage, so to speak. We appreciate that effort. We appreciate the efforts of the fire department, as well.' According to McClain, the shooting was not a direct reflection on TSU itself and is believed to be something that was 'kind of a side bar to the celebration.' He said there have been some shootings up and down the Jefferson Street corridor, but it's been pretty uneventful for the past couple years. The commander added that most of the people celebrating TSU's homecoming were down at Nissan Stadium for the football game against Eastern Illinois University, which kicked off at 5 p.m. MNPD Public Information Officer Don Aaron shared additional details in an 8 p.m. press conference. When asked about a shots fired call near Nissan Stadium amid the football game, Aaron said a noise that sounded like a gunshot may have been heard outside the stadium, but there are no reports of anyone being hit or any indication that it's related to the shooting near TSU.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/1-dead-9-injured-after-shooting-reported-near-tsu/	2024-10-12T17:43:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/processed-0D5216ED-D394-4D02-ADE4-B155A2325DF0.jpeg?w=900
Heavy Israeli bombardment in northern Gaza as UN peacekeepers in ...	BEIRUT (AP) — Palestinians in northern Gaza described heavy Israeli bombardment Saturday in the hours after airstrikes killed at least 22 people, as Israel warned people there and in southern Lebanon to get out of the way of offensives against the Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups. In Lebanon, the U.N. peacekeeping force said its headquarters in Naqoura was hit again, with a peacekeeper struck by gunfire late Friday and in stable condition. It wasn’t clear who fired. It occurred a day after Israel’s military fired on the headquarters for a second straight day. Israel, which has warned peacekeepers to leave their positions, didn’t immediately respond to questions. Hunger warnings emerged again in northern Gaza as residents said they hadn't received aid since the beginning of the month. The U.N. World Food Program said no food aid had entered the north since Oct. 1. An estimated 400,000 people remain there. Israel’s military renewed its offensive in northern Gaza almost a week ago while escalating its air and ground campaign against the Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Amid Israel's war with Hezbollah, a top U.N. official, Carl Skau, told The Associated Press he's concerned that Lebanon’s ports and airport might be taken out of service. More than 1 million people have been displaced. Israel’s military said Hezbollah fired more than 300 projectiles over Yom Kippur, the holiest and most solemn day on the Jewish calendar. Hezbollah claimed a series of rocket strikes on Israeli military positions and said fighters engaged an Israeli infantry unit attempting to enter Lebanese territory. Israel's military also said it killed 50 militants in Lebanon. Claims on either side couldn’t be verified. Israeli airstrikes on Saturday hit multiple areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Nine were killed in Maisra village in the northeast. Four were killed in an apartment building on the edge of Barja south of Beirut. Rayak and Tal Chiha hospitals in the Bekaa Valley were damaged. In Nabatieh, eight people were wounded. The total toll in Lebanon over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is now 2,255 killed, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. More than 1,400 people have been killed since mid-September. It isn't clear how many were fighters. 'We will keep standing with the Lebanese people during these difficult circumstances and also with the Palestinian people,' the speaker of Iran’s parliament, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, said Saturday while touring the scene of an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Some Gaza residents are trapped In northern Gaza, residents told the AP many were trapped in their homes and shelters with dwindling supplies while seeing bodies uncollected in the streets as the bombing hampered emergency responders. Those who rushed to the scene of the latest deadly airstrikes in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya found a hole 20 meters (65 feet) deep where a home once stood. At least 20 bodies were recovered while others likely were under rubble, emergency service officials said. Elsewhere in Jabaliya, a strike on a home killed two brothers and wounded a woman and newborn baby, the officials said. An afternoon strike on a home killed at least four people, including a woman, said Fares Abu Hamza, an official with the emergency service. Israel’s military said it killed more than 20 militants in the Jabaliya area over the past day. Military spokesperson Avichay Adraee told people in parts of Jabaliya and Gaza City to evacuate south to an Israeli-designated humanitarian zone as Israel plans to use great force 'and will continue to do so for a long time.' Israel has repeatedly returned to parts of Gaza as Hamas and other militants regroup. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Once again, some families moved south on foot, in donkey carts or crowded in vehicles that navigated piles of rubble. Others refused to go. 'It’s like the first days of the war,' said a Jabaliya resident, Ahmed Abu Goneim. 'The occupation is doing everything to uproot us. But we will not leave.' The 24-year-old said Israeli warplanes and drones struck many neighboring houses in the past week. He counted 15 relatives and neighbors, including four women and five children as young as 3, killed in neighboring homes. He said that there were dead in the streets. Hamza Sharif, who stays with his family in a school-turned-shelter in Jabaliya, described 'constant bombings day and night.' He said the shelter hasn't received aid since the beginning of the month and that families 'will run out of supplies very soon.' Food is running out The World Food Program said it was unclear how long the limited food supplies it distributed in northern Gaza earlier will last. The U.N.’s independent investigator on the right to food last month accused Israel of carrying out a 'starvation campaign' against Palestinians, which Israel has denied. Israel's offensive in Gaza started after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, when militants stormed into Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don't specify between combatants and civilians. Gaza’s Health Ministry said that hospitals had received the bodies of 49 people killed over the past 24 hours. ___ Samy Magdy reported from Cairo.

Asheville BBQ restaurant owners trying to recover from Helene	(NewsNation) — The owners of a popular Asheville, N.C. brewpub are counting the damage done to their building by Hurricane Helene but they're also counting their blessings. 'Seeing the community come together like it has ... been incredibly heartwarming,' said Bryan King, co-owner of 12 Bones Smokehouse and Brewing. 'There have just been so many folks that have reached out. People doing, just, selfless acts trying to do everything they can to help those around them and those in need. It’s been amazing to watch,' he added. Milton aftermath: Fuel shortages, 1.4M Floridians without power As for the future of 12 Bones, co-owner Angela King told 'NewsNation Now' that they’re still assessing the damage to their Asheville location. 'I don’t even know. Walking through there … there’s mud in the attic. I think it’s still too early to say,' she said. The Kings have filled out Small Business Administration relief forms, as well as insurance claims. Friends have set up a GoFundMe account to help the restaurants’ staff. 'Unemployment is only like $324 a week. That’s not enough for the staff to pay their rent,' said Angela King. Key disaster loan program ‘quickly exhausting’ funds after hurricanes 12 Bones’ two other locations in nearby Arden, N.C., which were not significantly damaged by Helene, are open and selling ribs, pulled pork and more, according to Bryan King. 'Our blueberry chipotle sauce is very well-known, and we do sell that through our website.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/asheville-brewpub-owners-recover-helene/	2024-10-12T15:28:24-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/12-Bones-River-Exterior-Damage-1.jpeg?w=900
Who is not allowed to vote in the 2024 presidential election?	(NEXSTAR) – The United States is just weeks away from a highly-anticipated presidential election, but not everyone will be able to exercise their right to vote on Nov. 5. Being at least 18 years old and a U.S. citizen are general requirements for voting, but individual states have laws that prohibit voting for several reasons. Convicted felons In all jurisdictions except Maine, Vermont, and the nation's capital, people convicted of felony crimes lose the right to vote while incarcerated. In half the states, felony voting restrictions extend after incarceration, often including their time on probation or parole, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). In some states, convicted felons lose their voting rights indefinitely for certain crimes. In recent years there has been a general trend toward reinstating the right to vote at some point.

Key disaster loan program 'quickly exhausting' funds after hurric...	Officials are warning a key federal program that provides disaster loans to businesses and homeowners is running critically low on funds in the aftermath of back-to-back hurricanes, increasing the pressure on Congress to return to Washington. The Small Business Administration (SBA) has roughly $50 million left for new disaster loans, and the agency says it expects funds to be depleted soon, potentially before Congress returns from recess next month, amid heightened demand in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Officials say the program needs about $1.6 billion. 'SBA staff is currently on the ground across the country working to support communities impacted by disasters,' SBA Administrator Isabel Casillas Guzman said in a statement this week. But, she added, the agency is 'quickly exhausting current federal funding to make new offers for affordable recovery loans to homeowners, renters, small businesses, and non-profits.' 'Americans should not have to wait for critical assistance when they need it the most.' President Biden has also sounded the alarm on the matter, telling reporters Thursday that Congress 'should be coming back and moving on emergency needs immediately.' 'Congress should move as rapidly as they can, particularly on the most immediate need, which is small business,' he said. The latest call by Biden adds to the growing pressure Congress has faced to return from the campaign trail to approve additional disaster relief in response to the damage wrought by hurricanes Helene and Milton. Congress last month passed a temporary stopgap measure to keep federal funding from lapsing in October and to prevent a government shutdown. The bill did not include additional funding for the SBA, despite repeated requests from the administration. Also notably missing from the same measure was further funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Instead, negotiators said the deal allowed for the agency to use the fund’s fiscal 2025 resources faster for disaster response for the duration of the nearly three-month stopgap, allowing FEMA access to draw from a roughly $20 billion pot starting Oct. 1. While FEMA officials have said in recent days that it has sufficient resources to respond to hurricanes Milton and Helene while Congress is out of session in the short term, they also indicated to reporters that almost half of that money is already gone. The SBA has said it will continue to process disaster loan applications after the funds are expended, but additional funding from Congress will be needed to make further loan offers to borrowers and send out checks. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are pushing for Congress to cut its recess early ahead of its current Nov. 12 return date, as campaigns kick it into their final gear ahead of the critical fall elections. In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) earlier this week, a group of House Democrats said the disaster funding approved by Congress recently fell 'critically short' of what will be needed for the current fiscal year. 'The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must be equipped not only to respond to current disasters but also to adequately prepare for future events,' the letter read. The lawmakers also pressed for the SBA’s disaster relief loan program to 'be replenished as soon as possible to help business owners rebuild their enterprises and communities.' Johnson signaled after Helene that he had little interest in bringing lawmakers back to Washington, saying FEMA has enough funding to cover the period until Congress is back in session. The Hill has reached out to the Speaker’s office for comment. Even some Republicans are pushing the Speaker on the issue. 'Just got off the phone with @POTUS Biden. He is personally overseeing that FEMA does not create problems with the debris removal and is supportive of the 15 Billion in FEMA funds ONLY FOR Hurricane victims,' Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) wrote Thursday on social platform X. 'If Congress goes into a special session we can get it passed immediately. This needs to happen. @SpeakerJohnson call us back,' she said Thursday before adding in a subsequent post that she also talked to Johnson and that he 'is actively also working this issue.' Pressed on the call by Biden for an early return, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-N.Y.) office also said Friday that he is 'awaiting estimates from agencies working diligently on the ground.' Despite previous requests to bolster disaster aid funds, the Biden administration has not yet released a new emergency supplemental funding request in the aftermath of Helene and Milton. Asked earlier this week about how much time Congress has before the SBA or FEMA runs out of money, Biden told reporters that discussion on the matter is still ongoing, but he said that, 'in terms of the SBA, it's pretty right at the edge right now.' 'It's going to take several billion dollars,' Biden said, discussing overall emergency needs. 'It's not going to be a matter of just a little bit. But we're providing now to make sure people have the emergency relief they need.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/key-disaster-loan-program-quickly-exhausting-funds-after-hurricanes/	2024-10-12T05:55:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Funding-challenges_101124_AP_Mike-Stewart.png?w=900

Milton aftermath: 1.6M Floridians still without power	(NewsNation) — Emergency and utility crews are working to clear flooded roadways and restore power to the 1.6 million Florida homes and businesses still in the dark three days post-Milton. At least 10 storm-related deaths have been reported, according to the White House. NewsNation local affiliate WFLA reported that one of those killed was a Polk County employee who was helping with cleanup. Six deaths resulted from a tornado hitting the Spanish Lakes Country Club Village near Fort Pierce, while two others in Volusia County were killed by trees crashing into their homes, according to authorities. Florida family: Insurers hope we’ll walk away The area is still recovering from Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 storm that hit Florida and other parts of the southeast just two weeks before Milton, a Category 3 at landfall. President Joe Biden spoke with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster Friday night to discuss the recovery efforts from Helene. He also spoke with Mayor Gene Brown of Bradenton, Florida, to discuss the ongoing rescue and response efforts in Florida following Milton, which made landfall near Sarasota in the central-west part of the state Wednesday night. President Joe Biden is expected to travel to Florida on Sunday to visit impacted areas. Power outages in Florida More than 1.6 million customers remained without power in Florida as of Saturday morning, down from an initial 3.3 million in the early morning hours of Thursday after the storm made landfall. The majority of outages are in the central-western part of the state where Milton made landfall. Vice President Kamala Harris shared on X that 50,000 workers are contributing to the power restoration. Harris also noted FEMA has delivered more than 1.2 million meals, and search-and-rescue teams have assisted in more than 4,200 rescues. Still, many expressed relief that Milton wasn’t worse. The hurricane spared densely populated Tampa a direct hit, and the lethal storm surge that scientists feared never materialized. Meteorologist threatened after debunking hurricane conspiracies 'To the people of Florida: I know recovery and rebuilding periods can be long and difficult. And that long after the press and cameras move on, you have to pick up the pieces. But I want you to know I will do everything in my power to help you put the pieces back together,' President Joe Biden posted to X Friday morning. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis acknowledged the storm was significant but said it 'was not the worst-case scenario.' While flying over some of the hard-hit areas, he said he noticed many recently-built homes fare well. 'We did not get the worst-case scenario, but we did get hit, and we are going to have to work to bounce back,' DeSantis said. The governor continued to encourage residents to 'exercise caution.' Hurricane Milton's destruction Arriving just two weeks after the devastating Hurricane Helene, the system knocked out power to more than 3 million customers initially, flooded barrier islands, tore the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays’ baseball stadium, and toppled a construction crane. Officials in hard-hit counties have warned people to beware of downed power lines, trees in roads, blocked bridges, and flooding. Before Milton even made landfall, heavy rain, and tornadoes lashed parts of southern Florida. The National Weather Service reported almost 19 inches of rainfall in the St. Petersburg area. A storm surge of 8 to 10 feet was reported in Sarasota County. Milton rapidly weakened to a Category 1 storm as it moved inland. LAKEWOOD PARK, FLORIDA- OCTOBER 10 Shane Ostrander looks through what remains of his home after a tornado spawned by Hurricane Milton destroyed his home in Lakewood Park, Florida on October 10, 2024.

How to use a generator after Hurricane Milton Officials warn of hurricane relief scams As relief efforts continue, the U.S. Department of Justice is alerting the public to a rise in scams aimed at exploiting victims of these disasters. According to the DOJ, scammers are quick to exploit weather disasters and the people affected by them. Officials also reminded people that if their property was damaged by both Helene and Milton, they would need to apply for disaster assistance twice, with separate applications for the damage from each storm. On Friday evening, Sarasota County Government shared that FEMA has asked for assistance 'correcting a rumor about automatic financial reimbursement for those who have been without power for 24 hours. Any individual seeking disaster assistance from FEMA must complete an application process.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/milton-aftermath-floridians-without-power/	2024-10-12T04:31:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177295651.jpg?w=900

Meteorologist threatened after debunking hurricane conspiracies	(NewsNation) —Katie Nickolaou, a meteorologist, says she's received death threats for debunking hurricane conspiracy theories regarding the latest natural disasters in the U.S. 'A lot of people are looking for someone to blame,' Nickolaou said Friday on 'CUOMO.' 'I'm just trying to get out there and answer questions in terms of understanding this insane weather.' The meteorologist, who shares weather updates on her TikTok, said she's not alone and that several other meteorologists are reporting similar hostile messages. Milton recovery efforts underway in Florida as 2M without power 'Murdering meteorologists won’t stop hurricanes,' Nickolaou wrote on X, alongside a screenshot of one threat she’d received. Meanwhile, Washington, D.C.-based meteorologist Matthew Cappucci said he's received hundreds of messages from people accusing him of modifying the weather to create hurricanes with space lasers, the New York Post reported. Crews resumed rescue-and-recovery efforts Friday in Florida, working around the clock to help people in the wake of Hurricane Milton.

Delphi killings: Timeline of events in Richard Allen case	DELPHI, Ind. (NewsNation) — The deaths of Indiana teens Libby German and Abby Williams shocked the country and changed their families and their small Midwest town forever. German, 14, and Williams, 13, ventured out on a walk along the Delphi Historic Trail on Feb. 13, 2017, but never returned home. Their disappearance sparked a community-wide search for the girls. Investigators discovered the girl's bodies the following day near the Monon High Bridge, just outside their hometown of Delphi, Indiana.

Idaho college killings: Timeline of events in Bryan Kohberger case However, with an evidence leak, several legal filings, the removal and reinstating of the original court-appointed defense team and other delays in the Delphi murder case, Allen's trial is expected to begin Oct. 14, 2024. Despite his 2022 arrest, Allen had talked to police in 2017 and told them he had been on the bridge the day of the girls' disappearance. He denied meeting the teenagers and pleaded not guilty. Here’s a timeline retracing key moments of the Delphi killings case. Libby German and Abby Williams vanish Feb. 13, 2017: German and Williams set out for a walk along the Delphi Historic Trail, where they are last seen. 'They just got out of the car and walked down the trail to go to High Bridge,' German’s older sister said. 'We told each other we loved each other. And that was the last time I saw her.' Just after 2 p.m. local time, German posted a photo of the Monon High Bridge on Snapchat and one of Williams walking across the historic bridge. That post was the last correspondence from either of them. Hours passed, and nobody could get in contact with the girls. They were then reported missing. Feb. 14, 2017: Law enforcement and volunteers began a search for the girls, canvassing areas. Their bodies were found in a rugged area near a hiking trail one day after they vanished while walking on that trail near the Monon High Bridge. Feb. 15, 2017: Law enforcement confirmed that the two bodies discovered were those of German and Williams. State police released images discovered on German's phone to the public, saying they were believed to be of the suspected killer. Delphi killing suspect.

(Photo by Jeremy Hogan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Oct. 31, 2022: Allen was officially arrested in connection with the killings of German and Williams. Allen pleaded not guilty and remained at the White County Jail, where he was detained without bond, Carroll County District Attorney Nicholas McLeland said. It marked the first time the tight-knit community of Delphi received possible answers to the case. Nov. 1, 2022: German's grandmother said Allen worked at CVS and had printed photos for the girls’ funerals. Nov. 22, 2022: Allen was granted a bail hearing, and a prosecutor said in court that Allen may not be the sole suspect. Nov. 29, 2022: Newly unsealed court records detailed how a cellphone video and an unspent bullet led officers to arrest a man they interviewed five years earlier in connection with the deaths. A redacted version of an affidavit was released that outlined why police suspected Allen in connection with the deaths of German and Williams. Delphi killings suspect Richard Allen claims mistreatment April 6, 2023: Allen’s legal team, attorneys Andrew Baldwin and Bradley Rozzi, filed an emergency motion to modify his safekeeping order, claiming the suspected killer was not being treated like other detainees. June 13, 2023: Allen’s defense team filed a motion to suppress certain evidence from the case. At the time, the motion was under seal, but the court revealed it involved ballistics. June 15, 2023: Allen appeared in court for what was supposed to be a bail hearing. Ultimately, the judge heard arguments over covering several issues, including a motion filed by Allen’s attorney to keep certain evidence from coming out at trial. Sebastian Rogers search: A timeline of the Tennessee teen’s disappearance Prosecutors stated that Allen confessed five or six times to the murders, but his attorneys said he couldn't be trusted due to his mental state. Along those lines, Allen’s attorneys also asked that he be moved from the Westville Correctional Facility to a county jail, citing a decline in the man’s physical and mental health. June 16, 2023: Allen's defense team claimed the suspect's mental and physical state was getting worse in isolation. Allen County Judge Frances Gull June 29, 2023: Allen County Judge Frances Gull unsealed 118 documents in the case against Allen. Allen allegedly told his wife and mother 'no less than five times' that he was responsible for killing German and Williams. The records also revealed that investigators believed a knife was used in the killings. Jan. 12, 2024: Allen's new defense team asked the state to transfer him to a new prison after the suspect claimed mistreatment at the Wabash Valley Correctional Facility. The new attorneys claimed the mistreatment impacted their ability to represent him in court. Feb. 8, 2024: Gull denied the motion, asking for Allen to be moved from Wabash Valley Correctional Facility. Odinist cult killing theory unfolds Sept. 18, 2023: Baldwin and Rozzi announced a conspiracy-fueled alternative theory to the Delphi murders that not only didn’t involve their client but invoked a ritualistic murder seeped in the occult. What is Odinism, and is it connected to the Delphi murders? While the Carroll County Prosecutor’s Office deemed the Odinist cult killing theory 'unfounded' with 'absolutely no proof,' Baldwin and Rozzi pointed out that investigators spoke with key suspects whom the defense team believed were at the center of the cult theory. Sept. 26, 2024: McLeland responded to Allen’s defense team’s 136-page memorandum that laid out an alternative theory that linked the Delphi murders, calling the alternative theory 'a fanciful defense for social media to devour' that isn’t supported by evidence. Oct. 3, 2023: In a court filing, the defense team said it believed investigators reopened their investigation into the theory that German and Williams were killed in a ritualistic sacrifice. Sept. 4, 2024: Gull rules against allowing the Odinism defense at trial. Delphi crime scene photos, evidence leaked Oct. 5, 2023: Evidence related to German and Williams' deaths, including crime scene photos, were leaked online and distributed to YouTube and podcast content creators. Oct. 9, 2023: Mitch Westerman, a friend of one of Allen's attorneys, reportedly contacted Baldwin and admitted to being behind the leak, taking photos of the evidence and sharing those with a man who later shared them with another person from Texas who in turn sent them to various YouTube and podcast creators. The man Westerman initially shared the photos with killed himself after being questioned by police. What do we know about Delphi suspect Richard Allen? Oct. 19, 2023: Gull announced Baldwin and Rozzi were 'voluntarily withdrawing' from the case in response to the evidence leak from their office earlier in the month. The decision, which the judge called a 'very unexpected turn of events,' meant some parts of the pretrial process would return to square one as Allen awaited a new legal team. Oct. 26, 2023: Baldwin and Rozzi filed several motions with the Indiana Supreme Court, claiming they were removed from the murder case by Gull in the aftermath of the evidence leak.

Jan. 28, 2024: Allen's attorneys filed a new motion seeking to remove Gull from the case, arguing she should be replaced or recuse herself from the proceedings in favor of a different judge. Jan. 29, 2024: McLeland pushed the court to hold Baldwin and Rozzi in contempt, accusing them of mishandling evidence and making public statements about the case as the court weighed a gag order. Andrew Baldwin (L), Richard Allen (C), Bradley Rozzi (R) Feb 7, 2024: Allen's defense team called for the murder charges leveled against him to be thrown out, claiming that interview recordings with 'key suspects' were deleted in acts the attorneys call either negligent or intentional. Baldwin and Rozzi filed their motion to dismiss on the grounds of destruction of evidence key to their defense of Allen. A third attempt to have Special Judge Fran Gull thrown off the case was rejected the same day it was filed. March 11, 2024: Gull granted the defense team’s request to move up Allen's murder trial, scheduling court to begin on May 13. Gull blocked off May 13 through May 31 in her motion. March 18, 2024: The judge dismissed two counts of kidnapping, and Allen waived an initial hearing to dispute the amended charges, which include murder. April 25, 2024: Gull declares no cameras will be allowed in the courtroom for Allen's trial. April 30, 2024: Prosecutors asked the court to prevent the defense from presenting its 'Odinism' murder theory in court.

May 2, 2024: Gull found Allen's defense lawyers 'sloppy, negligent, and incompetent' but declined to hold the pair in contempt. May 7, 2024: Gull reset Allen's trial dates for the murders of German and Williams for Oct. 14 through Nov. 15 in Carroll County. June 19, 2024: Defense attorneys claim the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office lied about the circumstances surrounding the transportation of a Westville Correctional Facility inmate for a June 2023 hearing — and that Gull contradicted the sheriff’s office report about the matter. The defense wants Gulls to testify as a defense witness regarding the matter. Rachel Morin trial postponed until April 2025 Aug. 16, 2024: Gull denied a defense request to have Allen's case dismissed. Richard Allen trial Oct. 14, 2024: Jury selection is set to begin.

Do we have to regulate everything?': DeSantis on Milton crane cr...	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Milton sent a massive crane crashing into the side of a St. Petersburg building on Wednesday, raising concerns about state regulations ahead of natural disasters and whether the state should have mandated the crane be taken down ahead of the storm. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis responded to the crane crash Friday, saying more 'common sense' was needed. 'I think the question is, should there be more regulation, or should there just be more common sense?' DeSantis said. 'I think it just takes a little bit of common sense.' Are more hurricanes heading for Florida?

PETERSBURG, FLORIDA - OCTOBER 10: A crane sits on the street after crashing down into the building housing the Tampa Bay Times offices after the arrival of Hurricane Milton on October 10, 2024 in St. Petersburg, Florida. Milton, which comes just after the recent catastrophic Hurricane Helene, landed into Florida's Gulf Coast late Wednesday evening as a Category 3 storm causing extensive flooding and damage. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) The crane rammed into the side of a large office building Wednesday night, causing severe damage and partial collapse. Police said no one was inside the building during the crash, and caution tape was put up around the damaged area. Developer Red Apple Group confirmed that at least one crane cab in the upper section of the mast fell, and they were working with city officials to assess the situation. City officials blocked off several blocks until they could completely assess the damage and begin working to remove the toppled and twisted crane Thursday. Experts said most cranes are designed for winds of at least 100 mph, and those in places like Florida, where hurricanes are a greater hazard, often have a greater wind resistance. But there is only so much force a crane can handle. That’s why St. Petersburg Mayor Kenneth Welch warned anyone living near construction projects that use a crane to leave, and police made sure areas threatened were cleared. Tom Barth of Barth Crane Inspections in Goose Creek, South Carolina, told The Associated Press that cranes have to be both raised and removed carefully, explaining that it could take days or longer to remove them. That’s time that usually isn’t available once forecasters lock in on a potential path for a storm. Milton gas shortage: Where to find gas in Tampa Bay DeSantis: I don't buy it However, DeSantis said he 'doesn’t buy' that it would have taken that long to take down a crane, especially in preparation for a massive hurricane projected to hit the area. 'I don't buy this idea it takes weeks to mitigate,' DeSantis, a Republican, said. 'I mean, they say the debris takes six months to a year. And then we got 40,000 cubic yards of debris off the Pinellas beaches just by bringing all of our people. ... So, you know, things can be done.' The governor questioned the necessity of additional regulations, emphasizing that common sense and local practices often suffice. Guthrie agreed with DeSantis, saying local governments and construction workers must have contingency plans, as Florida's geography makes it prone to natural disasters. He stressed that the government shouldn't have to overstep by micromanaging everything, but rather, common sense should guide local decisions. 'Disasters are at the local level. At the end of the day, Pinellas County's got a plan. St Pete's got a plan. We need construction workers to have a plan, and you've got to have those contingencies,' Guthrie said. 'I mean, it's not like this snuck out from anywhere. I mean, we had strong seven to 10 days notice that things were heading in this direction.' 'To the governor's point, there's got to be a point where common sense comes into play. We cannot hold everybody's hand and do everything for them,' he said. 'That is not the function of government, whether it's local county or the state government or even the federal government. It's not their job to do that.' Both agree that swift action and local oversight are crucial.

Dog found tied to pole during Milton has new name, animal rescue ...	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — The dog that was found tied to a fence on a Florida highway during evacuations ahead of Hurricane Milton is rehabilitating at an animal rescue facility in Tallahassee, according to a representative from the Leon County Humane Society. The dog was initially spotted by a trooper with the Florida Highway Patrol on Wednesday, along a section of Interstate 75 near Tampa. Video taken by the trooper showed the dog, unable to move from the fence, standing in a pool of water that had already risen up to its belly. Milton recovery efforts underway in Florida The trooper approached the dog, who began barking in his direction. 'I don’t blame you,' the trooper responded. 'I don’t blame you. It’s OK, buddy, it’s OK.' The dog rescued by a trooper with the Florida Highway Patrol is safe and rehabilitated in Tallahassee, according to the Leon County Humane Society. (Florida Highway Patrol Tampa) After the dog was rescued, the Florida Highway Patrol urged Floridians not to abandon their pets during evacuations. 'Do NOT do this to your pets please,' the FHP wrote. The story made national headlines, sparking concern among pet-lovers over the well-being of the animal. In response, a representative from the Leon County Humane Society has since confirmed the dog is safe at its facility. 'We know that without the help with Florida Highway Patrol Troopers with Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles that this dog would not have made it through,' reads a message posted to the Leon County Humane Society’s Facebook page. 'We're grateful the Troopers understood he was a scared and abandoned dog and treated him so patiently and kind during the rescue.' How might Helene, Milton hurricanes affect the election? The facility also revealed the dog’s new name. 'His name is Trooper, because of how much he's been through and to honor those who saved him.' In the post, the Humane Society confirmed the dog was 'stressed and still decompressing' as of Thursday, and will likely not be completely comfortable for months. The organization, too, said it’s 'completely unacceptable' for a pet owner to abandon their animals. 'It was cruel, and it was thoughtless not only toward him, but toward the people who were trying their best to handle the incoming storm,' reads the Facebook post. Close Thank you for signing up!

Obama urges Black men to show up for Harris as he campaigns in cr...	PITTSBURGH (AP) — Former President Barack Obama gave a blistering critique of his White House successor Donald Trump and urged Black men to show up for Kamala Harris as he opened a swing-state tour for the Democratic ticket. At a campaign field office to thank volunteers, Obama said Thursday he wanted to 'speak some truths' after hearing reports on the ground that there was lower enthusiasm for Harris than there was for his own candidacy and that some Black men were thinking of sitting out the election. 'Part of it makes me think — and I’m speaking to men directly — part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,' Obama said. The former president said Trump’s penchant for putting people down was not real strength. 'You’re thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that’s a sign of strength, because that’s what being a man is? Putting women down? That’s not acceptable,' Obama said. Trump responded in a post on his social media network Friday by ignoring Obama’s extended denunciation of him, suggesting the former president might secretly have his support, and by once again insulting Harris. 'Obama admits a total lack of enthusiasm for Kamala, especially with Black Men,' he wrote. 'I think Obama will be voting for me because he doesn’t like the fact that Kamala is an extremely Low IQ Person!' Obama made the battleground state of Pennsylvania the first stop of his campaign tour with less than four weeks until Election Day and as voting is already underway. Speaking at a rally at the University of Pittsburgh, he painted Trump as out-of-touch and not the choice to lead the country to change, calling him a 'bumbling' billionaire 'who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.' He said Harris is 'a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice and a chance' and declared, 'Kamala is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president has ever been.' Obama, eight years out of power, has been one of the Democratic Party’s most reliable surrogates to galvanize voters. Until he was elected president in 2020, Joe Biden had also taken on that role for Democrats, but this year, since ending his reelection campaign and letting Harris ascend to the ticket, he’s yet to hit the trail. Obama, who received a roaring welcome from the crowd, described Trump’s all-caps posts on social media and his 'ranting and the raving about crazy conspiracy theories. The two-hour speeches, word salad, just — it’s like Fidel Castro. Just on and on. Constant attempts to sell you stuff. Who does that?' Obama listed some of the products Trump has tried to sell during his third White House campaign, including $399 gold sneakers, a $100,000 watch and his 'God Bless the USA' Bible for $59.99. 'He wants you to buy the word of God: Donald Trump edition. Got his name right there next to Matthew and Luke,' Obama said, laughing. 'You could not make this stuff up.' The appearance by Obama, the nation’s first Black president, underscores the history-making nature of Harris' own political career. Harris, the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president, would be the first woman to serve as president if elected next month. Obama's old campaign rallying cry, 'Yes, We Can,' was even refashioned for the event, with 'Yes, She Can' beaming on a screen over the crowd. Both Harris and Trump have been vying for support from Black Americans. A recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 7 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, with few differences between Black male and female voters on how they view the Democratic candidate. Black voters’ opinions of Trump, by contrast, were overwhelmingly negative, according to the poll, but the former president believes his message on the economy, immigration and traditional values can make inroads into the Democrats’ traditional base of support among Black voters, especially younger Black men. Obama acknowledged that the last few years, starting with the pandemic, have been hard for Americans, with high prices and other stresses on working families. 'I get it, why people are looking to shake things up. I mean, I am the hopey-changey guy. So I understand people feeling frustrated and feeling we can do better,' Obama said. 'What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, Pennsylvania.' He mocked Trump’s answer in the debate that he would replace Obama’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, with 'concepts of a plan,' and his running mate JD Vance’s recent comment that Trump worked to 'salvage' the law. 'Donald Trump spent his entire presidency trying to tear it down. And by the way, he couldn’t even do that right.' Obama also referred to a new court filing in the federal election interference case against Trump that said Trump told an aide, 'So what?' after being told his vice president, Mike Pence, had been rushed to a safe location after a violent crowd of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. 'If Donald Trump does not care that a mob might attack his own vice president, do you think he cares about you?' he asked. Glenda Ellison, a 71-year-old retired schoolteacher and Democrat from Pittsburgh, said she is feeling 'a little nervous' about the election but 'prayerful that it’s going to turn out in our favor.' Ellison said she sees Obama as a party spokesperson with a large following who can hopefully sway voters that might be on the fence about voting for Harris. 'As a former president, and also as a Black president, I think that is something that might connect with the African American community, the fact that we do have our Black president supporting another Black candidate,' said Ellison, who is Black. Obama was among the key Democrats who were part of a behind-the-scenes effort to encourage Biden, his former vice president, to drop out of the 2024 race. Obama and Harris have been friends for two decades since he ran for Senate in Illinois. She campaigned for him when he sought the presidency in 2008. Pennsylvania is a state Obama won in his 2008 and 2012 presidential races, but Trump won in 2016. Biden narrowly carried it in 2020 and the state is shaping up to be one of the most closely contested in this year’s race. Trump was in the eastern part of the state Wednesday for back-to-back rallies in Scranton and Reading. He also campaigned in western Pennsylvania over the weekend when he returned to Butler, where he was shot in July as he survived an assassination attempt. Obama’s appearance at the University of Pittsburgh was also aimed to bolster the reelection campaign of Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who is being challenged by Trump-endorsed Republican David McCormick. ___ This story has been updated to correct Butler's location to western not eastern Pennsylvania.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-obama-hits-campaign-trail-in-critical-pennsylvania-to-shore-up-support-for-harris/	2024-10-11T07:28:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670936d445f230.66111013.jpeg?w=900
How might Helene, Milton hurricanes affect the election?	(NewsNation) — Arguments over voter access are brewing as the November election approaches — particularly in storm-damaged Florida, which has 30 electoral votes. Nothing is certain as crews continue to survey the damage from Hurricane Milton. However, voting rights groups have gone to federal court seeking to reopen voter registration, which ended Monday. A federal judge shot down the request and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also refused to extend the deadline. How to help Helene and Milton survivors What happens now? Activist groups may try to appeal the denial, claiming back-to-back hurricanes may have caused thousands of voters to miss the deadline. Meanwhile, DeSantis said he’s prepared to issue an executive order that would allow supervisors to change voting sites in the wake of Hurricane Milton, but he hasn’t done so yet. The governor has issued a similar executive order in 10 of Florida’s hardest-hit counties in response to Hurricane Helene. It allows election leaders to make early voting changes and set up consolidated polling sites. It also softens restrictions on mail-in ballots and allows state employees to take paid administrative leave to serve as polling workers on election day. How could hurricane damage affect the 2024 election? Despite the widespread damage across Florida, analysts predict the state will remain widely Republican. The state is home to a reported 5.3 million active registered Republican voters — a million more than Democrats. North Carolina, still reeling from Hurricane Helene, is also an important swing state with 16 electoral votes. Many of the hardest-hit areas from the Category 4 hurricane were Republican-leaning, affecting 8% of eligible voters. Election leaders say they’re doing everything they can to ensure people will be able to cast their votes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/florida-election-hurricanes-milton-helene-voter-registration/	2024-10-11T05:37:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24284729461489.jpg?w=900
Milton recovery efforts underway in Florida as 2.4M without power	(NewsNation) — Crews resumed rescue and recovery efforts Friday morning in Florida, working around the clock to help people in the wake of Hurricane Milton. At least 10 storm-related deaths have been reported so far, according to the White House. NewsNation local affiliate WFLA reported that one of those killed was a Polk County employee who was helping with cleanup. As of 7 a.m. ET Friday, more than 2.4 million customers remained without power in Florida, according to poweroutage.us. Still, many expressed relief that Milton wasn’t worse. The hurricane spared densely populated Tampa a direct hit, and the lethal storm surge that scientists feared never materialized. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that while the storm 'was significant,' it 'was not the worst-case scenario.' He noted that as he flew over some of the hard-hit areas, he saw that many homes that were built in recent years fared well. 'I’ve seen a lot of grit, I’ve seen a lot of determination and I’m very confident that this area is going to bounce back very, very quickly,' DeSantis said.

(AP Photo/Mike Carlson) Milton made landfall Wednesday evening in Siesta Key as a Category 3 storm. By Thursday afternoon, Milton had moved off Florida's east coast and became a post-tropical cyclone that no longer had hurricane-force winds. Following Hurricane Milton’s landfall, rescue crews have been surveying the damage, with those in north Tampa using airboats to reach people. Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said crews have been working hard through the morning to reach those in need of help. Arriving just two weeks after the devastating Hurricane Helene, the system knocked out power to more than 3 million customers, flooded barrier islands, tore the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays' baseball stadium and toppled a construction crane. Officials in hard-hit counties have warned people to beware of downed power lines, trees in roads, blocked bridges and flooding. Before Milton even made landfall, heavy rain and tornadoes lashed parts of southern Florida. Just inland from Tampa, the flooding in Plant City was 'absolutely staggering,' according to City Manager Bill McDaniel. The National Weather Service said almost 19 inches of rain fell in the St. Petersburg area. A storm surge of 8 to 10 feet was reported in Sarasota County. Milton rapidly weakened to a Category 1 storm as it moved over land. President Joe Biden called on Congress to move as fast as it could to get emergency funding to the Sunshine State. DeSantis pledged to send whatever resources he could into Pinellas County communities Friday. It's an area that was mostly spared during Milton but was hit hard by Hurricane Helene, resulting in 12 deaths two weeks prior. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, the following ports are now open: Key West, Port Everglades, Port Miami and the Miami River. The following ports remain closed: St. Petersburg, Fort Myers, Fort of Palm Beach, Fort Pierce, Port Canaveral, Jacksonville and Fernandina.

The airport said it is working with the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration and other airlines to aim for a Friday morning reopening. Flooding damaged a hangar Wednesday. Florida theme parks including Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld planned to reopen Friday after an assessment of the effects of Hurricane Milton. Some Halloween special events won’t be offered and they won’t necessarily be fully functioning Friday, but the public is welcome back, the parks said in statements. As Milton came ashore as a major storm Wednesday, all three Orlando-based parks shut down, putting a damper on the vacations of tens of thousands of tourists, many of whom hunkered down in hotels. Disney World, Universal and SeaWorld were all closed for at least part of Wednesday and all of Thursday. Orlando International Airport, Florida’s busiest, resumed domestic arrivals Thursday and planned to resume departures Friday after mostly shutting down Wednesday. In Tampa, the animals were safe at popular tourist attractions ZooTampa and The Florida Aquarium, which have aimed to reopen Saturday. The 1,000 animals at the zoo will remain in their night houses and hurricane shelter locations while habitats are cleared of debris, a spokesperson said. The aquarium also confirmed its animals are 'doing well.' The zoo sustained some damage from the high winds and does not have power, and the spokesperson anticipates the debris cleanup and restoration, which is already underway, will take a few days. All conservation parks, nature preserves, trails, neighborhood/specialty parks and athletic complexes in Hillsborough County will be closed until further notice. Massive hole swallows 2 homes in Florida after Milton Officials warn of hurricane relief scams As relief efforts continue, the U.S. Department of Justice is alerting the public to a rise in scams aimed at exploiting victims of these disasters. According to the DOJ, scammers are quick to exploit weather disasters and the people affected by them. Officials also reminded people that if their property was damaged by both Helene and Milton, they would need to apply for disaster assistance twice, with separate applications for the damage from each storm. CNN’s Anderson Cooper hit by flying object during Milton live shot Are more hurricanes heading for Florida? As Milton exits Florida, the National Hurricane Center continues to monitor another system in the Atlantic, which is not expected to make landfall or come close to the U.S. According to the National Hurricane Center’s 5 a.m. Friday advisory, Tropical Storm Leslie was about 1,600 miles west-southwest of the Azores, a group of islands in the mid-Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. The storm is expected to turn northeast and veer away from the U.S. over the next few days.

Where are Trump, Harris, JD Vance and Tim Walz campaigning today?	(NewsNation) — Presidential candidates are hitting the 2024 campaign trail ahead of the November election. The campaign season so far has been atypical. Former President Donald Trump suffered a graze wound to his ear during a July 13 assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where one attendee died and at least two others were injured. About a week later, President Joe Biden announced he no longer planned to accept the Democratic nomination and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the job. Harris then chose Minnesota Gov.

Biden suggests Trump 'get a life' after false hurricane claims	(The Hill) — President Joe Biden on Thursday said that former President Trump 'should get a life' amid false claims from Trump and his allies about the federal response to the recent hurricanes. 'Mr. President Trump, former President Trump, get a life man, help these people,' Biden said in remarks on Hurricane Milton from the White House. Biden was questioned if he has spoken to Trump about spreading misinformation and responded, 'Are you kidding me?' Hurricane Milton: What is FEMA’s plan for aid? The president said that the 'public will hold (Trump) accountable,' adding that the press will do so as well because 'you know the truth.' And, when questioned if he plans to speak with Trump directly, he replied an emphatic 'no.' Biden specially called out a claim from Trump that those impacted by the storm are only receiving $750 in government assistance. 'That $750 that they’re talking about, Mr. Trump and all those other people know that’s a lie to suggest that’s all they’re going to get. That’s bizarre. It’s bizarre,' the president said. 'You’ve got to stop this. I mean they’re being so damn un-American with how they’re talking about this stuff.' Biden has called for Trump and his allies, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to stop spreading misinformation in the wake of Hurricanes Helene and now Milton. He also gave two speeches from the White House on Wednesday to try to combat misinformation. Milton made landfall late Wednesday along Florida’s Gulf Coast. The deadly storm surge led to flooding and millions of Floridians experiencing power outages.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-trump-get-life-false-hurricane-claims/	2024-10-11T02:37:31-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24284661071030-e1728607621392.jpg?w=800

Hurricane Milton strikes Florida, officials warn of hurricane rel...	RICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) -- Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida Wednesday night, following the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene roughly two weeks prior, which resulted in over 200 deaths and extensive property damage. As relief efforts continue, the United States Department of Justice is alerting the public to a rise in scams aimed at exploiting victims of these disasters. Milton started its destruction in California Wednesday, Oct. 9 as a Category 3 storm but has since weakened to a Category 1 as it travels across Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center. As of Thursday morning, the storm has cut off power to more than 3 million people, spawned a number of tornadoes and killed four people. According to the Justice Department, scammers are quick to exploit weather disasters and the people affected by them. Milton live updates: At least 10 dead, 2.8M without power in Florida The Justice Department, including the NCDF, stands ready to prevent these bad actors from fraudulent activity. We are here to support victims of natural disasters during these difficult times together with our state, local and federal partners, and agencies. In an effort to assist the most vulnerable neighbors who are susceptible to these types of fraudulent schemes, we encourage you to be diligent in reporting suspicious activity on their behalf. U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Gathe Jr. for the Middle District of Louisiana, Executive Director of the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) According to the department, the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, scammers will often use the following kinds of scams to take advantage: Fraudulent charities soliciting donations for disaster victims that often imitate the names of charities linked to the disaster. Scammers impersonating government officials, offering disaster relief in exchange for personal information or money. Scammers promoting non-existent businesses or investment opportunities related to disaster recovery, such as rebuilding or flood-proofing. Price gouging for essential goods and services needed by disaster victims. Businesses using supply chain disruptions as a cover for collusion to overcharge customers. The department encourages people to exercise caution before giving money or personal information to someone on the phone, and reminds people of the following: Only scammers will insist that you pay for services by wire transfer, gift card, payment app, cryptocurrency or in cash. If they promise to help you qualify for relief for a fee, it is a scam. You should never sign your insurance check over to someone else. Make sure you research contractors and get estimates from more than one before signing a work contract. Get a written contract for repairs and read it carefully before signing. Jonathan McNamara with the American Red Cross emphasized to 8News that the organization will never request money or personal information through phone calls. As Florida grapples with the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, officials urge residents to stay informed and cautious, ensuring that their donations reach legitimate organizations working to aid those in need. If you do get a scam call like this, you can report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud by completing a Disaster Complaint Form or by calling 866-720-5721, which is a hotline staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/hurricane-milton-strikes-florida-officials-warn-of-hurricane-relief-scams/	2024-10-10T17:15:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/hurricane-_1530463789233_47339741_ver1.0.jpg?w=900
Tampa sees 5x the usual October rainfall due to Hurricane Milton	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Hurricane Milton's landfall as a Category 3 hurricane didn't just bring devastating storm surge and extremely dangerous wind speeds, it also left Tampa Bay soaked with historic rainfall. Tampa Bay faced a potential threat of catastrophic 15-foot storm surge, but this was averted when the hurricane swerved into Sarasota County near Siesta Key. How to help Helene and Milton survivors However, this meant that the counties north of Milton's eye were hit by heavy rainfall. St. Petersburg saw 15 to 18 inches of rainfall, while areas in and around Tampa saw 12 to 13 inches of rain. Even counties further inland saw historic levels of rain, well after the hurricane hit land. 'In fact, in some areas, it's about a once-in-a-500-year event, believe it or not,' said Jeff Berardelli, Max Defender 8 chief meteorologist. 'Very, very rare event in parts of our area.' In Tampa, Milton produced 12 inches of rain, more than five times the normal amount of rain for October. The normal amount for the entire month is usually 2.3 inches of rain. At times, people think of hurricanes as more of a threat when it comes to storm surge or winds, but with rain like this, Tampa Bay residents saw unprecedented flooding that struck their neighborhoods and homes, even outside the evacuation zones. Video: Hurricane Milton sucks water out of Tampa Bay 'We're talking a foot and a half of rainfall, and now that is what is leading to those lower-lying areas where you hear people say, 'Well we don't normally flood. We're not in an evacuation zone,'' Max Defender 8 Meteorologist Amanda Holly said. 'Well, when you get 18 inches of rain over a big area, yeah, you will see abnormally high water levels get into areas that don't normally flood.' With the heavy rainfall brought by hurricanes Debby, Helene, and Milton, 2024 has become the wettest year on record for the Tampa Bay area. After Milton, Tampa saw 77.11' inches of rain, more than 32.93 inches more than the normal yearly amount. 'Even if we don't get another drop of rain for the entire rest of the year, we will end the wettest year on record in Tampa,' Holly said. While the rains are out of our area, there is a fear of river flooding as they crest after the hurricane. The Anclote River, the Hillsborough River, the Little Manatee River, the Alafia River, and the Manatee River are all areas of concern. However, Tampa Bay will now experience some dry northern air that will reduce the humidity. 'It couldn't take the rain chance out completely, but I really think that outside of getting a quick little sprinkle, the day is going to feel comfortable,' Max Defender 8 meteorologist Leigh Spann said. 'And it's going to stick around with nice dry conditions all the way through the weekend.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/tampa-october-rainfall-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-10T16:59:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177054224-e1728604536853.jpg?w=800
TikToker Morgan Roos on riding out Milton: ‘It got dicey’	(NewsNation) — TikToker Morgan Roos updated her fans Thursday morning on what happened overnight as she rode out Hurricane Milton from her high-rise apartment on Tampa’s Riverwalk. 'It got dicey,' she said. 'I’m so grateful and so blessed to be OK.' Roos, a new Tampa resident, recounted spending the night in the hallway of her apartment building. 'I could hear on the upper floors a banging, like a window had popped. That was, like, getting my anxiety all high,' she said. At least 10 dead following Milton landfall in Florida 'Then at about 4:30 in the morning, I hear, like, this huge bang noise? And I can hear rushing water. And I hear, like, down the hallway, and I see water droplets. And I look down, and there’s like f------ water coming out of a light.' Roos said she then decided to go back inside her apartment, where the windows were intact, but water was everywhere. She also apologized for not taking video of the damage in real time. After getting back to sleep after 5 a.m., then waking up late Thursday morning, Roos reflected on sustaining a little water damage and losing her Wi-Fi connection for a while. 'You know like when you finally feel safe after a really stressful situation? Your body like kinda collapses? That’s how I felt,' she said. Floridian who rode out Milton ‘wouldn’t stay’ if he had do-over On Wednesday afternoon, as Milton approached the Florida Gulf Coast, Roos told 'NewsNation Now' she was having second thoughts about staying.

Not at the moment	(NewsNation) — As Hurricane Milton exits Florida, the National Hurricane Center is continuing to monitor another system in the Atlantic, which is not expected to make landfall or come close to the U.S. According to the National Hurricane Center’s 5 p.m. Thursday advisory, Tropical Storm Leslie was about 1,710 miles west-southwest of the Azores, a group of islands in the mid-Atlantic. The storm is expected to turn north tonight and veer away from the U.S. over the next few days. Photos: First look at Siesta Key after Hurricane Milton 'Rapid weakening is forecast to continue during the next day or so, and Leslie is forecast to lose tropical characteristics in a few days,' the NHC said in its latest update. There have also been false rumors on social media of a 'Hurricane Nadine' heading toward Central Florida. Nadine is indeed the next name on the list of tropical storms for 2024, but as of right now, nothing has developed. Hurricane Milton: What is FEMA's plan for aid? 'I don't see anything that's coming our way anytime soon,' said Justin Mosley, a meteorologist at NewsNation affiliate Suncoast News Network. So far, there have been 13 named storms in the 2024 hurricane season, which lasts until the end of November. Two weeks ago, Hurricane Helene hit the Big Bend region of Florida as a Category 4 storm, killing more than 200 people and leaving a wake of destruction in its path. Now, at least 10 people are dead after Hurricane Milton made landfall as a Category 3 storm Wednesday night. More than 3 million homes and businesses were without power in Florida on Thursday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/storms-heading-florida/	2024-10-10T15:30:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177012789.jpg?w=900
‘Gators, stingrays, snakes’: Floridians urged to avoid floodwater...	TAMPA, Fla. (NewsNation) — Florida officials are warning the public to avoid floodwaters caused by Hurricane Milton, saying a myriad of dangers are lurking in murky water. Frank Robb, an alligator expert and founder of the nonprofit group Environmental Education Awareness Research Support and Services (EEARSS), told NewsNation the dangers you face largely depend on where you live. 'If you're coastal, you have to worry about everything from stingrays to alligators, you know. If you're in South Florida, you gotta think about crocodiles, snakes — of course,' Robb said. 'It's definitely something to be aware of and keep on your mind.' Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment The worst storm surge appeared to be in Sarasota County, where it was 8 to 10 feet — lower than in the worst place during Helene. The storm also dumped up to 18 inches of rain in some areas. Robb recommends avoiding floodwaters at all costs but has advice for those who need to venture outside. 'Obviously, if it's not water you can see through, you probably shouldn't be wading through it,' he said. 'If you have to walk through it, carry a walking stick, something to put in front of you to feel where you're going.' Robb cautioned, however, that the most dangerous things dwelling in the depths of the dark water aren’t likely to be animals. 'You should be worried about microscopic organisms and bacteria. Those are the things to be really concerned about,' he said. 'Wildlife is going to be wildlife no matter what. The last thing they want to do is have an interaction with you. Again, it's the bacteria, pathogens and things of that nature that should really be on people's mind.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/floridians-urged-to-avoid-floodwaters/	2024-10-10T14:11:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177829552.jpg?w=900
Live: Trump visits Aurora after Venezuelan gang claims	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump held a rally in Aurora, Colorado, on Friday — a city his campaign called a 'war zone' in its announcement, claiming the city has seen an 'influx of violent Venezuelan prison gang members from Tren de Aragua.' His campaign issued a statement on Trump's proposal for a federal effort to remove gang members who are in the U.S. illegally, invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target members of cartel networks. Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman, a Republican, disputes that characterization and said concerns about Venezuelan gang activity have been 'grossly exaggerated.' 'Former President Trump’s visit to Aurora is an opportunity to show him and the nation that Aurora is a considerably safe city — not a city overrun by Venezuelan gangs,' Coffman said in a social media post on Tuesday. Aurora police: Gang has not taken over apartment complex During last month's presidential debate, Trump cited Aurora as an example of the Biden administration's border policy. 'They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently,' Trump said. 'These are the people that (Harris) and Biden let into our country.' The former president's remarks came after a viral video began circulating in August showing armed men in the hallway of an Aurora apartment complex. The Aurora Police Department has said it has no evidence that the people in the video are involved with any gang and they haven't been able to link the individuals to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. Coffman said the incidents were 'limited to several apartment complexes in this city of more than 400,000 residents.' Nevertheless, Aurora Police have acknowledged that 'components of Tren de Aragua' are operating in the area and have identified at least 10 known members. Those men face charges that include assault, burglary, kidnapping and attempted murder. Arrest warrants have been issued for the six armed men in the viral video, though only one has been taken into custody. They face felony charges of first-degree burglary and menacing. Trump says migrants who have committed murder have introduced ‘a lot of bad genes in our country’ In a statement to NewsNation affiliate FOX31, Colorado's Democratic Governor Jared Polis pushed back on Trump's rhetoric and said the former president will find an 'incredible city with two straight years of rapidly declining crime' when he visits Aurora. 'As Coloradans, we are proud of Aurora, proud of Colorado, and proud of the United States of America,' he said. The Trump rally is set for 1 p.m. on Friday at the Gaylord Rockies Resort and Convention Center, near Denver International Airport.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-aurora-venezuelan-gang/	2024-10-10T12:20:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2175694409.jpg?w=900
14-year-old found floating on fence in Tampa floodwaters after Hu...	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) – A 14-year-old was rescued after Hurricane Milton's floodwaters trapped him on a floating piece of a fence in the middle of Tampa, Florida. Video published by the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office showed Sheriff Chad Chronister and a deputy finding the boy floating on a street in front of a small grocery store. How to help Helene and Milton survivors 'Stay right there,' the rescue crew told the boy as they spun their boat around to grab him. Speaking with Melissa Marino of NewsNation affiliate WFLA, Chronister explained that the boy had evacuated from Hurricane Milton and was staying at a friend's house. However, when the boy tried to walk back home after the storm, he underestimated how deep the water was and could not swim well enough to get through. 'It was literally out of a castaway movie, him laying on top of a fence, waving at us,' Chronister said. 'Out of breath, gasping for air as we pulled him up.' Once the boy was pulled out of the floodwater, he was helped to solid ground before continuing home safely. Over 135 rescued from Tampa assisted living facility amid Milton flood That particular neighborhood was not in an evacuation zone, Chronister acknowledged. Still, it suffered what he had referred to as 'unprecedented' flooding. Hillsborough County Fire Rescue reported that 350 911 calls were made between 9:30 p.m. Wednesday and 3:30 a.m. Thursday. However, it is not known exactly how many people have been rescued yet.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/hurricane-milton-tampa-floodwaters/	2024-10-10T12:10:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/HCSO-RESCUES-14-YEAR-OLD-BOY.00_00_00_12.Still001.jpg?w=640
Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment	(NewsNation) — Once an emergency is declared — like in the case of Hurricanes Milton and Helene — the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) can unleash various types of aid. Much of what the agency does is give out money in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. That can include assistance to individuals affected by disasters, such as payments of $750 to pay for their immediate needs — like medicine or diapers — after a storm or earthquake hits. It can also mean additional money to rent an apartment because their home is destroyed or to pay for a storage unit. That $750, however, has been mischaracterized by several high-profile politicians, including former President Donald Trump. Hurricane Milton: What is FEMA’s plan for aid? He, and others, have claimed that the $750 payment is a loan and that is the only form of assistance FEMA is providing. The initial $750 is the first payment FEMA will make to storm survivors. They are also who eligible for other forms of assistance.

Tampa residents credit Native American legend for Helene, Milton ...	(NewsNation) — For more than a week, Hurricane Milton was forecasted to make direct landfall over the Tampa Bay area. Yet, in a last-minute wobble, the Category 3 storm veered away from the city Wednesday and spared locals from an anticipated massive storm surge. Instead, the hurricane made landfall in Siesta Key as a Category 3 storm Wednesday night. Now, Pinellas County residents are thanking a benevolent spirit they say guards them from storms and other hazards. ‘I’m fine’: Tampa’s ‘Lt. Dan’ survives Hurricane Milton on his boat The Tocobaga Tribe lore Local legend has it that mounds built by the Tocobaga tribe hundreds of years ago protected the area from major storms for centuries. The tribe lived in small villages between what is now Safety Harbor and the Gandy area, from 900 to the 1500s, but died out from disease and violence from Spanish settlers in the 17th century, according to Pinellas County’s website. In those villages, the tribe would build mounds made of layers of shells and sand. The mounds were used as temples, homes and burial grounds. The oldest remaining one is located near Old Tampa Bay. Some locals claim the tribe blessed the mounds for protection from hurricanes and other hazards, but we have yet to confirm the validity of their story. 'The Tocobaga tribe legend is big down here. People feel it keeps us safe,' Largo resident Denise Walenter-Just told NewsNation. Helene survivor says he had ‘guardian angel’ before rescue Locals praise Tocobaga for averting Milton Milton tracked to the south in the final hours and landed as a Category 3 storm Wednesday night in Siesta Key, about 70 miles south of Tampa. While it caused a lot of damage and water levels may continue to rise for days, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said it was not 'the worst-case scenario.' The deadly storm surge feared for Tampa appears not to have materialized, though the situation in the area was still a major emergency. The storm brought up to 18 inches of rain to spots in the Tampa and St. Petersburg areas. DeSantis said that the worst storm surge appeared to be in Sarasota County, where it was 8 to 10 feet — less than in the worst place during Helene. 'Everyone is thanking the Tocobaga for not getting a direct hit,' Walenter-Just said. Tampa City Councilman Bill Carlson said Thursday he and his neighbors were relieved when Milton took a last-minute turn away from their hometown. Carlson attributed the hurricane's southern wobble to the Native American spirit. 'Many people in the area believe there's a Native American spirit there that protects us from storms because it seems like every time a storm comes it either turns left or turns right,' Carlson said. The region didn’t escape the hurricane entirely. Carlson lives in a mandatory evacuation zone and spoke to NewsNation remotely from a hotel. Many people are still without power, and the city is asking residents not to venture out yet, cautioning about flooding and downed power lines. How to help Helene and Milton survivors Did Tocobaga legend cost lives? While locals thank the Tocobaga spirit, the legend has the potential to cause more harm than good in the Tampa Bay area. When Hurricane Helene dragged along Florida's western coast, residents refused to evacuate thinking the hit wouldn't do much damage to their area. However, local officials warned Floridians to evacuate ahead of the storm, saying Helene's storm surge could be deadly. It was. At least 12 people died in Pinellas County from the Category 4 storm. Helene hit the Tampa Bay area harder than any other hurricane in 103 years. While the property damage was mostly unavoidable, there didn’t have to be any deaths — the National Hurricane Center issued its first storm surge warning two days before Helene arrived, telling the barrier islands’ residents they should pack up and get out. Helene's devastation shocked locals. Walenter-Just said Pinellas County doesn't normally flood that bad before, so people don't evacuate, even though the news was stressing that Helene was going to be bad. 'People have had water before but four feet inside your home is just unimaginable,' she said. For Helene, most of Walenter-Just's neighbors and friends decided to stay put. She was also going to stay at her home just over the Indian Rocks Causeway Bridge but decided when Helene approached to retreat further inland to her daughter's place. For Milton, Walenter-Just boarded up her home and planned to stay with her daughter from the beginning. She wasn't taking any chances. United Cajun Navy deploys for 2nd time in 2 weeks for Milton Helene's devastation prevented additional casualties Seminole, Florida, resident Harry Berg rode out Hurricane Milton with his family instead of evacuating. He told NewsNation on Thursday morning that if he had to make that decision all over again, he wouldn't stay. 'I’ve never seen anything like this,' he said. After a very long night and lots of flooding, Berg concluded that he was grateful for Helene's initial impact. He explained that Helene gave the Tampa Bay area a 'little kiss' on its way by, leaving some destruction in its wake along the Pinellas County coastline. By doing so, it instilled a bit of fear within the locals. 'Everybody thinks that the Tampa Bay area is always going to be spared because of the Tocobago Indian lore,' he said. He said that because Helene hit just under two weeks ago, millions of people evacuated from the western coastline out of fear that what could happen with Milton would be worse than Helene. Berg ultimately believes the evacuations lowered Milton's casualty count.

Watch: Hurricane Milton sends massive crane crashing into office ...	(NewsNation) —A St. Petersburg, Florida, resident said he was 'terrified' the moment he heard a massive crane crash into a nearby building, fearing another would come down on him as fierce winds from Hurricane Milton pummeled the area Wednesday. The crane rammed into the side of a large office building Wednesday night, causing severe damage and partial collapse. ‘I’m fine’: Tampa’s ‘Lt. Dan’ survives Hurricane Milton on his boat Resident John Silling lives across from the building that was hit and told NewsNation he ran for cover after the crash. 'We heard a massive explosion. We heard glass shatter. We were pretty, pretty terrified,' he said. 'I ran into the stairwell of the building next to it in hopes that the other crane wouldn't come down,' he said. 'We kept looking out the window to see if the other one was coming.' Silling said he had gone through Hurricane Ian in 2022, but 'it was nothing compared to this.' The crane came down on a building previously occupied by the Tampa Bay Times newspaper.

Hurricane Milton: What is FEMA's plan for aid?	(NewsNation) — Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) leaders say about $11 billion is available for Hurricane Milton response efforts. So far, those efforts include urban and Coast Guard search-and-rescue teams, millions of meals and about 5,000 tons of water, among other aid. The FEMA relief process generally requires states to conduct individual assessments and calculations of the damages and then submit that information to federal government. Post-Milton gas in Florida will be a challenge: GasBuddy founder What aid is available for Hurricane Milton recovery? As of Thursday, FEMA said it has enough to help the most immediate emergency needs of people affected by Hurricanes Milton and Helene. FEMA can also tap into other funds that would divert resources for some longer-term projects to immediate needs. The response includes about 1,200 federal search-and-rescue personnel, three Coast Guard swift water rescue teams, tens of billions of meals and several tons of water to help storm survivors. More than 8,000 federal personnel, including FEMA disaster survivor assistance teams, have been deployed to neighborhoods across affected states, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. Nearly 300 emergency calls pending in Sarasota County after Milton What future plans are in store? President Joe Biden spoke overnight with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan for the latest storm updates. He also spoke over the phone with mayors of Orlando and Sarasota. The Army Corps of Engineers, health care groups and debris removal experts also traveled to affected areas to aid with recovery. Hundreds of ambulances will be made available to medical crews and 5,000 Florida National Guard members were placed on standby ahead of the storm, according to the Pentagon. Biden’s schedule remained relatively clear Thursday morning. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are expected to receive updates throughout the day.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/fema-hurricane-milton-recovery/	2024-10-10T08:22:21-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175616737-1-1.jpg?w=900
Helene survivor says he had 'guardian angel' before rescue	GREENEVILLE, Tenn. (WJHL) - David Boutin was stuck in flood waters for six hours before being rescued when Hurricane Helene swept through the region. Tragically, one of the rescuers, Boone McCrary, lost his life while attempting to save Boutin. On Sept. 27, the Nolichucky River flooded into Boutin's home. He described seeing the water rise up his driveway. That's when he went outside to pull his van to safety. Then, he went back inside to retrieve his dog 'Buddy,' cell phone and wallet. 'When I went in the bedroom to get him [Buddy], it was ankle deep,' Boutin said. 'Within a minute, it was up to my waist. And I went outside the house to try to get to a ladder to get on the roof. And the river just took us, took Buddy from my arms. I just went pinning along trees. Every time I hold on to a tree, it'd break and I'd just go downriver even further.' Tennessee nurse and his dog died trying to save a man from floods driven by Hurricane Helene Boutin was stranded in floodwaters for six hours before rescuers reached him. 'I didn't think I was gonna get rescued,' Boutin said. 'I couldn't see where I was at. I didn't know. All I knew is hold on to trees. And if I went out to the middle of the river, I wouldn't have made it.' The following day, Boutin learned that Boone McCrary, a rescuer, had gone missing while trying to save him. McCrary's family knew he was out saving people when they heard his boat had hit a bridge and capsized. McCrary's mother, Debbie Fisher, heard he was being rescued, so she went to check at Bird's Bridge. 'They came up and I asked, 'are you going to have to carry Boone up?' So I thought maybe he was injured,' Fisher said. 'They said this was Boone. But I said, 'no, that's not my Boone.' And that's when the nightmare really started because I thought he was being rescued.' It was actually Boutin who was rescued, while McCrary's body was discovered days later. Boutin attended McCrary's funeral service to pay his respects. How to help Helene and Milton survivors 'It lifted a big weight off my shoulder, you know, walked up to his casket, put my hand on there and thanked him for risking his life for me,' Boutin said. Boutin said he is praying for McCrary's family and friends. 'I'm blessed,' Boutin said. 'He's my guardian angel. I wish it didn't go down how it did.'

McCrary's mother and sister said that's just how courageous he was. 'My brother lived life to the fullest,' Laura Harville, McCrary's sister, said. 'He always put himself last and put others first. And I think that if you were to look on social media, you can see that from what others have said. One of his friends that would come and hunt with him, made a story on Tik-Tok and it was true. He's just a good old boy. He'd give you the shirt off his back.' Fisher agrees. She said all of the devastation, plus losing her son, is very traumatizing. 'It did my heart good to see all the people that he had touched and changed their lives and how much love and support he had showed them and kindness,' Fisher said. 'It does my heart good, but I still would love to have Boone here with me. I woke up this morning, I decided it was going to be a better day because Boone would not be happy if I was just not together at all. I could see him saying to me Mom...' 'Don't embarrass me,' Harville added. 'Don't be crying and embarrassing me,' Fisher said. 'And he'd also tell me [he would] say, 'Mom, you better suck it up.'' Fisher recounted her liver transplant last year and how much her son was there for her during that time. Boone McCrary and his dog 'Moss' (Photo: Laura Harville) Both McCrary's mother and sister are grateful that Boutin is alive and was able to be rescued. 'His life is precious and I told him that we're happy that he made it out because he was in dire straits, too,' Fisher said. 'And I seen him rescued, and I'm thankful that he was saved. So Boone made these decisions, but I know without a doubt if he knew the outcome, he would make that decision again to help somebody.' 'No doubt, there's no doubt in my mind that he would do it,' Harville added. Harville said she is starting a non-profit in the memory of her brother called 'Boone's Brigade.' The aim will be to help others learn outdoor skills, like hunting, fishing and boating. Activities that Boone McCrary enjoyed. McCrary was also an emergency room nurse at Greeneville Community East Hospital. Harville and Fisher are thankful for all of the community's support. Fisher also believes it would be helpful if local law enforcement had a liaison to help families of missing people. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

His property on Little Indian Creek Road consisted of three houses on a compound that belonged to him, his brother and his father. All three houses no longer stand. Belongings are scattered around the property, and many were washed away in the river. Eight vehicles are a total loss. Boutin spent 10 years, building his own home. He also never found his dog, Buddy. 'For four years, he was my best friend,' Boutin said. 'And he was just ripped from my arms and I couldn't do [anything].' David Boutin and his dog 'Buddy' (Photo: David Boutin) Boutin sustained physical injuries from the night he was stuck in flood waters. 'I went to the hospital the next day because I was getting headaches real bad,' Boutin said. 'And they said I had a concussion. I had a bruised chest and I also had a respiratory infection from the river. Still right now, I got migraines that won't go away. No medical insurance, so I can't go back to the doctor and get a follow-up.' Boutin has also been grappling with the mental toll of the devastation. 'I have nightmares of that night,' Boutin said. 'It’s hard, especially when the migraines wake [me] up in the morning. With bad migraines, but I still go to work. I have to, it’s the only way I’m going to rebuild. I just have to keep going one day at a time.' Boutin expressed his desire to return to his property in some way, perhaps in a camper, houseboat or any kind of home. However, he's still not sure. 'I love this place. It means everything to me,' Boutin said. 'I did everything I could to make this place nice. And just within minutes, everything got torn away. A lot of years of work.' Boutin is currently staying at his son's house in Morristown. He has a donation page set up to help rebuild his life.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/helene-survivor-guardian-angel/	2024-10-10T07:40:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/David-2.png?w=745

Nearly 300 emergency calls pending in Sarasota County after Milto...	(NewsNation) — Nearly 300 emergency calls were pending Thursday morning in Sarasota County, Florida, as first responders prepared to begin search-and-rescue efforts in the hours after Hurricane Milton’s landfall. Strong winds whipped by police headquarters and the area’s emergency center as workers fielded hundreds of calls related to the Category 3 hurricane, Sarasota County Sheriff Kurt Hoffman said. ‘I’m fine’: Tampa’s ‘Lt. Dan’ survives Hurricane Milton on his boat 'I’ve lived here over 40 years and 30 years in law enforcement in this community,' Hoffman told NewsNation on 'Morning in America.' 'This is the first time I’ve seen a mass exodus during a storm like this. You could tell from our interstate being backed up and, frankly, our roads were vacant of any traffic early on before the storm.' The county sent teams out at about 3 a.m. to check the streets. The main roadways were clear as of Thursday morning, despite some downed trees and power lines throughout the area, he said. Hoffman spoke with NewsNation before sunrise. Once daylight comes, crews will begin door-to-door outreach and search-and-rescue efforts, he said. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

The time for cleanup between Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton was limited. Officials moved fast to clear what they could, but it’s unclear how much damage may have been caused by the significant amount of debris that collected on nearby barrier islands, Hoffman said. 'Certainly, with Helene and with (Hurricane) Debby, the folks here on this coast are just very tired of hurricanes, for sure,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/hurricane-milton-florida-sarasota-county/	2024-10-10T06:20:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176987645.jpg?w=900
I'm fine': Tampa's 'Lt. Dan' survives Hurricane Milton on his bo...	TAMPA, Fla. (NewsNation) — A Tampa, Florida, man who goes by the nickname 'Lt. Dan' and who went viral on social media for refusing to evacuate his boat ahead of Hurricane Milton has survived the storm. NewsNation's Brian Entin went to check on him late Wednesday night after the storm had swept through. 'I'm fine,' he told Entin. Video: Wind tears roof off Tropicana Field, home of the Rays Lt. Dan, whose real name is Joseph Malinowski, went viral from videos posted by TikTok user Tampa Terrence, which gained a large following of people who were worried because he refused to evacuate the sailboat where he was living. Like the popular character from 'Forrest Gump' who refused to leave his boat during a massive storm, Tampa's Lt. Dan is missing a leg. 'I'm not going anywhere because the safest place to be is on a boat in a flood,' he said ahead of the storm. 'We learned that with Noah. Everyone who stayed on land drowned. Noah and the animals lived.'

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Days before the hurricane, Malinowski rejected offers of help from people and was even visited by Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw, who asked him to leave. However, the man continued to refuse to evacuate hours before Hurricane Milton was supposed to make landfall. 'You're all robots,' Malinowski said. 'You're all sheep, following the masses.' At a Wednesday midday press conference, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said Tampa police rescued 'Lt. Dan' and took him to a shelter that morning. However, he made it back to his boat by afternoon. 'He is here,' Entin said. 'He is definitely on the boat. We can see him. He keeps popping his head out, and I just saw his hand.' Milton barreled into the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday after plowing across Florida, pounding cities with ferocious winds and rain, and whipping up a barrage of tornadoes. It compounded the misery wrought by Helene while sparing Tampa a direct hit.

Video: Hurricane Milton sucks water out of Tampa Bay	(NewsNation) — Tampa Bay experienced a rare reverse storm surge as Hurricane Milton made landfall Wednesday evening, temporarily drawing water out of the bay and exposing parts of the bay floor that are typically submerged. Video taken by NewsNation's Brian Entin showed the seawater heavily receding by Bayshore Boulevard. 'All the water has run out of the bay,' Entin said. This phenomenon occurs when strong winds blow offshore, forcing water out of coastal bays, as explained by Peter Stempel, an associate professor in landscape architecture at Penn State, in a 2022 blog post. But, the effect is temporary. Video: Massive 28-foot wave captured inside Hurricane Milton The Florida Division of Emergency Management warned people not to walk on the exposed bay floor because the water would eventually rush back in, posing life-threatening risks. Due to how dark it was Wednesday night, it was not known how much the water receded. Milton made landfall as a powerful Category 3 storm near Siesta Key, Florida, at about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Meteorologists feared that if Milton had hit Pinellas County directly, it would bring a life-threatening storm surge of up to 12 feet to the area. However, storm surge warnings remained in effect for several parts of Florida Wednesday night, according to the National Weather Service.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/video-hurricane-milton-sucks-water-out-of-tampa-bay/	2024-10-10T00:46:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/bay.jpg?w=900
Video: Wind tears roof off Tropicana Field, home of the Rays	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) — Hurricane Milton made landfall in Siesta Key, south of St. Petersburg late Wednesday, and while the city avoided some of the worst storm surges, the local Major League ballpark took some damage. City officials confirmed high wind gusts from Hurricane Milton tore multiple panels off the roof of Tropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Rays.The field was not in use as a storm shelter but functioned as a staging area for storm response crews, according to the Associated Press. It was not clear Wednesday night how much damage the interior of the building had suffered. The stadium opened in 1990 and initially cost $138 million. It was due to be replaced in time for the 2026 season with a $1.3 billion ballpark, according to AP. Additionally, the city confirmed a crane collapsed onto an office building near Central Avenue. No injuries have been reported due to either incident, according to city officials as of midnight. Officials urged the public to stay sheltered in place overnight and avoid both areas until further notice. According to WFLA Chief Meteorologist Jeff Berardelli, St. Pete saw peak wind gusts of 91 MPH, among the highest in the Tampa Bay area after Milton made landfall. Other areas seeing peak wind gusts include Sarasota Bradenton International Airport (102 MPH), Egmont Channel (105 MPH), and Clearwater Beach (90 MPH), according to Berardelli.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/video-wind-tears-roof-off-tropicana-field-home-of-the-rays/	2024-10-10T00:36:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/hailey_img_2024-10-09_11-24-44.jpeg?w=589
Live Updates: Milton pummels Florida as Cat 1 Hurricane	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Milton has brought vast amounts of flooding, damage and debris to much of the Florida peninsula Thursday morning after it made landfall as a Category 3 Hurricane Wednesday evening. As of 11 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said a 'large area of life-threatening storm surge' was occurring along portions of the West-Central coast of the state and that heavy rainfall throughout Thursday would continue to bring the risk of 'catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding.' A couple hours later, Milton was downgraded to a Category 1 Hurricane as it continued to slam its way across the state.

Hurricanes’ potentially deadly legacy: Flesh-eating bacteria	(NewsNation) — The water that Hurricane Milton leaves behind may be just as deadly as the winds and storm surge, according to infectious disease experts. Flesh-eating bacteria is out there and looking for a way into your body. 'Within the waters, we find this vibrio ... it’s actually a bacteria. And bacteria can be ingested in the water,' said Dr. Norman Beatty, with the infectious diseases division at the University of Florida. 'Most of the time, what we see after a hurricane is we have volunteers or homeowners are out, and they are cleaning up the mess. They’re out in the storm surge waters. And that vibrio bacteria is penetrating through the skin. You step on a nail, slice your leg, you get an open wound and the bacteria gets in,' Beatty said. Hurricane Milton could cause $175B in damage Beatty told NewsNation’s 'Banfield' that flesh-eating bacteria took quite a toll two years ago after Hurricane Ian. 'There were 38 confirmed cases right after the storm, and at least 11 people died,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/hurricanes-legacy-flesh-eating-bacteria/	2024-10-09T21:48:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2174887918.jpg?w=900
Post-Milton gas in Florida will be a challenge: GasBuddy founder	(NewsNation) — A lot of gas stations in western Florida have run out of gas and getting them restocked once Hurricane Milton passes won’t happen overnight, said an expert who tracks gasoline prices nationwide. 'Almost a quarter of gas stations in Florida don’t have gasoline,' said Patrick De Haan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at the gasoline analysis site GasBuddy. 'In Tampa … 63% of stations don’t have gasoline right now,' he told NewsNation’s 'CUOMO.' Once the storm passes, De Haan said it could be a few days, or it could be two or three weeks, before every gas station in western Florida can fill up. ‘Multiple fatalities’ at senior community after tornado outbreak in Florida: reports 'It’s not like these outages are going to just magically going to solve themselves. There are still a lot of complications from this storm.' He said that those complications involve the main gasoline gateway for most of the Gulf side of Florida, he said. 'A lot of it’s going to be contingent on the Port of Tampa and Port Manatee. Potentially, there could be damage. The Coast Guard’s going to have to do assessments to see if those ports can accept shipments of barges from Texas and Louisiana refineries,' said De Haan. Hurricane Milton could cause $175B in damage He added that, in the rest of the U.S., gas prices are beginning to stabilize following four years of downs and ups, starting with demand plunging during the COVID pandemic then surging in the first months of the Russia-Ukraine war. 'Now, a couple of years into this, we’ve seen a little bit of normalization happening. The U.S. is still producing a record level of crude oil. The U.S. is still the world’s largest energy producer, and that’s part of the reason why gas prices have gotten closer to what many Americans consider normal,' said De Haan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/post-milton-florida-gas-challenge-gasbuddy-founder/	2024-10-09T21:22:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176921951.jpg?w=900
Multiple fatalities' at senior community after tornado outbreak ...	Related video: St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office facility damaged by tornado FORT PIERCE, Fla. (WFLA) — Multiple people were killed at a senior community as Hurricane Milton spawned tornadoes in Florida, according to local reports. The fatalities occurred at the Spanish Lakes Country Club in Fort Pierce, the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office confirmed to NBC affiliate WPTV and ABC affiliate WPBF. However, it's unclear how many people were killed. Dozens of agencies, including the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, responded to the community where dozens of homes are being searched as search and rescue operations are currently underway. Flash flood warnings issued for coastal areas in Milton’s path 'We have dozens of homes in St. Lucie County that have been damaged, some catastrophic damage,' St. Lucie County spokesman Erick Gill told WPTV. 'We are working with the St. Lucie County Fire District ... National Guard, as well as units from the sheriff's office and even first responders from surrounding counties to help with search and rescue.' Gill said the goal is to help survivors and do damage assessment. TikToker ‘Lieutenant Dan’ says he’s riding out Milton on his boat 'We have three shelters that were already open, but we're looking at converting another school to a fourth shelter to take care of those who may have been displaced by the tornadoes that ripped through our area this afternoon,' Gill said. Gov. Ron DeSantis said there have been 116 tornado warnings with 19 confirmed touch downs. Kevin Guthrie, the director of Florida's Division of Emergency Management, said about 125 homes were destroyed statewide, mostly mobile homes in senior communities. Hurricane Milton made landfall in Siesta Key as a Category 3 storm around 8:30 p.m. Wednesday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/multiple-fatalities-at-senior-community-after-tornado-outbreak-in-florida-reports/	2024-10-09T20:27:45-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1889004791-e1709502647468_d84f8c.jpg?w=800
Hurricane Milton could cause $175B in damage	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Milton could result in losses of up to $100 billion for the global insurance industry, creating a surge in 2025 reinsurance prices that could boost some insurance companies' shares, analysts said on Wednesday. The hurricane is expected to make landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida late on Wednesday or early Thursday. It is potentially one of the most destructive to hit the region, which is recovering from Hurricane Helene less than two weeks ago. Analysts at Jefferies estimated a mid-double-digit billion-dollar insured loss would follow a major hurricane impact in one of Florida's most heavily populated regions. ‘Not so confident in my decision’: Tampa woman to ride out Milton 'A 1-in-100-year event is estimated by some to result in $175 billion in losses for landfall in the Tampa region and $70 billion in losses in the Fort Myers region,' they wrote in a note, outlining an extreme scenario. Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody's Analytics, told NewsNation that Milton could cause damage similar to that of Hurricane Katrina. 'Just for context, do you remember Hurricane Katrina, that was the 2005 Category 5 that hit Louisiana? That cost $160 billion in today's dollars, and that includes the property damage — both insured and uninsured.' Zandi said that the federal government will ultimately step in and help those impacted by the storm. 'The insured loss is ultimately covered by the federal government,' he said. 'So the federal government has been coming in and making everyone whole — ultimately whole. I mean, obviously, what the damage this creates is enormous to people, but the economic damage is made whole by the federal government.'

Milton has a ‘really bad feel to it,’ says Florida man riding out...	PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla., (NewsNation) — A Pinellas County man tells NewsNation that while he’s lived in Florida for many years, Hurricane Milton has a particularly ominous feeling about it. 'We're starting to get some of the outer bands,' said Harry Berg, a local resident and uncle of NewsNation meteorologist Max Tsaparis. 'This storm has got a really bad feel to it — and I've been here for many years.' Berg said his decision not to evacuate the area doesn’t mean he isn’t taking the storm seriously. But it’s part of 'being a Floridian.' Floridians told to shelter in place as Milton approaches 'You have to prepare for this. What we're getting ready to face is something that we've never seen before, the likes of this … to make a long story short, you just have to make sure you're repaired.' Berg said his primary concern at the moment is wind. He added that if conditions become too dangerous by Wednesday afternoon they will 'seek shelter.' 'We have hurricane-proof windows, we’re boarded up correctly, we have enough rations, we have generators, we have everything,' he said. The National Hurricane Center has predicted Milton will likely weaken, but remain a major hurricane when it makes landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/pinellas-county-man-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-09T13:44:53-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176991288.jpg?w=724
‘Not so confident in my decision’: Tampa woman to ride out Milton	TAMPA, Fla. (NewsNation) — Morgan Roos, a Tampa resident who has decided not to evacuate the area ahead of Hurricane Milton, tells NewsNation she is having second thoughts about staying. Roos, who has 650,000 followers on TikTok and nearly 10,000 on Instagram, said she’s only recently moved to the area from Colorado. 'I am directly on the riverfront,' Roos told NewsNation. 'I am standing in front of my windows right now, and I would say, maybe 200 feet away is the Hillsborough River. I was here during Helene. I decided to wait that one out, and I watched the water rise, but it only came up on the Riverwalk. And now I am not feeling so confident in my decision.' ‘You are going to die’: Tampa mayor warns against ignoring Milton evacuation orders Roos said she’s not currently looking for a shelter for a variety of reasons. 'Truthfully, no,' she said. 'And the reason I say no is because I've got two dogs with me; got my mom here. The only sense of community I have here in Florida are people who live in my building, and they're all hunkering in together. So we're going to pull resources and go that way.' Roos said while she believes the city is prepared and that Gov. Ron DeSantis has been doing a 'great job,' she’s concerned about how the community will fare following back-to-back crises with Helene and Milton. 'The thing that scares me the most is just the fact that Helene hit two weeks ago,' she said. 'When I've been driving like, up and down the residential neighborhoods, there's debris stacked like eight feet high. I know that the governor has been doing a great job ... but it does scare me.' Hurricane Milton: Where will zoo animals go? Despite not being a native Floridian, Roos thinks she’s as prepared as can be expected. 'I think I really, really, really underestimated this,' she said. 'But I have four cases of water. My neighbors told me they have a bunch of flashlights. I have food, I've got a propane tank. I did everything that the internet told me to do. I just didn't get a flashlight in time.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/morgan-roos-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-09T11:56:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/snapshot-5.jpg?w=900

Milton evacuations spark traffic jams, fuel shortages	MIAMI (NewsNation) — As hundreds of thousands of Floridians flee the Gulf Coast, some are finding themselves in traffic backups and gas stations with empty fuel pumps. It’s estimated that nearly 25% of the state’s gas stations are out of fuel ahead of Hurricane Milton. Some of Florida's major highways, including Interstate 75 and Interstate Four have been seeing major backups and delays on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Florida Department of Transportation, in some instances, has opened up shoulder lanes of some of those major highways to try and speed up evacuations. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has assured people that his administration is working to bring emergency supplies into the state, with some fuel trucks even being escorted by law enforcement. The time to evacuate and get that fuel to people who need it is running out. LOOK: Tornado crosses Florida interstate as Hurricane Milton churns closer 'It's been, I would say, a tremendous task to get gas,' said Ralph Douglas, a resident of Ruskin, Florida. 'Because right now, if you drive from different areas, like during the course of the day, it was difficult because when you drive by, people don't have any gas.' Some hotels across the state are also filling up with evacuees. Booking.com says 98% of the hotels in Tallahassee are booked through next Wednesday. The mayor of Jacksonville said hotels in their downtown are full. Those who have been able to find a room say they were especially concerned about a life-threatening storm surge, the expected widespread power outages, and of course, this back-to-back hit from hurricanes.

Speaker Johnson to discuss Helene damage in North Carolina	(NewsNation) —Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is in Western North Carolina touring the damage done by Hurricane Helene. Johnson is expected to criticize the federal response to the disaster when he speaks in the Biltmore Village neighborhood of Asheville, one of the hardest-hit areas of the city. Helene weakened to a tropical storm as it moved through the Southeast, but heavy rains and winds downed trees and brought massive flooding to towns in the Blue Ridge mountains. When will Hurricane Milton hit Florida? Many in the area remain without power or water more than a week after the storm, with smaller communities cut off thanks to damaged or washed-out roads. The damage to the region is extensive, with homes and businesses demolished and entire towns like Chimney Rock and Hot Springs virtually destroyed. Areas along the French Broad and Swannanoa rivers fared the worst, including the historic Biltmore Village, a popular tourist area located near the Biltmore Estate, which remains closed to visitors. Residents Jacqueline Twohig and Doug Frieders saw the river rising and got out just in time. Their neighbors were not so fortunate, and videos showed their condo floating down the flooded river. 'All of your memories, your whole life, everything you’ve built, just crashing in the blink of an eye,' Twohig said. 'Thinking, we could have been in there, like if I didn’t get up because I was feeling hot and going to turn on the fan, we could have been in there until it was too late. Just like the others were.' As Hurricane Milton heads toward the U.S., the coast is gearing up for another devastating storm, impacting recovery efforts for an area where people are still reeling from Helene. Volunteer groups have organized relief efforts, including the self-described 'Redneck Air Force' made up of volunteers who are mostly former military. Sheriff condemns ‘sightseers’ visiting Helene flood-torn areas Many of them were in special operations and are now using helicopters to deliver aid to people in need in remote areas. Some in the group have said they haven't seen enough federal help on the ground. Local officials and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have pushed back on what they have called misleading claims about the response to Helene, saying there are hundreds of people on the ground and millions of assistance already approved. Former Green Beret Adam Smith leads a team of hundreds and fears the Appalachian region will be forgotten after Milton hits. 'All the news interest is going to go to Florida and it’s going to disappear from this location,' he said. 'As soon as that happens, the people of Western North Carolina are going to be standing here holding the bag because we haven’t had federal assistance, because we haven’t had federal funding, because that money’s not moving.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/johnson-speak-helene-nc/	2024-10-09T10:36:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2174585773.jpg?w=900
Honda recalls about 1.7 million vehicles over steering issue	(WJET/WFXP) – Honda is recalling nearly 1.7 million vehicles in the U.S. over a steering issue that could result in a crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Wednesday. The automobile company found that the assembly of the steering gearbox — which contains gears that help turn the vehicle's tires — may have been manufactured improperly, which could lead to excessive friction and difficulty steering. Warning signs include an unusual noise and/or a momentary 'sticky' feeling when turning the steering wheel while driving. Over 129K newer Ram trucks recalled over faulty turn signals The affected vehicles include: 2023-2025 Acura Integra 2024-2025 Acura Integra Type S 2022-2025 Honda Civic and Honda Civic Hatchback 2025 Honda Civic Hatchback Hybrid 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid 2023-2025 Honda Civic Type-R 2023-2025 CR-V 2025 Honda CR-V Fuel Cell EV 2023-2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid 2023-2025 Honda HR-V If your vehicle is affected by the recall, an authorized Honda dealer will replace the worm gear spring free of charge, and either 'redistribute or add grease' as needed. Owners will also receive a mailed notification expected to be sent out on Nov. 18. To check if your car is affected by the recall, you can search the NHTSA website using your VIN or the year, make and model of your vehicle.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/recalls/honda-recall/	2024-10-09T08:53:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6620396287ef70.43116672-e1728474222395.jpeg?w=800

(WFLA) — As Florida's Gulf Coast braces for the impacts of Hurricane Milton Wednesday, the storm is causing severe weather across the state, even in Miami. The National Weather Service Miami shared photos of a tornado crossing Interstate 75 Wednesday as cars were still driving on the highway. 'TORNADO crossing I-75 as we speak! Seek shelter NOW!' the agency wrote on social media. Credit: NWS Miami Credit: NWS Miami Miami and much of South Florida are not in the direct line of Hurricane Milton but could still face severe weather, like Wednesday's tornado. Parts of the Tampa Bay area, which is in Milton's path, are under tornado watches until Wednesday night. Time to evacuate running out as Milton nears Florida Hurricane Milton is set to make landfall somewhere along the Florida Gulf Coast as a 'dangerous major hurricane' around 2 a.m. Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said. As of Wednesday morning, the Category 4 hurricane is currently moving toward the northeast at 16 mph with winds of 155 mph.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/tornado-florida-interstate-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-09T08:46:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/tornado-NWS-e1728487771734.jpg?w=800
Sheriff condemns 'sightseers' visiting Helene flood-torn areas	UNICOI, Tenn. (WJHL) — Unicoi County Sheriff Mike Hensley told NewsNation affiliate WJHL this week that visitors coming to the flood-torn county in Tennessee to sightsee have complicated recovery efforts and are beginning to endanger workers and themselves. 'I know everybody wants to look and I understand that,' he said. 'But we're doing work. We're still in the recovery process. We've got power lines down, gas lines, fiber optic cable. We got a multitude of utilities working.' Hensley said he was near Yancey County, North Carolina Tuesday morning, where he had to escort people to the state line who were not from the area and looking around to 'see what they could pick up.'

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'They had some people up there [Yancey Co.] that wasn't from there. They [were] not related to anyone over there, more or less just looking around to see what they could pick up, and there was no criminal charges placed, but they did escort them to the state line.' Sheriff Hensley said he and his deputies are going to speak with people they see out and ask them to state their business to try to control the overwhelming amount of people entering the county for non-essential reasons. 'We're going to talk to these folks and see if they have relatives here in Unicoi County. If they have no business here, we're going to escort them on their way. We're not going to put up with looting and stealing of these flood victims, not for one second.' Hensley said one reason his office is trying to remove sightseers is because many different types of crews are hard at work restoring utilities and providing emergency services. He said many wires, poles, debris and more potentially dangerous items are still scattered around the flood area. 'If they don't have no business in these areas, not related, not help and not with any organization, they need to leave. And that's what I stand on up here.' Another reason is that it's causing unnecessary traffic, backing up already-narrowed roadways that are locals' only option right now.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/mid-south/helene-flooding-sheriff-condemns-sightseers-tennessee/	2024-10-09T08:34:33-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-08-164619.png?w=900
Cruz leading Allred by 3 points in Texas Senate race: poll	Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, holds a 3-point lead over his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, according to a new poll. The Florida Atlantic University (FAU) survey, conducted by Mainstreet Research, shows that among registered voters in the state, Cruz garners 46% support compared to Allred's 43%. About 11% of respondents also said they were undecided. When asked which candidate respondents would vote for if the election were held today, the incumbent maintained his 3-point lead over Allred, 47% to 44%, the data shows. The number of undecided voters dipped, however, to 9%. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } The numbers were released after Allred's team announced Tuesday that he has raised more than $30 million over the past three months in his battle against Cruz, reflecting broad desire among Democratic donors to defeat one of the Senate’s most prominent conservatives. The Texas Republican raked in $21 million in the same time period, according to his campaign. It also comes less than a week before the two take to the debate stage. In The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's aggregate of polls, Cruz has a 2.8-point edge on Allred, bringing in 47.9% support to the Democratic hopeful's 45.1%. The FAU poll was conducted from Oct. 2 to Oct. 6 among 811 registered voters in the Lone Star State. The margin of error is 3.4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ted-cruz-colin-allred-texas-senate-race/	2024-10-09T08:11:54-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Ted-Cruz-Colin-Allred-10.09.png?w=900
Hurricane Milton: Where will zoo animals go?	(NewsNation) — Florida residents aren’t the only ones bracing for Hurricane Milton — penguins, flamingos, rhinos and other Zoo animals across the must also find shelter to weather the storm. Ron Magill, director of communications for Zoo Miami, joined 'Morning in America' on Wednesday to explain how those decisions are made and which animals, if any, zoo staff may evacuate. Milton’s intensity has gone back and forth throughout the week. It’s expected to make landfall either Wednesday night or Thursday morning as a Category 5 hurricane, according to National Hurricane Center forecasts. When will Hurricane Milton hit Florida? 'I’m deeply worried,' Magill said. 'When you talk about Tampa Zoo, the Florida aquarium — these are places that are so exposed right now to this monstrous storm. Having lived through Andrew and Wilma here in Miami when we were devastated by those storms, I can only just imagine what’s going to happen up there.'

The storm’s high winds and surging water could put smaller animals who are usually in outdoor settings at the greatest risk. Aquariums also face potential challenges. The hurricane could disable tank filtration systems, which Magill called the 'life-support' for fish and other aquatic animals. 'A misconception people have about zoos and aquariums is that we evacuate animals (and) that we send them to another location,' Magill said. 'That rarely — if ever — happens. What we do in zoos and aquariums is we take the more susceptible animals like birds and smaller mammals and we will take them and put them in small sky kennels, like what you transport them in on an airplane, and then put those kennels in fortified buildings within the zoo property.' 'When you move animals, the stress you put on them sometimes is more dangerous than the storm itself,' Magill said. Live: Final preparations underway as Milton nears landfall The animals won’t be left alone. All accredited zoos have a team that stays on the grounds 24/7, Magill said. Some attractions like Zoo Miami also have what’s called a lethal response team — a group that, armed with rifles, would sweep the park after the storm to make sure every animal is where it should be, Magill said. 'The No. 1 priority is safety for the public by ensuring that these animals are still secure and then afterwards, clearing a way to get to them to take care of them,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/hurricane-milton-where-zoo-animals-go/	2024-10-09T08:00:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2021/11/4535f8b9858e41fc90a7814df93853ce.jpg?w=900
Helene spurs IV fluid shortage. Milton could make it worse	(The Hill) -- Hospitals across the U.S. are feeling the impact of Hurricane Helene as experts warn of an imminent intravenous (IV) solution shortage due to the temporary shutdown of a facility in North Carolina. And Hurricane Milton’s approach could worsen the problem, with another key IV fluid manufacturing facility located along its potential path in Florida. Baxter International’s IV fluid manufacturing facility in Marion, North Carolina, supplied roughly 60 percent of the IV solution used by hospitals in the U.S. every day until Helene temporarily halted operations. Final preparations underway as Milton nears landfall While what remained at Baxter’s facility has begun to be shipped out, production may not restart for another week or two. The company says its global plants are ramping up production in response. Just a week after Helene dissipated, hospitals say they’re already beginning to feel the strain of Baxter’s temporary halt in production. Nancy Foster, vice president for quality and patient safety policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA), told The Hill that hospitals nationwide that rely on Baxter have been told to expect 40 percent of their normal shipments of IV solution. 'And that's all that will be available to them until the situation begins to improve,' she said. According to Foster, this means that hospitals will have to think conservatively in terms of how they use IV fluids, prioritizing certain patients who 'absolutely need' those solutions and utilizing alternative methods for others. She noted 17 different products were manufactured at the North Carolina plant, mostly different types of saline but also products like ringer’s lactate, which support patients’ bodily function. The AHA has called on the Biden administration to declare a shortage of IV solutions, both so that hospitals can prepare IV solutions in their own pharmacies and to signal to health care providers that they must conserve their supply. Concerns are culminating just as Milton is set to make landfall in Florida this week. B. Braun, another top IV solution manufacturer in the U.S., has a facility in Daytona Beach, Florida. Both federal officials and the company are well aware that the plant is within Milton’s expected path. A spokesperson for the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) said it is coordinating with B. Braun 'to move their product out of the path of the storm and facilitate other activities that will mitigate potential impacts on future distribution.' B. Braun’s Daytona Beach facility was not affected by Hurricane Helene. It is closing its Florida manufacturing plant and distribution center Wednesday morning in anticipation of Milton, with plans to resume operations on Friday, Oct. 11. Alli Longenhagen, director of corporate communications at B. Braun, confirmed her company is working with ASPR to transfer its Florida inventory to a 'secure, temperature-controlled facility, north of Florida.' 'Once the storm passes, the product will return to the distribution center,' said Longenhagen. 'The Daytona Beach facility is a key part of our plan to help address the shutdown of Baxter’s IV solutions manufacturing facility in North Carolina,' Longenhagen added. 'In partnership with ASPR, we are taking immediate steps to increase production of critical IV fluids at our plant in Irvine, CA, and will resume this plan at Daytona Beach following Hurricane Milton’s departure.' Report names ‘Immaculate Constellation’ UAP program: Journalist Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., has called on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to further strengthen supply chains to prevent an IV fluid shortage. 'Natural disasters often have effects beyond the horrific destruction and loss of life throughout the southeastern part of our country,' Dingell said in a letter to HHS. 'This supply chain disruption is a grave reminder of the interconnection of our government and society — maintaining communication and cooperating through these adversities is the best solution to care for our communities.' According to a senior Biden administration official, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering potential options to address the issue, including temporary imports and expedited reviews. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) said in a statement Tuesday that it backed the plan for expedited importation from foreign plants. The ASHP had a meeting with the FDA and the White House to discuss the looming issue in which the organization said it called for 'temporary flexibility' on FDA requirements like inspections, limits on compounding and an extension on expiration dates for IV fluids and peritoneal dialysis solutions. In cases of IV solution shortage, hospitals have contingency plans in place, but Foster noted that the traditional course of action is usually to ask other hospitals to share their supplies. This plan doesn’t work when the supplier is out of commission. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'It's this taking out of the source that’s created the real challenge for hospitals and others regarding the use of these IV solutions right now,' said Foster. Another measure being considered to mitigate a shortage is to have other manufacturers ramp up production. ICU Medical, a major IV solutions manufacturer, said it was unaffected by Helene and continues to operate as normal. 'We are continuing to collaborate with government agencies while actively monitoring potential increases in demand for IV solutions and have already taken necessary steps to increase production to help meet market needs while continuing to support our existing customers,' it said in an emailed statement. The incoming respiratory viral season adds an additional layer of pressure on hospitals. Hospitalizations go up as flu, RSV and COVID spread, and ensuring that hospitalized patients remain sufficiently hydrated is a key part of treatment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/hurricane-iv-fluid-shortage-milton-helene/	2024-10-09T07:02:54-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/IV_drip_AP-e1728479561815.jpg?w=800
Final preparations underway as Milton nears landfall	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Milton was reclassified a Category 4 storm Wednesday morning but remained two miles per hour of wind gust away from Category 5 status. Millions along the coast remain under evacuation orders, packing roads, draining gas stations and getting out of town before Milton's anticipated landfall Wednesday night. Milton threatens to deliver storm surges up to 15 feet on the Gulf Coast, catastrophic flooding and destructive winds. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has urged Florida residents in danger zones to leave ahead of Hurricane Milton’s arrival, especially since the National Hurricane Center said it could be one of the most destructive storms to ever hit the area. How Waffle House helps Southerners judge a storm's severity President Joe Biden on Tuesday noted the rapid intensification of the storm earlier this week when it went from a Category 1 to a Category 5 in a day. It was downgraded to a Category 4 early Tuesday before ramping back up to a Category 5 later in the afternoon. It is expected to be powerful when it makes landfall in Florida near the Tampa Bay area. 'Get out now while you can,' National Hurricane Center Director Dr. Michael Brennan said in a live update streamed by the organization. Brennan emphasized that you need to only travel tens of miles rather than hundreds to find safety, and that attempting to evacuate too late has led to deaths in previous hurricanes. The latest National Hurricane Center forecast has the storm crossing over the entire state of Florida and entering the Atlantic Ocean by Thursday evening. Tracking Hurricane Milton The hurricane was about 300 miles southwest of Tampa as of 7:30 a.m. ET Wednesday moving at 14 mph. With Milton, forecasters warned of a possible 10- to 15-foot storm surge in Tampa Bay. It is the highest surge ever predicted for that location and has led to evacuation orders for communities all along the coast. Communities hit hard by Hurricane Helene less than two weeks ago have been working day and night to remove the debris from their homes before Milton makes landfall with the potential to turn wrecked furniture into projectiles. 'I went through Katrina, and that was mainly winds that destroyed everything. And everything's a projectile out here right now because everybody's house is in the front yard, and so all of this is going to be pretty much missiles coming through if it's the amount of wind that's going through with this hurricane coming in,' New Port Richey resident Scott Pepperman said. Milton remains on track to be the worst storm to hit the Tampa Bay area in over a century, the National Weather Service in Tampa Bay said. The region has become home to more than 3 million people and is one of the most vulnerable metropolitan areas in the U.S. to storm surge. New Zillow feature: Climate risk data added to home listings DeSantis has warned Floridians that the hurricane could 'wobble,' meaning it could hit at any point whether it is north of Tampa, Tampa, or south of Tampa. 'Wherever it makes landfall, there’s going to be impacts far beyond what the cone actually shows,' DeSantis said. It reached an incredibly low pressure Tuesday night, which generally correlates with a storm’s strength. The lower a system’s pressure, the stronger the hurricane. Scientists expect the system to weaken slightly before landfall, though it could retain hurricane strength as it churns across central Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. That would largely spare other states ravaged by Helene, which killed at least 230 people on its path from Florida to the Appalachian Mountains. Why should you fill your bathtub before a hurricane?

Israeli offensive in hard-hit northern Gaza kills dozens and thre...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A large-scale Israeli operation in northern Gaza has killed and wounded dozens of people and threatens to shut down three hospitals over a year into the war with Hamas, Palestinian officials and residents said Wednesday. Heavy fighting is underway in Jabaliya, where Israeli forces have carried out several major operations over the course of the war and then returned as militants regroup. The entire north, including Gaza City, has suffered heavy destruction and has been largely isolated by Israeli forces since late last year. The continuing cycle of destruction and death in Gaza, unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, comes as Israel expands a weeklong ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon and considers a major retaliatory strike on Iran. Residents of Jabaliya, a refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, said thousands of people have been trapped in their homes since the operation began Sunday, as Israeli jets and drones buzz overhead and troops battle militants in the streets. 'It’s like hell. We can’t get out,' said Mohamed Awda, who lives with his parents and six siblings. He said there were three bodies in the street outside his home that could not be retrieved because of the fighting. 'The quadcopters are everywhere, and they fire at anyone. You can’t even open the window,' he told The Associated Press by phone, speaking over the sound of explosions. Dozens have been killed and survivors fear displacement Gaza's Health Ministry said it recovered 40 bodies from Jabaliya from Sunday until Tuesday, and another 14 from communities farther north. There are likely more bodies under rubble and in areas that can't be accessed, it said. An airstrike in Jabaliya early Wednesday killed at least nine people, including two women and two children, according to Al-Ahly Hospital, which received the bodies. Strikes in central Gaza killed another nine people, including three children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Residents of Jabaliya fear Israel’s aim is to depopulate the north and turn it into a closed military zone or a Jewish settlement. Israel has blocked all roads except for the main highway leading from Jabaliya to the south, according to residents. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said it was evacuating seven schools that were being used as shelters and that only two of eight water wells in the camp are still functioning. 'We are concerned about the displacement to the south,' Ahmed Qamar, who lives in Jabaliya with his wife, children and parents, said in a text message. 'People here say clearly that they will die here in northern Gaza and and won’t go to southern Gaza.' Hospitals are under threat Fadel Naeem, the director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said it had received dozens of wounded people and bodies from the north. 'We declared a state of emergency, suspended scheduled surgeries, and discharged patients whose conditions are stable,' told AP in a text message. Israel’s offensive has gutted Gaza’s health sector, forcing most of its hospitals to shut down and leaving the rest only partially functioning. Naeem said three hospitals farther north — Kamal Adwan, Awda and the Indonesian Hospital - have become almost inaccessible because of the fighting. The Gaza Health Ministry says the Israeli army has ordered all three to evacuate staff and patients. Meanwhile, no humanitarian aid has entered the north since Oct. 1, according to U.N. data. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the hospitals or the apparent suspension of aid delivery in the north. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, said late Tuesday that Israeli forces were operating in Jabaliya to 'prevent Hamas' regrouping efforts' and had killed around 100 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it fights in residential areas. Israel ordered the wholesale evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, in the opening weeks of the war, but hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have remained there. Israel reiterated those instructions over the weekend, telling people to flee south to an expanded humanitarian zone where hundreds of thousands are already crammed into squalid tent camps. The war began just over a year ago, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. They are still holding around 100 hostages, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. It has said women and children make up over half of the dead. The offensive has also caused staggering destruction across the territory and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Israel warns Lebanon that it could end up like Gaza Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until 'total victory' over Hamas and the return of all the captives. On Tuesday, he warned that Lebanon would meet the same fate as Gaza if its people did not rise up against Hezbollah, which began firing rockets into Israel after the initial Hamas attack. That set in motion a cycle of escalation that ignited a full-scale war last month. 'You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza,' Netanyahu said, addressing the Lebanese people. An Israeli strike killed four people and wounded another 10 at a hotel sheltering displaced people in the southern Lebanese town of Wardaniyeh on Wednesday, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. An Associated Press reporter in a nearby town heard two sonic booms from Israeli jets before the strike. Plumes of smoke rose from the building after the explosion. In recent weeks Israel has waged a heavy air campaign across large parts of Lebanon, targeting what it says are Hezbollah rocket launchers and other militant sites. A series of strikes killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. So far, ground operations appear to be focused on a narrow strip along the border, but Israel has warned people to evacuate dozens of cities and towns, many of them north of a buffer zone declared by the United Nations after the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Hezbollah's acting leader, Sheikh Naim Kassem, said in a televised statement Tuesday that the group has replaced its slain commanders and was preventing Israeli ground forces from advancing. The militants have extended their rocket fire deeper into Israel, disrupting life but causing few casualties. The Israeli military said Wednesday that Hezbollah has fired more than 12,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel since the start of the hostilities last year. Israel is meanwhile considering options for a strike on Iran that could potentially escalate the war on yet another front. Iran, which supports Hezbollah and Hamas, launched a wave of some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for the killing of top militants from both groups. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

WATCH: Las Vegas bids farewell to the Tropicana with a spectacula...	LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — The seconds ticked away early Wednesday morning until the husk of the Tropicana Las Vegas resort, deserted since its April 2024 closing date, would meet a final and spectacular end, bringing to a close the era of the 67-year-old structure once a bastion for visitors from across the country. The Las Vegas classic was set to come down in style with a seven-minute celebration involving 550 drones and 150 'pyrodrones' counting down to the controlled demolition of the resort originally erected in 1957. Phil Grucci, CEO and president of Fireworks by Grucci, previewed the celebration ahead of the demolition, revealing that the show will feature images of the Tropicana logo, the iconic 'Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas' sign, and a tribute to the Athletics franchise, whose proposed $1.5 billion, 33,000-seat ballpark could open in the footprint of the former Tropicana in time for the 2028 season.

In July, Bally's, the company that controlled most of the site, entered into a merger agreement with its top stockholder, Standard General. A total of 917,400 square feet will be imploded with the use of nearly 2,200 pounds of explosives. The demolition sequence will begin with the implosion of the 23-story Paradise Tower and end with the implosion of the 23-story Club Tower. It’s expected both buildings will collapse within 22 seconds after the implosion button is pressed, according to the Bally’s Corporation news release. Tropicana Las Vegas opened in 1957.

Report names 'Immaculate Constellation' UAP program: Journalist	(NewsNation) — A leaked whistleblower report says the Pentagon is operating a secret UFO retrieval program called 'Immaculate Constellation,' according to independent journalist Michael Shellenberger. The report revealed for the first time the name of an alleged UAP program, stating that the executive branch has been managing UAP issues without congressional knowledge or oversight, possibly for decades. Shellenberger told NewsNation's Ross Coulthart he has been in touch with the whistleblower, whose exact role and other identifying details, including gender, he has withheld because they fear what could happen if they were publicly known. Earth’s temporary 2nd moon has arrived: What you need to know 'I don't think that they're faking it or that they're lying about their fear,' he said. 'This person discovered this material accidentally. This was not something they had expected to encounter.' That fear is why Shellenberger said the whistleblower did not share intelligence imagery showing UAPs. The unnamed whistleblower said the Department of Defense created 'Immaculate Constellation' in 2017 after a New York Times report revealed another program known as the Advance Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). The whistleblower report cites evidence, including allegations about UAP sightings collected by the Pentagon and intelligence documenting firsthand encounters with UAPs or UFOs that are kept in a database used by the intelligence community. The report is also said to describe various UAPs in detail, including one where orbs surrounded an F-22 and forced it out of its patrol area and one where the crew of a Navy aircraft saw an orange-red sphere descend from a high altitude, after which they described a sense of unease and feeling as if they'd snapped out of a trance. Pentagon historically denies reports of UAP programs The Pentagon has long denied claims that there is any evidence to indicate any nonhuman, alien or extraterrestrial intelligence has visited Earth. In a May report, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) said reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) are the result of mistaken identification of drones, top-secret projects or other known aerial objects. AARO said longstanding claims that the Pentagon is secretly studying UAPs are a result of 'circular reporting' from a group of people who believe the rumor to be true despite a lack of evidence. Could a drug used in organ transplants slow aging? Rumors about the government and unidentified objects have existed since the end of World War II and the famed Roswell incident of 1947. Believers pointed to errors in the report and cast doubt on the validity of the claims. Skeptics, on the other hand, have said persistent rumors about government UFO programs are a result of government disinformation and social contagion like the 'Satanic Panic' of the 1980s. 'This new whistleblower is not part of that circular reporting,' Shellenberger said. 'I am confident of that. This person did not know the other individuals who verified the name of this program. It does not fit the theory of social contagion.' Those who have suggested we need to look more closely at UAPs include high-ranking officials like former Assistant Secretary of Defense Christopher Mellon and former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, even if they stop short of saying UAPs are alien in nature. Recent UAP reports In 2023, former Air Force officer David Grusch reignited interest in UAPs by claiming a secret UAP retrieval program was being operated by the Pentagon without the public or Congress being aware. His statements sparked a congressional hearing on the subject and a bipartisan UAP Caucus formed in the House of Representatives, with lawmakers seeking to understand what programs exist and how the Pentagon would be funding alleged UAP efforts. How can I protect my social security number from hackers and scams? Others have since come forward with their own stories, including former military intelligence officer Luis Elizondo and retired Army Col. Karl Nell. Lawmakers from both parties have come forward to press the Defense Department for more transparency and have said the earlier hearing was not the last the public can expect to see on UAPs. 'No justification has been given for this level of secrecy,' Shellenberger said, noting that efforts to discredit those who have come forward to speak about UAPs have ruined people's lives. He also recommended whistleblowers approach journalists or congressional staffers, saying that protections for whistleblowers who go to AARO or the inspector generals for defense or intelligence are not adequate.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/report-immaculate-constellation-uap-journalist/	2024-10-08T11:51:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/AARO-UAPS-sighting-Nexstar-4212023.png?w=900
Redneck Air Force' delivers aid to North Carolina mountains	(NewsNation) — In Swannanoa, North Carolina, a group calling themselves the 'Redneck Air Force' is helping deliver aid to mountain areas affected by Hurricane Helene. The home base for the group looks like a central command for disaster relief, but it’s all being run by volunteers, mostly retired special ops. They are choppering aid into the mountains, and volunteers with the group said they haven’t seen FEMA or federal help. Milton ‘could be the worst storm to hit Florida in over a century’: Biden After making landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, Helene weakened as it traveled up the southeast. Western North Carolina was particularly hit hard by the storm, which dumped record amounts of rain on communities built in the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountains. The region surrounding Asheville, North Carolina, was virtually cut off, with hundreds of roads washed out or impassable and cell phone service down. More than a week after the storm hit, thousands are still without power or water with no firm timeline given for restoration. NewsNation’s Rich McHugh went up with the group, flying over the popular tourist destination of Chimney Rock, which has been almost completely devastated by Helene. Helicopters come into the volunteer group’s headquarters to load up with supplies and fly aid in to those still in the area. FEMA held a press conference on the disaster response, with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell pushing back against what the agency has characterized as misinformation about the response. Brother of missing Tennessee man still searching for answers Officials in the area have said it’s making it more difficult for the agency to help people. 'People that have been impacted are afraid to apply for the assistance, that they can then get a hotel room. If I can’t get them to apply, I can’t get them the assistance,' Criswell said. 'I've heard rumors that if you take our $750 and don't pay it back, we're going to take your home. Absolutely false.' But the men and women running the Redneck Air Force say they have found FEMA’s response lacking. '[It’s] incompetent, if we’re talking about, broadly speaking, limited-to-no personnel,' said Adam Smith, former Green Beret. 'Once they did get here, they put themselves in positions, obviously, to make connections, create rapport, but in the process, there’s not been much dedicated assistance or support. I’ve not seen one FEMA individual come through this location. I’ve not seen one FEMA truck in this town.' James Taylor, Luke Combs, Eric Church to take part in Helene relief concert Aaron Switzer, who was part of Air Force Special Operations before he retired, said FEMA is taking too long to get aid out. 'These guys are coming in trying to figure out what the problem is and who’s in charge while we’re solving the problems,' Switzer said. 'People don’t care what’s going to happen two weeks from now when they’re starving. They need food, they need water, they need warmth. They need somebody to give them a hug and say, what do you need? They don’t need a government official to say we’re here, and we’re going to fix this.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/redneck-air-force-aid-north-carolina/	2024-10-08T11:40:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175400595.jpg?w=900
