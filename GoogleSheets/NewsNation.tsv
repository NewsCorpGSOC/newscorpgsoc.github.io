Government handling of drones a 'catastrophe': Elizondo	(NewsNation) — The public has yet to get answers regarding the mysterious drone sightings reported in eastern states, showing how much the Biden administration 'doesn’t seem to have a handle on things,' a former Pentagon official says. Lue Elizondo, who led Pentagon investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), aka UFOs, told NewsNation the public messaging surrounding the unexplained drones has been a 'catastrophe.' 'I have never seen an administration handle a topic as poorly as this,' he said. 'We're not informing the American people of the truth and this is yet another example of, for whatever reason, this administration doesn't seem to have a handle on things.' Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey and parts of New York since mid-November, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster. New Jersey drones not national security risk: White House The FAA temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey and 30 areas in New York, where critical infrastructure is located. FAA officials said the flight restrictions were requested by federal security agencies and are effective through Jan. 17. The agency has warned that 'deadly force' could be used against the drones if they pose an 'imminent security threat' and that the government is using 'drone busters' to take down unauthorized flyers. Elizondo blasted officials, saying the only two possibilities for the lack of information is that they are either 'lying or they’re incompetent.' 'Either one of those is really a bad place for this administration to be in,' he said. Elizondo believes the incoming Trump administration may do a better job with transparency, saying many key figures tapped by the former president are known to be 'extremely proactive and dedicated to getting to the bottom of what's actually going on.' FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey The FBI, the Homeland Security Department and state agencies have been investigating the drones, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. Speculation has run rampant, with some expressing concerns the drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents or clandestine operations by the U.S. government. Authorities say many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars. While not identifying the drones as UAPs, Elizondo says the drones fit into what he calls the 'five observables' associated with UAPs. The possibility is there, he said. 'Once people really know the truth, the whole truth, about this topic, and particularly the UAP topic, you know, I think there's going to be a lot of reconciliation.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elizondo-government-drones/	2024-12-21T18:00:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/snapshot_19458a.jpg?w=900
NJ rep. says it's alarming Feds can't bring down one drone	(NewsNation) — U.S. Rep. Chris Smith says he is 'disturbed' more isn’t being done by federal officials to bring down even one of the mysterious drones flying over that state in order to get answers. Smith, a Republican serving New Jersey's Fourth District, told NewsNation he has been disappointed by the lack of transparency and effort put forth by the Biden administration to quell concerns about who is behind the drone flap. 'Why can't they bring one of these down?' he asked. 'Is our airspace so susceptible and so easily violated that we can't go and say, ‘OK, here they are, let's get at least one and find out...what's the origin?' Smith said many New Jersey residents have been 'alarmed' by the flying objects, and all they want is answers and support to handle the air infestation. New Jersey drones: State senator wants state of emergency Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey and parts of New York since mid-November, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster. The FAA temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey and 30 areas in New York, where critical infrastructure is located. FAA officials said the flight restrictions were requested by federal security agencies and are effective through Jan. 17. The agency has warned that 'deadly force' could be used against the drones if they pose an 'imminent security threat' and that the government is using 'drone busters' to take down unauthorized flyers. The FBI, the Homeland Security Department and state agencies have been investigating the drones, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. 'They keep saying it’s not a foreign threat, but they don’t know that,' Smith said, adding that he is highly concerned the drones could be from China or Iran. FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey 'It certainly begs the question, why are we not aggressively looking to determine the source, and they're not doing that,' he said. 'If they are doing it, they are failing in a colossal way.' Speculation has run rampant, with some expressing concerns that the drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents or clandestine operations by the U.S. government. Authorities say many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars. But those are not reassurances, Smith said, adding that he believes the drone activity has been 'ramping up.' He also said the flight restrictions imposed by the FAA lead him to believe all is not well as the government is implying. 'If there's nothing to see here, then why are you taking further action to protect because that's where the sightings are,' Smith said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/new-jersey-feds-drone/	2024-12-21T18:00:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/07/64a2eaf73e05e1.31816879.jpeg?w=900
Chicago closing last migrant shelter as it moves to 'unified syte...	(NewsNation) — Chicago, Illinois will close its last shelter specifically for migrants later this month as it merges these services with others the city currently offers to homeless people. A migrant shelter at 1310 N. Elston Avenue is set to shut down by Dec. 31, city officials said at a news conference Friday. Besides that shelter, Fox 32 Chicago writes, there are five other shelters in Chicago, two of which are run by the state of Illinois and three that are operated by the city. These will be integrated into Chicago's One System Initiative, meaning these shelters won't only be for migrants, but any homeless individuals in need of housing. What is the Project Blue Beam drone conspiracy theory? Under the new unified shelter system, which will launch in January 2025, will be 3,800 beds added to the 3,000 already existing in the system. On Dec. 20, SPARC, or Shelter Placement and Resource Center, opened. SPARC is a new, 24/7 access point for single adults with 200 temporary beds. About a year ago, there were around 15,000 migrants, some of whom were sent from Texas under a program by Gov. Greg Abbott, who lived in 28 shelters, according to city data compiled by The Chicago Tribune. During this time, over 30,000 measles vaccines and tens of thousands of other vaccines were administered to migrants and 17,000 people were resettled in apartments. At Friday's press briefing, officials said there are currently 2,476 migrants in city shelters, but these numbers will no longer be tracked under the new system. Deputy Mayor for Immigration Beatriz Ponce de León said this information is no longer needed because Chicago is no longer in 'that crisis state.' 'Everyone in the new system will be under will be under the same policy,' she said. 'There’s no need to collect that data.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/chicago-closing-last-migrant-shelter-unified-sytem/	2024-12-21T16:06:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/6543b0834ef3e9.01583529.jpeg?w=900
Senate Democrats condemn ethical lapses by Thomas, Supreme Court ...	Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee condemned the Supreme Court for an 'ethical crisis of its own making' in a new report released Saturday. The report follows Democrats’ 20-month investigation into the court’s ethics, spurred by ProPublica reports last year detailing how Justice Clarence Thomas accepted various luxury gifts and trips from a billionaire while on the court. In particular, the majority staff report critiques Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito and the late Justice Antonin Scalia, all prominent conservative justices, claiming they violated their legal obligations by not disclosing gifts or failing to recuse from certain cases. Biden signs bill to avert government shutdown 'Any claim that the Court can adequately police itself is belied by the fact that the Court has not taken meaningful action to address ethical misconduct and no justice has faced consequences for unethical behavior—despite dozens of credible allegations of misconduct by multiple justices over decades,' the report states. 'An enforceable code of conduct for the Supreme Court is essential in light of the Court’s failure to police itself,' it continued. Democrats have pushed the Supreme Court to strengthen its ethics standards for years, but revelations of Thomas’s trips and other ethics controversies sparked renewed interest as public trust in the court plummeted. 'The number, value, and extravagance of the gifts accepted by Justice Thomas have no comparison in modern American history,' the report states, critiquing the judiciary’s policymaking body for not taking further corrective action. Thomas has denied wrongdoing and said he was not previously obligated to disclose the trips, provided by billionaire Harlan Crow, under a personal hospitality exception that has since been clarified. Here’s what made the cut in Congress’ 1,500-page government funding deal 'On a personal note, Kathy and I are saddened that our dear friends, Clarence and Ginni Thomas, have been subjected to these baseless smears for the past two year,' Harlan Crow said in a statement. 'They are good and honorable people and no one should be treated this way.' In response to the pressure, the justices ultimately adopted a statement of ethical principles last November. Democrats have criticized it for including no binding enforcement mechanism, as opposed to the code in place for other federal judges. The new report reups Democrats’ calls to pass legislation that would create an enforceable ethics code. Republicans blocked the bill, expressing confidence in the justices to police their own ethics and view Democrats’ investigation as a partisan attempt to tear down the conservative-majority court. Thomas and the other justices did not return a request for comment sent to a court spokesperson. Mark Paoletta, a close friend of Thomas whom President-elect Trump has selected for a senior role in the Office of Management and Budget, called the report 'pathetic' and criticized Democrats for releasing it the Saturday before Christmas. 'When they come back, they will thankfully be in the minority. Good riddance,' Paoletta wrote on X.

Funding saga forecasts future struggles for Speaker Johnson	Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) averted a government shutdown, but the days-long rollercoaster as the leaders cycled through multiple plans leaves serious questions about how the Speaker will manage the House GOP under President-elect Trump — and whether he can keep his gavel. The intra-party clashes that were on full display this week will be even more consequential next year as Johnson aims to push through an ambitious legislative agenda in Trump’s first 100 days in office with an even slimmer GOP majority in the House. Republican frustration with Johnson this week boiled over beyond the typically antagonistic hardline conservative wing as he went from unveiling a bipartisan 1,500 bill and then abandoning it due to GOP opposition; to pushing a slimmed-down plan B that included a debt ceiling increase requested by Trump, which failed on the House floor; to finally ushering through the slimmed-down version without a debt ceiling lift. 'There’s zero communication from leadership to the membership. And it’s frustrating. And it’s something that should change before January 3,' Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) said as she entered a House GOP conference meeting on Friday. 'We need a clear understanding of how we’re going to do things next session, because what’s happening now is completely unacceptable.' Jan. 3 is the first day of the 119th Congress, where the first order of business for House members will be electing the Speaker. Johnson cannot afford more than one Republican defection on the House floor in the Jan. 3 Speakership election, assuming all members are present and voting. Republicans are set to have 219 Republicans taking the oath of office on Jan. 3, and all 215 Democrats are expected to vote for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) – with Jeffries saying this month that Democrats will not save Johnson from a GOP revolt. One Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie (Ky.), is already publicly pledging to vote against the Speaker on Jan. 3. 'We’re legislating by braille here,' Massie said Friday. 'I think this wasn’t handled well. And then I still have all the grievances from last at the beginning of this year; FISA, Ukraine, all of those things. I think there's going to be a reckoning eventually.' A number of other Republicans who spoke to The Hill this week also withheld their support for Johnson. And Johnson is losing backing from others who previously supported him. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), chair of the House Freedom Caucus, told The Hill on Wednesday after the initial 1,500-page funding bill was released that he still supported Johnson. But on Friday after the House passed the stripped-down version, Harris said in a statement on X that he was 'undecided on what leadership should look like in the 119th Congress,' citing concerns about unpaid new spending not offset by cuts. Yet even some who were highly critical of Johnson’s handling of the funding deal this week, such as Rep. Rich McCormick (R-Ga.), said they are not ready to force a floor fight over the Speakership. 'We’ll see how it goes … I want a consensus pick,' McCormick said. 'Of course, he's made mistakes. And any quarterback in any Super Bowl, including the MVP, can make mistakes. But you know, nothing's done until it's done.' The situation echoes the sequence of events that led to former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) being ousted from the Speakership in October 2023 just days after he pushed through a short-term government funding bill with the help of Democrats. But there are several differences in the dynamics. While former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) claimed that he moved to oust McCarthy over policy gripes, McCarthy maintained that Gaetz had a personal vendetta against him over an ethics investigation. Delaying the election of a Speaker for multiple days, as was the case with McCarthy in 2023, would also clash with Congress’s statutory responsibility to count the electoral votes that certify Trump’s victory on Jan. 6. Johnson has also enjoyed the support of Trump, which helped him get nominated as Speaker in an unanimous internal voice vote in November. The Speaker on Friday night emphasized that he was in 'constant communication' with Trump during the continuing resolution negotiation process — and that he had talked to Elon Musk, who had posted incessantly against Johnson’s original bipartisan deal, within an hour of the stopgap and disaster aid package passing. Musk, in turn, posted on X that Johnson 'did a good job here, given the circumstances.' But some members think Trump could be doing more to signal his support for Johnson. Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) said that 'going multiple rounds, fighting with one another' over the Speakership, as members did with McCarthy over 15 ballots in 2023, would 'delay the work that we have to do to deliver on the America first mandate.' 'I think President-elect Trump can play an enormously constructive role in helping speaker Johnson get there early,' Barr said. Asked after the vote Friday if he is confident that he can keep the Speakership, and if he could win on the first ballot, Johnson said to each question: 'Yes.' Difficulties for Johnson will extend far beyond Jan. 3, though. 'There's going to be a reckoning when Trump figures out that Mike Johnson has constraints on him that were imposed before President Trump won the election,' Massie said, adding that there will be tensions between what Trump wants Johnson to do and what GOP members want him to do. Some of that tension emerged this week, when Trump made a last-minute demand to increase the debt limit as part of a deal to continue government funding. Trump wanted to get the issue out of the way before he takes office in January so Democrats could not use it as leverage, but many Republicans balked at raising the debt limit without significant spending cuts. In an attempt to appease Trump, Republicans struck an agreement to raise the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion in exchange for $2.5 trillion in net cuts to spending, done through a reconciliation package next year, two sources confirmed to The Hill. That adds a significant layer of complexity to an already-ambitious legislative agenda that Republicans were hoping to push through Congress and onto Trump’s desk without Democratic support. Republicans were already eyeing that party-line reconciliation process to extend tax cuts first passed under Trump’s term and to address border issues. And after some members of the House GOP are confirmed to join the Trump cabinet, Johnson will be able to afford zero defections on party-line measures until GOP replacements are chosen in special elections. 'It’s gonna be a fist fight on every vote,' Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) said. Given the steep challenges, Johnson was asked by a reporter Friday evening if he even wants to keep the job. 'Being Speaker of the House is a challenge in this modern era, but it’s a challenge that we accept,' Johnson responded. 'I wouldn't say it's the most fun job in the world all the time, but it's an important one. A hugely consequential moment for the country.'

Death toll in attack on Christmas market in Germany rises to 5, w...	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — Germans on Saturday mourned both the victims and their shaken sense of security after a Saudi doctor intentionally drove into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers, killing at least five people, including a small child, and injuring at least 200 others. Authorities arrested a 50-year-old man at the site of the attack in Magdeburg on Friday evening and took him into custody for questioning. He has lived in Germany for nearly two decades, practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg. officials said. The governor of the surrounding state of Saxony-Anhalt, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters that the death toll rose from two to five and that more than 200 people in total were injured. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that nearly 40 of them 'are so seriously injured that we must be very worried about them.' Several German media outlets identified the suspect as Taleb A., withholding his last name in line with privacy laws, and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Mourners lit candles and placed flowers outside a church near the market on the cold and gloomy day. Several people stopped and cried. A Berlin church choir whose members witnessed a previous Christmas market attack in 2016 sang Amazing Grace, a hymn about God's mercy, offering their prayers and solidarity with the victims. The man behind the attack There were still no answers Saturday as to what caused him to drive into a crowd in the eastern German city of Magdeburg. Describing himself as a former Muslim, the suspect shared dozens of tweets and retweets daily focusing on anti-Islam themes, criticizing the religion and congratulating Muslims who left the faith. He also accused German authorities of failing to do enough to combat what he said was the 'Islamism of Europe.' Some described him as an activist who helped Saudi women flee their homeland. He has also voiced support for the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Recently, he seemed focused on his theory that German authorities have been targeting Saudi asylum seekers. Prominent German terrorism expert Peter Neumann said he had yet to come across a suspect in an act of mass violence with that profile. 'After 25 years in this ‘business’ you think nothing could surprise you anymore. But a 50-year-old Saudi ex-Muslim who lives in East Germany, loves the AfD and wants to punish Germany for its tolerance towards Islamists — that really wasn’t on my radar, ' Neumann, the director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King’s College London, wrote on X. The two people confirmed dead were an adult and a toddler, but officials said additional deaths couldn’t be ruled out because 15 people had been seriously injured. 'As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city,' Saxony-Anhalt’s governor, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters. 'Every human life that has fallen victim to this attack is a terrible tragedy and one human life too many.' Magdeburg is still shaken The violence shocked Germany and the city, bringing its mayor to the verge of tears and marring a festive event that’s part of a centuries-old German tradition. It prompted several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution and out of solidarity with Magdeburg’s loss. Berlin kept its markets open but has increased its police presence at them. Germany has suffered a string of extremist attacks in recent years, including a knife attack that killed three people and wounded eight at a festival in the western city of Solingen in August. Magdeburg is a city of about 240,000 people, west of Berlin, that serves as Saxony-Anhalt’s capital. Friday’s attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Chancellor Scholz and Interior Minister Nancy Faeser traveled to Magdeburg on Saturday, and a memorial service is to take place in the city cathedral in the evening. Faeser ordered flags lowered to half-staff at federal buildings across the country. A recount of the horrifying attack Verified bystander footage distributed by the German news agency dpa showed the suspect’s arrest at a tram stop in the middle of the road. A nearby police officer pointing a handgun at the man shouted at him as he lay prone, his head arched up slightly. Other officers swarmed around the suspect and took him into custody. Thi Linh Chi Nguyen, a 34-year-old manicurist from Vietnam whose salon is located in a mall across from the Christmas market, was on the phone during a break when she heard loud bangs and thought at first they were fireworks. She then saw a car drive through the market at high speed. People screamed and a child was thrown into the air by the car. Shaking as she described the horror of what she witnessed, she recalled seeing the car bursting out of the market and turning right onto Ernst-Reuter-Allee street and then coming to a standstill at the tram stop where the suspect was arrested. The number of injured people was overwhelming. 'My husband and I helped them for two hours. He ran back home and grabbed as many blankets as he could find because they didn’t have enough to cover the injured people. And it was so cold,' she said. The market itself was still cordoned off Saturday with red-and-white tape and police vans every 50 meters (about 54 yards). Police with machine pistols guarded every entry to the market. Some thermal security blankets still lay on the street. Christmas markets are a German holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages, now successfully exported to much of the Western world. Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry condemned the attack on X. ___ Aboubakr reported from Cairo and Gera from Warsaw, Poland.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-germans-mourn-attack-on-christmas-market-with-no-answers-about-why/	2024-12-21T03:27:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6766a67f1a8b28.74242458.jpeg?w=900
House passes bill to avoid government shutdown	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The House voted to support a measure keeping the government funded past Friday night’s deadline, sending the bill to the Senate just hours before a looming shutdown. The chamber voted 366-34-1 in support of the legislation to avoid a shutdown. The Senate is expected to vote on the plan later Friday evening. After weeks of back and forth, Congress was able to come up with a funding bill to keep the government running. This marks the end of tumultuous negotiations on Capitol Hill. More Americans optimistic about coming year: Marist survey Republicans had abandoned a bipartisan plan Wednesday to prevent a shutdown after President-elect Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk came out against it. What is the spending bill? The spending bill lays out how to distribute federal money to agencies, departments and programs that keep the government running. Creating this budget has led to many clashes between Republicans and Democrats. What were the two sides arguing about? Trump had tied a demand for dealing with the debt ceiling to the dispute over government funding, saying one should not be addressed without the other. When he rejected the spending proposal on Wednesday, Trump said that he wanted the debt ceiling debate settled before he takes office next month. Warning of trouble ahead for Johnson and Republicans in Congress, Trump told Fox News Digital, 'Anybody that supports a bill that doesn’t take care of the Democrat quicksand known as the debt ceiling should be primaried and disposed of as quickly as possible.' GOP Senator Rand Paul pushes Elon Musk for House Speaker After meeting with his caucus, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries rejected any possibility that his members would bail out Republicans as the shutdown threat loomed. 'GOP extremists want House Democrats to raise the debt ceiling so that House Republicans can lower the amount of your Social Security check,' Jeffries posted Thursday on social media. 'Hard pass.' Jeffries and other Democrats said Republicans should honor the spending agreement that was negotiated before Trump got involved. Which agencies would have been impacted by a shutdown? Each federal agency determines its own plan for how to handle a shutdown, but basically any government operations deemed nonessential stop happening, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees would have seen their work disrupted. Wisconsin lawmakers to set up DOGE-inspired committee called ‘GOAT’ Sometimes workers would have been furloughed, meaning that they kept their jobs but temporarily didn't work until the government reopened. Other federal workers might have stayed on the job but without pay, with the expectation that they would be paid back in full once the government reopened. What was Elon Musk's role? Elon Musk brought to a sudden halt a bipartisan budget proposal by posting constantly on X (formerly Twitter) and threatening Republicans with primary challenges. The social media warnings preceded Trump's condemnation of a measure negotiated by GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson, which effectively killed the stopgap measure that was designed to prevent a partial shutdown of the federal government.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Friday afternoon that the House would vote on a modified version of the bill that was defeated Thursday — minus the debt ceiling provision pushed by President-elect Trump. Democrats and a few dozen Republicans on Thursday rejected the bill that paired a three-month government funding extension, $110 billion in disaster and farm aid and other measures with a two-year extension of the debt limit. Senate Republicans were left fuming over what they called the dysfunctional 's‑‑‑ show' and 'fiasco' they witnessed in the House, as two proposals to fund the government through Christmas failed this week.

Drones over New Jersey: Mystery continues month after first sight...	(NewsNation) — After more than a month of sightings across multiple states, lawmakers and the general public are no closer to finding out what the mysterious drones are spotted in New Jersey and a handful of other states. An unexplained large number of drones began flying over sensitive military sites in New Jersey in mid-November, and while the White House and the Pentagon insist they don't pose a threat, lawmakers are demanding answers. For the second week in a row, NewsNation's Ross Coulthart will examine the enduring mystery of the drones being spotted over New Jersey and other states. Tune in to Coulthart's second special report 'Drones over New Jersey' at 9 p.m. ET on Saturday, Dec. 21. Not sure where to watch NewsNation? Use our ChannelFinder app to locate NewsNation on your TV. And get caught up with what we know so far by watching last week's special report here. Why shooting down mystery drones carries big risks What are lawmakers doing about the drones? On Dec. 12, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, along with three other U.S. senators, sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Aviation Administration requesting a briefing on the situation. Since sightings of the drones have spread in news outlets and on social media, a slew of elected officials -- local, state and federal -- have been outspoken about what they call a lack of transparency from the government. FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey Last week, a group of New Jersey lawmakers met with state police and DHS, but some were left frustrated about the lack of answers they received. Republican New Jersey state Rep. Brian Bergen told NewsNation that meeting was 'a whole lot of nothing.' 'All they did was tell us they don’t know anything that’s going on,' he said. Where are the drones? Other than New Jersey, they have been spotted in other Northeastern states, including New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Sightings have also been reported in California, Florida, Ohio and Minnesota. NewsNation confirmed House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., received a classified briefing on the drones, and lawmakers on both sides have called for the drones to be intercepted. 'We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,' said U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., last week. Eyewitness accounts of New Jersey drones include politicians, journalist FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey Following the large number of mysterious drone sightings, the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey where critical infrastructure is located. FAA officials said federal security agencies requested the flight restrictions, which are effective through Jan. 17. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the restrictions are out of an 'abundance of caution,' without explaining further.

Can you fly with pot? Here’s what the TSA says	(WJW) – Ohio is one of the most recent states to legalize recreational marijuana. About half the US has legalized recreational marijuana, and more states have legalized marijuana for medical use. So, what does that mean for you when you’re flying to see friends and family for the holidays – or any other time of year? How many local ER visits are blamed on marijuana? Can I travel on a plane with marijuana? The short answer is no. Most cannabis products remain illegal under federal law. Since TSA security is under federal jurisdiction, bringing marijuana through a TSA checkpoint could lead to criminal charges. Here’s the TSA’s official statement on traveling with marijuana – which applies to both carry-on and checked bags. Marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some Cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law except for products that contain no more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry weight basis or that are approved by FDA. (See the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-334.) TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law to local, state or federal authorities. TSA’s screening procedures are focused on security and are designed to detect potential threats to aviation and passengers. Accordingly, TSA security officers do not search for marijuana or other illegal drugs, but if any illegal substance is discovered during security screening, TSA will refer the matter to a law enforcement officer. TSA notes that its employees are not trained for drug screening and that they’re looking for security threats, not drugs. Will marijuana eventually be allowed? The rules will likely change if marijuana is reclassified. Marijuana is a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act. Yes, marijuana can cause psychosis In the spring, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration proposed to shift marijuana from a Schedule I drug, which includes heroin and LSD, to a less tightly regulated 'Schedule III' drug, which includes ketamine and some anabolic steroids. Federal rules allow for some medical uses of Schedule III drugs. The proposed change faces a lengthy regulatory process, and there’s no timeline for the change as of now.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/can-you-fly-with-pot-heres-what-the-tsa-says/	2024-12-20T12:05:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2161792208.jpg?w=683

Would the US Postal Service stop during a shutdown?	(NewsNation) — A government shutdown will not affect the mail, meaning even if Congress does not pass a funding plan, holiday gifts still out for delivery should arrive. Congress has until midnight Saturday to avoid a government shutdown. If it misses the deadline, several agencies would not have the funds to continue operating, meaning some services would be delayed or stopped and federal workers would be furloughed or work without pay. What services are impacted when the government shuts down? However, the USPS is funded through the sale of its products and services, not by tax dollars, meaning it will stay operational if Congress fails to avert a shutdown. 'U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown, and all Post Offices will remain open for business as usual,' according to a 2023 post on the government agency’s website. Services that would be impacted by a shutdown National parks Facilities that require staffing would close but visitors could still access some memorials and open-air parks where staffing isn’t required. Federal courts Federal courts usually have enough money on hand from court filings and other fees to stay open for several weeks during shutdowns. After that, they curtail services. Federal prisons stay open. Veterans Veterans Administration hospitals stay open and benefit checks are issued during a shutdown, but new benefit applications and pending claims aren’t processed. Active duty military During a shutdown, military personnel would continue to work, but they don’t get paid until Congress provides funding. Some civilian military employees are furloughed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/would-post-offices-close-during-shutdown/	2024-12-20T07:58:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP20231702729442-e1730217747717.jpg?w=800
Richard Allen sentenced to 130 years for Delphi murders	(NewsNation) — Richard Allen, who was convicted of killing two Indiana girls in the 2017 Delphi murders, was sentenced to 130 in prison during a sentencing hearing held on Friday. The sentencing range for Allen was 45 years to 130 years in prison. He was given 65 years for counts three and four, to be served consecutively, for a total of 130 years. Counts one and two were vacated because of double jeopardy. Allen was convicted on Nov. 11 in the killings of Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14. A jury found him guilty of two counts of murder and two counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping. Delphi killings: Timeline of events in Richard Allen case When he was arrested in October 2022, more than five years after the February 2017 killings, Allen was employed as a pharmacy technician just blocks from the county courthouse where he later stood trial. The trial came after repeated delays, a leak of evidence, the withdrawal of his public defenders and their reinstatement by the Indiana Supreme Court. Allen’s defense team has said that they would not participate in Friday’s sentencing hearing as they prepare to appeal Allen’s conviction. He has continued to maintain his innocence throughout the legal process.

What services are impacted when the government shuts down?	(NewsNation) — Federal lawmakers have until midnight Friday to pass a budget, or else the government will shut down, impacting millions of employees and consumers ahead of the holiday. Without a funding plan, the shutdown would begin at 12:01 a.m. Dec. 21 and last until Congress passes a spending bill. Here are the government services and agencies that would be affected if the government shuts down. What does a government shut down impact? Federal employees, including military members, would not be paid. Non-essential agencies would stop service, while essential workers, such as police officers and air traffic controllers, would still report for duty. Citizens who don't work for the government may be impacted as well if certain agencies are closed or understaffed. Johnson says plan C reached to avert shutdown, vote expected Air Travel: The Transportation Security Administration is considered essential, so employees would be working without pay. Still, delays and interruptions could happen. Social Security: Payments for current recipients would continue because Social Security is deemed essential, but services for new claims could be delayed due to furloughed staff. Medicare and Medicaid: Current recipients would continue to receive benefits, but new applicants could see delays. Mail Service: The United States Postal Service would continue operations and remain open. Student Loans: Student loan services would continue to process payments, and payments will still be due. Speaking with an agent or getting help may come with delays, however. Government employee pay: Furloughed federal employees would receive back pay when a shut down ends, but government contractors will not. Passport Services: The processing of passport applications may be slowed or halted. FEMA cleanup and protection: The agency will still respond to emergencies in the event of a disaster, but long-term projects would be delayed. National Parks and Museums: Many national parks and federally funded museums would likely close or have limited operating hours. Food Assistance Programs: People who receive benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would continue to payments, but new enrollment or renewals could face delays.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/government-shutdown-impacted-agencies-and-services/	2024-12-20T06:17:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2184674649.jpg?w=900
Amazon drivers strike at multiple hubs over pay, conditions	SKOKIE, Ill. (NewsNation) — More Amazon warehouse workers are set to join the picket lines on Friday, as thousands of workers affiliated with the Teamsters union continue their strike, demanding higher wages and improved safety conditions just days before Christmas. Delivery drivers went on strike Thursday at seven major hubs across the United States, fighting for better pay and safer working conditions. The NYPD reported two arrests during a strike in the New York City borough of Queens but didn't specify why. The timing is strategic, as Amazon relies heavily on drivers during the holidays, and delays in deliveries could Amazon says the workers represent a small fraction of their workforce and expect holiday shipments to be delivered on time. Travel tracker: What you should know as you prepare for holiday travel Why are workers striking? The Teamsters said the workers, who voted to authorize strikes in recent days, joined picket lines on Thursday after Amazon ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. Drivers argue they should get paid the same as United Postal Service workers or UPS drivers. Amazon announced plans to raise wages for its subcontracted drivers to $22 an hour following union pressure. However, Teamsters members driving for UPS earn an average of $49 an hour. 'I'm gonna get paid this Friday, and more than half my check is going to go towards paying bills, paying insurance, and then my benefits that get taken out. More than half my check is about just benefits alone,' an Amazon worker told NewsNation. 'We should be getting fair pay, especially with the cost of living in California.' Where are the strikes happening? Amazon employs a few hundred employees at each delivery station. The Teamsters union has primarily focused on organizing delivery drivers, who work for contractors handling Amazon's deliveries. However, Amazon has rejected calls to negotiate, since it doesn't consider the drivers to be its employees. Teamsters also say the union represents some Amazon warehouse workers, totaling about 10,000 Amazon workers nationwide — a small portion of Amazon's 1.5 million employees. The union hasn't disclosed the number of workers participating in the strike or how long it will last. But it included Amazon-employed warehouse workers in San Francisco and subcontracted delivery drivers in cities like Chicago, New York City, Atlanta, and other parts of California. Will Amazon strike affect your holiday packages? How has Amazon responded? Amazon says the strike will not affect customers receiving their packages on time and argues the drivers are not its employees. The company also says these actions are protests, not strikes since no Amazon employee or third-party driver pays Teamsters union dues. 'They've worked hard over the last several weeks to drum up a lot of attention and also to try to convince employees and third-party drivers to join them out there on their protest lines. They weren't successful so they brought in a bunch of outsiders to harass our employees and to make it difficult for them to get in and out of our facilities,' said Kelly Nantel, Amazon's director of Global Media Relations.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/amazon-drivers-strike-multiple-hubs-over-pay-conditions/	2024-12-20T05:21:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2190075792.jpg?w=900
Johnson says plan C reached to avert shutdown, vote expected	Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Republicans have arrived at a plan C to avert a shutdown and the House will vote Friday morning on the legislation. 'Yeah, yeah, we have a plan,' Johnson said Friday morning as he entered the Capitol. 'We're expecting votes this morning, so you all stay tuned. We've got a plan.' He did not say what it entails. Lawmakers have little time to avoid a shutdown: Government funding runs out when the clock strikes midnight late Friday. Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) said on CNBC on shortly after Johnson’s comments Friday morning that he thinks Washington will probably avoid a shutdown since 'we’re pushed up against Christmas here,' alluding to the likely path forward without directly confirming it, saying that will be up to the Speaker’s office to announce it. 'There’s a chance today a clean CR [continuing resolution], short term clean CR, it may be for two, three weeks,' Mullin said. 'That was something that was discussed, you know, late last night, you know, even some discussions this morning. I’m not going to say that’s going to happen, but you know, that’s really the option that’s on the table.' If Johnson does move forward with a clean, short-term stopgap, it is unclear if that will muster enough votes to clear the House. A handful of Republicans have historically opposed continuing resolutions, and Democrats have evaluated the Speaker’s proposals on a case-by-case basis, two factors that are fueling the chances of a shutdown so close to the deadline. It's also unclear if Johnson’s plan will appease President-Trump and his demand to raise the debt ceiling as part of the CR. Friday’s vote will be the latest effort by the House to fund the government ahead of the partial shutdown deadline. And it will come hours after the House on Thursday voted down Johnson’s plan B bill that combined a three-month government funding extension with $110 billion in disaster and farm aid, some other policy measures, and a two-year suspension of the debt limit — the latter of which was a last-minute demand by Trump. The failed vote marked a blow for Johnson and Trump, who endorsed the package, urged lawmakers to support it and threatened primary challengers for anyone who opposed it. Aside from the debt limit increase, the plan B proposal was a stripped-down version of an initial funding deal that Johnson negotiated with Democrats and revealed earlier in the week. That initial bill included measures like a health care deal and an increase in pay for members of Congress that ballooned the bill to over 1,500 pages, prompting outrage from Republicans, Trump, and Elon Musk helped kill the package. Members on Thursday night were unsure how they would solve the funding impasse after the plan B failed. They will have to not only get a bill that can appease Trump and pass in the narrow House GOP majority, but get approval from the Democratic-controlled Senate and White House. Johnson's comments Friday morning came moments before he was scheduled to huddle in his office with members of the far-right Freedom Caucus and at least two figures in the incoming Trump administration: JD Vance, the vice president-elect, and Russell Vought, who served as head of the White House budget office in Trump's first term. A long list of conservative House Freedom Caucus members trickled into the room after Johnson's arrival, including Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas), Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and Andy Harris (R-Md.), the chairman of the group. None of them commented. 'It's gonna be beautiful,' said GOP Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.). House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) and House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) also arrived at Johnson’s office early Friday morning. Trump’s last-minute demand to address the debt limit has drastically complicated the government funding process. It emerged as one of the main sticking points in negotiations, which is drawing opposition from Democrats and Republicans. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) wrote on social media Thursday that increasing the borrowing limit at this juncture was a 'hard pass,' in-part prompting most of the caucus to oppose the proposal that hit the floor that day. On the other side of the aisle, conservative Republicans have criticized raising the debt ceiling without cutting spending. 'New bill: $110BB in deficit spending (unpaid for), $4 TRILLION+ debt ceiling increase with $0 in structural reforms for cuts. Time to read the bill: 1.5 hours. I will vote no,' Roy wrote on X. Congress is not expected to have to deal with increasing the debt until summer 2025.

Luigi Mangione held in same jail as 'Diddy'	(NewsNation) — Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, will reportedly be housed in the same New York City jail as rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs. 'He just walked into paradise,' said Gene Borrello, a former organized crime associate who spent 13 years behind bars, including at BMDC and Rikers Island. Mangione will be at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center. Some previously suspected Mangione may have been booked at Rikers Island jail. 'Rikers Island is an absolute hell hole... It's the most violent jail in the country,' Borrello said on NewsNation's 'Banfield' Thursday night. 'So he actually got lucky. He should be happy the feds came and got him because he's going to be in a much safer place.' Borrello said he thinks Mangione will be in the 4 North unit, which is also where Diddy is. 'It's going to be with a whole bunch of other high-profile people with no violence going on,' Borrello said, but if he's housed with the general population, then 'he's going to be dealing with a lot of gang members. They all hate murder.' NewsNation contributor faces death threats for Mangione analysis Could Mangione face the death penalty? Mangione was extradited to New York Thursday facing 11 federal criminal charges, including first-degree murder, and could face the death penalty. 'I have rarely seen the kind of support pretrial for somebody charged with murder that there is for this young man,' said criminal attorney Mark Geragos, whose daughter works for the law firm representing Diddy and Mangione. 'The polling I've seen... this guy has support exceeding 40% in people under 30. It's astonishing,' Geragos said, referring to an Emerson College poll that found 41% of people ages 18-29 think Mangione's actions were 'acceptable.' Geragos said he thinks the death penalty is 'entirely likely,' but it could be a difficult task for prosecutors in federal court in New York City, which is traditionally 'anti-death penalty.' Shooting of Brian Thompson Brian Thompson, 50, was fatally shot just before 7 a.m. Dec. 4 in front of a Hilton hotel while walking to UnitedHealth Group’s annual investor meeting in New York City. The words 'deny,' 'depose' and 'defend' were written on bullet shell casings found at the scene. It is an apparent reference to the title of the book 'Delay, Deny, Defend,' which covers ways insurance companies reject requests for medical coverage deemed necessary by doctors. NYPD finds drone in Brooklyn, owner steps forward: Report Authorities arrested Mangione at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania on Dec. 9. With him at the time were a mask, firearm, suppressor and fake New Jersey ID that connected him to the shooting, police said. Mangione also had a manifesto and a spiral notebook with a 'to-do' list. In the manifesto, Mangione wrote that he acted alone and that he 'apologizes for any strife or traumas, but it had to be done.' 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming,' he wrote. Mangione case reactions Thompson's death and Mangione's arrest have sparked strong reactions both online and in real life. Before Thursday's hearing, some supporters of Mangione were at the courthouse holding signs saying 'Luigi the people hear you,' 'Murder for profit is terrorism' and 'Free Luigi.' At the Altoona McDonald's where police arrested Mangione, employees told NewsNation they hired security guards after they received death threats. Those who live near that McDonald's say the arrest was quiet, and they had no idea what was happening until it showed up on the news. NewsNation's Brooke Shafer, Alex Caprariello and the Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangione-same-prison-as-diddy/	2024-12-20T03:18:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24345709498364.jpg?w=900
Republicans scramble for funding plan C as shutdown deadline draw...	Congress is racing toward a shutdown at the end of the day Friday, and Republicans appear no closer to finding a path forward that will keep the lights on and appease President-elect Trump. The latest setback roiled the House on Thursday evening, when Democrats and a band of Republicans rejected a bill that paired a three-month government funding extension, $110 billion in disaster and farm aid and other measures with a two-year suspension of the debt limit — the latter of which was a last-minute demand by Trump. That plan B was cobbled together after GOP lawmakers, Trump and Elon Musk torpedoed the first deal Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) negotiated with Democrats, with the influential Republicans criticizing the policy add-ons included — like a health care policy deal and cost of living raise for members of Congress — that ballooned the legislation to over 1,500 pages. With Johnson’s first two proposals up in flames, Republicans are unsure where to turn. 'There’s no plan,' Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) said after the plan B vote failed, adding: 'Trump wants the thing to shut down.' Johnson told reporters Thursday night, shortly after the failed vote, that Republicans would 'regroup' and 'come up with another solution,' adding 'stay tuned.' But Republicans, who are eager to stay on the incoming president’s good side, and Johnson, trying to keep his grasp on the gavel come next year, are struggling to unify behind a plan. Trump’s last-minute debt limit increase demand is opposed by many Republicans — 38 of whom joined with Democrats to tank the plan B bill on Thursday. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) said Republicans are not currently planning to try to bring the bill up through a longer regular rule process, which would require near-unified GOP support for passage. Beyond the struggles in the House, any bill would have to not only pass the GOP-controlled House but get approval from Democratic-controlled Senate and White House, which are rejecting the last-minute GOP changes. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) kept his posture steady even following the vote, indicating he was in no mood for negotiating further after Johnson reneged on their original accord. 'It's a good thing the bill failed in the House,' Schumer told reporters. 'And now it's time to go back to the bipartisan agreement.' Senators voting on an unrelated bill across the Capitol complex as the latest stopgap measure was going up in smoke were unsure where negotiations will go from here with the clock ticking down toward a shutdown and a likely pre-Christmas weekend session. 'I guess it’s back to the drawing board,' Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) told The Hill as he exited the Capitol. 'We’ll see. We’ll figure out in the House what they want to do next, and they’ll digest this last effort and see what Plan B is.' 'We have to be able to figure out a path forward,' the incoming majority leader continued. 'We’re little over 24 hours away from a shutdown, so it’s going to have to happen quickly, but we’ll figure it out.' With little direction, members were throwing out ideas that could potentially stick. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) predicted a three-week 'clean' continuing resolution without a hike in the debt limit could be the next course of action. He, however, acknowledged that he is 'labor, not management.' Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), the top Senate GOP appropriator, told reporters she would back a multi-week continuing resolution that would help get members through the holiday season, but conceded that she is unsure where negotiators will go next with the hourglass running out. 'I don't know what the plan is now,' she said, adding that the inclusion of a debt ceiling increase 'seems to have aggravated the Democrats.' 'My number one goal is to prevent a government shutdown,' she added. The reaction was similar on the House side, where Republicans floated various ideas with no off-ramp in sight. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), for example, told reporters after Thursday’s failed vote that he pitched Johnson on splitting the stopgap package into four separate bills: A clean continuing resolution, disaster aid, the farm bill extension and the debt limit suspension, passing them under one procedural rule then voting on each one individually. Massie said he pitched Johnson on the idea and that 'it wasn’t rejected outright.' It’s also unclear if Trump would support that. Massie said that Trump’s team initially asked for a five-year extension of the debt limit, so it would not come up again during his presidential term. Another idea brought up to Johnson was to add spending cuts to the bill to offset the unpaid disaster and farm aid spending, one source said, as a means of trying to woo hardline conservatives to support the bill. Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), the chairman of the self-proclaimed pragmatic Main Street Caucus, said he 'suggested a number' of ideas to Johnson, but would not divulge specifics. Another House Republican predicted to The Hill that Republicans would move to a 'clean' continuing resolution next. Another GOP lawmaker, meanwhile, said the 'rumor' in GOP circles is that the Senate will try to pass the initial proposal negotiated by congressional leaders in an attempt to 'jam' the lower chamber. Senate Republicans are balking at that idea — but not ruling it out. Collins, the top Senate GOP appropriator, told reporters that a bill originating from the Senate is not the 'preferred way to proceed,' but is something she could potentially foresee amid the ongoing troubles. 'I don't know what the plan is now,' she said, adding that the inclusion of a debt ceiling increase 'seems to have aggravated the Democrats.' Collins also said that she would be supportive of a short-term measure that would get lawmakers past the holiday season. 'Yes,' she said about the possibility of a three-week 'clean' bill. 'My number one goal is to prevent a government shutdown.' As the clock ticks to Friday at 11:59 p.m., lawmakers are becoming acutely aware of the time crunch they face to craft a proposal that can muster bipartisan support, move it through the House and usher it through the Senate. With time running out, Republicans are urging their colleagues to get down to business. 'At some point, let’s just put on our big boy, big girl pants, let’s understand that we got to get to 218 here and we got to get 60 over there,' Dusty Johnson said. 'Ideas that don’t move us in that direction are not helpful.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/republicans-scramble-for-funding-plan-c-as-shutdown-deadline-draws-near/	2024-12-20T01:51:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/IMG_4878.jpeg?w=900
House rejects Johnson's plan B to prevent shutdown	The House on Thursday torpedoed Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) plan B to avert a government shutdown and suspend the debt limit, dealing a blow to the GOP leader and catapulting the conference back to square one as it stares down Friday's funding deadline. The measure — which Johnson rolled out hours roughly three hours before the vote — failed to clear the chamber in a 174-235-1 vote, falling short of the two-thirds threshold needed for passage under the fast-track suspension of the rules process. The bill met its demise after Democrats — led by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), who called the legislation 'laughable' — and a handful of conservative Republicans came out against the legislation, largely over the inclusion of a two-year suspension of the debt limit, which was a demand made by President-elect Trump. It remains unclear what path Johnson pursues next. Given the Republican opposition, the bill is unlikely to pass in the slim GOP majority if Johnson attempts to another vote it through a longer regular rule process that requires just a simple majority. After the vote, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) said leadership did not plan to send the bill to the Rules Committee. 'Not on this bill … not right now,' he said. 'We're going to have some more talks. I won't say anything's dead because we're going to continue having talks.' Speaking to reporters as the vote occurred, Johnson did not say what the next step will be. The clock, however, is ticking: If Congress does not approve any legislation by 11:59 p.m. on Friday, the government will shut down. The unsuccessful vote deals a blow to Johnson, who is scrambling to avert a shutdown by the looming deadline — and keep his grasp of the gavel come next year — and to Trump, who endorsed the package after torpedoing the Speaker’s initial proposal. Johnson rolled out the plan B Thursday afternoon after hours of closed-door meetings with an ideologically diverse array of House Republicans. The proposal would have kept the government funded at current levels through March 14, suspended the debt limit for two years and appropriated roughly $100 billion in disaster relief and about $10 billion for farmer economic assistance, while stripping away a number of policy provisions that were in an original 1,500-page deal. Trump quickly backed the package, calling it 'a very good Deal for the American people' and urging lawmakers to support it. But a handful of Republicans rejected that call almost immediately, hammering away at the legislation. 'More debt. More government. Increasing the Credit Card $4 trillion with ZERO spending restraint and cuts. HARD NO,' Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, wrote on X. Democrats also came out against the legislation in droves. During a closed-door House Democratic Caucus meeting after the bill’s rollout, lawmakers were heard chanting 'hell no.' Thursday’s proceedings mark the latest twist in this week’s government funding debacle, which began after congressional negotiators rolled out a stopgap, heated up when Republicans of all stripes came out against the measure, and reached a fever pitch after Trump came out against the bipartisan bill, tanking its prospects of clearing the chamber. The series of events sent Republicans back to square one, huddling in Johnson’s office for hours trying to come up with an alternative plan. Vice President-elect JD Vance joined those talks at various points. The initial funding plan, which was crafted by congressional negotiators, would have funded the government at current levels through March 14, extended the farm bill for one year and appropriated roughly $100 billion in disaster relief and $10 billion in economic assistance for farmers, among other authorizations. Johnson, however, never put that legislation on the floor after Trump, his allies and a large number of Republicans said they would oppose it. Trump’s demand to lift the debt limit hurled an eleventh-hour curveball into government funding talks, inserting the issue — which typically requires painstaking and lengthy negotiations — into the discussions with just hours to go until the funding deadline. Congress is expected to have to act on the debt by at least mid-2025. But Trump on Wednesday expressed concern about Democrats using the must-pass issue as a leverage point, calling it a 'TRAP' at one point.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/house-rejects-johnsons-plan-b-to-prevent-shutdown/	2024-12-19T16:00:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/johnsonmike_121024gn07_w.jpg?w=900
Shutdown odds rapidly rise as House seeks plan B	The odds of a shutdown were rapidly growing on Thursday after President-elect Trump upended the talks by urging GOP lawmakers to shutter the government unless Democrats agree to a clean stopgap spending bill that raises or abolishes the debt limit. 'If we don’t get it, then we’re going to have a shutdown, but it’ll be a Biden shutdown, because shutdowns only inure to the person who’s president,' Trump told ABC’s Jonathan Karl. Trump’s blunt demand leaves leaders in Congress scrambling for some kind of compromise measure, and they have less than 36 hours to do it, heightening the chance of a federal shutdown over the weekend and possibly past Christmas. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is the figure at the center of the storm, and he and other Republicans in the House were seeking to pick up the pieces after their initial compromise bill was toasted by Trump and his allies on Wednesday. The House GOP is eyeing a plan B that would cut some of the parts of the bill that caused Wednesday’s political storm, including a pay hike for lawmakers. Yet their new plan would not include Trump’s demand for a debt ceiling increase, a move that risks triggering his opposition. Instead, two sources told The Hill, GOP lawmakers would commit to raising the borrowing limit twice next year through reconciliation, the budget process that Republicans are relying on to pass Trump’s agenda without Democratic support. 'They want a commitment from the Republicans that we can move during reconciliation and support a debt ceiling increase so that President Trump can function and do what he needs to do,' one of the sources said. Some of Trump’s government affairs staffers are in the meeting, the source said. Republican senators said Thursday that they have little idea how a shutdown will be averted given that Trump has shifted the debate so dramatically only a few hours before federal funding is due to lapse. 'I honestly don’t know what the endgame is,' said one GOP senator who requested anonymity to comment on the sense of confusion in the Senate Republican Conference. 'I don’t get a sense of where the House is. 'I just don’t have any idea how they’re going to get out of this,' the senator added. Doubts were also being expressed on the House side of the Capitol. Asked about the odds of a shutdown, Freedom Caucus member Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said: 'Well, I’ll say it is, in fact, noon, 36 hours before we run out of funding.' 'When you’re 24 hours out, you never know,' Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Texas) told reporters when asked about the likelihood of a shutdown. 'We’re trying to work on something that we could either get done tomorrow or over the weekend, so it’s mitigate and minimize.' Trump’s intervention in the talks, which came after his allies Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy railed against the bill on social media, has left plenty of observers doubtful of the GOP’s chances. It has also raised risks for Johnson’s Speakership. Two Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), said in the last 36 hours they would not back Johnson for Speaker. He faces a vote two weeks from Friday. Trump offered only a muted endorsement of Johnson keeping his job as Speaker, despite having endorsed him strongly in a meeting with GOP lawmakers a week after the election. 'We’ll see,' Trump told NBC when asked whether he still has confidence in Johnson. One Republican lawmaker who had spoken to Trump recently said the president-elect was not aware of the scope and many of the details of the government funding and disaster relief bill that Johnson put together behind closed doors with a handful of other leaders. One source close to Trump's orbit told The Hill that getting rid of Johnson could create even more complications for an already fractious GOP at a time when they are hoping to unify around Trump's agenda. 'There are a lot of people that aren’t happy with Johnson, but you get rid of Johnson, then what?' the source said. 'It’s the ‘then what’ that's part of the issue.' Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a staunch Trump ally, said it wouldn’t be the end of the world if the government shut down over Christmas, arguing that most people will be on vacation and federal employees will get paid anyway. 'Everybody’s on vacation, nobody’s not going to get paid,' he said, arguing that it would be better for President Biden, President-elect Trump and congressional leaders to have some time to think about how to solve the government funding and debt-limit impasse over Christmas and New Year’s Day. The House Republican leaders gathered midday in Johnson’s Capitol office to hash out a plan-B stopgap included House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (Minn.), House Appropriations Committee Chair Tom Cole (Okla.), Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart (Fla.) and leaders from the conservative House Freedom Caucus, the more centrist Republican Governance Group, Main Street Caucus and Republican Study Committee. James Braid, the incoming White House head of legislative affairs, was spotted walking into the Speaker’s suite. Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), the chair of the Main Street Caucus, told reporters the internal talks were 'making progress' but declined to reveal any details. A big and important question to any internal GOP plan is whether House Democrats will back it. Republicans are almost certain to need Democratic votes, and if they take the bill to the floor under a suspension of House rules, it will need to pass with a two-thirds majority. Democratic support will also be needed in the Senate. But there’s no guarantee that Democrats will be ready to accept a new offer from Johnson after spending the last several weeks negotiating the continuing resolution that sparked strong pushback from Trump and House conservatives Tuesday and Wednesday. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) insisted Thursday that the spending deal that Johnson had agreed to initially was the 'best path' for avoiding a shutdown. 'We are prepared to move forward with the bipartisan agreement that we thought was negotiated in good faith with House Republicans, along with Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans, that meets the needs of the American people at this moment in time,' he said. But Jeffries also left the door open to supporting a new stopgap that would include only government funding, farm aid and disaster relief. 'The debt-limit issue and discussion is premature, at best,' Jeffries said.

Dems say 'hell no' to GOP plan B on government funding, debt ceil...	House Democrats are rallying in overwhelming opposition to the Republicans' second stab at a government funding bill, vowing to sink it on the House floor and force GOP leaders back to the table to negotiate a bipartisan compromise. Huddling behind closed doors in the Capitol basement, party leaders detailed their opposition to the bill and urged their troops to join them in voting against it. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) foreshadowed that message going in, saying the GOP bill is 'laughable.' If there were any questions about the message resonating, they were dispelled by the loud chants of 'hell no' that could be heard deep into the hallway outside the meeting room. 'You heard the two-word position,' Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said afterward. 'We're all there,' echoed Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.). The vote, which is expected shortly after 6 p.m. on Thursday, is governed by a fast-track procedure known as the suspension calendar, which requires two-thirds of the House chamber to pass the bill. The Democrats' opposition means GOP leaders will fall far short of that bar, forcing Republicans either to attempt to move the bill through the Rules Committee, where hard-line conservatives could sink it, or abandon the bill in favor of a plan C. President-elect Trump brought Congress to a standstill this week when he came out against the previous bipartisan funding plan that both sides had agreed to, while also making a last-minute demand for Republicans to put in language tackling the nation’s borrowing ceiling. 'Unless the Democrats terminate or substantially extend Debt Ceiling now, I will fight ‘till the end,' he wrote in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday. He also warned any Republicans who back a stopgap funding bill without the debt ceiling component will face primary challenges. Lawmakers are expected to have to tackle raising the debt ceiling, which caps how much money the Treasury can owe to cover the country’s bills, next summer. Rep. Richard Neal (Mass.), top Democrat on the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said 'the debt ceiling is legitimate, but it has to be decided and discussed in a separate forum.' 'It has been demagogued by both sides over my time here, and I do think deserving of a conversation. But not to be had with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning,' Neal said. The debt limit has previously been used as a key point of leverage for the party out of power, which can demand major concessions in return for agreeing to raise the debt limit. And Republicans have successfully used the task of acting on the debt limit in the past to secure concessions from Democrats — most recently last year. Congress currently has until Friday to pass legislation to keep the government funded or risk a shutdown. Democrats have pushed for Republicans to uphold a previously agreed-to, roughly 1,500-page package to keep the government funded that also includes a sweeping bipartisan health care deal, along with about $110 billion in disaster relief and economic assistance for farmers. Jeffries earlier Thursday opened the door to a slimmed-down package, but one without a debt ceiling suspension. In addition to suspending the debt limit for two years, the new 116-page plan unveiled by Republicans also includes billions of dollars in disaster relief and economic assistance, but strips out reforms to how pharmacy benefit managers operate and chips away at extensions for some health care programs that were included in the earlier package. It also cuts other bipartisan provisions singled out by Trump allies that would end a years-long pay freeze for congressional members and language that would transfer administrative jurisdiction over RFK Stadium to the District of Columbia. Trump is urging both sides to vote for the legislation on Thursday night, saying the bill 'will keep the Government open, fund our Great Farmers and others, and provide relief for those severely impacted by the devastating hurricanes.' 'A VERY important piece, VITAL to the America First Agenda, was added as well - The date of the very unnecessary Debt Ceiling will be pushed out two years, to January 30, 2027,' Trump said. 'Now we can Make America Great Again, very quickly, which is what the People gave us a mandate to accomplish.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/dems-say-hell-no-to-gop-plan-b-on-government-funding-debt-ceiling/	2024-12-19T15:01:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/jeffrieshakeem_092524gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Trump backs plan B spending deal, urges swift passage	President-elect Trump on Thursday backed a new spending deal brokered by House Republicans to avert a shutdown after an initial proposal was torpedoed amid opposition from Trump and several of his allies. The plan now includes a two-year suspension of the debt ceiling in what became an unexpected sticking point by Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance in the negotiations in the last 24 hours. 'All Republicans, and even the Democrats, should do what is best for our Country, and vote ‘YES’ for this Bill, TONIGHT!' Trump posted on Truth Social. In a break from that package, however, language that would provide lawmakers with a pay raise was removed. The legislation also will not contain the E15 ethanol provision. It will, however, including $100 billion for disaster aid $10 billion in farmer economic assistance. Trump had come out against the previous agreement reached late Tuesday, focusing specially on concerns that it did not raise the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling, which limits how much money the federal government can borrow in part to pay off its debts, was set to come up as an issue in June during Trump's first term. The president-elect had argued lawmakers should deal with the debt ceiling as part of government funding talks now under President Biden, seeking to remove it as a potentially thorny issue for him after he takes office in January. A vote is scheduled for Thursday night, but it remains unclear whether it will pass both chambers. Some House Republicans have balked at raising the debt ceiling, and Democrats hold a majority in the Senate.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-plan-b-spending-deal/	2024-12-19T14:57:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Politics-Johnson_071824_AP_Matt-Rourke.jpg?w=900
Travel tracker: What you should know as you prepare for holiday t...	(NewsNation) — Nearly 120 million people are expected to travel at least 50 miles away from home over the Christmas and New Year holidays. The heavy traffic load of cars, buses, trains and airplanes over the coming two weeks could create snags in arrival times, but there are ways to make your holiday travel plans smoother. The American Automobile Association estimates that 119.3 million Americans will venture away from home during the year-end holidays. The travel period extends from Saturday through Jan. 2. The agency’s domestic travel prediction would surpass a previous record set in 2019 by 64,000 travelers. AAA said 3 million more people will travel for the holidays than last year. Disney vacations push families into debt, but 59% say it’s ‘worth it’ AAA estimates that 90% of holiday travelers (107 million) will commute by car while 7.85 million people will fly to their destinations. An additional 4.47 million people will travel by bus, train or cruise ship, up 10% from 2023. Weather forecasts affecting travel Several states could experience wintery bursts of weather in the coming days and leading up to Christmas, forecasters predict. With the year-end travel season kicking off this weekend, winter-related weather alerts are expected to begin Thursday for North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. The National Weather Service alerts and advisories are associated with an Alberta clipper, which originates in western Canada. The system could produce heavy snow, high winds and icy roads for the affected areas. The NWS said that once the system arrives in the Northeast, flurries and spotty snow could have mild travel impacts. However, meteorologists say that the clipper could possibly run into a storm system that is reportedly building off the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. If the two systems converge, that could create a major travel disruption over the next several days, including hazardous conditions along the I-95 corridor that could affect major cites on the East Coast such as New York and Boston. How drone activity could affect US holiday travel plans Rainstorms are also expected to hit the Pacific Northwest, including Washington, Idaho, Oregon and northern California before Christmas. The storms likely will produce heavy rain and mountain snow and wind that should begin early next week and extend through the day after Christmas. The storms could cause air traffic delays between San Francisco and Seattle and could also hamper drivers traveling in higher elevation areas including Donner Pass in California and Snoqualmie Pass in Washington, Accuweather reported. Gas prices ahead of holiday travel Americans traveling by car this year are receiving an added holiday gift as Christmas gas prices nationwide are expected to be the lowest in four years. GasBuddy estimates that the price at the pumps will be a national average of $2.95 per gallon Christmas Day. Gas prices have finally gotten closer to normal thanks to the Federal Reserve, which has been cutting back on high interest rates that slowed the economy in recent years, GasBuddy reported. Other factors include a weak Chinese economy as well as the passage of time since the economy was growing at a 'blistering pace.' The nation’s lowest gas prices are expected to be found in Oklahoma ($2.46 per gallon), Texas ($2.53) and Mississippi ($2.55 per gallon). The highest prices are in Hawaii ($4.58 per gallon), California ($4.31 per gallon) and Washington ($3.93 per gallon). Holiday flight status The record number of people traveling by air over the next few weeks will increase traffic in and around the nation’s airports. Weather conditions could affect whether flights depart and arrive on time. The TSA estimates that it will screen more than 39 million people during the year-end holidays. Will Amazon strike affect your holiday packages? The heavy rains that are expected to hit the West Coast could lead to delays for passengers traveling through Seattle and San Francisco. Should the Alberta clipper and storm system that is brewing off the East Coast develop into a significant weather event, airports in New York and Boston could see travel delays, according to the weather service. Fliers can use the FlightAware site to track the status of their plane. For those who do find themselves rerouted, delayed or stuck, the Department of Transportation maintains a list of rights for passengers, including how to contact the department if one believs an airline carrier has violated rules around refunds or compensation. Will a possible United flight attendant strike affect air travel? United Airlines flight attendants were expected to begin demonstrating outside of airports across the country Thursday as part of an ongoing contract dispute between union flight attendants and the carrier. The union said that flight attendants have been working without a contract since 2021 and filed for federal mediation nearly a year ago. The union reported that in August, more than 99% of flight attendants represented by the union agreed to strike. Will drones affect holiday travel? The FBI has received tips about more than 5,000 drone sightings in recent weeks around the United States. The sightings have included reports of drone activity around airports in New York and Boston, including sightings that closed down the runways at Stewart International Airport in New York for an hour. No flights were affected by the activity, officials said. Two Massachusetts men were also recently arrested in connection with allegations they were flying a drone too closely to the airspace at Logan International Airport in Boston. Federal officials, including President Joe Biden, have said they do not believe there is any public safety risk associated with the drone sightings.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/holidays/travel-tracker-what-you-to-know-as-you-prepare-for-holiday-travel/	2024-12-19T14:27:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-2168330898.jpg?w=900
FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey	(NewsNation) — The Federal Aviation Administration has issued flight restrictions on drones over parts of New Jersey after a large number of mysterious drone sightings have been reported all over the state. The FAA temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey where critical infrastructure is located. FAA officials said the flight restrictions were requested by federal security agencies and are effective through Jan. 17. The FBI, the Homeland Security Department and state agencies have been investigating, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. The agency has warned that 'deadly force' could be used against the drones if they pose an 'imminent security threat,' and that the government is using 'drone busters' to take down unauthorized flyers. Eyewitness accounts of New Jersey drones include politicians, journalist The agency said pilots who fail to abide by those restrictions could be 'intercepted, detained, and interviewed by the law enforcement/security personnel.' Democratic U.S. Rep. Joshua S. Gottheimer of New Jersey has called on the agency to do a public briefing to explain the call to ban drones. 'Decisions like these made in a vacuum only lead to more confusion and uncertainty. These federal agencies must do better by Jersey families,' he said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said the restrictions are out of an 'abundance of caution,' without explaining further. The agency also restricted uncrewed aircraft systems and certain flights. FBI says it has no answers for drones seen over New Jersey Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents or clandestine operations by the U.S. government. Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said it’s unlikely the drones are engaged in intelligence gathering, given how loud and bright they are. He reiterated this week that the drones being reported are not being operated by the U.S. Department of Defense.

Republicans announce funding agreement, Thursday vote as shutdown...	House Republicans have reached an agreement on a plan B to avert a government shutdown ahead of Friday’s deadline and plan to vote Thursday, lawmakers announced. The bill, titled the American Relief Act, includes a three-month continuation of government funding and a two-year suspension of the debt limit, a provision that President-elect Trump called for Wednesday. It keeps a chunk of the bipartisan provisions from the initial package negotiated by Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) while stripping out controversial measures like a pay raise for members of Congress — but there are other key differences. Getting the bill across the finish line will be tough. Democrats still control the Senate and White House, and the plan B package is already getting opposition from hard-line conservatives in the House. Because leadership is bringing the bill to the floor under a suspension of the rules, it needs two-thirds support to pass. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) quickly panned the new bill. 'The Musk-Johnson proposal is not serious — it’s laughable. Extreme MAGA Republicans are driving us to a government shutdown,' Jeffries said. Clocking in at 116 pages, the legislation is significantly shorter than the more than 1,500-page bipartisan deal from earlier in the week. One source said a vote is expected on the bill at 6:30 p.m EST. The bill keeps roughly $100 billion in disaster relief and about $10 billion for farmer economic assistance, in line with the dollar amounts included in the previous bipartisan funding agreement struck days back. And it will include a one-year extension of the 2018 farm bill. In a break from Johnson’s initial package, however, language that would provide lawmakers with a pay increase was removed. Sources also said a deal for year-round E15 ethanol sales will not be included. It includes extensions for some health care programs — but not all that were in the original deal. And reforms to how pharmacy benefit managers operate were stripped from the package — a bipartisan measure that significantly added to the initial bill’s length and complexity — were removed. Reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, which got heat from Elon Musk and right-wing commentators, was removed. The SUPPORT Act, a bipartisan bill to address the opioid crisis, was also stripped. The new package also doesn’t include previous language that would transfer administrative jurisdiction over RFK Stadium to the District of Columbia. The move comes after Musk also elevated misinformation that the prior package included a provision to 'facilitate a $3 billion NFL Stadium' in D.C. Federal funding for rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore that was destroyed by a cargo ship crash earlier this year remains in the new bill. One source said the bill will be titled the American Relief Act. Top House Republicans told reporters they plan to vote on the agreement Thursday, as Friday’s shutdown deadline rapidly approaches. It remains unclear, however, if the legislation will muster enough support to pass. Even some Republicans teed off on the agreement quickly after details leaked: Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) called it a 'bad deal' on Sean Hannity’s radio show. Rep. Rich McCormick (R-Ga.) also expressed early skepticism of the bill to reporters: 'Tell me what changed that was good. I just don't understand unless somebody's missing something or somebody's not telling me the details.' Trump, for his part, endorsed the new spending deal — particularly the debt ceiling increase, which he called 'A VERY important piece, VITAL to the America First Agenda.' 'SUCCESS in Washington!' he wrote on Truth Social. 'Speaker Mike Johnson and the House have come to a very good Deal for the American People.' 'All Republicans, and even the Democrats, should do what is best for our Country, and vote 'YES' for this Bill, TONIGHT!' he added. An ideologically diverse group of House Republicans huddled in Johnson’s office for hours Thursday looking into alternate spending plans, including one stopgap that would have excluded a debt ceiling increase but instead been accompanied by a commitment to raise the borrowing limit twice next year. That version would have excluded Trump's biggest ask — and a Democratic red line. The plan, however, ran into a brick wall as hard-line conservatives, including those in the House Freedom Caucus, demanded spending cuts to offset the debt limit increases, a source told The Hill. The source said the group was unable to find enough areas to cut in such a short period of time with the shutdown looming, prompting a 'logjam' and leading them to scrap that plan. The plan B comes after Johnson’s initial funding proposal that he had negotiated with Democrats was torpedoed by frustrated GOP lawmakers with help from opposition from Trump and a swarm of posts against it from incoming 'Department of Government Efficiency' co-chiefs Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.

Texas Gov. Abbott lays out new ‘border security’ measures	EAGLE PASS, Texas (NewsNation) — Republican Gov. Greg Abbott was expected Thursday to lay out the state’s new 'border security strategy' to deter migrants from entering the U.S. illegally, according to a news release from the governor’s office. Several local ranchers, officials with the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), the state’s border czar, and more were expected to be on hand for the announcement. The new strategy precedes President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January, when he promised mass deportations on day one of his administration. CEO murder suspect Luigi Mangione waives extradition to New York Texas has spent over $11 billion since 2021 on Texas Department of Public Safety troopers stationed at the border, along with Texas National Guard troops, and has built miles of state-funded border wall — much of it in South Texas.

He also expects Trump to encourage local and state law enforcement officers to help with efforts to arrest and detain migrants. He said Wednesday that he's in regular contact with Trump's team, including Tom Homan, Trump's pick for border czar, and Stephen Miller, incoming deputy White House chief of staff for policy. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates that 11 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the U.S. as of 2022, the latest statistics available.

Christmas decorations have been put out on Hurricane debris and one resident decorated a massive Christmas tree in the center of the devastation. He turns the lights on at sunset every night, which he says brings hope.

Will Amazon strike affect your holiday packages?	(NewsNation) — Nearly 10,000 Amazon workers who are part of the Teamsters union are striking across the United States ahead of the Christmas holiday, but the online retailer says it doesn't expect the strike to affect holiday gift deliveries. Picket lines are being seen in cities like New York, Chicago and Atlanta as workers are walking off the job as the holiday rush to get packages delivered across the country heats up. Amazon says the drivers represent a small fraction of its delivery workforce and should not slow down operations, the company told Fox 5 in New York. Why are Amazon drivers striking? Teamsters are demanding more money for workers and claim that Amazon officials have not done enough to fix workplace safety issues. Amazon has denied the claims. 1,000 toys dropped off for patients at Bronson Children’s Hospital In suburban Chicago, about 400 Teamster drivers work at a facility where some employees are encouraging their colleagues to join the picket lines. The main demand is better pay. Drivers claim they are living paycheck to paycheck. Workers are also upset with how quickly they must process packages at Amazon fulfillment centers, citing a study that showed that workplace injuries at Amazon are double that of the industry standard. Where are the areas affected by the Amazon strike? Drivers are walking out of facilities in Southern California as well as San Francisco, Queens, New York, Atlanta, and outside of Chicago. The union calls it the 'largest strike against Amazon in U.S. history.' Teamsters are also setting up picket lines at Amazon Fulfillment Centers nationwide, the organization said, adding drivers and warehouse workers who are not unionized are legally allowed to honor those picket lines. 'If your package is delayed during the holidays, you can blame Amazon’s insatiable greed. We gave Amazon a clear deadline to come to the table and do right by our members. They ignored it,' said Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien. 'These greedy executives had every chance to show decency and respect for the people who make their obscene profits possible. Instead, they’ve pushed workers to the limit and now they’re paying the price. This strike is on them.' What do I do if my Amazon packages are delayed? If your package is delayed, the retailer says to wait 48 hours before contacting them or the seller, according to Amazon's website. You can also find out how to track your order on the website or in the app. Senate report on Amazon workforce This week, a report released by the majority staff for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, found that Amazon accepted employee injuries as part of the 'cost of doing business.' Amazon responded by saying that the committee's chair, Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders is 'misleading the American public.' Teamsters’ officials also argue Amazon management did not come to the bargaining table. Amazon executives maintain that the Teamsters are not representative of all of the company’s drivers. Amazon pays a driver service which in turn, provides about 7,000 independently contracted drivers for Amazon, which says the drivers are not Amazon employees. Those drivers, the company says, represent less than 1% of its workforce.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/amazon-drivers-across-us-strike-over-pay-and-work-conditions/	2024-12-19T06:22:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2021/02/GettyImages-1208650169.jpg?w=900
UnitedHealthcare CEO murder 'acceptable' among 40% of young peopl...	(NewsNation) — Four in ten young adults find the actions of the UnitedHealthcare CEO's killer 'acceptable,' according to a new Emerson College Polling national survey. The poll was conducted the week after a man, suspected to be 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, allegedly shot and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Bryan Thompson over his discontent with the American healthcare system. The poll asked about 1,000 people, 'Do you think the actions of the killer of the UnitedHealthcare CEO are acceptable or unacceptable?' Will Luigi Mangione face the death penalty? Respondents aged 18-29 were almost split; 41% of this age group voted acceptable, whereas 40% voted unacceptable. However, the majority of the larger poll respondent pool (68%) voted that the killer's actions were 'unacceptable.' From a political lens, more Democrats were OK with the killing with 22% voting acceptable compared to 12% of Republicans. Men were more likely to find the actions acceptable with 19%, compared to 14% of women.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/unitedhealthcare-ceo-murder-national-poll/	2024-12-19T05:23:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Luigi-mangione-brian-thompson.jpg?w=900
CEO murder suspect Luigi Mangione expected to waive extradition	(NewsNation) — Luigi Mangione, who is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is expected to waive extradition to New York while in Pennsylvania court on Thursday, sources tell NewsNation. Mangione's New York attorney is vowing to fight every charge, as his client could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted. The 26-year-old is charged with first-degree murder in the furtherance of terrorism, as well as two counts of second-degree murder. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul says extradition is going to happen one way or another. 'I'm ready to bring him back and make sure justice is served to someone who had the audacity to gun down any New Yorker,' Hochul said. 'I don't care what their title is. That brazen move on our streets must result in severe consequences.' What is the Project Blue Beam drone conspiracy theory? According to a local news outlet, if Mangione does get extradited to New York, he could be booked, processed, and arraigned in front of a different judge as soon as Thursday afternoon. NewsNation reached out to Mangione's attorneys for comment. Shooting of Brian Thompson Thompson, 50, was fatally shot just before 7 a.m. Dec. 4 in front of a Hilton hotel while walking to UnitedHealth Group’s annual investor meeting in New York City. The words 'deny,' 'depose' and 'defend' were written on the shell casings found at the scene. It is an apparent reference to the title of the book 'Delay, Deny, Defend,' which is about the ways insurance companies reject requests for medical coverage deemed necessary by doctors. NYPD finds drone in Brooklyn, owner steps forward: Report Authorities arrested Mangione at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania on Dec. 9. With him at the time were a mask, firearm, suppressor and fake New Jersey ID that connected him to the shooting, police said. Mangione also had a manifesto and a spiral notebook with a 'to-do' list. In the manifesto, Mangione wrote that he acted alone and that he 'apologizes for any strife or traumas, but it had to be done.' 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming,' he wrote. Mangione has been held without bail at the State Correctional Institution Huntingdon in Pennsylvania.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangione-court-hearing/	2024-12-19T04:45:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2188645013.jpg?w=900

Will Luigi Mangione face the death penalty?	(NewsNation) — Prosecutors in New York announced they are charging UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect Luigi Mangione with first-degree murder and killing as an act of terrorism, which comes with a penalty of up to life in prison. But could Mangione face the death penalty? Mangione, 26, is charged with the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was on his way to an investor meeting when he was shot outside of a Manhattan hotel. Police have described the crime as 'brazen' and targeted, with bullets engraved with the words 'deny' 'defend' and 'depose.' Gaetz ethics report to be released before Christmas: Sources Authorities launched a manhunt for the suspect, releasing photos taken from surveillance footage around New York. Mangione was eventually arrested at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania. New York abolished the death penalty in 2004 and even before that, the last execution in the state took place in 1963. In order to face the death penalty, Mangione would have to be charged federally, which isn't likely for a murder charge. Dane Elkins missing case gains new leads While hiring someone to kill another person across state lines qualified as a federal crime, crossing state lines to murder someone yourself does not, making it unlikely for Mangione to face a federal murder charge on top of the state charges. Even if he were to face such a charge, the federal government might not make the case for the death penalty, something that is relatively rare in federal prosecutions.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangione-death-penalty/	2024-12-18T15:20:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24345709519032.jpg?w=900
NYPD finds drone in Brooklyn, owner steps forward: Report	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — The NYPD recently discovered an abandoned drone in Brooklyn amid a spate of sightings in the Tri-State Area. This one, however, has a known owner. A photo obtained by The New York Post shows an officer holding up the 5-foot aircraft. The object, according to The Post, was found on Fifth Street between Market Street and Morris Avenue. The drone turned out to be owned by Amogy Inc., a sustainable energy startup working to use ammonia as a renewable fuel source for, among other things, drones. CDC reports first severe case of human bird flu in US A large number of mysterious drones have been reported flying over New Jersey and across the eastern U.S., sparking speculation and concern over where they came from and why they're being seen in such numbers. The FBI, the Homeland Security Department and state agencies have been investigating, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. In fact, authorities say, many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars. President Joe Biden said Tuesday night that there appears to be nothing nefarious about the flying objects. 'There are a lot of drones authorized. We are following this closely. So far, no sense of danger,' the president said as he left the White House for a trip to Delaware. Despite federal officials' comments, many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly unmanned aircraft — and for authority to shoot them out of the sky.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/nypd-finds-drone-in-brooklyn/	2024-12-18T14:50:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/NYPDGettyImages-1147477406.jpg?w=900
State of Emergency declared in California over the spread of bird...	(KRON) -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a State of Emergency in response to bird flu on Wednesday. The declaration comes following the spread of avian influenza in 16 states, including California and outside the Central Valley. The declaration, according to Newsom's office, is meant to streamline the state's response to bird flu. This latest action from the governor comes as cases were detected in dairy cows on farms in Southern California. CDC reports first severe case of human bird flu in US This signals 'the need to further expand monitoring and build on the coordinated statewide approach to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus,' according to a statement from the governor's office. After first being detected in Texas and Kansas back in March, the virus has spread in 16 states among dairy cattle. To date, however, no person-to-person spread of bird flu has been detected in California. According to Newsom's office, nearly all infected individuals in California had exposure to infected cattle. California has the largest testing and monitoring system in the nation, according to the governor's office. 'This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak. Building on California’s testing and monitoring system — the largest in the nation — we are committed to further protecting public health, supporting our agriculture industry, and ensuring that Californians have access to accurate, up-to-date information. While the risk to the public remains low, we will continue to take all necessary steps to prevent the spread of this virus.' -- Gov. Gavin Newsom The declaration of a State of Emergency will provide state and local agencies with additional flexibility around staffing, contracting, and other rules to support the state's response, Newsom's office said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/california-bird-flu-state-of-emergency/	2024-12-18T11:54:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6740dfad13d111.44398605.jpeg?w=900
CDC reports first severe case of human bird flu in US	(NewsNation) — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported the first severe case of bird flu in the U.S. in Louisiana. There have been a total of 61 human cases of H5N1 avian influenza reported in the U.S. since April but this is the first one to be considered severe. Partial genomic analysis indicates the virus affecting the Louisiana patient belongs to a genotype found in wild birds and poultry rather than the type detected in dairy cows. Couple allowed child to go severely malnourished: Police Public health experts are still working to determine the source of the infection, but the patient had exposure to sick and dead birds in backyard flocks. It is also the first case of bird flu linked to exposure from a backyard flock in the U.S. Sporadic cases of bird flu in humans are expected, often due to contact with infected wild or domestic birds. The agency has not detected any person-to-person spread of the virus and said the current risk to the public remains low. Doomscrolling among teens leads to growing ‘brain rot’ concerns To avoid contracting bird flu, the CDC recommends those who are in contact with livestock or wild birds, including backyard poultry owners, hunters and bird enthusiasts, should avoid contact with sick or dead birds. For those who must come in contact with wild birds or other poultry that could be infected, the CDC recommends wearing personal protective equipment and avoiding contact with surfaces or material that can be contaminated with saliva, mucous or animal feces.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/cdc-severe-bird-flu/	2024-12-18T11:07:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66949c1279f880.67501612.jpeg?w=900
Louisiana health officials confirm human case of bird flu: What t...	BATON ROUGE, La. (BRPROUD) — The Louisiana Department of Health has reported the first human case of bird flu (H5N1) in a person in the state. A person from southwestern Louisiana is hospitalized after exposure to sick and dead birds suspected of having the virus. According to state health officials, H5N1 is a virus that causes severe respiratory illness in birds. Outbreaks in wild birds and poultry have been reported since 2022 in the U.S. 2 cats die from suspected bird flu traced to raw milk in California 'While the current public health risk for the general public is low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk,' the agency said. According to LDH, 60 human cases have been reported nationwide as of Dec. 13, all linked to contact with infected animals. No human-to-human transmission has occurred in the U.S. 'The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure. That means avoiding direct contact with wild birds and other animals infected with or suspected to be infected with bird flu viruses,' LDH said. USDA orders nationwide testing of milk for bird flu to halt the virus How to protect yourself Avoid contact with sick or dead birds or animals. Keep pets away from dead animals. Always cook poultry, eggs, and animal products thoroughly. Avoid raw or unpasteurized dairy products from infected animals. Farm workers should consider seasonal flu vaccines to lower risks of co-infection. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Gaetz ethics report to be released before Christmas: Sources	(NewsNation) — A long-awaited ethics report into former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz will be released before Christmas, sources have confirmed to NewsNation. A House committee considering the report’s release has not announced a timeline for when the report will be released. However, sources told NewsNation that the committee has already voted to release the report in the next week. In response, Gaetz wrote on X, 'My 30’s were an era of working very hard - and playing hard too. It’s embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.' Most Republicans have argued that any congressional probe into Gaetz ended when he resigned from the House. Speaker Mike Johnson also requested that the committee not publish its report, saying it would be a terrible precedent to set. While ethics reports have previously been released after a member’s resignation, it is extremely rare. Shortly before the votes took place, Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., who introduced one of the bills to force the release, said that if Republicans reject the release, they will have 'succeeded in sweeping credible allegations of sexual misconduct under the rug.' Gaetz has repeatedly denied the claims. This is a developing story. Refresh for updates.

Here's what made the cut in Congress’ 1,500-page government fundi...	Congress on Tuesday rolled out its last major funding deal of the year and is expected to move quickly to try to pass it ahead of a Friday government shutdown deadline. The bill, which is more than 1,500 pages, would keep the government funded at current levels through March 14, buying time for the incoming Congress to finish its funding work for fiscal 2025. It also includes a number of add-ons, including more than $100 billion in disaster and emergency funding, a health care-related package, and an extension of the farm bill. Below are just some of the highlights from the package: Disaster assistance FILE - A tattered American flag flaps outside a home with furniture and household items damaged by Hurricane Helene piled outside along the street awaiting pickup ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Milton in Holmes Beach on Anna Maria Island, Fla., Oct. 8, 2024. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File) Lawmakers agreed to tack on roughly $100 billion in disaster aid as members on both sides of the aisle have dialed up pressure on leaders for relief following hurricanes Helene and Milton. That includes nearly $30 billion in funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as officials have sounded alarm over the agency’s Disaster Relief Fund in recent months. It also includes disaster relief for farmers, and $4 million for the Office of Inspector General for oversight. There’s also about $20 billion for disaster assistance to farmers and producers that falls under dollars for the Department of Agriculture, roughly $1 billion for the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, and more than $800 million for the Emergency Conservation Program, as outlined in a breakdown of the disaster relief portion of the package. More than $10 billion in funding would also go toward the departments of Interior, Agriculture Forest Service and the Environmental Protection Agency for costs incurred by disasters in 2024 and in recent years. The Department of Housing and Urban Development would also receive $12 billion for Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery, and negotiators say more than $3 billion would go to the Defense Department for repair from extreme weather events for military programs. The Defense Department would also receive about $2 billion in funds partly for construction on Guam following Typhoon Mawar. PBM reforms, health extenders Prescription pills are shown Wednesday, Nov. 10, 2021 in Washington. Medicare enrollees who take expensive medicines could save thousands of dollars a year under the Democrats’ sweeping social agenda bill, but those benefits would build gradually, starting in a couple of years with a check on price increases and limits on insulin costs. A cap on out-of-pocket costs would follow in 2024, and a year later patients will begin to see lower prices negotiated by Medicare. (AP Photo) Lawmakers agreed to attach an expansive health care package to the legislation. The health portion contains reforms to the pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) industry, extensions of Medicare telehealth flexibilities, reauthorizations of legislation to prevent pandemics and address the opioid crisis, payments to community health centers and other policies. The PBM changes have been a bipartisan priority for years but until now never made it to the finish. PBMs negotiate discounted drug prices for insurers and employers. The measures include a ban on linking PBM compensation to a drug’s Medicare price. Lawmakers and PBM critics say higher drug prices lead to higher fees to PBMs; the higher the price of a covered drug, the steeper the potential discount, some of which PBMs keep as profit. So there’s an incentive for PBMs to steer patients to the highest cost drugs. Critics have long argued PBMs operate essentially in the shadows, and the funding bill includes new reporting requirements to increase transparency, including requiring PBMs to disclose the cost and reimbursement of drugs and any fees or discounts involved. The PBM changes will be used to help pay for some of the other health provisions. Farm bill extension Farmers of the Voznesenka-Agro farm harvest with their combine in a wheat field not far from Melitopol, south Ukraine, July 15, 2022. The package includes another one-year extension of the 2018 farm bill after Congress also failed to pass a longer extension last year, as well as an additional $10 billion in economic assistance for farmers. Lawmakers said some of the assistance for farmers had emerged as a key sticking point as funding talks ramped up in the past week. Some Republicans threatened to vote against the stopgap measure if it did not include economic assistance for farmers and ranchers. Key bridge funding Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed in the early morning hours of March 26 after a container ship called the Dali lost power and smashed into it. Democrats have also lauded a section of the bill they say would cover replacement costs for the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. 'With the inclusion in the Continuing Resolution of our Baltimore BRIDGE Relief Act, Congress is now committed to covering the full cost of replacing the bridge. This will allow the bridge it to be built as quickly as possible,' Maryland Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen said in a joint statement Tuesday. 'Our provision also ensures that the federal taxpayers will be reimbursed through proceeds from insurance payments and litigation taken on by the Department of Justice, the Maryland Attorney General and others.' There’s also $8 billion in funding for federal highway and roads disaster relief that falls under the Transportation Department.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Another line item in the stopgap would also transfer administrative jurisdiction over the RFK Memorial Stadium Campus to the District of Columbia in a move that could lead to the return of the Washington Commanders to the nation’s capital. House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.), who led a legislative effort along with Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), expressed excitement about language getting tucked into the stopgap to make the move earlier Tuesday. If it passes, the legislation unveiled Tuesday would direct the Interior secretary to transfer administrative jurisdiction to the District, allowing it to use the campus for stadium redevelopment and other purposes. 'We figured out a way to make this work, to be able to attract the Commanders back to Washington. It’s a win-win for Washington,' Comer told The Hill, adding he and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) have 'been in constant communication for months' as part of the ongoing effort. Here's some of what was not included: Biden’s Ukraine ask File - President Joe Biden speaks about his administrations economic playbook and the future of the American economy at the Brookings Institution in Washington, Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) The Biden administration’s request for $24 billion in funding related to Ukraine does not make an appearance, after Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) rejected the request for further assistance earlier this month. 'I’m not planning to do that,' Johnson said at the time. He also said Trump’s election would 'change the dynamic of the Russian war on Ukraine' and that lawmakers would 'wait and take the new commander in chief’s direction on all that.' Offsets Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) is seen following a joint meeting of Congress to hear Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on April 11, 2024. The designated emergency and disaster funding tacked onto the continuing resolution clocks in at about $110 billion – but without the offsets some Republicans had hoped for. 'I’m always happy to look at any offsets we have and that we can pass, and so far, we haven’t been able to get something to get the votes for them,' House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) told The Hill on Tuesday when asked about past discussions around offsets. Still, the lack of offsets is sure to upset conservatives who have called for any additional funding to be offset with savings elsewhere. RECA deal Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) speaks to reporters as he leaves the Capitol following a vote on Thursday, December 12, 2024. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) also called out Johnson in a post on social media shortly after the package’s release for the absence of a deal on the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. Hawley wrote that Johnson 'personally killed a bipartisan, bicameral expansion + spending cap RECA deal.' 'It was him alone. BUT he’s willing to spend BILLIONS on Ukraine and foreign wars and every pork barrel project known to man,' he added. The Hill has reached out to Johnson’s office for comment. Congressional pay freeze The legislation could also end a years-long freeze on cost of living adjustments for lawmakers. The news was first reported by the Bloomberg Government. Lawmakers on both sides have come out for and against the push over the years. President-elect Trump criticized the push in larger statement opposing the package on Wednesday, writing on Truth Social that 'this is not a good time for Congress to be asking for pay increases.' 'This bill would also give Congress a pay increase while many Americans are struggling this Christmas,' he also said in a statement. However, supporters have raised questions of fairness over the matter. 'I think that if you're going to have people serve here, and look, the most money I've ever made my lifetime has been in this body, but it's also the most expensive place I've ever lived in my lifetime,' outgoing Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) told The Hill on Wednesday. 'So, you've got to make sure that the wages are commensurate, and if you don't, you're going to end up with people that are uber rich. That's the only people are going to be able to afford to do this. So, I don't have a problem.' Nathaniel Weixel contributed.

Doomscrolling among teens leads to growing brain rot concerns	(NewsNation) — The amount of time teens spend on their phones and tablets, excessively scrolling through social media posts, is likely diminishing their brain activity and creating health concerns. The act of excessively soaking in negative news or social media posts, known as 'doomscrolling' has led to growing amounts of brain rot over the past year, experts found. Oxford University Press selected 'brain rot' as its word of the year for 2024. Researchers found that between 2023 and 2024, the times 'brain rot' was used in conversation increased by 230%. Brain rot is defined as 'the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state' as a result of over-consumption of online content, Oxford University Press wrote this month in announcing its annual Word of the Year honor. Republicans butt heads on daylight saving time after Trump directive In addition to popular online platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, researchers also included artificial tools such as ChatGPT as a source of brain rot. The term 'brain rot' dates back to 1854 when author Henry David Thoreau used the word in his book 'Walden' when he criticized society’s tendency to devalue complex ideas. Oxford University Press experts found that 'brain rot' has increased because of the impact of teens and other online users consuming excessive amounts of 'low-quality online content.', especially on social media. Media psychologist Dr. Don Grant told NewsNation that social media engineers are tapping into the psychological flaw in the limbic system that causes humans to seek intermittent rewards. He described doomscrolling as a form of a digital slot machine that humans feed off of. Grant, the national adviser of healthy device management at Newport Healthcare in Los Angeles, said one of his major concerns is how brain rot is affecting imagination and education. 'We don’t have to imagine anything anymore,' Grant told VICE. 'We pick up our devices every time. I’m worried about memory. I’m worried about education.' In Australia, social media usage has been banned for children under the age of 16 over health concerns connected to too much time being spent online. 'There’s a direct correlation between the rising anxiety, depression, eating disorders, self-harm and suicide among teenagers and the introduction of social media into their world,' Greg Attwells, the director of 36 Months Movement, told NewsNation. Other experts warn that concerns over brain rot only continue to grow. The more teens and others spend on screens, the more they struggle with things like attention span, VICE reported. 'They feel brain foggy, they (have) less concentration,' Dr. Kyra Bobinet, told Fox News. 'They can’t do deep work. And then there’s also this epidemic of loneliness that has been kind of sitting on the heels of this, because we can’t really focus on anything, including relationship-building.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/doomscrolling-among-teens-leads-to-growing-brain-rot-concerns/	2024-12-18T07:11:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2021/11/GettyImages-671711967.jpg?w=724
Lawmakers want to see legislation to better monitor drones	(NewsNation) — The House Intelligence Committee had a classified briefing on Capitol Hill Tuesday over the drone sightings in New Jersey and across the eastern United States, but lawmakers were left with more questions than answers. Former FAA official: Don’t shoot down suspected drones Several lawmakers told NewsNation they believe there needs to be new legislation to better monitor drones in U.S. airspace, as well as to decide what can be flown there. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is pushing for a bill to give local authorities more power to respond to and track drones as well. 'We're actually reasonably good, but we can be better about monitoring restricted airspace,' Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn.,said after Tuesday's briefing. Intelligence officials and FBI officials say there's no threat in our night skies. Federal authorities said Monday evening that sightings have been identified as legal commercial drones, hobbyist drones, law enforcement drones, as manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars. Speaking to reporters Tuesday night as he headed to Deleware, President Joe Biden said officials are 'following this closely, but so far, no sense of danger.' 'Nothing nefarious apparently, but they're checking it all out,' he said. Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., echoed these sentiments. 'I think the FBI, the intelligence community, is taking this very seriously, is looking at every report, and to date, there's no evidence that there's anything nefarious going on,' Bera said. Michael Melham, the mayor of Belleville, New Jersey floated the idea that the drones might be connected to radioactive material in an interview with 'Good Day New York.' He reiterated these claims on 'Morning in America' Wednesday. Earlier this month, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported radioactive material contained in medical equipment used for cancer scans was lost in transit. On Dec. 3, an an Eckert &amp; Ziegler model HEGL-0132 device was sent for disposal from Nazha Cancer Center in Newfield New Jersey. However, the shipping container it was in arrived at its destination 'damaged and empty,' according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 'We know we have drones flying in a grid-like pattern. In my opinion, they're looking for something,' Melham said on 'Good Day New York.' 'What might they be looking for? Maybe that's radioactive material.' The Department of Energy and other officials told ABC News that Melham's theory has been disproven. In addition, a doctor at the Nazha Cancer Center said to ABC that the missing material was found and disposed of properly. Jared McColloch disappeared during a last-minute road trip Dr. James Dalzell told ABC the device was shipped by Fed-Ex, which temporarily misplaced it. The equipment was found later and sent to the manufacturer, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said. According to the NJDEP, drones were not used to locate the radioactive material, ABC wrote. Former CIA operations officer Laura Ballman said on 'Morning in America' that she has seen '0 evidence' that the drones are related to nuclear material. 'I would caution the public to be extremely skeptical of those kinds of theories,' Ballman said in an interview with NewsNation's Markie Martin. Melham said on NewsNation Wednesday that he wasn't the one who brought up the radioactive material during the 'Good Day New York' interview.

Murdered Kansas moms: Testimony leads to 'eruption,' producer say...	(NewsNation) — A preliminary hearing was waived and two plea deals were announced Tuesday in the case of murdered Kansas mothers Veronica Butler, 27, and Jilian Kelley, 39. Butler and Kelley were murdered earlier this year after they traveled from Hugoton, Kansas, to pick up Butler’s children in Oklahoma. Their bodies were found buried in a freezer in April, and an autopsy revealed that both women had been stabbed to death. Police have been investigating their deaths and charged Tifany Adams, 54; Tad Cullum, 43; Cora Twombly, 44; Cole Twombly, 50, and Paul Grice, 31, with kidnapping and first-degree murder. Luigi Mangione indicted on first-degree murder charge Adams, Cullum, and Twombly went into the Texas County Courthouse on Tuesday for their preliminary hearings, NewsNation Kansas affiliate KSNW reported. The other two suspects in the case, Twombly and Grice, previously waived their right to a preliminary hearing. The district attorney filed a motion to have them testify at the preliminary hearings. Their testimony revealed details about what led up to the murders of Butler and Kelley. Adams reportedly showed up, admitted guilt and has waived her right to a preliminary hearing and speedy trial. She is due back in court April 16. Kansas moms killings: What we know Senior NewsNation producer Allison Weiner said Grice's testimony was like nothing she'd ever seen before in court. 'It caused an eruption in court,' Weiner said on 'Banfield.' 'Paul Grice was on the stand, and he starts talking about how he actually murdered Veronica Butler. ... He said that the light came out of her eyes, and he fell to the ground. And he said Grandma Tifany (Adams) was walking around in a circle laughing.' She said the whole courtroom was 'sobbing' and that it got so loud that the judge stopped the proceedings.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/banfield/murdered-kansas-moms-testimony-eruptions/	2024-12-17T21:56:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/snapshot-2024-04-12T171412.320.jpg?w=900
Luigi Mangione murder terrorism charge 'risky': Former prosecutor	(NewsNation) — Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani warns that the terrorism and first-degree murder charges against UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect Luigi Mangione are 'a risky move' that could complicate the prosecution. A grand jury indicted Mangione on Monday on first-degree murder and terrorism charges, a case that has sparked widespread public attention and debate. 'I understand why Bragg's office did this, but now, it raises the question as to why Mangione did this,' Rahmani said on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' 'It raises the element of why, and you have to get into Mangione's intent and his history.' Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting Mangione, 26, is accused of shooting Thompson on Dec. 4 with a 3D-printed ghost gun. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged Mangione with one count of first-degree murder, two counts of second-degree murder and weapons- and forgery-related offenses. The charges include a terrorism count, which Rahmani noted requires proving 'intent to intimidate the public or influence government policy.' This classification could increase the potential prison sentence from 15 years to 20 to 25 years without parole. The case has sparked a national conversation about health care industry practices. On social media in particular, some users gloated about the killing, a reaction they framed as rooted in their enmity for the health insurance industry. 'I have never, ever seen an accused murderer with this much sympathy and support on traditional and social media,' Rahmani said, warning that this could potentially lead to a jury nullification risk. 'You have to get 12 out of 12 jurors unanimously to convict, and this case presents a very real possibility of a holdout juror, a stealth juror that tries to get on this panel to send a message to executives of the health care industry,' Rahmani said. Health insurance ‘delay tactic’ is too common: Former Cigna executive New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch condemned what she called a 'shocking and appalling celebration of cold-blooded murder.' Mangione was captured in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after a five-day search and is currently fighting extradition. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday that could return him to New York City. The defendant, described as coming from a wealthy background, has garnered a surprising level of public support, which Rahmani suggests might stem from his perceived image as an attractive, intelligent and now-famous individual. His defense attorney, Karen Friedman, is expected to challenge the extradition, though Rahmani noted that such challenges typically only verify the defendant's identity. 'She's going to focus her attention on those New York charges,' Rahmani said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangione-murder-terrorism-charge-risky/	2024-12-17T15:41:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/snapshot_12f47e.jpg?w=900
Luigi Mangione indicted on first-degree murder charge	(NewsNation) — Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced Luigi Mangione is now being indicted on one count of first-degree murder in the furtherance of terrorism in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione was previously indicted on second-degree murder charges and still faces two counts of second-degree murder, one for killing in an act of terrorism. Thompson was shot outside a hotel in Manhattan as he arrived for an investor meeting. Police described the attack as targeted, and bullet casings had the words 'deny,' 'delay' and 'depose' carved onto them. Nima Momeni found guilty in Cash App CEO’s death Authorities began a search, releasing surveillance photos of a person of interest from locations around New York. Mangione was eventually arrested at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania. He is facing firearms charges in that state as well as the murder charges in New York. In a press conference, authorities called the attack 'brazen' and said the shooting was designed to invoke terror. Investigators also condemned popular support for Mangione from Americans who have expressed positive views of the shooting on social media while sharing stories of health insurance claim denials and the impact those have had on their lives. In response to a question from a reporter, one official confirmed that police had reached out to Mangione's mother, who had said the shooting was something she 'could see' him doing.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangione-indicted-first-degree-murder/	2024-12-17T12:35:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24345709541836.jpg?w=900
Nima Momeni found guilty in CashApp CEO's death	(NewsNation) — Nima Momeni was found guilty of second-degree murder by a jury in the high-profile trial of the tech consultant who was charged in the stabbing death of CashApp founder Bob Lee in 2023. A jury reached a verdict in the case on Monday after deliberating for seven days before agreeing on a unanimous decision, the Associated Press reported on Monday night. The verdict was not read until Tuesday morning so jurors, the judge, Momeni, Lee’s family, Momeni’s supporters, defense attorneys, prosecutors, and reporters could all gather in the courtroom. The only family member present at the courthouse Monday afternoon was Momeni’s mother, who immediately began sending text messages on her cellphone. Wisconsin school shooting: Police investigating shooter’s motive In California, a second-degree murder conviction carries a 15-year sentence. Sentencing is expected to be handed down in about six weeks. Emotions inside the courtroom were varied after the verdict was read. Momeni's family was said to be crying while the defendant showed litle emotion. Jury deliberations began earlier this month after prosecutors concluded during their closing argument that Momeni planned the 2023 attack after hearing that the tech mogul had introduced his younger sister to a drug dealer who she says gave her GHB and other drugs and then sexually assaulted her at his apartment. Prosecutors maintain that Momeni lured Lee to an isolated location near the Bay Bridge and stabbed him three times with a knife from his sister’s kitchen. Defense attorneys, however, said that Lee was on a multi-day cocaine and alcohol bender and attacked Momeni with a knife over a bad joke. John Kirby’s drone statement ‘very misleading’: New Jersey rep. The defense argued that Momeni acted in self-defense. Momeni testified during the trial that Lee walked away from the incident and showed no signs of injury.

Surveillance footage shows the two men leaving Momeni’s sister’s apartment around 2 a.m. on the day of the incident and getting into Momeni’s car. Other footage shows the two men getting out of the BMW in the area where the stabbing took place. Lee was found detected around 2:30 a.m. in downtown San Francisco, dripping in blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital. The knife used in the attack was described as a paring knife with a 4-inch blade and had Momeni’s DNA on the handle and Lee’s DNA on the blade, prosecutors said. Defense attorneys said that the DNA evidence was not definitive and that the handle of the knife should have included the DNA of both men. The Associated Press reported that testimony included the fact that Lee and Momeni’s sister, Khazar Momeni, had been doing drugs and drinking at the apartment belonging to a drug dealer that Lee knew. The defense showed a video of Lee during its closing arguments.

DENVER (KDVR) — Fourteen people were detained by Aurora police following a reported armed home invasion at the troubled apartment complex, the Edge at Lowry. The Aurora Police Department posted on X that just before 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, officers responded to calls about an armed home invasion, a stabbing and kidnapping at an apartment in the 1200 block of Dallas Street. According to preliminary reports, investigators said several suspects entered an apartment unit that had two people inside. The suspects then reportedly moved the victims to another apartment on the property where police said they were threatened and bound. An adult man sustained a non-life-threatening stab wound. Police said the victims were eventually released by the suspects and called 911. Aurora police said they are still in the very early stages of the investigation and will provide more information as it becomes available. At this time, police said it's unclear if the suspects are connected to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. FOX31 has a crew on the way to learn more. Apartment complex known for its troubled past The Edge at Lowry has been deemed a troubled apartment complex after a viral video of a group of armed men surfaced in August. The owners of the video said it was taken shortly before a shootout at the complex that left one person seriously injured. Several vehicles were also damaged by gunfire. Tenants of troubled Aurora apartment complex worry about looming closure The apartment became a national topic when President-elect Donald Trump discussed the video during his presidential campaign. He visited Aurora in October and displayed enlarged mugshots showing the men identified in the video. The apartment is now set to close after the owner reached an agreement with the city. Proceedings will continue in January and if the buildings close the city will give at least 30 days’ notice to current residents lawfully staying at the property.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/14-detained-following-reported-armed-home-invasion-at-troubled-aurora-apartment/	2024-12-17T07:48:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Use_Descriptive_File_Name-2024-12-17T075206.220.jpg?w=900
Wisconsin school shooting: Residents 'eager' to know what happene...	(NewsNation) — Residents in Madison, Wisconsin, continue to wrestle with Monday’s shooting at Abundant Life Christian School, where a 15-year-old student opened fire and killed two people while injuring six others. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes told NewsNation that people continue to struggle with how another school shooting took place in the U.S. and how future tragedies can be prevented. 'Our community is really trying to grapple with this,' Barnes said. Madison school shooting: Police investigating shooter’s motive Two students who sustained non-life-threatening injuries were released from the hospital on Monday night, Barnes said. Meanwhile, the investigation continues into the shooting in which Natalie Rupnow, who went by the name Samantha, opened fire at the non-denominational Christian school. Rupnow was pronounced dead in transport to a hospital, while one teacher and one teenager were declared dead at the scene. Barnes said Rupnow’s family is cooperating with the police and that investigators spoke at length with Rupnow’s father on Monday night. Barnes said Rupnow was not on police radar but said in many cases, information about suspects involved in school shootings comes to light after the fact. Police plan to hold a news conference on Tuesday afternoon to discuss new details in their investigation, including about items that were taken from the family’s home Monday night. Barnes said that the search was done voluntarily and that investigators did not need a search warrant. Barnes said police also hope to soon verify an online document that was circulating that could speak to the shooter’s motive. The chief said that other documents were taken from the home on Monday that could provide clues. 'We want to make sure that before we put any information out that certainly we are as accurate as we possibly can knowing that things may change,' Barnes told NewsNation. 'But we also want to make sure that if this document is being circulated, that people know about it.' He added: 'We have to do everything in our power to prevent these (shootings) from happening again, again and again in our country.' Madison police are working with the ATF to trace where the handgun used in Monday’s shooting came from, Barnes said. Police are trying to determine if the gun was in the home or if the weapon was given to Rupnow by another person. 'We don’t know,' Barnes said about the gun’s origin, adding, 'Everyone is eager to know why this happened and we may never know.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/wisconsin-school-shooting-residents-what-happened/	2024-12-17T06:56:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24351656962051.jpg?w=900
Rex Heurermann case: 'Significant update' coming in Gilgo Beach k...	(NewsNation) — New York prosecutors say they plan to announce a 'significant update' in the Gilgo Beach killings case Tuesday, following a court appearance by suspect Rex Heuermann. Heuermann is charged with killing six women whose remains were found on Long Island. He's pleaded not guilty. The Suffolk County District Attorney's Office will hold a news conference Tuesday morning following Heuerman's court appearance, be has not provided much information on what they plan to address. Investigators are still looking into the deaths of several other people whose remains were discovered in the area. Timeline: Rex Heuermann charged with Gilgo Beach Four deaths Rex Heuermann could be a suspect in other homicides District Attorney Ray Tierney has previously indicated that Heuermann is a suspect in the death of Valerie Mack, whose remains were found in 2000. In addition to Mack, prosecutors are also looking into the death of Karen Vergata, whose remains were first discovered in 1996 and finally identified in 2022 after a new DNA analysis. In September, authorities released new renderings of an unidentified victim who was found in 2011. Officials said the victim, who for years they had identified as male, may have presented outwardly as female and died in 2006. Seven identified Gilgo Beach victims.

The women were killed at another location and their bodies were transported to Gilgo Beach, about 64 km (40 miles) east of New York City, Suffolk county, New York police said. The bodies were discovered in early December. 'All of the women were escorts, who were self-employed and used Craig's List and other sites to arrange meetings with clients,' said a police spokesperson, reading from a statement issued by Police Commissioner Richard Dormer.

(James Carbone/Newsday via AP, Pool) This will be Heuermann's first court appearance since October. The government has frozen assets from the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office as part of a separate investigation involving the previous administration. The probe into a former district attorney has tied up an estimated $13 million and significantly slowed the movement of Heuermann’s case, court officials said. Background of Gilgo Beach investigation Heuermann is charged with murder in connection with the deaths of six women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Costello, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla. He was initially charged with murder in the deaths of the first four women, and prosecutors later charged him in the deaths of Taylor and Costilla. Gilgo Beach task force seeks information about ‘Asian Doe’ victim Police spent the past 14 years investigating the deaths of at least 10 people — most of whom were sex workers — whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway near Gilgo Beach on Long Island. Heuermann lived across the bay from where officials discovered the bodies. He pleaded not guilty to all charges in June. He was initially charged in the deaths of three women in 2023 and was subsequently charged in three more earlier this year. In a court filing for the most recent charges, prosecutors said they had recovered a file on a hard drive in Heuermann’s basement that he used to 'methodically blueprint' his killings — including checklists with tasks to tick off before, during and afterward, as well as lessons for 'next time.' Where does Rex Heuermann’s case stand now? The district attorney’s office has turned over 99.9% of the electronic data extracted from the 400 devices investigators recovered from Heuermann’s home — about 120 terabytes of information. Heuermann’s attorney, Michael Brown, said he plans to seek separate trials for the fifth and sixth victims. Brown also announced plans to ask for a change of venue, joking that 'Mars' is the only place the case might receive a fair trial because of extensive news media coverage.

Suspected UFO in Connecticut: Witness to 2022 sighting speaks out	(NewsNation) —Something unexplained is happening over a reservoir in Connecticut. On the back deck of a community center in Fairfield County, a woman named Diane says she noticed a light in the sky, potentially an unidentified aerial phenomenon, during what was otherwise a routine shift in April 2022.

Judge rules Trump's conviction withstands Supreme Court immunity ...	A New York judge upheld a jury’s verdict that made President-elect Trump a felon, ruling the conviction in the hush money case can withstand the Supreme Court’s new test for presidential immunity. Judge Juan Merchan’s decision comes on the heels of Trump’s presidential election victory against Vice President Harris, when voters chose to catapult him back to the White House despite his years of legal peril. The judge has not yet ruled on Trump’s efforts to toss the case entirely now that he is president-elect. Trump’s attorneys contended that New York prosecutors introduced evidence during his seven-week trial that was protected by the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity doctrine. Among other things, the challenged evidence included testimony from Trump White House aides, tweets Trump issued while in office and his government ethics form. The judge ruled Trump failed to preserve some of his immunity objections by not raising them earlier, but regardless, none of the evidence was protected. 'The evidence related to the preserved claims relate entirely to unofficial conduct and thus, receive no immunity protections; and as to the claims that were unpreserved, this Court finds in the alternative, that when considered on the merits, they too are denied because they relate entirely to unofficial conduct,' Merchan wrote in his ruling. After the trial, the high court held that former presidents enjoy absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for exercising core constitutional powers and at least presumptive immunity for other official acts. Unofficial conduct can be prosecuted, but the jury cannot question the motivation behind a presidential decision, the court said. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) urged the judge to reject Trump’s arguments, arguing that no evidence placed before the jury was protected, and even if it was, it paled in comparison to 'other overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt.' Merchan agreed, writing that even if immunity did extend to the evidence in question, he 'would still find that the People's use of these acts as evidence of the decidedly personal acts of falsifying business records poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the Executive Branch, a conclusion amply supported by non-motive-related evidence.' Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records tied to a $130,000 hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election to conceal an affair, which he denies. Prosecutors with the district attorney’s office portrayed the scheme as an effort to unlawfully influence the election’s outcome. The New York hush money case was the first-ever criminal prosecution of a former president, and the only one to have reached trial. Trump has separately argued that his White House victory compels the dismissal of the jury’s verdict and the case in its entirety. Bragg has pushed back, instead laying out alternatives like freezing the proceedings during Trump’s term. The judge has yet to rule on that matter. 'Today’s decision by deeply conflicted, acting Justice Merchan in the Manhattan DA Witch Hunt is a direct violation of the Supreme Court’s decision on immunity, and other longstanding jurisprudence,' Steven Cheung, Trump’s spokesperson and incoming White House communications director, said in a statement. Bragg’s office declined to comment on the ruling. In a separate letter, Merchan revealed that Trump also sent a Dec. 3 letter alleging juror misconduct. The judge provided sparse details but indicated the issue would be made public with redactions. Trump’s other criminal proceedings have fared worse following his presidential win. Special counsel Jack Smith dismissed all charges against Trump in his federal election subversion and classified documents cases, while the president-elect's Georgia criminal case is paused indefinitely as an appeals court weighs a pretrial defense challenge. Trump’s lawyers have pushed to end that case, too.

The motive behind the attack is not known at the time of writing. 'This is a terrible thing, and it should not be happening,' Govindarajan said. Teacher, student killed; 6 hurt in Madison school shooting 'I think it has become normalized in our society, and it really should not be because this is devastating to see,' he continued. Police said the shooting was confined to one area, though it is not clear if it was a classroom or hallway. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes confirmed a handgun was used in the shooting. 'I am frustrated with how slow progress has been happening,' Govindarajan added. 'I think it is going to be the younger folks slowly getting into politics that will make the change happen here in Madison.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/madison-school-shooting-wisconsin-councilman/	2024-12-16T14:20:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Abundant-Life-Christian-School.png?w=900
Madison shooting 'should not be happening': Ex-Sandy Hook cop	(NewsNation) — More than 12 years on from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, a former police captain had hoped he would no longer have to discuss the deaths of children from a school shooting. Christopher Vanghele, Newtown's police former captain during the Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut, joined 'NewsNation Now' to discuss the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, where three people died. Madison police said the three were a teacher, a teenage student and the teenage suspect. Two other students are currently hospitalized with life-threatening injuries. 'You hope that it doesn't happen again ... but unfortunately, that's not the reality,' Vanghele said. Live: Teacher, student killed; 6 hurt in Madison school shooting 'Between [Sandy Hook] and now, we've had hundreds of school shootings, and once again, a community has a great loss,' he continued. The K-12 school has roughly 300 students on a 28-acre campus with close to 60 staff members. This was the final week of school before Christmas break. 'It should not be happening at a place where kids are supposed to take refuge,' Vanghele added. 'So right now, my hearts go out our house go out to the families, to the people that are affected, and, of course, to the law enforcement officers that also have to deal with what they've seen today for the rest of their careers and the rest of their lives.' Officials encourage anyone who needs mental health support due to the shooting or coverage to reach out to 988 via phone or text to be connected to resources.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/gun-violence/madison-shooting-sandy-hook-cop/	2024-12-16T14:09:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24351706697450.jpg?w=900

Luigi Mangione's New York attorney married to Diddy lawyer	(NewsNation) — The New York attorney for Luigi Mangione, the man accused in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is not the only person in her intermediate family linked to a high-profile client. Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who has been retained to represent Mangione on second-degree murder charges, is married to Marc Agnifilo, the attorney for Sean 'Diddy' Combs, according to multiple media reports. Combs, the disgraced hip-hop mogul, faces sex trafficking and racketeering charges. Friedman Agnifilo served as the Manhattan chief assistant district attorney between 2014 and 2021. She worked previously in private practice and served as general counsel on criminal justice policy for New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s office between 2006 and 2010. The New York Post reported Friedman Agnifilo joined her husband's firm, Agnifilo Intrater, in 2021. 2 teens killed, 4 injured in shooting at makeshift club in Houston Friedman Agnifilo told the New York Daily News that she does not plan to issue any comment at this time about representing Mangione. However, she worked for CNN before she was retained by Mangione and gave an indication of how she may treat the case, Newsday reported. 'It looks like to me there might be a 'not guilty by reason of insanity' defense because the evidence is going to be so overwhelming that he did what he did,' Friedman Agnifilo said on a CNN broadcast. Mangione’s case will be the latest high-profile trial for Friedman Agnifilo, who has worked in criminal justice, litigation, and trials for three decades. In between cases, Friedman Agnifilo serves as a legal analyst for cable news networks and even as a legal advisor for the show 'Law and Order.' Three arrested for beating bank worker, robbing ATM Mangione is currently being held without bail in Pennsylvania where he faces gun and forgery offenses. He was apprehended in Altoona, Pennsylvania when a McDonald’s customer recognized him and tipped off employees. He is expected to waive extradition to New York at a hearing that is scheduled for Tuesday. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to charges he faces in Pennsylvania, including possession of an unlicensed gun, forgery and providing false identification to police. According to his profile on his firm’s website, Marc Agnifilo has won acquittals in many of the country’s most complex and difficult trials.

(Photo by ANGELA WEISS / AFP) He worked previously as a supervisor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey. He also worked previously as a Manhattan assistant district attorney. At the Agnifilo Intrater firm, Agnifilo serves as the lead trial counsel on complicated and serious criminal cases, investigations and financial regulatory matters. Before requesting bail be granted for his client, Agnfilio said that Combs was not adjusting well to a new prison diet, saying that the food 'is probably the roughest part of it.' The firm’s website said Friedman Agnifilo specializes in internal investigations relating to misconduct, discrimination and sexual assault. The New York Daily News reported that the couple was previously on opposing sides of the sexual assault case involving International Monetary Fund director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in 2011. Friedman Agnifilo was working for the Manhattan District Attorney’s office at the time, which meant she would not have to recuse herself in the matter, The New York Times reported. The New York Post reported, however, that Friedman Agnifilo was forced to recuse herself from several of her husband's cases, including one against Harvey Weinstein. 'It’s never been awkward,' Marc Agnifilo told the newspaper about being part of a two-lawyer household tied to high-profile cases. 'We’re pretty regimented about it. If she’s recused from a case, we really don’t talk about it.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangiones-new-york-attorney-married-to-diddy-lawyer/	2024-12-16T11:59:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24345709519032.jpg?w=900
What is the Project Blue Beam drone conspiracy theory?	(NewsNation) — As drones become more visible across New Jersey and New York, conspiracy theories continue to spread. Project Blue Beam is a conspiracy theory dating back to the 1990s, but some believe the current drone sightings are a sign of it coming to fruition. What is Project Blue Beam? Canadian journalist Serge Monast is credited with coming up with the theory of Project Blue Beam, wherein there is a plot to engender a dictatorial, universal government that abolishes Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Judaism and Islam) in favor of a new world order. Mystery drones: Where they have been spotted? In theory, this totalitarian state is to be achieved through staged futuristic NASA technology pretending to be proof of alien presence or attacks. Monast claimed NASA and the U.S. were collaborating to abolish Abrahamic religions to establish a 'New Age' religion with the anti-Christ as the figurehead. Who is talking about Project Blue Beam? Several prominent figures have discussed how they believe continued drone sightings and Project Blue Beam are intertwined. Actress Roseanne Barr posted on X Sunday: 'Now you see why I mention Project Blue Beam every week on my podcast....' 50 drone sightings prompt New Jersey sheriff to action Alex Jones also discussed the topic, sharing a 2021 interview with ufologist and former physician Dr. Steven Greer, in which the latter suggested a 'hoax cosmic threat' would soon be coming into effect. A fan page of influencer Charlie Kirk shared an image of a post from a Reddit 'conspiracy' thread on X, purportedly written by a '25-year radar operator for a major [government] agency' which echoed similar rhetoric to Jones. On Sunday, Jones quote-tweeted footage of drones appearing in New Jersey, describing their presence as 'part of a larger psychological warfare operation ahead of major events.' Experts' opinions on drone sightings University of Pennsylvania mechanical engineering professor Vijay Kumar told Newsweek does not believe the drones are a foreign state actor, but rather a U.S. government initiative. Multiple drones are seen over Bernardsville, N.J., Dec. 5, 2024 (Brian Glenn/TMX via AP) 'Firstly, it's not a coincidence, I think, that all these sightings have been near military bases. I'll just leave it at that,' he told the outlet. 'If I was an adversary, I would take great trouble to conceal what I was doing. So that leads me to believe that it's not a military power that's trying to attack the U.S.' East Coast drone sightings reach San Diego Director of Mason Autonomy and Robotics Center at George Mason University, Missy Cummings suggested to Newsweek they may not be drones at all. 'It is highly unlikely these are large drones as you describe, and if they are drones, they likely would be controlled by line-of-sight, so possibly from the water but probably not miles out to sea,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/what-is-project-blue-beam-drone-conspiracy/	2024-12-16T10:04:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2189936159.jpg?w=900

Mysterious drones shut down air base in Ohio	DAYTON, Ohio (WJW) – Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, was shut down for hours this weekend due to drone activity. The shutdown occurred amid reports of clusters of drone-like objects flying low in the night sky in several states, but very little information has been released about them. Some of the drones, or suspected drones, have also been flying over military installations, alarming residents in states including New Jersey and New York. Officials have attempted to reassure the public that military installations are able to detect and respond to drones, and security personnel are trained to identify them. Mystery drones: Where they have been spotted? The FBI had said last week that the drones do not belong to the U.S. military and that foreign governments are not behind the objects. This photo provided by Trisha Bushey shows the evening sky and points of light near in Lebanon Township, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. (Trisha Bushey via AP) On Sunday, officials at Wright-Patterson confirmed its airspace was closed for four hours on Friday night and early Saturday because of small unmanned aerial systems being spotted in the vicinity. The shutdown meant that no airplanes were allowed in and out of the base. Wright-Patterson's officials did not divulge the altitude at which the systems were flying, but they said they ranged in different shapes and sizes. 'Installation leadership has determined none of the incursions impacted our base, our residents, our facilities or our assets,' said Wright-Patterson Public Affairs Chief Robert Purtiman. There is growing bipartisan outrage that the federal government has not offered a clear explanation as to who is behind the confirmed drone sightings. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has asked the Department of Homeland Security to immediately deploy the Robin Radar System to get to the bottom of this. 'We’re asking The Department of Homeland Security to deploy special detection systems like the Robin, which use not a linear line of sight, but 360-degree technology that has a much better chance of detecting these drones,' said Senator Schumer. 'We're asking DHS to bring them to the New York and New Jersey area.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

The Department of Defense has confirmed sightings at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, but officials also said they have no evidence the drones are being used maliciously or are being operated by foreign governments. The lack of answers from federal officials has prompted some local law enforcement agencies to take action. Similar sightings have been reported reported in San Diego County and other parts of Southern California, Nexstar’s KTLA reports. Mysterious drones have also been spotted over Bowie, Maryland, according to videos sent to Nexstar’s WDVM by a viewer. Michael Mastronardy, the sheriff in Ocean County, New Jersey, told NewsNation that one of his deputies called 911 after spotting 50 drones over the ocean, which forced the U.S. Coast Guard to take action.

50 drone sightings prompt New Jersey sheriff to action	(NewsNation) — The mystery over drone sightings reported in New Jersey and New York continues to grow as the number of sightings reported in the northeastern United States is adding up, including at military bases and airports. As pressure grows on federal agencies like the FBI to provide answers, drone sightings have caused airspace closures. Places like Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and Stewart International Airport in New York closed its runway for an hour due to drone activity. The Department of Defense has confirmed sightings at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, but officials also say they have no evidence the drones are being used maliciously or are being operated by foreign governments. The lack of answers from federal officials has prompted some local law enforcement agencies to take action.

Mastronardy said the department contacted New Jersey state police, FBI and Coast Guard. NewsNation has spoken with various drone and aviation experts, who maintain that the objects being seen in New Jersey are airplanes.

Drones in New Jersey are 'friendly': FAA drone pilot	(NewsNation) — Amid growing concern over mysterious drone sightings across New Jersey, a leading drone expert suggests the aircraft may be part of routine military surveillance operations rather than a foreign threat. Mike Fraietta, an FAA drone pilot and founder of Gargoyle Systems, told NewsNation that most reported sightings are likely manned aircraft or authorized military tests. 'Is this a friend or foe drone? My gut says these are friendly drones,' Fraietta said Saturday on 'NewsNation Prime.' The expert pointed to confidential flight notices near McGuire Air Force Base and potential military reconnaissance missions as probable explanations for the widespread drone activity. He believes a 'failure of communication' between government agencies is fueling public panic. While dozens of witnesses have reported drone sightings since November, spanning locations from the Raritan River to coastal areas and near military installations, federal officials maintain the drones do not represent a public safety threat. Drones over New Jersey: Crisis in our skies The FBI is investigating the reports, with an official acknowledging public concern while suggesting there might be a 'slight overreaction.' The Pentagon has repeatedly stated the drones are not of foreign origin. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has written to President Joe Biden seeking answers, and local law enforcement continues to monitor the situation. Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., has personally participated in drone monitoring efforts. Some unusual reports have circulated, including claims of drones draining battery power when approached and sightings of multiple aircraft simultaneously. However, Fraietta said that many reported sightings are likely misidentified conventional aircraft. 'It very much well could be our military testing and looking at things over on on the ocean,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/drones-new-jersey-friendly-faa-drone-pilot/	2024-12-14T20:32:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/19798D6D9730D0EC812E8D4BEABBCC77.jpg?w=900
Eyewitness accounts of New Jersey drones include politicians, jou...	(NewsNation) — Drone sightings in New Jersey have become a 'nightly spectacle' for Garden State residents, including state lawmakers. Assemblyman Mike Inganamort is one of the eyewitnesses to the unexplained phenomenon that has been gaining national attention since mid-November. The conversation began after flying objects were spotted near Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. Lawmakers and residents have said they're frustrated over the federal government's lack of transparency and inability to provide answers. The FBI instead asked the public to provide them with information and to report drones they come across. The Pentagon said Wednesday there was 'no evidence these are coming from a foreign entity or the work of an adversary.' Here are some of the firsthand accounts of the drone sightings, as told to NewsNation by eyewitnesses. Drones over New Jersey: What we know so far What do the drones look like? Inganamort, whose district includes a quarter million constituents, said he and his family have seen the drones for four weeks. On Friday, as he walked into his office, he said he saw multiple hovering overhead. 'There were three drones zipping around our neighborhood and above this office building as I walked in,' Inganamort said. 'I expect to see several on my way out.' The former mayor of Chester Township isn't the only eyewitness to dozens of drones. NewsNation's investigative reporter Rich McHugh reported seeing at least 50 during an investigation with the Ocean County Sheriff's Department Thursday. 'When this story first came out a few weeks ago, as a resident of New Jersey, as a journalist, I didn't pay much credence. I thought it would turn out to be a bunch of pranksters, and this would all be over by now,' McHugh said Friday. 'The experience I had last night, however, changed the way I feel about this story completely. What I saw was more sophisticated than I ever imagined.' New Jersey drone sightings: Lawmakers press for more briefings NewsNation crews filmed some of the mystery drones in Red Bank, New Jersey, which is about 50 miles south of New York. McHugh described them as looking like u- or v-shaped, fixed-wing aircraft about 8 to 10 feet wide with colorful and white blinking lights. 'Definitely not an airplane, but what was it?' McHugh said. The Ocean County Sheriff's Department said the drones do not emit heat like regular drones, which is why they're able to evade detection -- something law enforcement hadn't experienced until now. Sheriff Michael Mastronardy told NewsNation that his officers identified 50 drones coming off the coast. He invited White House officials to come to New Jersey: 'Come see what we see.' 'If this is not our military, then we need answers,' McHugh said, also describing the objects as 'creepy' and 'moving at a different pace.' Feds not being fully transparent about drones: Ross Coulthart New Jersey lawmakers spot drones The federal government has offered little explanation, angering current and former lawmakers, some of whom have seen the drones. Former New Jersey Gov. Larry Hogan captured video of what he identified as drones over his home in Davidsonville, Maryland, 25 miles east of the nation's capital. U.S. Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., posted a firsthand video of drones in Clinton Township, New Jersey, this week. Officials say they received unconfirmed reports of drone sightings over LaGuardia Airport, in New York. The FBI said it has received more than 3,000 reports since Nov. 18, and there has been an average of 92 sightings daily across half a dozen states. Drone sightings across multiple states Reports have surfaced in eastern Pennsylvania as well. 'It's as if they migrated over,' said Dr. Katherine Ramsland, a forensic psychologist and NewsNation contributor. 'I called a couple of friends, and we were texting each other as all of us seeing them in different areas.' She, too, saw blinking lights. 'I saw one going west. It was red, red blinking lights ... another one was coming toward it from the west, going east, and then the westward one suddenly turned around and went into formation with the one going east turned green, the lights turned green, and then yellow,' Ramsland said. She said it 'couldn't possibly' have been a plane, as it was turning fast and hovering too close to be one. There wasn't any noise, she said. Scott Rouse, a NewsNation contributor who is a behavior analyst and body language expert, describes the ones he saw in Oak Ridge, Tennesee, as round with something spinning on top. He said he saw around 30 of them.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/eyewitness-accounts-of-new-jersey-drones-include-politicians-journalist/	2024-12-14T14:43:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/drones-new.jpg?w=900
Mystery drones: Where they have been spotted?	(NewsNation) — The crux of the federal probe into mysterious drone sightings in recent weeks has centered around the skies over New Jersey and New York, but the flying objects controlled by unknown operators has become a global phenomenon. In the United States, the FBI insists that the drones do not belong to the U.S. military and are also not the property of foreign governments. But as lawmakers and residents push for more government transparency and answers about what these objects are, the number of places sightings have taken place continues to grow. New Jersey drone sightings: Lawmakers press for more briefings NewsNation's Ross Coulthart will examine the perplexing case of the mysterious drones seen all over New Jersey in an hourlong special program on NewsNation at 9 p.m. ET on Dec. 14.

Mid-Atlantic region In New Jersey, two of the sightings creating the biggest buzz involved those located in sensitive areas including Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility in Morris County, located in the northeastern part of the state. President-elect Donald Trump’s Trump National Golf Club, located in Bedminster — 40 miles west of New York City — has also been the site of drone sightings, WJAR reported. Multiple drones are seen over Bernardsville, N.J., Dec. 5, 2024 (Brian Glenn/TMX via AP) Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, R-N.J., wrote in a social media post that the drones spotted in her state measured up to 6 feet in diameter and sometimes traveled with their lights off. Fantasia said that the first sightings took place Nov. 18 and have continued every night since. She said the reported sightings typically take place between 6 and 11 p.m. and reports range between four and 180 sightings per night, she said. She estimates that there are typically an average of 92 sightings per night and that conservatively, 2,500 sightings have been reported since they began. Two lawmakers representing the Jersey Shore region of the state reported that a dozen drones were spotted near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park, which are located in Ocean County. In those cases, WJAR reported the drones were seen following a U.S. Coast Guard lifeboat. A Coast Guard spokesperson told WJAR that 'multiple low-altitude aircraft' were reported near one of the Coast Guard’s boats. Russia targets Ukrainian infrastructure with a massive attack by cruise missiles and drones According to the WJAR report, drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use. However, they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations. Drone operators must be FAA-certified, the report said. New Jersey lawmakers, including U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, have expressed concern and frustration over the federal government’s lack of transparency on the issue. 'We need to know what’s going on over our skies,' Booker said, according to WJAR. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said he does not believe the drone sightings pose any threat. However, Murphy’s office announced Friday that it has contacted President Joe Biden about concerns over unmanned aircraft systems in and around New Jersey airspace. In the letter, Murphy wrote that more federal resources should be devoted to the matter since state and local law enforcement in his state are limited in dealing with unmanned aircraft systems. Another lawmaker, Sen. Andy Kim, reported seeing drones while on patrol with local law enforcement. Kim said he witnessed white, red and green lights appearing in groups of five to seven at a time. Kim wrote in a series of social media posts that he knew the lights were not associated with aircraft because the objects did not appear on the FlightAware tracker. In New York City, residents in the Bronx and Queens have reported seeing multiple drones as well as sightings being reported over LaGuardia Airport, The New York Daily News reported Friday. The New York City Emergency Management Department said in a social media post that it has not received any official reports of drone activity, but is aware of the reports of the sightings near the airport. The report indicated that the drones took off once police reported on the scene in the Bronx. Police also reported that sightings had taken place on Staten Island. In Maryland, residents in Bowie have released videos of drone sightings to local media organizations. Autumn Stasulli and her family told NewsNation affiliate DC News Now they were out looking at Christmas lights when they spotted flashing red and green lights. She said she saw between three and five drones the size of SUVs that were making loud noises. She told the station that there were 'just drones all over the place.' She added that it appeared that military jets were in pursuit of the drones and that she is concerned about where the aircraft may be coming from. In a social media post, Gov. Larry Hogan reported that he witnessed dozens of large drones Thursday night over his home in Davidsonville, which is located 25 miles outside of Washington, D.C. Hogan wrote that the drone activity lasted about 45 minutes. Midwest Residents in Northfield, Minnesota — located south of Minneapolis-St. Paul — have reported seeing mysterious flashing lights over the night sky. Deborah Wagner and her daughter told Fox 9 that the lights were hard to track. 'We started trying to follow them, but they just won’t be followed,' Wagner said, adding that the lights just seemed to disappear. Her daughter, Chrissy Grady, tried to capture video of the orbs with her cellphone, and the video showed the objects hovering before disappearing. 'Are those UFOs? Are they a government thing?' Grady asked. West Coast Similar sightings have been reported in southern California, where residents spotted seeing colored lights. Colin Rambo, who lives outside San Diego in Lemon Grove, told CBS 8 that he witnessed seeing 'a bunch of red lights floating in the sky.' Rambo told the television station that he was driving when he saw what he called a fleet of 'red glowing orbs.' Over five minutes, Rambo reported seeing at least 25 of the orbs. In Temecula, which is located in southern California’s wine country in Riverside County, residents reported seeing large drones hovering over the community. One resident said the objects were the size of a car.

Local sheriff’s officials said the drones did not belong to the department. Camp Pendleton, a Marine Corps base north of San Diego, told the station it had received several reports of drone sightings from local residents. A spokesman for the base told CBS 8 that the base did not have any drone activity planned when the sightings took place. International Unidentified drones have also been spotted over four Royal Air Force bases in England, which has prompted the British government to request military assistance, the U.S. Air Force said. Air Force officials said that 'small' drones continue to be spotted in and around the four British military installations since Nov. 20. None of the activities interrupted base operations, officials said. In a statement, the Air Force said that the objects have ranged in size and configurations and that the U.S. Air Force is working with host-nation officials and mission partners to endure base personnel. Reuters reported that drones have also been spotted at the U.S. Air Force base at Ramstein in Germany this month. Sources told Reuters that German officials have not determined who is operating the drones. They had, however, ruled out the possibility that the drones were operated by amateurs.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/mystery-drones-where-they-have-been-spotted/	2024-12-13T14:48:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/DronesNJ.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Nine days after United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson was assassinated on the streets of New York City, a new report indicates the manhunt included a crucial tip from San Francisco police. An officer in the Special Victims Unit of the San Francisco Police Department recognized Mangione in photos shared with the public on Dec. 5, days before Luigi Mangione was found. The officer tipped off the FBI, per San Francisco Chronicle. NewsNation has reached out to the San Francisco Police Department for comment. Prosecutors in Manhattan have also reportedly started presenting evidence to a grand jury in the case. NewsNation reached out to the Manhattan District Attorney's office for confirmation but due to the ongoing Grand Jury proceedings, they declined to confirm.

He was charged with forgery and possession of an instrument of a crime. Now he's facing extradition to New York, and a second-degree murder charge, among others.

Watch: Dozens of drones spotted in New Jersey	(NewsNation) — Dozens of mystery drones were spotted over New Jersey and NewsNation obtained exclusive footage. NewsNation's Rich McHugh was embedded with Ocean County Sheriff's Department to investigate the drones. After not seeing any drones, he got a call that some drones had been spotted in Monmouth County. 'I raced up to Monmouth County and pulled off in Red Bank, and sure enough I looked in the sky and saw one. I started following it into a residential area, took out my phone and started filming it,' McHugh says. 'I believe I saw over 50 of these drones. And I’ve got to say, if this is not the military, it is even more terrifying. These things look like they are fixed-wing and they have multiple lights,' he continued. 'I’m not really sure how to process what I saw last night. Both the photographer and I were kind of stunned.' FBI says it has no answers for drones seen over New Jersey McHugh has been talking with experts and law enforcement about what he saw, and the government’s response.

Drones over New Jersey: What we know so far	(NewsNation) — Mysterious drones spotted flying at night over sensitive areas in New Jersey and other parts of the Mid-Atlantic region have prompted concern from local residents, anger from lawmakers and endless speculation on social media. The drones appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio, according to a state lawmaker briefed Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security. NewsNation's Ross Coulthart will examine the perplexing case of the mysterious drones seen all over New Jersey in an hour-long special program on NewsNation at 9 p.m. ET on Dec. 14.

It’s also possible that a single drone has been reported more than once. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Breaking News Alerts Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } The worry stems partly from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster. A federal probe into the sightings continues to produce a lack of substantial answers, angering lawmakers and residents alike. The FBI has concluded the drones do not belong to the U.S. military and that foreign governments are not behind the objects. When did the drones start appearing? The drones were first spotted in northern New Jersey, in mid-November. Multiple drones are seen over Bernardsville, N.J., Dec. 5, 2024 (Brian Glenn/TMX via AP) Where have the drones been spotted? While it's unknown if there is any connection, floating lights have been reported in states throughout the country. Similar sightings are being reported in San Diego County and other parts of Southern California. FOX9 in Minnesota reports residents in Northfield have seen mysterious flashing lights in the night sky. Mysterious drones have also been spotted over Bowie, Maryland, according to videos sent to NewsNation affiliate DC News Now by a viewer. Autumn Stasulli and her family were out trying to see Christmas lights when they spotted flashing red and green lights in the sky above her Bowie home on Monday night. 'There’s a drone, they’re all over,' said Autumn Stasulli in one of the videos. FBI says it has no answers for drones seen over New Jersey Stasulli said she spotted what appeared to be three to five drones the size of SUVs in the sky emitting loud noises. NewsNation broadcasted exclusive footage of the drone sightings | Credit: Max Falvey 'I got out of my car and started filming and these drones were just all over the place. I was shocked,' said Stasulli. Stasulli said she then saw what appeared to be military jets chasing after the drones. 'This is very unsettling like I would like to know where these are coming from especially now that they’re starting to be seen in Maryland,' said Stasulli. What are lawmakers saying about the mysterious drones? NewsNation has confirmed that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Friday received a classified briefing on the drones. Lawmakers on both sides have called for the drones to be intercepted. 'We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,' U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Thursday, as concerns about the drones spread across Capitol Hill. U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., echoed those comments during an appearance on NewsNation. 'We have the capability to shoot them now, but to do it in a place where there would not be any threat to anybody on the ground,' Smith said. 'Just do it.' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, both New York Democrats, joined New Jersey Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim wrote a letter this week asking for a briefing with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security 'as soon as possible.' Concerns cited by the senators include a medevac helicopter that was allegedly prevented from transporting a seriously injured patient to get help because of the drones. Timeline of UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect’s movements The White House as well as federal authorities rejected a claim from U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., that an Iranian mothership operated the drones. While a group of New Jersey lawmakers met with state police and the Department of Homeland Security about them, some, like Republican New Jersey state Rep. Brian Bergen told NewsNation they were frustrated with the lack of answers provided. 'I walked out because it was it was worthless,' Bergen told NewsNation. 'It was the biggest amateur hour presentation I’ve ever seen about anything. It was ridiculous. There were no answers. Every question that was asked by a member of the state legislature — great questions, no answers, no resolution. They don’t know where the drones are coming from.' What have military and law enforcement said about the drones? The White House said Thursday that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully. White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said there were no reported sightings in any restricted airspace. He said the U.S. Coast Guard has not uncovered any foreign involvement from coastal vessels. 'We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus,' Kirby said, echoing statements from the Pentagon and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh has said they are not U.S. military drones. Ret. Maj. Gen. John F. Wharton, who consults with several government agencies, told NewsNation some issues need to be addressed considering where the drones are being spotted. 'I don’t think you need to engage kinetically and take these things down until you get a little more information from the government and all the other agencies,' Wharton said.

'However, I do think it is a concern that when you’re flying over critical infrastructure, dense urban environments that are important to national security, we have to be prepared and have to put the proper measures in place. It’s not going away.' Shaun Golden, the sheriff of Monmouth County, New Jersey, has urged Gov. Phil Murphy to declare a state of emergency. 'We continue to urge our governor to press the federal government to put more … resources out here,' Golden said Thursday on 'Dan Abrams Live.' 'The only way we’re going to solve this is by the federal government coming in here and doing full investigations as to what these things are, how their movements are made.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/drones-what-we-know-new-jersey/	2024-12-13T11:43:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/image-26.png?w=655
Iran has new drone ship in Persian Gulf	Iran has a new ship with the capability of launching drones, according to satellite images reviewed by Maxar Technologies that were shared with The Hill. The new drone ship, called Shahid Bagheri, is anchored offshore of the Iranian naval port of Bandar Abbas in the Persian Gulf, according to Maxar. The ship was originally a commercial container ship but was modified into a drone carrier vessel for Iran's naval forces. The Shahid Bagheri left home port in late November and is conducting its first sea trial, according to Maxar, which says the ship has a net-covered drone on deck. Accompanying the drone ship are two other vessels that appear to be similarly modified, the Shahid Mahdavi and Shahid Roudaki, according to the images. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Additional photos provided by the company detail how the ships were modified and constructed at a nearby Iranian shipyard, including the addition of a ski-jump ramp and angled flight deck that can be used to launch and recover drones. The news comes amid a flurry of drones buzzing across northern New Jersey and New York since November, including near sensitive U.S. military sites. Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.) claimed that an Iranian mothership located off the East Coast was responsible for the drones over his state. Both the Pentagon and White House have denied that any foreign entity is behind the New Jersey drone phenomenon. The Iranian drone ship in the Persian Gulf shows Tehran has the capability to launch drones, but the vessel is located thousands of miles away from the U.S. coast, well out of range of even a long-range drone. Drones have also flown near sensitive U.S. military sites across the country and even at bases housing American troops in the United Kingdom.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/iran-has-new-drone-ship-in-persian-gulf/	2024-12-13T11:41:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24347860890564-1-e1734105102589.jpg?w=900
Pelosi hospitalized in Luxembourg after sustaining injury	Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was hospitalized for evaluation in Luxembourg after sustaining an injury during a trip with a congressional delegation, her spokesperson said Friday. It remains unclear what type of injury Pelosi, 84, sustained. Her spokesperson said the California Democrat is 'currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals.' 'While traveling with a bipartisan Congressional delegation in Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation,' the spokesperson, Ian Krager, said in a statement. 'She continues to work and regrets that she is unable to attend the remainder of the CODEL engagements to honor the courage of our servicemembers during one of the greatest acts of American heroism in our nation’s history,' he added. Eighteen House lawmakers were scheduled to visit Luxembourg with the congressional delegation, according to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.). The group is set to take part in observances for the anniversary Friday and Sunday. Pelosi stepped down from Democratic leadership last year after roughly two decades at the helm of the caucus, allowing a new crop of younger lawmakers to take on the highest echelons of the group. The California Democrat, however, has remained in Congress, maintaining a schedule that includes House votes, television appearances and international trips.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/pelosi-hospitalized-in-luxembourg-after-sustaining-injury/	2024-12-13T09:00:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24288415722950-e1734107348227.jpg?w=900
Feds not being fully transparent about drones: Ross Coulthart	(NewsNation) — A federal probe into mysterious drone sightings in New Jersey and New York continues to produce a lack of substantial answers, angering lawmakers and residents alike. The FBI has concluded the drones do not belong to the U.S. military and that foreign governments are not behind the objects. Drones have been spotted on the East Coast and Southern California. But just because government agencies are not offering answers doesn’t mean they don’t have information about who could be behind the drone sightings, NewsNation special correspondent Ross Coulthart said.

Based on the FBI's conclusions, Coulthart said the list of who could be behind the mysterious objects is short. He said it could be a dissident, rogue group within the government or a private contractor that is 'doing the wrong thing.' On Thursday, John Kirby, White House national security spokesman, claimed that New Jersey residents have misidentified manned aircraft for the drones. However, because of the size of the objects residents have seen, those making the reports of the sightings continue to defend their opinions, Coulthart said. 'They want answers, and they don’t like being gaslit by the White House,' he added. In addition to New Jersey, New York and California, drones have been sighted over two Royal Air Force bases in England as well as Australia, China, Russia, and in parts of Europe, Coulthart said. Yet, Coulthart insists U.S. officials know more than they are letting on. 'Unfortunately, the government here cannot give us answers,' he said. 'They seem to be unable to provide a simple explanation to what these objects are.

New Jersey drone sightings: Lawmakers press for more briefings	(NewsNation) — Lawmakers want to have more meetings with investigators over the drones recently seen flying over New Jersey. While a group of New Jersey lawmakers met with state police and the Department of Homeland Security about them, some, like Republican New Jersey state Rep.

Drones appear to show no threat: FBI In a memo, the FBI and DHS said there's no known malicious activity happening, but the drone spotting highlights 'the insufficiency of current authorities.' 'We take seriously the threat that can be posed by unmanned aircraft systems, which is why law enforcement and other agencies continue to support New Jersey and investigate the reports,' the memo said. The Coast Guard says no reported or confirmed sightings have taken place in restricted airspace, and the White House as well as federal authorities reject a claim from U.S. Rep.

Drones should be shot down, New Jersey rep. says: 'Just do it'	(NewsNation) — U.S. Rep.

Smith is one of two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen calling on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns. New Jersey drones causing ‘growing sense of uncertainty and urgency’ 'Many law enforcement people have told me, including one chief of police, that he was skeptical. Then he saw a dozen of them,' Smith said. 'And they're in formation.' New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but it is still not known exactly what they are or who is behind them.

Suspected CEO shooter was never a UHC client: NYPD	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — The NYPD said Thursday evening the suspected UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter was never a client of the insurance company. Police believe rather that suspect Luigi Mangione targeted Brian Thompson because of the insurer’s size and influence in the industry. NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told NBC New York in an interview Thursday that investigators have uncovered evidence Luigi Mangione had prior knowledge UnitedHealthcare was holding its annual investor conference in New York City. Health insurance ‘delay tactic’ is too common: Former Cigna executive 'We have no indication that he was ever a client of United Healthcare, but he does make mention that it is the fifth largest corporation in America, which would make it the largest health care organization in America. So that’s possibly why he targeted that company,' said Kenny. UnitedHealthcare is in the top 20 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization but is not the fifth largest. It is the largest U.S. health insurer. Mangione remains jailed without bail in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested Monday after being spotted at a McDonald's in the city of Altoona, about 230 miles west of New York City. His lawyer there, Thomas Dickey, has said Mangione intends to plead not guilty. Dickey also told NewsNation he has yet to see evidence decisively linking his client to the crime. 'I don’t want people to jump to these prejudgment things because nobody would ever want that if they were accused, or one of their loved ones were accused,' Dickey said exclusively on 'CUOMO' Tuesday. Mangione is fighting attempts to extradite him back to New York so that he can face a murder charge in Thompson's killing. A hearing has been scheduled for Dec. 30.

The White House has offered little information, saying there is no evidence the drones have any connections to foreign adversaries. Steinhardt said information has been hard to come by, even for legislators. He believes that the American public deserves an answer even if the drones turn out to be American assets. Steinhardt also pushed back on dismissive responses from the government, suggesting nothing was amiss. 'It's rather simple to be dismissive and tell folks that there's nothing to see, but all you got to do is look up in the sky, and there's lots to see,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/new-jersey-mystery-drones-doug-steinhardt/	2024-12-12T14:20:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/DronesNJ.jpg?w=900
FBI not involved in Jan. 6 riots: Report	(NewsNation) — A new report from the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General found that the FBI failed to take a basic step in preparing for the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, and that no FBI agents were involved in the attack. The 88-page report concluded that no federal agents were involved in supporting the attack on the Capitol and that no undercover agents were present in the crowd. The report found that although the FBI only played a supporting role to other law enforcement agencies, it did take some steps to identify domestic terrorism subjects who planned to travel to Washington, D.C., ahead of the vote to certify the 2020 election results. New Jersey drones causing ‘growing sense of uncertainty and urgency’ However, the report noted that the FBI failed to canvass field offices ahead of the date to identify intelligence about potential threats. FBI sources told the OIG that it is common practice for the FBI to do so ahead of a large event, such as a presidential inauguration or the Super Bowl. The report noted that performing a canvass would have created a more thorough understanding of the threat landscape ahead of the Jan. 6 riots. A number of confidential FBI sources were present during the riots, the report found, some of whom did enter the Capitol. The OIG also found that there was no critical information in the FBI's possession that was not given to other law enforcement stakeholders ahead of the riots.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/fbi-not-involved-jan-6/	2024-12-12T11:10:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671bde3c3ad3b6.80963154.jpeg?w=900
Burglaries targeting professional athletes 'epidemic': Security e...	(NewsNation) — A South American transnational organized crime group is believed to be behind a string of burglaries targeting the homes of high-profile pro athletes, including Super Bowl champions Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce.

He said that pro athletes are an easy target if they are not security-conscious due to their wealth, schedules and high-profile status. 'This provides a lucrative opportunity for those who are looking to take advantage,' Skule said. The transnational crews rely on very sophisticated techniques to carry out their crimes. The organizations operate by jamming signals and security cameras, cutting alarms that are used to detect activity. Because of those methods, an additional level of security is needed to thwart the efforts, Skule said. Skule believes that due to the level of media attention being devoted to the crimes, arrests could be imminent. However, he also says that pro athletes could also become more cognizant that their homes may be targeted and will work with team security officials to better protect their homes. He said that while cases involving Burrow, Kelce, Mahomes and Milwaukee Bucks star Bobby Portis have received more attention, other burglaries are likely taking place involving other players. Skule added that many of the items stolen from athletes end up on the black market and are very easy to trace. Still, the volume of break-ins remains alarming because those allegedly involved in the break-ins do not remain in the country for long, cutting down on the time authorities have to conduct a search for suspects. 'This is becoming an epidemic,' Skule said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/pro-athletes-burglaries-epidemic-security-expert/	2024-12-12T10:51:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2188541406.jpg?w=900
New Jersey drones causing 'growing sense of uncertainty and urgen...	(NewsNation) — State and local lawmakers are calling on federal officials to be more transparent about recent sightings of drones flying over New Jersey. On Wednesday, a group of New Jersey lawmakers met with state police and the Department of Homeland Security about the matter, but some were left frustrated about the lack of answers they received. Republican New Jersey state Rep. Brian Bergen told NewsNation that meeting was 'a whole lot of nothing.' 'All they did was tell us they don't know anything that's going on,' he said. Luigi Mangione’s fellow inmates: Free him, ‘conditions suck’ Over the past few weeks, people have seen drones near an Army munitions hub, as well as near the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster. Reports also came up on Staten Island in New York and in the Philadelphia area. New Jersey state Rep. Dawn Fantasia, R, said investigators described the drones as being large and up to six feet in diameter. They operated in a coordinated manner, with lights turned off, investigators said according to Fantasia. She added that investigators do not believe the drones to be ones used by hobbyists. Federal investigation into New Jersey drones The Pentagon says it currently does not appear that a foreign enemy is behind them. U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew claimed the drones are being launched by an Iranian mothership, but Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said during a Wednesday afternoon briefing there is 'not any truth to that.' With the investigation ongoing, the sheriff in Monmouth County, New Jersey has called for the governor to declare a state of emergency and to issue an executive order banning nighttime use of recreational drones. FBI’s response to drones seen over New Jersey is ‘unacceptable’: Cuomo Sheriff Shaun Golden says at night, it can be tough for police to identify operators and possible risks including illegal surveillance and aviation hazards. Golden said Congress should pass legislation to help state and local police address the drone issue. Democrat U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ, is asking for more information from law enforcement with so many people asking questions about this. Letter to Biden administration over New Jersey drone sightings In a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, FBI Director Chris Wray and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Booker said he recognizes the need to maintain operational security amid the ongoing probes, but there is a 'growing sense of uncertainty and urgency' across the state from constituents and officials. 'We need continued transparency and vigilance as authorities investigate unauthorized drone flights across our area,' Booker said on X.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/new-jersey-drone-sightings-investigat/	2024-12-12T08:06:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/DronesNJ.jpg?w=900
Trump tells TIME he will pardon Jan. 6 rioters on day 1	(NewsNation) — Donald Trump is trading his mugshot for a cover shot. The President-elect, who will serve his second term as the first American president to be convicted of a felony, was named TIME's 2024 'Person of the Year.' Since 1927, TIME Magazine's editors have recognized an individual or group that has most influenced the world, for better or worse, during the past year. FBI Director Christopher Wray to step down Trump told TIME that on day one of his presidency, he will pardon most of the rioters accused or convicted of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. 'It's going to start in the first hour,' he said. 'Maybe the first nine minutes.' This isn't the first time Trump has said he wants to pardon them on his first day. In his first TV network interview since winning the election, Trump told NBC News earlier this week that he planned to follow through on that promise. 'We’re looking at it right now. Most likely, yeah,' Trump said to NBC's Kristen Welker in a 'Meet the Press' interview. 'Those people have suffered long and hard. And there may be some exceptions to it. I have to look.' In total, 1,572 people have been criminally charged in federal court for crimes connected to the events on Jan. 6, according to the Department of Justice. Of those, 1,251 pleaded guilty or were convicted. When asked if he would pardon those who pleaded guilty to crimes, including assaulting police officers, Trump said he would 'look at individual cases.' Kimberly Guilfoyle gets Greece as consolation prize after Donald Trump Jr. dumps her: Source 'I'm going to be acting very quickly,' he said to NBC News, claiming pardons would come the first day in office. Trump's TIME cover story was published online Thursday, the same day President Joe Biden commuted 1,500 sentences and pardoned 39 people in the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history. In his interview with TIME, Trump detailed his mass deportation plan, which he said would involve ending the 'catch-and-release' program and resuming border wall construction. He also plans to take early action on reversing Biden's executive orders and expanding oil drilling on federal land. Trump received TIME's 'Person of the Year' recognition in 2016. This year's recognition succeeds Taylor Swift, who earned the spot last year. This year's contenders included Vice President Kamala Harris, Princess Kate Middleton, Elon Musk, Yulia Navalnaya, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Jerome Powell, Joe Rogan, Claudia Sheinbaum and Mark Zuckerberg.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-time-pardon-jan-6-rioters-day-1/	2024-12-12T07:25:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24347466478861.jpg?w=900
As FBI probe continues, 'drones are not going away': Wharton	(NewsNation) — The FBI has said that it has no answers about the drones that have been spotted in the skies over New Jersey and New York in recent weeks, frustrating local lawmakers. But Retired Maj. John F. Wharton, who consults with several government agencies, says drones aren’t going anywhere. Although the U.S. military says that the drones are not its property, testing and valuation could be operated by the defense contractors in the private sector on behalf of the military, Wharton told NewsNation. 'We’re going to see (drones) in many different ways,' Wharton said. NJ governor taking unidentified drone flights ‘deadly seriously’ Wharton said that the inter-agency coordination as a federal probe continues is a good thing. If nothing else, the effort is a very good test of how a synchronized counter-drone system or an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) system could be used by the government. However, with drones flying over military bases in some cases, Wharton says some issues need to be addressed considering where the drones are being spotted. 'I don’t think you need to engage kinetically and take these things down until you get a little more information from the government and all the other agencies,' Wharton said. 'However, I do think it is a concern that when you’re flying over critical infrastructure, dense urban environments that are important to national security, we have to be prepared and have to put the proper measures in place. It’s not going away.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/fbi-probe-continues-drones-not-going-away/	2024-12-12T06:14:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24346797049881.jpg?w=900
Shell casings at UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting match gun on Mangi...	(NewsNation) — A gun on Luigi Mangione when he was arrested in Pennsylvania matches shell casings found at the scene in New York City where United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot last week, the New York Police Department says. Fingerprints from a water bottle and protein bar wrapper found near the area in Midtown Manhattan match 26-year-old Mangione, as well, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. Mangione is charged with second-degree murder in the death of Thompson, 50, who was killed just before 7 a.m. Dec. 4 in front of a Hilton Hotel, where he was walking to UnitedHealth Group’s annual investor meeting. Health insurance ‘delay tactic’ is too common: Former Cigna executive NYPD officers searched for the suspect in New York and Georgia until they arrested Mangione in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after responding to reports of a man matching authorities’ description of the suspect at a local McDonalds. Officials still have not released a motive. However, the words 'deny,' 'depose,' and 'defend' were written on the shell casings — which many have assumed is a reference to a book about the ways insurance companies reject requests for medical coverage deemed necessary by doctors. In addition, a written document found on Mangione states that he 'apologizes for any strife or traumas, but it had to be done' as 'these parasites had it coming.' Along with the document, Mangione also had what is alleged to be a 'to-do' list before the killing. Mangione is currently at the State Correctional Institution Huntingdon in Pennsylvania, but the state is pursuing a governor's warrant to transfer him to New York. The legal representation for Mangione is trying to fight this.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/shell-casings-united-healthcare-ceo-shooting-match-gun-mangione/	2024-12-12T05:18:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Luigi-mangione-brian-thompson.jpg?w=900

Luigi Mangione's fellow inmates: Free him, 'conditions suck'	(NewsNation) — NewsNation's Alex Caprariello and Ashleigh Banfield spoke exclusively with prison inmates who called for UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect Luigi Mangione to be transferred to Rikers Island in New York City. The inmates yelled from their cells during a live broadcast of 'Banfield,' describing the conditions at the State Correctional Institution Huntingdon in Pennsylvania. 'Luigi's conditions suck,' inmates shouted to NewsNation's Caprariello. 'Free Luigi.' They also said Mangione doesn’t have a television in his cell and expressed their desire for him to waive his extradition challenge. United Healthcare CEO killing: Suspect used ‘ghost gun,’ police say Mangione has a cell to himself and is kept away from other inmates. The prison menu, which inmates shouted was 'terrible,' includes fruit, grits, scrambled eggs, and 'porcupine meatballs' for lunch, a dish made from ground beef and rice. Gene Borrello, a former organized crime associate who spent 13 years behind bars, including four at Rikers, described the conditions at the New York City prison as the 'most dangerous in America.' He warns that if Mangione is transferred to Rikers, he will face harsh realities, including substandard food, unsanitary conditions, and safety concerns. 'You have to watch your back every day,' Borrello said on 'Banfield.' 'There's no structure. It's just complete chaos. ... It's nonstop stabbings and gang violence where the cops are scared to come to work. It's a place you want to avoid.' Fingerprints taken from Mangione match those found on a water bottle near the place in New York City where United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot last week. The water bottle was in an alleyway Mangione allegedly ran to after the shooting, sources told NewsNation local affiliate WPIX. Thompson, 50, was killed just before 7 a.m. Dec. 4 near a Midtown Hilton Hotel while he was walking to UnitedHealth Group’s annual investor meeting. NYPD officers searched for the gunman in New York and Georgia. On Dec. 9, police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, responded to reports of a man matching authorities’ description of the suspect at a local McDonalds. It was there that Mangione was arrested. The NYPD said Mangione matched the description authorities were searching for and that he had with him a mask, firearm, suppressor and fake New Jersey ID that connected him to the shooting. New reporting shows Mangione also had a manifesto and spiral notebook with a 'to-do' list. Mangione allegedly wrote in the manifesto he acted alone and that he 'apologizes for any strife or traumas, but it had to be done.' 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming,' the manifesto says. Luigi Mangione’s extradition hearing As he was escorted into a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday after his arrest, Mangione shouted to reporters gathered outside. 'It’s completely an injustice and an insult to the American people,' he said. During his extradition hearing Tuesday, Mangione tried to interrupt and talk with his attorney, Thomas Dickey. The state of Pennsylvania is pursuing a governor’s warrant for 26-year-old Mangione. That process could take 30 days, especially as Mangione is trying to fight it. NewsNation's Alex Caprariello, Brian Entin and The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/banfield/luigi-mangione-inmates/	2024-12-11T21:05:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/7E90C4D5CAB232E13101BDC50DF1ED63.jpg?w=900
Six-time Super Bowl champion Bill Belichick to be named UNC footb...	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (WNCN) – One of the greatest to ever work the sidelines on the gridiron is set to join the college ranks in Chapel Hill. Legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick, who led the New England Patriots to six Super Bowl titles, will be the next head football coach at the University of North Carolina, according to Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network and NFL.com. 'The deal is done,' Rapoport posted on social media around 5:30 p.m. Wednesday. The 72-year-old coach stepped away from football this year after parting ways with the Patriots following the 2023 season. CBS 17 first learned of Belichick's consideration from Inside Carolina. PREVIOUS: Bill Belichick interviewed for UNC’s vacant head football coach job, report says He’s set to replace Mack Brown, who was fired nearly two weeks ago after six years leading the Tar Heels. Under Brown’s tutelage, UNC compiled a 44-33 overall record during his second stint at the school, ending this season at 6-6. Brown, inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2018, concluded his time with the Tar Heels as the winningest coach among active FBS head coaches, accumulating a career record of 282-149 between his stints at Tulane, Texas and UNC. The 73-year-old also finished his tenure winning a program-record 113 games. UNC tight ends coach and run game coordinator Freddie Kitchens, a former head coach of the Cleveland Browns, is currently slated as the Tar Heels’ interim coach in preparation for their upcoming bowl game against UConn later this month. READ MORE: What led to UNC’s decision to fire head football coach Mack Brown? Belichick, who’s only about seven months younger than Brown, arrives at UNC during a turbulent and ever-changing landscape in college football, amid the rise of name, image and likeness (NIL) deals for student-athletes as well as free player movement through the transfer portal era. He even has slight ties to the university, dating back to when his father, Steve Belichick, spent two seasons as UNC's backfield coach between 1953 and 1955. A photo of Belichick inside Kenan Memorial Stadium as a child went viral on Monday after being shared during a media appearance on ESPN. This marks the first time Belichick has ever worked at the collegiate level, following monumental success alongside quarterback Tom Brady across most of his historic 24-year tenure with the Patriots. Since departing from New England, he's been in the running for other NFL job openings, most notably the Atlanta Falcons back in January. On Monday, the Super Bowl-winning coach appeared on 'The Pat McAfee Show,' saying he had 'a couple of good conversations' with UNC Chancellor Lee Roberts amid recent speculation of him being linked to the job opening. READ MORE: All the connections Bill Belichick has with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 'I've had the opportunity to talk to Chancellor Roberts and we’ve had a couple of good conversations,' Belichick said. 'So we’ll see how it goes.' Although he didn’t go into extensive detail about his UNC discussions, Belichick broke down the parallels between overseeing an NFL franchise and running a college program, especially now that players can profit off their athletic exploits with endorsements and revenue sharing on the horizon. 'If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,' Belichick said Monday. 'It would be a professional program: training, nutrition, scheme, coaching, techniques that would transfer to the NFL.' 'It would be an NFL program at a college level,' he added. The exact contract details regarding Belichick’s hiring are unknown at this time.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/bill-belichick-unc-football-coach/	2024-12-11T15:05:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-1789394659.jpg?w=900
Missing woman Hannah Kobayashi found safe: family	(NewsNation) — The family of missing Hawaii woman Hannah Kobayashi said in a statement she has been found safe. 'We are incredibly relieved and grateful that Hannah has been found safe. This past month has been an unimaginable ordeal for our family, and we kindly ask for privacy as we take the time to heal and process everything we have been through,' the statement said. The family has spoken to Kobayashi but has not elaborated further on her disappearance. Kobayashi was reported missing after she didn't board a connecting flight during her trip from Hawaii to New York. She was spotted in a few locations in Los Angeles before disappearing, sparking a search. Family members were sent strange texts from her phone before she cut off contact. She was seen on Los Angeles at the Grove Market and near the stadium where the LA Lakers play, accompanied by an unknown man. That man later spoke to police about his encounter with Kobayashi. Kobayashi's family initially feared she may have been trafficked. During the search, photos that appeared to show Kobayashi getting married also raised fears that she could have been a victim of a green card marriage scam. While searching for her, Kobayashi's father took his own life. Police later announced that Kobayashi intentionally missed her flight and believed she had gone to Mexico of her own accord. No further information on her whereabouts has been released. This is a developing story.

FBI Director Christopher Wray to step down	(NewsNation) — FBI Director Christopher Wray announced he is stepping down as FBI director at the end of the current administration. Wray announced his plan to leave his role at a townhall meeting for FBI employees. He said his goal is to keep the focus on the agency's mission and that stepping down is the best way for him to avoid dragging the FBI into political division. An FBI official told NewsNation the meeting was standing room only in Washington, D.C., and received a standing ovation that lasted more than a minute. 'After weeks of careful thought, I’ve decided the right thing for the Bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current Administration in January and then step down. My goal is to keep the focus on our mission — the indispensable work you’re doing on behalf of the American people every day. In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work,' he said. UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting: Suspect’s fingerprints link him to scene The move clears the way for President-elect Donald Trump to appoint a new director. Trump previously announced plans to nominate Kash Patel for the role. Wray's term as director was not set to end until 2027 but Trump has repeatedly said he would fire Wray, citing the agency's involvement in executing a search warrant for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Trump has repeatedly referred to the incident as a raid. 'When you look at where the threats are headed, it’s clear that the importance of our work — keeping Americans safe and upholding the Constitution — will not change. And what absolutely cannot, must not change is our commitment to doing the right thing, the right way, every time. Our adherence to our core values, our dedication to independence and objectivity, and our defense of the rule of law — those fundamental aspects of who we are must never change,' Wray said. 'That’s the real strength of the FBI — the importance of our mission, the quality of our people, and their dedication to service over self. It’s an unshakeable foundation that’s stood the test of time, and cannot be easily moved. And it — you, the men and women of the FBI — are why the Bureau will endure and remain successful long into the future.' Trump responded to Wray's resignation on Truth Social. 'The resignation of Christopher Wray is a great day for America as it will end the Weaponization of what has become known as the United States Department of Injustice. I just don’t know what happened to him. We will now restore the Rule of Law for all Americans,' he said. 'Under the leadership of Christopher Wray, the FBI illegally raided my home, without cause, worked diligently on illegally impeaching and indicting me, and has done everything else to interfere with the success and future of America. They have used their vast powers to threaten and destroy many innocent Americans, some of which will never be able to recover from what has been done to them. Kash Patel is the most qualified Nominee to lead the FBI in the Agency’s History, and is committed to helping ensure that Law, Order, and Justice will be brought back to our Country again, and soon. As everyone knows, I have great respect for the rank-and-file of the FBI, and they have great respect for me. They want to see these changes every bit as much as I do but, more importantly, the American People are demanding a strong, but fair, System of Justice. We want our FBI back, and that will now happen. I look forward to Kash Patel’s confirmation, so that the process of Making the FBI Great Again can begin. Thank you!' Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-IA, noted that Wray's resignation came after a letter from Grassley demanding the director step down. 'Reform is badly needed at FBI American ppl deserve TRANSPARENCY &amp; ACCOUNTABILITY,' he said. Wray has faced grilling from House Republicans who have accused him of politicizing the agency. Wray was himself appointed by Trump to replace former FBI Director James Comey, but Trump soured on him after the Justice Department began investigations into the former president after he left office. This is a developing story. Check back for more details.

FBI says it has no answers for drones seen over New Jersey	EWING, N.J. (NewsNation) — The FBI says it has no answers as to the dozens of drones reported at night across New Jersey in recent weeks. The agency has been investigating reports about the mysterious nighttime drone flights that started occurring last month across central New Jersey and has asked the public for help. Since then, residents have reported seeing drones in other areas. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said during a Wednesday briefing there is 'no evidence these are coming from a foreign entity of the work of an adversary.' She also refuted a claim by U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew who said the drones were being launched by an Iranian mothership. 'No there is not any truth to that,' said Singh. While speaking at an unrelated bill signing event in Princeton, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy noted there were 49 reports of drones on Sunday, mostly in Hunterdon County. UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect fights extradition New Jersey State Rep. Brian Bergen told NewsNation he’s not getting enough information from officials. 'There were no answers,' he said. 'Every question that was asked by members of the state legislature? No answers. No resolution. They don’t know where the drones are coming from. They don’t know who is doing it. They don’t know why they’re doing it. But they say there’s no credible threat.' Middletown Mayor Tony Perry said a recent reported sighting over Naval Weapons Station Earle was particularly concerning. 'We had one confirmed drone directly over the top of Earle,' he told NewsNation. 'If anybody knows Naval Weapons Station Earle, if you come within 500 feet of Earle, they’re already authorized to fire upon you when you’re just a fishing boat. Unfortunately, it seems like we’re unable to take any action when a foreign, unauthorized drone is flying above.' Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Drone operators also must be FAA certified. Most, but not all, of the drones spotted in New Jersey were larger than those typically used by hobbyists. Nancy Mace allegedly attacked on Capitol Hill; suspect arrested The flights initially raised questions in part because they took place near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster. Most of the drones have been spotted along coastal areas, and some of the devices were recently spotted over a large reservoir in Clinton. The FBI asks that residents share any videos or photos they may have of the flights, along with any other relevant information.

Fentanyl found inside dead dolphins in Gulf of Mexico	(NewsNation) — Traces of fentanyl were found inside bottlenose dolphins who were found dead in the Gulf of Mexico, raising concerns that the deadly drug may be affecting other sea life. Researchers from Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi found traces of fentanyl and other illegal substances were found in the six dolphins that were found dead. Fentanyl found in dead dolphins The research team studied 89 dolphins, from three areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Of the 89 dolphins that were studied, 30 contained traces of having drugs in their system, including 24 that had traces of fentanyl. The research found that the trace of fentanyl detected in the mammals was not necessarily the cause of death. Who gets $60K reward money in UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting? Researchers say they don’t know where the fentanyl is coming from but given the proximity of the Mexican border to where the dolphins were found, drug smuggling via the waterway could be one possible source. Authorities say that drug smugglers have been using the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico for years. This summer, the Mexican Navy pulled 1.6 tons of suspected cocaine from the water. Researchers think other animals could have drugs in their systems The university said that the findings indicate that pharmaceuticals have become emerging micropollutants and are a growing global concern. Dara Orbach, the study’s lead author said that the fatty blubber of dolphins is a good indicator of levels of ocean pollutants because it can store contaminants and be sampled relatively minimally invasively in live animals. Researchers at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi said they don’t think the dolphins with drugs found inside them are alone. A previous study discovered that sharks were also found to have cocaine in their system. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect fights extradition	(NewsNation) — The legal representation for Luigi Mangione, who is charged with murder in the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is trying to block his extradition to New York from Pennsylvania. The state of Pennsylvania is pursuing a governor’s warrant for 26-year-old Mangione, who is currently at the State Correctional Institution Huntingdon. That process could take 30 days, especially now that Mangione is trying to fight it. As he was escorted into a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday, Mangione shouted to reporters gathered outside. Nancy Mace allegedly attacked on Capitol Hill; suspect arrested 'It’s completely an injustice and an insult to the American people,' he said. During his extradition Tuesday, Mangione tried to interrupt and talk with his attorney, Thomas Dickey. Dickey told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo that he believes that Mangione will plead not guilty. 'We've seen no evidence. We've seen nothing,' Dickey said on 'CUOMO' Tuesday. 'I don’t want people to jump to these prejudgment things because nobody would ever want that if they were accused, or one of their loved ones were accused.' Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting In the months leading up to the shooting, Mangione's mother reported him missing to police in San Francisco, California, the New York Police Department's Chief of Patrol, John Chell, said. Mangione's mother told law enforcement that her son wasn't returning phone calls and text messages or posting on social media. Several GoFundMe accounts have been set up so people can donate to pay Mangione's legal bills. GoFundMe says they are quickly working to shut these down. UnitedHealthcare CEO fatally shot Thompson, 50, was killed just before 7 a.m. Dec. 4 near a Hilton Hotel while he was walking UnitedHealth Group’s annual investor meeting in New York City last Wednesday. NYPD officers searched for the gunman in New York and Georgia. On Dec. 9, police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, responded to reports of a man matching authorities' description of the suspect at a local McDonalds. It was there that Mangione was arrested. The NYPD said Mangione matched the description authorities were searching for and also had with him a mask, firearm, suppressor and a fake New Jersey ID that connected him to the shooting.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/united-healthcare-ceo-shooting-suspects-lawyer-fights-extradition/	2024-12-11T06:20:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24345709519032.jpg?w=900
Luigi Mangione reported missing 2 weeks before CEO slain: Police	Editor’s note: The video above aired on Dec. 10, 2024. NEW YORK (WPIX) – The parents of Luigi Mangione, the man suspected of shooting and killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, told law enforcement that they hadn't heard from their son in months. Mangione's mother reported him missing to San Francisco police two weeks before Thompson's slaying in Midtown, according to John Chell, New York Police Department Chief of Patrol. Mangione, 26, appeared in a Pennsylvania court on Wednesday, where he contested his extradition to New York to face murder and other charges. Who was Brian Thompson, the UnitedHealthcare CEO? 'This is completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people,' Mangione said as he was led into court. He wants a hearing on the extradition, according to Mangione's attorney, Thomas Dickey. 'I don’t want people to jump to these pre-judgment things because nobody would ever want that if they were accused, or one of their loved ones were accused,' Dickey said in an interview with NewsNation. 'And the big hearing today, I haven’t seen any evidence yet. I don’t even know if this is him or whatever. So we’re going to test those waters and give the government a chance to bring some evidence.' The NYPD is working to assemble a timeline and trace Mangione's whereabouts before and after the shooting. He was taken into custody at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Who gets $60K reward money in UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting? Chell said authorities are reviewing considerable evidence, including what's described as a handwritten manifesto. The document that Mangione had on him at the time of his arrest said, 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming. I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. I wasn’t working with anyone,' sources told NewsNation affiliate WPIX. Mangione intends to plead not guilty to all accusations against him, his attorney said. He recently suffered from a back injury and had surgery, according to reports.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangione-missing-unitedhealthcare-ceo/	2024-12-11T06:18:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/luigimangione-e1733922020591.png?w=800
Blinken testifying at committee hearing on Afghanistan withdrawal	(NewsNation) — The House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committee is set to hear Secretary of State Antony Blinken speak on the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal on Wednesday. Thirteen U.S. service members and 170 Afghans died in a suicide bombing at the Abbey Gate entrance of Hamid Karzai International Airport during the withdrawal. Lawmakers have been demanding answers about how such a significant operation could have gone so wrong. A committee aide tells NewsNation that members of the Foreign Affairs committee plan on asking Blinken about the role he played in the chaotic evacuations, as well as who had top authority over the withdrawal and why the State Department kept the U.S. Embassy open. Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting The committee says the hearing is a culmination of three years of investigations into the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. Blinken was asked to testify before the committee several times. Republican representatives tried earlier this year to hold him in contempt of Congress for not complying with a subpoena to appear. The State Department, meanwhile, says they have provided Foreign Affairs committee members with large amounts of information and that Blinken has testified before Congress on Afghanistan more than 14 times. A report by GOP representatives on the Foreign Affairs Committee was released in September, accusing the Biden administration of failing to see warning signs about how quickly Kabul would fall to the Taliban, as well as delaying an evacuation, NewsNation's partner The Hill reported. White House officials, in response, said House Foreign Affairs Chair Michael McCaul, R-Texas, was cherry-picking details and not placing enough blame on President-elect Donald Trump. The Taliban overtook Kabul only days into the evacuation from Afghanistan, and an estimated 100,000 partners of U.S. government efforts were left behind, The Hill reported. Reuters contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/blinken-testifying-committee-hearing-afganistan-withdrawal/	2024-12-11T06:11:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Afghanistan_GettyImages-1234956919.jpg?w=900
US inflation ticked up last month as some price pressures remain ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Fueled by pricier used cars, hotel rooms and groceries, inflation in the United States moved slightly higher last month in the latest sign that some price pressures remain elevated. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in November from a year earlier, up from a yearly figure of 2.6% in October. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices increased 3.3%, the same as in the previous month. Measured month to month, prices climbed 0.3% from October to November, the biggest such increase since April. Core prices also rose 0.3% for a fourth straight month. Wednesday's inflation figures from the Labor Department are the final major piece of data that Federal Reserve officials will consider before they meet next week to decide on interest rates. The relatively mild November increase won’t likely be enough to discourage the officials from cutting their key rate by a quarter-point. The probability of a rate cut next week, as envisioned by Wall Street traders, rose to 98% after Wednesday’s inflation report was released, according to futures pricing tracked by CME FedWatch. The Fed slashed its benchmark rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, by a sizable half-point in September and by a quarter-point in November. Those cuts lowered the central bank’s key rate to 4.6%, down from a four-decade high of 5.3%. Though inflation is now way below its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, average prices are still about 20% higher than they were three years ago — a major source of public discontent that helped drive President-elect Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in November. Grocery prices jumped last month, an uncomfortable reminder for consumers that food prices remain a big drag on households' budgets. Beef prices leapt 3.1% just from October to November and are up 5% from a year earlier. Egg prices, which have been volatile for more than two years, in part because of outbreaks of bird flu, soared 8.2% just last month. They are nearly 38% higher than a year ago. Gas prices ticked up 0.6% from October to November, ending a string of declines. Still, gas is down more than 8% from a year earlier. Hotel prices leapt 3.2% from October to November and are 3.7% higher than a year ago. But one key category that has been pushing prices up showed welcome signs of cooling in November: Rental prices ticked up just 0.2%, the smallest increase since July 2021. A measure of housing costs also rose by just 0.2%, the mildest rise since April 2021. Fed officials have made clear that they expect inflation to fluctuate along a bumpy path even as it gradually cools toward their target level. In speeches last week, several of the central bank’s policymakers stressed their belief that with inflation having already fallen so far, it was no longer necessary to keep their benchmark rate quite as high. Typically, the Fed cuts rates to try to stimulate the economy enough to maximize employment yet not so much as to drive inflation high. But the U.S. economy appears to be in solid shape. It grew at a brisk 2.8% annual pace in the July-September quarter, bolstered by healthy consumer spending. That has led some Wall Street analysts to suggest that the Fed doesn’t actually need to cut its key rate further. But Chair Jerome Powell has said that the central bank is seeking to 'recalibrate' its rate to a lower setting, one more in line with tamer inflation. In addition, hiring has slowed a bit in recent months, raising the risk that the economy could weaken in the coming months. Additional rate cuts by the Fed could offset that risk. One possible threat to the Fed’s efforts to keep inflation down is Trump’s threat to impose widespread tariffs on U.S. imports — a move that economists say would likely send inflation higher. Trump has said he could impose tariffs of 10% on all imports and 60% on goods from China. As a consequence, economists at Goldman Sachs have forecast that core inflation would amount to 2.7% by the end of 2025. Without tariffs, they estimate it would drop to 2.4%. When the Fed’s meeting ends Wednesday, it will not only announce its interest rate decision. The policymakers will also issue their latest quarterly projections for the economy and interest rates. In September, they projected four rate cuts for 2025. The officials will likely scale back that figure next week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/ap-us-inflation-likely-edged-up-last-month-though-not-enough-to-deter-another-fed-rate-cut/	2024-12-11T06:10:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/675996dd393761.99778998.jpeg?w=900
Luigi Mangione’s lawyer: No evidence he shot UnitedHealthcare CEO	(NewsNation) — Thomas Dickey, Luigi Mangione's lawyer, tells NewsNation that 'I haven't seen any evidence' backing up accusations his client shot and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York last week. 'I don’t want people to jump to these prejudgment things because nobody would ever want that if they were accused, or one of their loved ones were accused,' Dickey said exclusively on 'CUOMO' Tuesday. The attorney pointed out that the ghost gun found on Mangione when he was arrested at an Altoona, Pennsylvania, McDonald's Monday has not definitively been matched to the one used in Thompson's death. 'I haven't been certainly made aware of that. I haven't seen any holistic report,' he said. 'So, if you've seen that already, then that's interesting because I certainly haven't seen that.' Luigi Mangione ‘brilliant-minded,’ nonviolent: Acquaintances Investigators said Mangione matched the description of the ID they were searching for and was found in possession of several items they believe would connect him to the shooting. Those allegedly include a mask, firearm, suppressor, fake New Jersey ID that investigators believe was used to check into a hostel in New York and a handwritten document speaking to his motivation. Dickey emphasized that he'd only started representing his client for about '12 hours' before the TV interview and apologized that his lack of knowledge of the rumors circulating about Mangione may 'disappoint' many. 'I got to look at evidence and, you know, not going to go by conjecture and opinions and speculation, what people think,' he explained. Luigi Mangione's lawyer: 'He's entitled to bail' Dickey also pointed to Pennsylvania law that classifies most crimes — except for capital punishment cases or when punishment includes life without parole — as bailable offenses. In Pennsylvania, Mangione was charged Monday with forgery, carrying firearms without a license, having 'instruments of a crime,' tampering with records or information and false identification to law enforcement. Later that day, Manhattan prosecutors filed a second-degree murder charge, among others, against Mangione, according to an online court docket obtained by NewsNation. Luigi Mangione charged with murder in UnitedHealthcare shooting On Tuesday, a judge denied Mangione bail. The state of Pennsylvania is pursuing a governor's warrant to transfer him to New York and has 30 days to do so. Dickey said that in Pennsylvania, a second-degree murder charge doesn't warrant life without parole. '[Because of] those two exclusions, he's entitled to bail,' Dickey said. 'Whether it's $10 billion or $10,000 or whatever, the judge had that discretion, but he should have set bail.' Lawyer describes meeting accused UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Dickey recalled his first meeting with Mangione, telling NewsNation's Chris Cuomo he intended to 'develop a relationship, a bond,' with his client rather than assess him or his mental state. 'He seemed to understand my questions. He seemed to be able to interact with me, and so I was pleased with that,' he said. When asked about Mangione's mood, Dickey said to use your 'common sense' about how one accused of such a crime would feel. Luigi Mangione classmate: ‘A lot of families are hurting’ Dickey also addressed the public Tuesday afternoon in a press conference from his law firm in Altoona, Pennsylvania, roughly 35 miles from the State Correctional Institution Huntingdon, where Mangione is currently being held without bail as he attempts to fight extradition to New York. Dickey, who took on the case Tuesday, refused to clarify who hired him during that press conference. Mangione will remain in the State Correctional Institution Huntingdon until a governor’s warrant is secured. Blair County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Peter Weeks said both Pennsylvania and New York’s governors feel confident they can obtain a governor's warrant before the deadline. Who is Luigi Mangione? Mangione had no prior criminal record. A spokesperson with the University of Pennsylvania confirmed that Mangione attended and graduated with both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in engineering. NewsNation local affiliate WPIX confirmed that Mangione was employed as the head counselor for the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies program in 2019. The Mangione family issued a statement following his arrest. 'Unfortunately, we cannot comment on news reports regarding Luigi Mangione. We only know what we have read in the media. Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest,' the statement said. 'We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved. We are devastated by this news.' NewsNation's Steph Whiteside, Rich McHugh, Alex Caprariello and Brian Entin contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/luigi-mangione-lawyer-interview-unitedhealthcare-shooting/	2024-12-10T19:02:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/image-3.png?w=900
Pepperdine student feared for his life amid Franklin Fire	(NewsNation) — Pepperdine University students were among many Malibu residents subjected to the Franklin Fire currently raging in Southern California. Crews with the Los Angeles County Fire Department responded to the blaze, dubbed the Franklin Fire, near Malibu Canyon Road and Station Boundary at around 10:45 p.m. As of 2 a.m., the fire was mapped at 853 acres with no containment. The cause of the fire was under investigation. Nicholas Gerding, a student at Pepperdine University, joined 'NewsNation Now' to discuss how close the Franklin wildfire came to their shelter-in-place spot on campus. What to know about the fast-moving Franklin Fire 'The worst part was when it was right up against the windows of the library, and that was the scariest because they ordered us to stay away from those windows, and we all kind of huddled in the middle of the library for about 30 minutes before those fires were kind of taken care of,' Gerding said. 'There were about 30 minutes where I genuinely did not know if I was going to be okay or not. ... It was really looking like it wasn't going to go well, and coming to terms with the fact my life might end today was a hard 30 minutes to sit through and kind of manage,' he added. Shelter-in-place orders have since been lifted, with students either choosing to leave campus, return to their dorms or remain in the library, according to Gerding.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/pepperdine-student-franklin-fire/	2024-12-10T15:03:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2189204759.jpg?w=900
NJ governor taking unidentified drone flights 'deadly seriously'	New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) said that he is taking unidentified drone flights in his state 'deadly seriously.' 'These are apparently … as I understand it, very sophisticated,' Murphy told a group of reporters in a clip posted to the social platform X Monday. Live: House panel holds drone hearing 'The minute you get eyes on them, they go dark. And, you know, we’re obviously most concerned about sensitive targets and sensitive, critical infrastructure. We’ve got military assets, we’ve got utility assets, we’ve got the president-elect’s, one of his homes, here. This is something we’re taking deadly seriously,' he added. Last week, in a post on X, Murphy said he 'convened a briefing' featuring Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as well as other important figures in the Department of Homeland Security, New Jersey government 'and members of our congressional delegation to discuss reported drone activity over parts of North and Central New Jersey.' 'We are actively monitoring the situation and in close coordination with our federal and law enforcement partners on this matter. There is no known threat to the public at this time,' Murphy added. In the clip posted to X on Monday, the Garden State governor told reporters that he and other officials 'don’t see any concern for public safety.' FBI investigating reports of large drones flying in New Jersey, seeks public’s help 'It’s really frustrating that we don’t have more answers as to where they’re coming from and why they’re doing what they’re doing,' Murphy said in the clip. The FBI’s field office in Newark, N.J., said last Tuesday that they, alongside New Jersey authorities 'are asking for the public to report any information related to the recent sightings of possible drones flying in several areas along the Raritan River.' 'Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,' the field office added in a release.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/new-jersey-drone-flights/	2024-12-10T12:56:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24157731297026-e1717682524417.jpg?w=900
What to know about the fast-moving Franklin Fire	(NewsNation) — Firefighters are continuing to battle the Franklin Fire, which has led to mandatory evacuation orders for nearly 10,000 Malibu, California residents living in the area around Pepperdine University. Los Angeles County fire crews are fighting the blaze, which was dubbed the Franklin Fire, and has been mapped at 853 acres with no containment. Fire officials said that as of Tuesday morning, the fire has burned nearly 2,600 areas as of Tuesday. Alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter denied bail Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna told reporters on Tuesday that 18,000 people have been affected by the fire and that 8,100 structures are in the affected areas. Of those structures, 2,043 are under mandatory evacuation orders while 6,046 are under evacuation warnings. Here’s what is known about the fire at this time. Where is the Franklin Fire? The fire was reported in the Malibu Canyon near South Malibu Canyon Road and Francisco Ranch Road, which is located near Pepperdine University. Cal Fire officials announced that the fire had spread across the Pacific Coast Highway (Highway 1) and was moving toward the Malibu Pier. The pier is a popular tourist destination that is popular among locals and surfers. Malibu is located nearly 37 miles outside of Los Angeles.

(AP Photo/Ethan Swope) What schools, businesses, and neighborhoods have evacuated because of the fire? Pepperdine University canceled classes and issued a shelter-in-place order due to the surrounding area being affected by the blaze. Residents in several Malibu neighborhoods and surrounding communities have had their power shut off as utility workers are hoping to mitigate the effects of the high Santa Ana winds.

Hong) In addition to Pepperdine University, the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District closed all of its schools in Malibu. The district said that the closures were due to the fire and 'other fire concerns'. The closures affected two elementary schools, a middle school and Malibu High School. Residents have been asked to avoid using their sprinklers or irrigating their lawns as that water may be needed to fight the fire. Pacific Coast Highway between Kanan Dume Road and Topanga Canyon Boulevard has been shut down until further notice, the California Highway Patrol announced on Tuesday. Has anyone died in the Franklin Fire? No deaths or serious injuries have been reported since the fire broke out. A Pepperdine spokesperson told The New York Times that damage to the campus is minimal and that none of the university’s 3,000 students and faculty members who were sheltered in place were injured. Local law enforcement officials said that several structures have sustained damage or have been destroyed due to the fire, but that no further details about the number of buildings that sustained damage were available. The Los Angeles Fire Department said that a 'minimal number' of homes have been destroyed. What started the Franklin Fire? Fire officials have not announced the cause of the fire. However, the National Weather Service on Monday issued a Red Flag warning for areas East of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, KTLA reported. The weather service announced that warm Santa Ana winds produced gusts of up to 80 mph. AccuWeather officials announced that the dry air and dry vegetation are creating conditions that are conducive to new fires spreading out of control. Has air quality been affected by the Franklin Fire? Smoke generated by the Franklin Fire has diminished the air quality in Malibu and in surrounding communities, the South Coast Air Quality Management District said. Smoke was largely spreading west over the Pacific Ocean, but was spread over Los Angeles throughout the day on Tuesday, the agency said. A Wildfire Smoke Advisory was released by the agency, which runs through 5 p.m. local time on Wednesday. The fire is actively producing smoke with winds pushing the smoke toward Malibu. Sensors showed that levels put the air quality in the unhealthy to hazardous category, the agency said. Smoke is most likely to affect Northwest coastal Los Angeles County, including Malibu. The alert said that some smoke impacts may occur in parts of the San Fernando Valley, Santa Monica, downtown Los Angeles, and nearby areas on Wednesday afternoon as winds shift to come from the southwest.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/what-know-about-franklin-fire/	2024-12-10T12:05:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24345369331608.jpg?w=900
Timeline of UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect's movements	(NewsNation) — After a search that spanned multiple states, Luigi Mangione, 26, was named as the suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Thompson, 50, was killed near a Hilton Hotel while walking to UnitedHealth Group's annual investor meeting in New York City last Wednesday. An official motive has not yet been revealed for the shooting, but the words 'deny,' 'depose' and 'defend' were written on the shell casings found at the scene, police sources told NewsNation local affiliate WPIX. These words are similar to the title of the book 'Delay, Deny, Defend,' which is about the ways insurance companies reject requests for medical coverage deemed necessary by doctors. UnitedHealthcare has the highest claim denial rate among insurance companies. It rejects 32% of all claims compared to the industry average of 16%. Luigi Mangione classmate: ‘A lot of families are hurting’ United Healthcare was being investigated by the Department of Justice over allegedly running a monopoly and unfairly blocking out competitors. In addition, Thompson, as well as other executives at United Healthcare, were being sued over allegations they sold shares of stock in the company before the probe by the DOJ was announced. Thompson, 50, was a father of two. After becoming CEO of UnitedHealthcare in 2021, he helped the company bring in $281 billion in profits in 2023. Between his salary and other benefits, Thompson made an estimated $10 million last year. This undated photo provided by UnitedHealth Group shows UnitedHealthcare chief executive officer Brian Thompson. (AP Photo/UnitedHealth Group via AP) Here are the events surrounding Mangione's arrest on Monday. Nov. 24 On this date, the suspected shooter arrived in New York City on a Greyhound bus at the Port Authority terminal. Police said the bus originated in Atlanta, Georgia. The suspect took a taxi to a New York hostel and checked in using an ID that authorities believe was fake. Surveillance video shows the man, at one point, pulling down his facemask and smiling while talking to an employee in the hostel lobby. Nov. 29 The suspect checked out of the hostel — but police believe this was an administrative check-out as he did not show up at the required time. He checked back into the same hostel the next day. Police say he did not stay somewhere else during this time. Dec. 4 The suspect left the hostel before dawn and then was seen on video around the area of the Hilton. At some point, he went to a Starbucks, and then returned to the hotel. Just before 7 a.m., Thompson was shot in the back and leg by the gunman. Thompson was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the shooter was 'lying in wait,' and arrived at the Hilton five minutes before Thompson. Many people passed him, but the gunman appeared to wait for his intended target,' Tisch told reporters at a press conference.

Alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter's manifesto to be evidence	(NewsNation) — Alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione's manifesto will be used as evidence, an NYPD source told NewsNation. Mangione is facing second-degree murder charges in New York in connection with the shooting. Luigi Mangione's alleged manifesto The document has been described as two to three pages long and talks about the insurance industry. Quotes include, 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming' and 'I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done.' Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting The document also states he was not working with anyone else. 'To the Feds, I’ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn’t working with anyone,' it reads. Mangione, 26, was arrested on Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after being spotted at a McDonald's on firearms charges related to a ghost gun he allegedly had on him when arrested. The NYPD told NewsNation they have not finished interviewing Mangione about the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson but believe the gun found on him when he was arrested is the gun used in the murder. Who is Luigi Mangione? Mangione had no prior criminal record. A spokesperson with the University of Pennsylvania confirmed that Mangiano attended and graduated with both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in engineering. NewsNation’s local affiliate, WPIX, confirmed that Mangione was employed as the head counselor for the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies program in 2019. The Mangione family issued a statement following his arrest. 'Unfortunately, we cannot comment on news reports regarding Luigi Mangione. We only know what we have read in the media. Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest,' the statement said. 'We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved. We are devastated by this news.' Wildfire explodes near Pepperdine University in Malibu; evacuations ordered How did police find Luigi Mangione? The NYPD said investigators spent hours pouring over surveillance footage and looking for evidence following the shooting. Mangione was initially identified as a person of interest and police released multiple surveillance photos that were shared across the country. At a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, a customer spotted Mangione based on the photographs and alerted an employee who called 911.

This undated photo provided by UnitedHealth Group shows UnitedHealthcare chief executive officer Brian Thompson. (AP Photo/UnitedHealth Group via AP) The words appear to be a possible reference to a book titled 'Delay, Deny, Defend,' which details the ways insurance companies use to reject requests for medical coverage deemed necessary by doctors. UnitedHealthcare has the highest claim denial rate among insurance companies, rejecting 32% of submitted claims compared to the industry average of 16%. Thompson, 50, was a father of two. He became CEO of UnitedHealthcare in 2021 and helped the company bring in $281 billion in profits in 2023. Between salary and other benefits, he was estimated to have more than $10 million in compensation last year. Man who spent day with Hannah Kobayashi opens up to police: Report Earlier this year, Thompson was sued by the Hollywood Firefighters’ Pension Fund for insider trading and fraud. Executives at United Healthcare were being investigated by the Department of Justice over allegedly running a monopoly and unfairly blocking out competitors. The Department of Justice also launched an antitrust investigation into the UnitedHealthcare Group following a cyberattack on a subsidiary that handled health care payments. During the attack, many patients were forced to pay out of pocket for care and medications or were unable to get them because medical facilities were unable to process payments.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/alleged-unitedhealthcare-shooter-manifesto-evidence-luigi-mangione/	2024-12-10T09:49:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24345099202858_1804ab.jpg?w=900
McDonald's in Pennsylvania slammed with bad reviews after arrest ...	ALTOONA, Pa. (WTAJ) -- A McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, is getting backlash online after an employee called 911, leading to the arrest of Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione was taken into custody at the McDonald's on Monday morning after a customer noticed a man in the back of the store with a mask, laptop and backpack. The customer then went to an employee who in turn called 911. Luigi Mangione classmate: ‘A lot of families are hurting’ Calls for Luigi Mangione to be freed Since the arrest, social media has lit up with calls for Mangione to be freed, which has led to users leaving bad reviews for the fast-food restaurant, even if they've likely never been there. While some want to praise Mangione, Gov. Josh Shapiro was vocal against 'vigilante justice' and said he's 'not a hero.' A recurring theme for the reviews is 'rats,' which likely refers to the employee 'ratting out' Mangione by calling 911. Others are also calling it 'noisy' because 'employees talk too much,' again, likely referring to the employee talking to dispatch/police. Luigi Mangione charged with murder in UnitedHealthcare shooting 'Full of rats. Untrustworthy staff. Nobody stays in their lane,' one reviewer said on Facebook. 'Mcdiarrrhea of the mouth here. Would not recommend. Unsafe food served by unsafe ppl. Curious what insurance plans employees get working here,' one user from Illinois wrote on Yelp. 'This McDonald's location is dealing with a serious rat problem. They have rats working the register,' said another from New York on Yelp. Yelp has shut down reviews for the location, citing 'unusual activity.' UnitedHealthcare shooting arrest: 'Review bombing' The following statement pops up when visiting the page: 'This business recently received increased public attention, which often means people come to this page to post their views on the news. While we don’t take a stand one way or the other when it comes to this incident, we’ve temporarily disabled the posting of content to this page as we work to investigate whether the content you see here reflects actual consumer experiences rather than the recent events. Please note that we apply this same policy regardless of the business and regardless of the topic at issue. Read more on Yelp Support. Luigi Mangione ‘brilliant-minded,’ nonviolent: Acquaintances If you’re here to leave a review based on a first-hand experience with the business, please check back at a later date.' The 'review bombing' of the store has led to Yelp showing a 1-star rating for the location. Meanwhile, poor reviews continue to flood the 'McDonald's (Altoona, PA)' Facebook page. UnitedHealthcare shooting reward It was unknown whether the employee who called 911 or the customer who alerted them would receive the $50,000 reward offered by the FBI or the $10,000 reward from the NYPD for information leading to an arrest in Thompson’s slaying.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/luigi-mangione-arrest-mcdonalds-bad-reviews/	2024-12-10T09:26:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/McDonalds-on-Plank-Road-in-Altoona-Pa.-e1733842310681.png?w=800
US sees shortage of wildland firefighters	(NewsNation) — A shortage of wildland firefighters is getting worse — and becoming a concern to public safety. It's an extremely dangerous career path, that carries with it mental and physical stress. For many, the low pay is just not worth the risk. Wildland firefighters can be on duty for 20-40 days in a row, working 24-48 hour shifts. Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard on Capitol Hill to get Senate support While their wages vary depending on where they live, an entry-level wildlands firefighter typically makes $34,000 a year. Many rely on overtime or hazard pay to get ahead financially. NewsNation has spoken to people who live in houses with multiple roommates because of their salary. In addition, that amount of money is not enough for people in a career who face a mountain of health concerns. A structure firefighter, who puts out flames in buildings, often uses oxygen devices for respiratory protection, but most wildland firefighters, who work in uncultivated land, don't do that. The Forest Service has acknowledged that there's a link between cancer and fighting wildland fires — something people have long expressed concern over. There's not much job security either. Many wildland firefighter positions are seasonal jobs that end at the end of fire season. Although fire season is lasting longer now, sometimes even through January, when it's over, firefighters need to either apply for unemployment or have another job lined up. One report by LAist shows California is about 1,250 wildland firefighters short of what it needs to fully staff crews. While the Forest Service said on its website that it met its staffing goal this year with 11,393 firefighters, NewsNation sources disagree. 'They need to double that number, and then they need to also increase their resources of fixed and rotary-wing aircraft,' Joseph Ten Eyck, the wildfire/urban-interface fire programs coordinator at the International Association of Firefighters, said. Donald Trump says tariffs will not hurt Americans’ pockets George Broyles, a retired firefighter for the Forest Service, says many end up having to choose between their health, family and job. 'It's a great job, don't get me wrong,' Broyles said. 'I think that's why a lot of folks struggle — because they love the work that they do, but the challenges with pay and with health and travel and the trauma that we deal with, whether it's yourself that gets injured, or your or your brother or sister that's out there on the line — it takes a big emotional toll on everybody.' When President Joe Biden took office, his administration increased wildfire firefighters' minimum wage from $13 an hour to $15 an hour. However, that pay bump expires at the end of the year. While Biden proposed a $1.6 billion budget to support the wildland workforce for FY2025, Congress has not approved it yet. Lawmakers are also negotiating a disaster relief bill that the wildfire firefighter union hopes will include more money for them.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/us-shortage-wildland-firefighters/	2024-12-10T08:33:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24312051643465.jpg?w=900

A lot of families are hurting': Luigi Mangione classmate	(NewsNation) — A former high school classmate of Luigi Mangione, the man charged in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson had been following the case since last week but said he never connected Mangione with the crime until Monday. Freddie Leatherbury, who has known Mangione since the sixth grade, told NewsNation on Tuesday that it has been difficult to see his high school portrayed in a negative national spotlight since Mangione was arrested on Monday and that those who know Mangione remain shocked. 'My life since about 1 (p.m.) Eastern time yesterday has just been so surreal,' Leatherbury said. Who is UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect Luigi Mangione? Mangione, 26, was charged with several criminal offenses, including murder. Mangione, 26, was denied bail and faces a preliminary hearing on Dec. 23. Mangione will likely be taken to a state correctional facility Monday evening, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said. Mangione was arrested at an Altoona, Pennsylvania, McDonald’s following a dayslong manhunt after Thompson was shot and killed on a Manhattan sidewalk last week. 'Nothing connected to me when I saw the surveillance footage,' Leatherbury said. 'It’s so impressive to me that the McDonald’s worker of all people who had never seen this person in his life picked him out of a crowd basically and said, ‘I know that guy. He’s the wanted guy.’ That’s crazy to me.' Leatherbury said he and Mangione weren’t in the same social circles but were friendly. He remembers Luigi as being driven, smart and athletic. He said Mangione was everything one could want in a high school student. Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting Leatherbury said he followed Mangione on social media. He characterized him as an infrequent poster on social platforms and that he did not see any red flags that indicated he was capable of committing a crime with which he is charged. 'It doesn’t seem thinkable that this is the same person,' Leatherbury said, adding, 'It just goes so against everything I knew about Luigi.' He added: 'None of us can come up with any leads or any or any history of inclination to do anything like this.' Leatherbury said that there isn’t much 'worth hearing' regarding Mangione, but said his thoughts are focused on Thompson’s family. He also said Mangione’s family is grieving the loss of life they’re going to have with Mangione. 'So a lot of families are hurting right now,' Leatherbury told NewsNation. 'So I I don't really need to know much more from Luigi, to be honest. I just want to know that they're at peace and comfortable with what's going on moving forward.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/families-hurting-luigi-mangione-classmate/	2024-12-10T06:21:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/96e8a6a7-b272-4899-ad30-5d043b735e68.jpg?w=800

Jay-Z files motion to reveal rape accuser's identity	Jay-Z’s attorney, Alex Spiro, filed court paperwork Monday asking a judge to require his rape accuser, who is only identified as 'Jane Doe,' to reveal her identity if she wants to continue the lawsuit. Spiro said the woman hasn’t provided any evidence to justify her anonymity and that her 'vague assertions of potential harm fall far short of the stringent requirements' under the law. The woman who previously sued Sean 'Diddy' Combs, alleging she was raped at an awards show after-party in 2000 when she was 13, amended the lawsuit Sunday to include a new allegation that Jay-Z was also at the party and participated in the sexual assault. Spiro asked for an urgent hearing on the matter. Who are the celebrities accused with Diddy? S.D.N.Y._24-cv-07975_dckt_000038_000_filed_2024-12-09Download 'Mr. Carter deserves to know the identity of the person who is effectively accusing him — in sensationalized, publicity-hunting fashion — of criminal conduct, demanding massive financial compensation, and tarnishing a reputation earned over decades,' Spiro wrote. 'He has never been accused of, let alone engaged in, any sexual misconduct.' The 24-time Grammy award-winning rapper, producer and music mogul, whose real name is Shawn Carter, called the allegations 'idiotic' and 'heinous in nature' in a statement released by Roc Nation, one of his companies. He also revealed that he had anonymously sued the woman’s lawyer, Tony Buzbee, last month, alleging he was trying to blackmail the rapper by threatening to make the rape allegation public if he didn’t agree to a legal settlement. He said Buzbee sent a letter to his lawyer appearing to seek a settlement but that the letter had the 'opposite effect' on him. Celebrities who had the worst year in 2024 'It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion,' Jay-Z’s statement read. 'So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!' The litigation is part of a wave of sexual assault lawsuits levied against Combs as the hip-hop mogul remains in custody in New York awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, said the notion that he was trying to blackmail Jay-Z is 'stupid and laughable,' and that his letter simply sought confidential mediation in the litigation. 'What he fails to say in his recent statement is that my firm sent his lawyer a basic demand letter on behalf of an alleged victim and that victim never demanded a penny from him,' he said in an emailed statement. 'Since I sent the letter on her behalf, Mr. Carter has not only sued me, but he has tried to bully and harass me and this plaintiff. His conduct has had the opposite impact. She is emboldened. I’m very proud of her resolve.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jay-z-rape-accusers-identity/	2024-12-09T21:34:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/6668abff160446.34366488.jpeg?w=900
Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting	(NewsNation) — A primary care physician in the wake of a UnitedHealthcare CEO's killing has highlighted growing frustrations within the medical community over insurance company practices, particularly aggressive claim denials. Dr. Saju Mathew, a 20-year veteran physician, told NewsNation Monday that insurance companies are increasingly blocking critical medical procedures through complex 'prior authorization' processes. 'We as doctors have been crying, screaming on the top of our lungs regarding how lots of insurance companies are denying claims on a daily basis,' Mathew said on 'NewsNation Now.' He cited examples of patients being unable to obtain routine tests like mammograms without extensive bureaucratic hurdles. Who is UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting person of interest Luigi Mangione? UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting The doctor's comments come after the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan, which has sparked a national conversation about health care industry practices. On social media in particular, some users gloated about the killing, a reaction they framed as rooted in their enmity for the health insurance industry. That, in turn, brought rebukes from others who condemned those responses as inhumane, especially in the circumstances. Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested as a person of interest and was reportedly found with a three-page manifesto expressing anger toward corporate America. Shell casings at the scene had words written on them with markers said to have included 'Depose,' 'Deny,' and 'Defend.' Doctor calls out claim denials after UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting Mathew said that UnitedHealthcare denies one in three claims, a trend he says is symptomatic of a broader industry problem. The company reported $281 billion in revenue last year. 'But it's just not UnitedHealthcare. It's really all insurance companies,' he said. Mathew argued that meaningful change would require congressional action, suggesting legislators should mandate transparency about insurance denial rates and restore medical decision-making power to physicians and patients. Killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO uncorks anger at insurance industry 'No. 1, we should be able to make sure that people understand which insurance companies have the highest denial rate,' Mathew said. The physician called for removing insurance companies' ability to arbitrate medical necessities, particularly in critical procedures like knee replacements for patients with severe arthritis. A recent KFF poll spotlights Mathew's concerns, revealing that 97% of registered voters believe insurance companies bear significant responsibility for high health care prices. A February report from KFF found that Americans owe 'at least $220 billion' in medical debt and that about 3 million people have debts of over $10,000.

Luigi Mangione 'brilliant-minded,’ nonviolent: Acquaintances	(NewsNation) — The man charged in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, was 'brilliant-minded' and 'very popular' in high school, an anonymous classmate tells NewsNation. 'He was the valedictorian of our high school, but he didn't put in much effort at all. He would sit there in class, not study after school, and aced the tests,' the classmate said on 'CUOMO.' According to class records, Mangione attended a private high school in Baltimore, Maryland. In addition to academic feats, he was also a wrestler. '[Mangione] was an extraordinary mind. He was a very popular person in the class,' he added. 'Had a lot of friends. It's just shocking that he would commit such a heinous act.' Luigi Mangione charged with murder in UnitedHealthcare shooting R.J. Martin, who was roommates with Mangione at a coliving space in Hawaii, met Mangione when he was already in his 20s. Martin tells NewsNation that he, like many others in the community, was looking to enjoy the tropics and live healthier — namely, healing a bad back, Mangione told him. 'I don't know if it was an injury or preexisting, (but) he was doing everything he could to, you know, not be in pain when he moved in at Surfbreak [Coliving],' Martin said. Martin’s experience echoes Mangione’s high school reputation, with the roommate describing him as 'a kind person, great listener, somebody that you know you would enjoy having a cup of coffee with.' 'And I just can't imagine that this is the same person,' Martin said, calling the incident 'unimaginable.' Martin emphasized that while he and Mangione had discussed health care before, it never teetered toward violent ideation. 'Most people are aware that many of the systems that we live within don't benefit us as well as they could. And you know, those are normal intellectual conversations and discussions that we have,' Martin said. 'And he and I had many of those kinds of intellectual conversations, but never anything remotely towards violence. He was never aggressive. I never even remember him once being upset.' Who is UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting person of interest Luigi Mangione? Mangione’s anonymous classmate pointed to him as someone who was 'capable of running or starting their own biotech firm that could have helped cure some of these illnesses.' 'I want to know why he thought there was no other way. … The fact that that mind is now going to spend, likely, the rest of their life in prison is very sad,' he added. Luigi Mangione named person of interest in UnitedHealthcare shooting Manhattan prosecutors filed murder and other charges against Mangione late Monday night. He remains in Pennsylvania jail. He was arrested Monday on forgery charges in Pennsylvania after questioning by authorities, according to a police briefing on Monday evening in the Keystone State. His Monday arraignment saw his bail denied, and a preliminary hearing set for Dec. 23. In Pennsylvania, Mangione was charged with forgery, carrying firearms without a license, having 'instruments of a crime,' tampering with records or information and false identification to law enforcement. The NYPD released Mangione’s name at a press conference later that day. Investigators said Mangione matched the description of the ID they were searching for and was found in possession of several items they believe would connect him to the shooting. Those allegedly include a mask, firearm, suppressor and fake New Jersey ID that was used to check into a hostel in New York. Police described the firearm as consistent with the one used to shoot Thompson.

Who are the celebrities accused with Diddy?	(NewsNation) — Rap mogul Jay-Z has been accused of assault alongside Sean 'Diddy' Combs in an amended complaint filed Sunday, but his name is just the latest among several well-known people linked to the accusations against Combs. Originally filed in October 2024, the suit named only Combs but now identifies Jay-Z as 'Celebrity A,' who was accused of raping a 13-year-old at an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty, NBC News first reported. Jay-Z accused The victim, identified as 'Jane Doe,' alleges that the pair of stars assaulted her after the event in Manhattan in September 2000. Court documents accuse Jay-Z of being present during 'many such instances.' What’s happened since Diddy was indicted? Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, denied the allegations in a lengthy statement in response to the complaint. In it, he claims the lawyer behind the accuser’s suit attempted to blackmail him. The rapper is the most high-profile name to be linked to Combs, but several others have been tied to the disgraced music producer who is currently in a New York prison after a federal indictment on three counts of racketeering, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and transportation to engage in prostitution. Cuba Gooding Jr. Oscar-winning actor Cuba Gooding Jr. was added to a sexual assault lawsuit against Combs by music producer Rodney Jones earlier this year. Jones, also known as Lil Rod, alleged that Gooding sexually harassed and assaulted him, such as by groping him while aboard Combs’ yacht in 2023. He said Gooding did not stop until he forcibly pushed him away and that Combs left him alone with the actor. Gooding has denied the allegations. Aaron Hall R&amp;B singer and songwriter Aaron Hall was sued alongside Combs by Liza Gardner for battery, sexual assault and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Garner said in 1990, she and her friend met Combs during an event at the offices of MCA Records, and the two were invited back to Hall’s home. There, she 'was coerced into having sex with Combs,' the suit alleged. 'After Combs finished doing his business, Liza Gardner laid in bed, shocked and traumatized,' the lawsuit stated. 'As she was in the process of getting dressed, Hall barged into the room, pinned her down and forced Liza Gardner to have sex with him.' Both Hall and Combs have denied the allegations. What we know about the Diddy investigation Harve Pierre Bad Boy Records executive Harve Pierre, Combs, and a third 'assailant' were sued by Anna Kane, the ex-wife of an NHL hockey player. Kane alleged that the three gang-raped her when she was 17 after trafficking her across state lines in 2003. Kane said that she met Pierre as a junior in high school when he approached her at a lounge in Detroit near her home. Pierre and Combs convinced the then-teen to take a private jet with them and a third person to Combs’ recording studio in New York City. That’s where they drugged her and then began taking turns raping her, she alleged. 'As a result of being raped by Mr. Combs, Mr. Pierre and the Third Assailant, Ms. Doe suffered significant emotional distress and feelings of shame that have plagued her life and personal relationships for 20 years,' her lawsuit stated. Pierre denied the allegations in a statement to TMZ. Christian 'King' Combs Combs’ son Christian 'King' Combs was named alongside his father in a lawsuit that accuses the younger Combs of sexual assault and battery on a yacht that was chartered by the music mogul in 2022. Grace O’Marcaigh, a steward working on the yacht, alleged in a civil suit in the Los Angeles County Superior Court that Christian, 26, forced her to take a 'spiked' shot of tequila, groped her and then assaulted her, according to court documents. She says she complained to the ship’s captain, but the incident was not properly investigated. She alleges Combs paid the captain a hefty tip as part of a 'coverup,' reported Rolling Stone. Jay-Z says lawsuit accusing him of raping a child at awards after-party is part of an extortion ploy Jacob the Jeweler Celebrity jewelry designer Jacob Arabo, known as Jacob the Jeweler, was named as a defendant in a complaint filed against Combs in July, reported Business Insider. The complaint accuses Combs of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and sex trafficking by a woman who worked at one of the rapper’s infamous 'white parties.' He alleged that Combs forced her to have sex with Arabo, who was one of the party guests. Yung Miami Rapper Yung Miami, who once dated Combs, is named in the sexual assault lawsuit filed by Jones as being a part of his sex trafficking operation. The lawsuit accuses the rapper of bringing Combs tuci, a drug sometimes called 'pink cocaine,' on a private jet. Jones alleged Yung Miami was among several women 'who were paid a monthly fee to work as Mr. Combs' sex workers.' The rapper was also named in another sexual assault lawsuit filed by Jane Doe who alleges that Yung Miami harassed her to have an abortion at the behest of Combs, reported Vulture. Yung Miami denied the allegations, reported The Los Angeles Times.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/celebrities-accused-diddy/	2024-12-09T11:56:56-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-1201994175.jpg?w=900
Who is UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting person of interest Luigi Man...	(NewsNation) —Authorities have arrested a person of interest in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, and little is still known about him or why he attacked the executive. Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested in Pennsylvania on firearms charges and is described by police as a person of interest in the shooting. NewsNation is working to obtain more information on Mangione. Thompson, 50, was shot just before 7 a.m. last week near a hotel on 54th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues, sources told NewsNation. UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting: Who was Brian Thompson? The gunman had been anticipating Thompson to arrive at the hotel for an investors meeting, police said. This was a 'premeditated, preplanned, targeted attack,' NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said during a news conference. The suspect was 'lying in wait for several minutes.' Luigi Mangione named person of interest in UnitedHealthcare shooting The NYPD released Mangione's name at a press conference on Monday. Investigators said Mangione matched the description of the ID they were searching for and was found in possession of several items they believe will connect him to the shooting. Those allegedly include a mask, firearm, suppressor and fake NJ ID that was used to check into a hostel in New York. Police described the firearm as consistent with the one used to shoot Thompson. Investigators said the gun appears to be a ghost gun, a term for an gun with no serial number, which may have been made on a 3D printer and capable of firing a 9mm round. Police also recovered a handwritten document that speaks to his motivation and mindset. Mangione has no prior arrests on his record. What do we know about the suspect in the UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting? Upon locating the backpack, police discovered a jacket and monopoly money. As Thompson arrived at the Hilton, the shooter stepped out from behind a car and fired multiple rounds, striking Thompson in the leg and back. Kenny said it appeared that the 'gun malfunctions as he clears the jam and begins to fire again.' The New York Police Department released photos of a person of interest wanted for questioning in connection to the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. (NYPD)The New York Police Department released photos of a person of interest wanted for questioning in connection to the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. (NYPD) The suspect then ran through an alley, hopped on an electric Citi Bike and rode through Central Park on Center Drive. 'I hear a shot,' a witness told NewsNation affiliate WPIX. 'When I look around, I saw a guy with a gun. He shot three times, then he starts running.' Investigators recovered several 9 mm shell casings from outside the hotel and a cell phone from the alleyway through which the suspect fled. They were also searching Thompson's hotel room and interviewing his UnitedHealthcare colleagues, Kenny said. While the shooting was targeted, police say they still don’t know a motive for the attack. What is Luigi Mangione's manifesto? Investigators said a three-page, handwritten document was found that they described as a manifesto. While they said they don't believe there are specific threats to others in the document, they described it as showing 'ill will' toward corporate America. Authorities say it gives insight into the mindset of motives in what they described as a 'targeted' killing. How was Luigi Mangio found? Police said old-fashioned detective work was used to locate Mangione. The photo of a person of interest taken from surveillance video was shared across the country and a McDonald's employee identified Mangione as a possible match. Responding officers said Mangione was acting suspiciously and found that he had multiple IDs on him. The New York Police Department released photos of a person of interest wanted for questioning in connection to the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Pennsylvania police question man in connection with CEO killing	(NewsNation) — NewsNation has confirmed that authorities in Altoona, Pennsylvania, are questioning a man in connection with the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson Police have expanded the search for the suspected shooter beyond New York as they have implored the public to come forward with information. NewsNation affiliate WTAJ reports a person of interest is currently being questioned and CBS confirmed the person was found with a gun similar to the one used in the shooting. Forever chemicals tainting food supply, destroying American farmers Thompson was killed while walking to the company's annual investor meeting. Police say they believe the attack was targeted and not a random act of violence. The words 'deny,' 'depose' and 'defend' were written on the shell casings found at the scene of the shooting, police sources said to NewsNation local affiliate WPIX. The words appear to be a possible reference to a book titled 'Delay, Deny, Defend,' which details the ways insurance companies use to reject requests for medical coverage deemed necessary by doctors. United Healthcare has the highest claim denial rate among insurance companies, rejecting 32% of submitted claims compared to the industry average of 16%. Police released surveillance photos of a person of interest they hoped to question, which showed an individual in a dark, hooded jacket with a backpack. The backpack was later located and found to contain Monopoly money. Thompson, 50, was a father of two. He became CEO of United Healthcare in 2021 and helped the company bring in $281 billion in profits in 2023. Between salary and other benefits, he was estimated to have more than $10 million in compensation last year. 9 states could halt Medicaid expansion if Trump cuts funding Earlier this year, Thompson was sued by the Hollywood Firefighters’ Pension Fund for insider trading and fraud. Executives at United Healthcare were being investigated by the Department of Justice over allegedly running a monopoly and unfairly blocking out competitors. The Department of Justice also launched an antitrust investigation into the United Healthcare Group following a cyberattack on a subsidiary that handled healthcare payments. During the attack, many patients were forced to pay out of pocket for care and medications or were unable to get them because medical facilities were unable to process payments.

Daniel Penny found not guilty in Jordan Neely's death	(NewsNation) — The jury in Daniel Penny’s high-profile trial has returned and has found the former Marine not guilty in the death of Jordan Neely. The verdict comes after Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed the manslaughter charge against Penny, who is accused of killing Neely. The judge’s ruling on Friday left the jury to consider a lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide against Penny. The verdict drew mixed reactions inside the courtroom, including applause. Neely's father, Andre Zachery, and his attorney were asked to leave the courtroom. In a news conference held outside of the courthouse minutes after the verdict was read, Zachery said that the judicial system had failed. 'Let the marchers march and let the steppers step,' Zachery said. 'You want to do something about this verdict? Then you go into your neighborhood and you promote Black unity.' He added: 'Black people, we are all that we have. This system protects every other group except for the very people that built this country.' In a statement released by his office, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said that the jury had spoken and that he deeply respects the jury process and the jury's verdict. He said that during the trial, prosecutors and their family members were 'beseiged with hate and threat.' 'Simply put, this is unacceptable, and everyone, no matter your opinion on this case, should condemn it,' Bragg said in the statement. Wiley gave the jurors the Allen charge earlier on Friday, which are instructions reminding the jurors of how much time and money has gone into the case and how imperative it is that they reach a decision. Daniel Penny trial: Jurors return to deliberate lesser charge This comes after jurors told Wiley they were unable to come to a unanimous decision on the manslaughter charge against Penny, who also faces one for criminally negligent homicide. Penny has pleaded not guilty. Penny placed Neely in a chokehold for nearly six minutes after the man threatened to kill other passengers on the subway. The jury, made up of five men and seven women, deliberated after closing arguments began last week. Before the judge dismissed the manslaughter charge, the jury indicated that it could not decide on the manslaughter charge after it struggled with both Penny's justification for placing Neely in the chokehold and whether the chokehold actually caused Neely's death. The jury can find Penny guilty of criminally negligent homicide if it decides Penny acted recklessly or was careless. The lesser charge carries a maximum sentence of four years. Defense attorneys representing Penny petitioned a judge to have the charges against their client dismissed after Thanksgiving, but the judge ruled that the case would move to closing arguments. The defense rested on November 29 after electing not to have Penny testify in his own defense. Deliberations began after the seven-week trial that included 40 witnesses. Jury members also watched hours of video during the trial and listened to recordings of 911 calls that were placed following the incident. During their deliberations, the jury sent a series of notes to the judge, requesting key pieces of evidence, including cellphone video footage of Penny keeping the chokehold on Neely. The jury also requested that judge read definitions of 'recklessness' and 'negligence,' which spoke to the issue of Penny's justification for his actions. Jordan Neely’s cause of death is disputed Central to the case was whether the hold that Penny put on Neely led to the man’s death. The medical examiner, key to the prosecution, said the reason for Neely’s death was the chokehold, but the defense’s experts said this was not the case. He said it was a combination of four factors: restraint and struggle, sickle cell crisis, a synthetic drug in his system called K-2 and schizophrenia. Daniel Penny leaves the courtroom during a break in New York, Monday, Oct. 21, 2024. Jury selection is set to begin in the criminal trial of the U.S. Marine Corps veteran who placed a man in a deadly chokehold aboard a New York City subway train last year. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Penny told officers in an interview room that Neely told passengers on the subway, 'I’m gonna kill everybody. I’m gonna go to prison forever. I don’t care. I’m gonna do this.' The defense’s clinical pathologist, Dr. Satish Chundru, testified that Neely’s injuries suffered in the 2023 incident, along with video shot by passengers, did not indicate that Neely died from the chokehold applied by Penny. Chundru, citing medical records, testified that the location and extent of the bruising Neely suffered, along with other factors, led him to conclude that the chokehold was not fatal. In addition to the bruising on Neely’s neck, Chundru testified that there was a small amount of petechiae — small red spots caused by subsurface bleeding — on his eyelids. Jay-Z accused of raping 13-year-old in 2000 with Diddy Chundru concluded that Neely died from 'the combined effects' of synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint and a blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during exertion. Prosecutors maintained that Penny's actions are directly connected to Neely's death. 'I’m sure that you had absolutely no question in your mind about what caused Jordan Neely's death. It’s too obvious,' Yoran said during her closing argument. 'This is a clear case of death by chokehold.' Daniel Penny encounters Jordan Neely Jurors learned during the trial that Neely was begging for money May 1, 2023, but that he began to shout to passengers that he was willing to die or go to jail.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Testimony included that Neely, who sometimes entertained passengers as an Elvis impersonator aboard the subway, began acting erratically and began making threats to passengers, witnesses said. Penny has said Neely lurched toward a woman with a small child and said, 'I will kill.' Penny put his arm around Neely’s neck, took him to the floor, and held Neely there, with Penny’s legs around him, for close to six minutes, bystander videos show. Neely had stopped moving at roughly the last minute, witnesses said. Penny’s defense attorneys asked jury members to put themselves in the shoes of those aboard the train, while prosecutors countered that Penny acted too aggressively and was forceful and reckless in responding to Penny. Defense attorney Steven Raiser told jurors during his closing argument that Neely was filled with rage when he entered the train and was not afraid of any consequences. However, prosecutors argued that despite Neely’s actions, Penny went too far. 'You obviously cannot kill someone because they are crazy and ranting and looking menacing, no matter what it is that they are saying,' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran told jurors during her closing argument, according to The Associated Press. Raiser told jurors this week that his client could not release Neely from the hold without putting others in danger. He also said that Penny never applied enough pressure to Neely to cause his death. Prosecutors disagreed, citing Penny’s military experience. 'He was trained in this,' Yoran said during her closing argument, referring to the chokehold, according to The New York Times, 'and yet he continued with the foreseeable and tragic results.'

Daniel Penny trial: Jurors return to deliberate lesser charge	(NewsNation) — Jurors head back to New York City court Monday morning to continue deliberating whether they will convict Daniel Penny with criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely on a subway train last May. Penny faced two charges, both of which he pleaded not guilty: One of second-degree manslaughter and another of criminally negligent homicide. However, Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed the more severe manslaughter count Friday afternoon after jurors said they were deadlocked on it. David Tarras, head of the federal criminal defense practice at Rossen Law, tells NewsNation this was an 'unusual' move. If Penny is found guilty, his legal team has already said they will file an appeal. Should Penny be convicted of criminally negligent homicide, he faces up to four years in prison. Had manslaughter still been on the table, he could have gotten 15 years. Forever chemicals tainting food supply, destroying American farmers Jordan Neely's father sues Daniel Penny Neely's father, Andre Zachary, sued Daniel Penny alleging negligence, assault and battery that led to the death of his unarmed, 30-year-old son. On May 1, 2023, Penny, now 26, placed Neely in a chokehold for about six minutes after Neely, who was homeless, started shouting and acting erratically on a crowded, underground train. According to the lawsuit filed Wednesday, Zachary is seeking a judgment awarding damages 'in a sum which exceeds the jurisdictional limits of all lower Courts which would otherwise have jurisdiction.' Penny’s lawyer Steven Raiser said the timing of the lawsuit is 'unfortunate.' 'We will not be distracted by this attempt to attack Danny while he is under such tremendous stress,' Raiser said in a statement Thursday. But Christopher Neely, Jordan’s uncle, maintained that Neely didn’t deserve to die, the Associated Press reported. 'What gave Daniel Penny the right to choke Jordan nearly for six minutes?' He said outside the courthouse last week. 'He had an option to go to another car. He had the option to say something and not do nothing.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/daniel-penny-trial-jurors-deliberate-lesser-charge/	2024-12-09T04:43:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24341623325034.jpg?w=900
Jay-Z accused of raping 13-year-old in 2000 with Diddy	(NewsNation) — Rap mogul and entrepreneur Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, is accused of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000, alongside defamed music star Sean 'Diddy' Combs, an amended complaint obtained by NewsNation alleges. The victim, identified as 'Jane Doe,' alleges that the pair of stars assaulted her at an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty. She was invited by a limousine driver after the Video Music Awards in Manhattan in September 2000. Originally filed in October 2024, the suit named only Diddy. Sunday's amended complaint identifies Jay-Z as 'Celebrity A,' who was accused of raping the 13-year-old while 'Celebrity B,' a female, watched. Anonymous Diddy accuser revealed as NHL player’s ex-wife Court documents also accuse Jay-Z of being present during 'many such instances.' 'He believes he is above the law. He is not,' the filing reads. 'His close friend Shawn Carter has been with Combs during many such instances described herein. Both perpetrators must face justice.' The suit also accuses Jay-Z of 'orchestrating a conspiracy of harassment, bullying and intimidation against Plaintiff’s lawyers, their families, employees and former associates in an attempt to silence Plaintiff from naming Jay-Z herein.' NewsNation has reached out to Jay-Z's lawyer for comment. What’s happened since Diddy was indicted? Diddy has pleaded not guilty to federal sex trafficking charges contained in an indictment unsealed the day after his Sept. 16 arrest. Charges include allegations he coerced and abused women for years, aided by associates and employees, and silenced victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings. He has remained incarcerated pending a May 5 trial after two judges denied bail in rulings being appealed to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Russian state news agencies say ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad...	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad fled to Moscow on Sunday, Russian media reported, hours after a stunning rebel advance took over the capital of Damascus and ended the Assad family’s 50 years of iron rule. The Russian agencies, Tass and RIA, cited an unidentified Kremlin source on Assad and his family being given asylum in Moscow, his longtime ally and protector. The Associated Press was not immediately able to verify the reports but contacted the Kremlin for comment. RIA also said Moscow had received guarantees from Syrian insurgents of the security of Russian military bases and diplomatic posts in Syria. Assad reportedly left Syria early Sunday, and Syrians have been pouring into streets echoing with celebratory gunfire after a stunning rebel advance reached the capital, ending the Assad family’s 50 years of iron rule. The swiftly moving events have raised questions about the future of the country and the wider region. Russia has requested an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council discuss the situation in Syria, Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the U.N., Dmitry Polyansky, posted on Telegram. Joyful crowds gathered in squares in Damascus, waving the Syrian revolutionary flag in scenes that recalled the early days of the Arab Spring uprising, before a brutal crackdown and the rise of an insurgency plunged the country into a nearly 14-year civil war. Others gleefully ransacked the presidential palace and residence after Assad and other top officials vanished. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, a former al-Qaida commander who cut ties with the group years ago and says he embraces pluralism and religious tolerance, leads the biggest rebel faction and is poised to chart the country's future. In his first public appearance since fighters entered the Damascus suburbs Saturday, al-Golani visited the sprawling Umayyad Mosque and called Assad's fall 'a victory to the Islamic nation.' Calling himself by his given name, Ahmad al-Sharaa, and not his nom de guerre, he told hundreds of people that Assad had made Syria 'a farm for Iran’s greed.' The rebels face the daunting task of healing bitter divisions in a country ravaged by war and still split among armed factions. Turkey-backed opposition fighters are battling U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the north, and the Islamic State group is still active in some remote areas. Syrian state television broadcast a rebel statement early Sunday saying Assad had been overthrown and all prisoners had been released. They called on people to preserve the institutions of 'the free Syrian state.' The rebels later announced a curfew in Damascus from 4 p.m. to 5 a.m. The rebels said they freed people held at the notorious Saydnaya prison, where rights groups say thousands were tortured and killed. A video circulating online purported to show rebels breaking open cell doors and freeing dozens of female prisoners, many of whom appeared shocked. At least one small child was seen among them. 'This happiness will not be completed until I can see my son out of prison and know where is he,' said one relative, Bassam Masr. 'I have been searching for him for two hours. He has been detained for 13 years.' Rebel commander Anas Salkhadi later appeared on state TV and sought to reassure Syria's religious and ethnic minorities, saying: 'Syria is for everyone, no exceptions. Syria is for Druze, Sunnis, Alawites, and all sects.' 'We will not deal with people the way the Assad family did,' he added. Celebrations in the capital Damascus residents prayed in mosques and celebrated in squares, calling, 'God is great.' People chanted anti-Assad slogans and honked car horns. Teenage boys picked up weapons apparently discarded by security forces and fired into the air. Revelers filled Umayyad Square, where the Defense Ministry is located. Some waved the three-starred Syrian flag that predates the Assad government and was adopted by the revolutionaries. Elsewhere, many parts of the capital were empty and shops were closed. Soldiers and police left their posts and fled, and looters broke into the Defense Ministry. Videos showed families wandering the presidential palace, some carrying stacks of plates and other household items. 'It’s like a dream. I need someone to wake me up,' said opposition fighter Abu Laith, adding the rebels were welcomed in Damascus with 'love.' At the Justice Ministry, where rebels stood guard, Judge Khitam Haddad said they were protecting documents from the chaos. Outside, some residents sought information about relatives who disappeared under Assad. The rebels 'have felt the pain of the people,' said one woman, giving only her first name, Heba. She worried about possible revenge killings by the rebels, many of whom appeared to be underage. Syria’s al-Watan newspaper, which was historically pro-government, wrote: 'We are facing a new page for Syria. We thank God for not shedding more blood.' It added that media workers should not be blamed for publishing past government statements, saying it 'only carried out the instructions.' A statement from the Alawite sect that has formed the core of Assad's base called on young Syrians to be 'calm, rational and prudent and not to be dragged into what tears apart the unity of our country.' The rebels mainly come from the Sunni Muslim majority in Syria, which also has sizable Druze, Christian and Kurdish communities. In Qamishli in the northeast, a Kurdish man slapped a statue of the late leader Hafez Assad with his shoe. Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said the government was ready to 'extend its hand' to the opposition and turn its functions over to a transitional government. A video shared on Syrian opposition media showed armed men escorting him from his office and to the Four Seasons hotel on Sunday. Anwar Gargash said Assad's destination at this point is a 'footnote in history,' comparing it to the long exile of German Kaiser Wilhelm II after World War I. Calls for an orderly transition The rebel advances since Nov. 27 were the largest in recent years, and saw the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs fall within days as the Syrian army melted away. Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, which provided crucial support to Assad throughout the uprising, abandoned him as they reeled from other conflicts. The end of Assad’s rule was a major blow to Iran and its allies, already weakened by conflict with Israel. Iran, which had strongly backed him throughout the civil war, said Syrians should decide their future 'without destructive, coercive, foreign intervention.' The Iranian Embassy in Damascus was ransacked after apparently having been abandoned. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile said Israeli troops had seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights established in 1974, saying it was to protect Israeli residents after Syrian troops abandoned positions. Israel's military later warned residents of five southern Syria communities to stay home for their safety, and didn’t respond to questions. Israel captured the Golan in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it. The international community, except for the United States, views it as occupied, and the Arab League on Sunday condemned what it called Israel’s efforts to take advantage of Assad’s downfall occupy more territory. The rebels are led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, which has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. Al-Golani, has sought to recast the group as a moderate and tolerant force. 'Golani has made history and sparked hope among millions of Syrians,' said Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group. 'But he and the rebels now face a formidable challenge ahead.' The U.N.’s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, called Saturday for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition.' The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key regional mediator, hosted an emergency meeting of foreign ministers and top officials from eight countries with interests in Syria late Saturday. They included Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Turkey. Majed al-Ansari, Qatar’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, said they agreed on the need 'to engage all parties on the ground,' including the HTS, and that the main concern is 'stability and safe transition.' ___ Sewell reported from Beirut.

MANAMA, Bahrain (Reuters) —The United States will maintain its presence in eastern Syria and will take measures necessary to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Daniel Shapiro said on Sunday. Speaking hours after Syrian rebels announced they had toppled Bashar al-Assad's government, Shapiro called on all parties to protect civilians, particularly minorities, and to respect international norms. 'We are aware that the chaotic and dynamic circumstances on the ground in Syria could give ISIS space to find the ability to become active, to plan external operations, and we're determined to work with those partners to continue to degrade their capabilities,' he told the Manama Dialogue security conference in Bahrain's capital. '(We're determined) to ensure (Islamic State's) enduring defeat, to ensure the secure detention of ISIS fighters and the repatriation of displaced persons,' Shapiro added. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which spearheaded the rebel advances across western Syria, was formerly an al Qaeda affiliate known as the Nusra Front until its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, severed ties with the global jihadist movement in 2016. Western governments, which have shunned the Assad-led state for years, must decide how to deal with a new administration in which HTS looks set to have influence. HTS is a globally designated terrorist group.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/international-headlines/us-will-remain-in-eastern-syria-and-seek-to-prevent-is-resurgence-pentagon-says/	2024-12-08T03:49:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24343438098826.jpg?w=900
Syrian government falls to fast-moving rebels, ending 50 years of...	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The Syrian government collapsed early Sunday, falling to a lightning rebel offensive that seized control of the capital of Damascus and sent crowds into the streets to celebrate the end of the Assad family's 50 years of iron rule. Syrian state television aired a video statement by a group of men saying that President Bashar Assad had been overthrown and all prisoners had been set free. The man who read the statement said the opposition group, known as the Operations Room to Conquer Damascus, called on all rebel fighters and citizens to preserve the institutions of 'the free Syrian state.' The statement emerged hours after the head of a Syrian opposition war monitor said Assad had left the country for an undisclosed location, fleeing ahead of insurgents who said they had entered Damascus following a remarkably swift advance across the country. Many of the capital’s residents were in disbelief at the speed at which Assad lost his hold on the country after nearly 14 years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced half the country's prewar population of 23 million and drew in several foreign powers. Celebrations erupt across the capital As daylight broke over Damascus, crowds gathered to pray in the city’s mosques and to celebrate in the squares, chanting 'God is great.' People also chanted anti-Assad slogans and honked car horns. Teen boys picked up weapons that had apparently been discarded by security forces and fired them in the air. Revelers filled Umayyad Square in the city center, where the Defense Ministry is located. Men fired celebratory gunshots into the air and some waved the three-starred Syrian flag that predates the Assad government and was adopted by the revolutionaries. A few kilometers (miles) away, Syrians stormed the presidential palace, tearing up portraits of the toppled president. Soldiers and police officers left their posts and fled, and looters broke into the Defense Ministry. Videos from Damascus showed families wandering into the presidential palace, with some emerging carrying stacks of plates and other household items. 'I did not sleep last night, and I refused to sleep until I heard the news of his fall,' said Mohammed Amer Al-Oulabi, 44, who works in the electricity sector. 'From Idlib to Damascus, it only took them (the opposition forces) a few days, thank God. May God bless them, the heroic lions who made us proud.' Syria’s al-Watan newspaper, which was historically pro-government, wrote: 'We are facing a new page for Syria. We thank God for not shedding more blood. We believe and trust that Syria will be for all Syrians.' The newspaper added that media workers should not be blamed for publishing government statements in the past. 'We only carried out the instructions and published the news they sent us,' it said. 'It quickly became clear now that it was false.' A statement from the Alawite sect — to which Assad belongs and which has formed the core of his base — called on young Syrians to be 'calm, rational and prudent and not to be dragged into what tears apart the unity of our country.' Assad's whereabouts are unknown Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said in a video statement that the government was ready to 'extend its hand' to the opposition and turn its functions over to a transitional government. A video shared on Syrian opposition media showed a group of armed men escorting him out of his office and to the Four Seasons hotel on Sunday. The prime minister had earlier told the Al Arabiya news network that he does not know where Assad and the defense minister are. He said he lost communication with Assad late Saturday. Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told The Associated Press that Assad took a flight Sunday from Damascus. A senior diplomat from the United Arab Emirates, which had sought to rehabilitate Assad's image and has welcomed high-profile exiles in recent years, declined to comment on his whereabouts when asked by reporters at a conference in Bahrain. Anwar Gargash said Assad's destination at this point is a 'footnote in history,' comparing it to the long exile of German Kaiser Wilhelm II after World War I. Assad has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war, including a 2013 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of the capital. There was no immediate comment from Iran, which had been Assad’s staunchest supporter. The Iranian Embassy in Damascus was ransacked after apparently having been abandoned. AP footage showed broken windows and documents scattered in the entryway. Opposition forces had not reached Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured areas on the outskirts of the capital following a yearslong siege. Calls for an orderly transition as it remains unclear what comes next The rebel advances since Nov. 27 were the largest in recent years, and saw the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs fall in a matter of days as the Syrian army melted away. Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, which provided crucial support to Assad throughout the uprising, abandoned him in the final days as they reeled from other conflicts. The rebels are led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, which has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. Its leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has sought to remake the group’s image, cutting ties with al-Qaida, ditching hard-line officials and vowing to embrace pluralism and religious tolerance. HTS set up a 'salvation government' in 2017 to administer a large region in northwestern Syria under its control. 'Golani has made history and sparked hope among millions of Syrians,' said Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and an expert on Syrian groups. 'But he and the rebels now face a formidable challenge ahead. One can only hope they rise to the occasion.' The U.N.’s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, called Saturday for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, whose country is Assad’s chief international backer, said he feels 'sorry for the Syrian people.' The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key regional mediator, hosted an emergency meeting of foreign ministers and top officials from eight countries with interests in Syria late Saturday. The participants included Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Turkey. Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman and an adviser to the prime minister, told reporters that they agreed on the need 'to engage all parties on the ground,' including the HTS, and that the main concern is 'stability and safe transition.' The Israeli military said Sunday it has deployed forces in a demilitarized buffer zone along its northern frontier with Syria following the rebel offensive there. The military, which said it also sent troops to 'other places necessary for its defense,' said the deployment was meant to provide security for residents of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast war and the international community, except for the United States, views it as occupied. ___ Sewell reported from Beirut.
