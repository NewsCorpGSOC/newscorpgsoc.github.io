Galaxy Gas: What is it and what are the dangers of misuse?	(NewsNation) — It started with a video of a man in a fast-food restaurant taking a hit from a flavored whipped cream canister called Galaxy Gas. He showed off how deep the can made his voice, racking up millions of views and shares as others followed. Now, when you search 'Galaxy Gas' on TikTok you’re met with a warning that some substances can be dangerous when misused. The app has scrubbed many of the viral clips, but that was after hundreds of thousands of similar videos were posted of people 'whiffing' Galaxy Gas to get high. The cans are easily available online or at big brand-name stores. When you visit Galaxy Gas’ website, you now must agree to a disclosure statement before scrolling. The company sent NewsNation a statement saying its products are for culinary use only, and misuse of any kind is prohibited. Indiana police seize nearly 124 kilos of cocaine in traffic stop What is Galaxy Gas? Nitrous oxide is so-called laughing gas. Dentists and doctors use it for procedures but say it’s not safe for teens to use without medical assistance because it could be deadly. 'These children have underdeveloped brains,' Dr. Sulagna Misra, founding physician at Misra Wellness, told NewsNation. 'They're getting instant gratification high, and there's no oversight. … You can die from one use of this. One prolonged, abnormal, wrong misuse, no supervision — you can die.' Titan submersible CEO was ‘a murderer’: Titanic expedition leader What are the long-term effects? A U.S. substance abuse study suggests that about 13 million Americans ages 12 and older had misused nitrous oxide in their lifetime. Misra said it’s all about reminding teens the short-term high isn’t worth the potential long-term brain damage. In the United States, the misuse of nitrous oxide is rising rapidly. 'People have this sort of super hero syndrome where they think nothing's going to affect them until they wind up in a hospital sick,' psychotherapist Dr. Lisa Palmer said. Misuse of nitrous oxide can impair the body’s metabolism of vitamin B12, which is essential for maintaining the insulation and protection of nerves in the brain and spinal cord. Long-term misuse can lead to range of neurological, blood-related and psychiatric complications, including nerve damage and psychosis, according to a January study from the Yale School of Medicine.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/galaxy-gas-what-is-it-dangers/	2024-09-18T05:16:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-1815420415.jpg?w=900
Pregnant migrants balance journey to childbirth, asylum	(NewsNation) — Leticia Alvarez didn’t realize she was pregnant when she left Venezuela, determined like millions of other asylum-seekers to trade the political persecution and hardships for new opportunities elsewhere. Alvarez learned she was 13 weeks pregnant in Panama after she developed intense belly pain early in her family’s trek to the Mexico-U.S. border. The news pushed the 25-year-old into a population of migrant women who navigate the already stressful process of giving birth while also seeking asylum in a new country. Abbott announces Texas crackdown on Venezuelan gang In 2021, President Joe Biden reversed a Trump-era policy that allowed pregnant women or nursing mothers to be detained by border officials. Despite the change, the American Civil Liberties Union submitted a petition with more than 900 signatures that called for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to change its policy to minimize harm to women who are pregnant, postpartum, or nursing, saying that mothers-to-be continue to be mistreated. Yet for Alvarez, pregnancy and migrant-related challenges pale to what she would have faced had she remained home. 'If I would have been pregnant in my country, I would be dead with my baby,' Alvarez told NewsNation in Spanish. Searching for a new life across the border Alvarez and her family needed 15 days to reach the U.S., traveling mainly by bus thanks to money she and her husband, Lisandro Escola, saved. But the couple, along with Alvarez’s sister, niece and niece’s father, also walked for two days, including through the treacherous jungles of the Darien Gap, a 60-mile stretch of rainforest that sits on the border of Colombia and Panama and connects Central and South America. The area is known to be dangerous, considering its tough terrain and steep mountains, but it has become a main thoroughfare for migrants making the journey to the southern border. 'It was exhausting because you fight to get out of the jungle, and (it was) traumatic because you see infinite amounts of things that are not told but are carried in the mind,' said Alvarez, who fell several times in the jungle. 'Once you start the trip, you don’t stop walking.' Anxiety filled Alvarez once she learned she was expecting, including fears she could lose her baby. Leticia Alvarez gave birth to her first child, Sophie, at Cook County Hospital in Chicago after making the journey from Venezuela. (Photo courtesy of Leticia Alvarez) She and Escola were separated from her relatives, who remained in Mexico City after they ran out of money. Alvarez and Escola crossed near McAllen, Texas, and surrendered to border officials. Alvarez was immediately released but said Escola was held at the Joe Corley Detention Center for seven months. She says she doesn’t know why. In late January, the Venezuelan government announced that it would halt repatriation flights from the U.S. as of Feb. 13 in response to the economic sanctions that the United States reimposed on Venezuela after previously lifting them in 2023, according to information provided by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico. With her husband in federal custody, Alvarez flew to Chicago and then traveled by car to Indianapolis, where she worked a construction job. She says she worked from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, cleaning and helping lay ceramic tiles and flooring in a newly constructed building along with other duties. She saw a doctor only once in three months, fearing the cost. Alvarez saw her first Chicago doctor in early January. Two months later, she gave birth to a baby girl, Sophia, who entered the world at 8 pounds, 9 ounces. Leticia Alvarez and her husband Lisandro Escola have been married since 2021 but were separated nearly all of Alvarez's pregnancy (Photo courtesy of Leticia Alvarez) Two weeks after that, Escola was freed from detention, but by then, Alvarez was carrying the emotional toll. 'Going through the pregnancy alone is very hard and very sad,' Alvarez told NewsNation. 'All you want is to be accompanied at that moment, and I was alone.' The costs of migrant pregnancy Over the past two years, the health system for Illinois’ largest county has treated more than 35,000 patients, including 670 pregnant women. The health system connects women to prenatal care and since 2022 has spent more than $30 million on migrant medical care, a spokeswoman for Cook County Health told NewsNation. Like Chicago-area locals facing economic hardship, migrants are eligible for financial assistance. Of those who apply, 99.5% receive a 100% discount, with the health system’s operating budget absorbing the costs, the spokeswoman said.

(Sandra Sanchez/Border Report Photo) In New York, which has processed more than 225,000 migrants, NYC Health + Hospitals assisted 300 babies born to asylum-seekers in 2023 while also contributing 2.1 million baby wipes, 400,000 diapers and 100,000 bottles of baby food and formula, National Public Radio reported last year. Border arrests rose slightly in August; Encounters at ports of entry hold steady In Denver, city officials have spent $90 million on migrants this year, some new arrivals who have given birth find difficulty adjusting. Denver Health, the city's safety net hospital, lost about $2 million in 2023, according to The Denver Post, which reported that the facility provided about $136 million in care it didn't receive compensation for. In the past year, the hospital provided medical care for 8,000 migrants from Central America, which made 20,000 visits to the hospital for care, including childbirth, the report said. The hospital's CEO told the newspaper that the facility isn't reimbursed by the state or federal government to cover the cost of migrant health care, which runs into the millions. Hospital officials did not immediately return an email from NewsNation seeking details on migrant childbirth costs absorbed by the health system. Ivanni Herrera was eight months pregnant when her family’s shelter assignment in Denver ended. She was told she could seek care at a local hospital, where the costs of her appointments and the baby’s delivery would be covered by Medicaid, according to The Associated Press. She declined the help. 'How could I sleep in a warm place when my son is cold on the street?' she told the AP. Denver city officials have committed to keeping families off the streets and, in turn, have helped thousands of migrants gain work authorization. As she waits, Herrera has no means of regular income. She told the AP she owes $18,000 in medical bills because she forgot to sign up for Medicaid. 'I’m afraid they’re going to deport me,' she said. What Chicago migrant care looks like Doctors working within Illinois’ Cook County Health System say they strive to provide the same care to migrants and asylum-seekers as anyone else. The biggest challenge, however, is higher levels of fractured care experienced by migrants because of the countries from where they came from and the amount of time that may have passed since their last appointment. 'A pregnancy really can’t wait for you to be in the best possible place to get your care,' Dr. Mary Arlandson, an attending physician and OBGYN at Chicago’s Stroger Hospital, told NewsNation. Mexican drug cartels are operating in Southern Colorado, DEA says Doctors are not able to make up for lost time. But they can assess what care a woman needs at the time and help them navigate a pregnancy that is stressful even without challenges like learning a new city, a lack of work and finding transportation to appointments. 'The type of person who would take that journey is probably categorically different than the person who decides they’re not up for that,' Arlandson said. Since Sophia’s birth, Alvarez has struggled at times with postpartum depression. The family resides in a rented room as they await permanent living conditions. While Alvarez remains home with the couple's daughter, Escola said that her husband works construction from time to time and handles all of the young family's expenses. Alvarez says Sophia is adjusting as her parents wait for necessities like work authorizations and immigration court appearances. She says that ever since she learned she was pregnant, she has only thought about the opportunities that await her daughter if she and her husband can do their part. For now, things are as good as they can be. 'The baby is fine, thank God,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/pregnant-migrants-childbirth-asylum/	2024-09-18T03:00:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/LeticiaAlvarez.jpg?w=715
Hezbollah is hit by a wave of exploding pagers that killed at lea...	BEIRUT (AP) — Pagers used by hundreds of members of the militant group Hezbollah exploded near-simultaneously Tuesday in Lebanon and Syria, killing at least nine people, including an 8-year-old girl, and wounding several thousand, officials said. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for what appeared to be a sophisticated remote attack. An American official said Israel briefed the United States on Tuesday after the conclusion of the operation, in which small amounts of explosive secreted in the pagers were detonated. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the information publicly. The Israeli military declined to comment. Among those wounded was Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon. The mysterious explosions came amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which have exchanged fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the war in Gaza. The pagers that blew up were apparently acquired by Hezbollah after the group’s leader ordered members in February to stop using cellphones, warning they could be tracked by Israeli intelligence. A Hezbollah official told The Associated Press the pagers were a new brand, but declined to say how long they had been in use. Taiwanese company Gold Apollo said Wednesday that it authorized its brand on the AR-924 pagers used by the Hezbollah militant group, but the devices were produced and sold by a company called BAC. At about 3:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, as people shopped for groceries, sat in cafes or drove cars and motorcycles in the afternoon traffic, the pagers in their hands or pockets started heating up and then exploding — leaving blood-splattered scenes and panicking bystanders. It appeared that many of those hit were members of Hezbollah, but it was not immediately clear if non-Hezbollah members also carried any of the exploding pagers. The blasts were mainly in areas where the group has a strong presence, particularly a southern Beirut suburb and in the Beqaa region of eastern Lebanon, as well as in Damascus, according to Lebanese security officials and a Hezbollah official. The Hezbollah official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. The explosions came hours after Israel’s internal security agency said it had foiled an attempt by Hezbollah to kill a former senior Israeli security official using a planted explosive device that could be remotely detonated. The United States 'was not aware of this incident in advance' and was not involved, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. 'At this point, we’re gathering information.' Experts said the pager explosions pointed to a long-planned operation, possibly carried out by infiltrating the supply chain and rigging the devices with explosives before they were delivered to Lebanon. Whatever the means, it targeted an extraordinary breadth of people with hundreds of small explosions — wherever the pager carrier happened to be — that left some maimed. One online video showed a man picking through produce at a grocery store when the bag he was carrying at his hip explodes, sending him sprawling to the ground and bystanders running. At overwhelmed hospitals, wounded were rushed in on stretchers, some with missing hands, faces partly blown away or gaping holes at their hips and legs, according to AP photographers. On a main road in central Beirut, a car door was splattered with blood and the windshield cracked. Lebanon Health Minister Firas Abiad told Qatar's Al Jazeera network at least nine people were killed, including an 8-year-old girl, and some 2,750 were wounded — 200 of them critically — by the explosions. Most had injuries in the face, hand, or around the abdomen. It appeared eight of the dead belonged to Hezbollah. The group issued a statement confirming at least two members were killed in the pager bombings. One of them was the son of a Hezbollah member in Parliament, according to the Hezbollah official who spoke anonymously. The group later issued announcements that six other members were killed Tuesday, though it did not specify how. 'We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression that also targeted civilians,' Hezbollah said, adding that Israel will 'for sure get its just punishment.' Iranian state-run IRNA news agency said that the country’s ambassador, Mojtaba Amani, was superficially wounded by an exploding pager and was being treated at a hospital. Previously, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had warned the group’s members not to carry cellphones, saying they could be used by Israel to track and target them. Sean Moorhouse, a former British Army officer and explosive ordnance disposal expert, said videos of the blasts suggested a small explosive charge — as small as a pencil eraser — had been placed into the devices. They would have had to have been rigged prior to delivery, very likely by Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, he said. Elijah J. Magnier, a Brussels-based senior political risk analyst, said he spoke with Hezbollah members who had examined pagers that failed to explode. What triggered the blasts, he said, appeared to be an error message sent to all the devices that caused them to vibrate, forcing the user to click on the buttons to stop the vibration. The combination detonated a small amount of explosives hidden inside and ensured that the user was present when the blast went off, he said. Israel has a long history of carrying out deadly operations well beyond its borders. This year, separate Israeli airstrikes in Beirut killed senior Hamas official Saleh Arouri and a top Hezbollah commander. A mysterious explosion in Iran, also blamed on Israel, killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ supreme leader. Israel has killed Hamas militants in the past with booby-trapped cellphones and it’s widely believed to have been behind the Stuxnet computer virus attack on Iran’s nuclear program in 2010. The pager bombings are likely to stoke Hezbollah's worries about vulnerabilities in security and communications as Israeli officials are threaten to escalate their monthslong conflict. The near-daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah have killed hundreds in Lebanon and several dozen in Israel, and have displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, deplored the attack and warned that it marks 'an extremely concerning escalation in what is an already unacceptably volatile context.' On Tuesday, Israel said that halting Hezbollah’s attacks in the north to allow residents to return to their homes is now an official war goal. Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said the focus of the conflict is shifting from Gaza to Israel’s north and that time is running out for a diplomatic solution with Hezbollah. ___ This story has been updated to correct the name of the Hezbollah lawmaker’s son killed by a pager blast. ___ Associated Press writers Hussein Malla, Hassan Ammar, Fadi Tawil and Sarah El Deeb in Beirut; Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran; Michael Biesecker in Washington; Josef Federman in Jerusalem; Zeke Miller in Washington; and Edith M.

Titan submersible CEO was 'a murderer': Titanic expedition leader	(NewsNation) — The founder of OceanGate, who died in the Titan submersible implosion, was called a 'murderer' by a Titanic expedition leader after testimony revealed new details about the implosion. G. Michael Harris, founder of RMS Titanic, said Tuesday on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush was 'a complete, unequivocal narcissist, and in the end, a murderer.' 'He killed those people. He knew better,' Harris said, referring to the five individuals who died when the Titan imploded during a dive to the Titanic wreckage in June 2023. Titan implosion hearing: Key witness testifies on Day 2 The comments came as the U.S. Coast Guard conducted hearings into the disaster. Former OceanGate employees have testified about alleged mismanagement and safety lapses in the Titan's construction. One employee described Rush as more focused on making money than science, saying they had 'no confidence whatsoever' in the way the submersible was being built. Harris claimed that industry professionals had long harbored concerns about the Titan. 'We all knew about this. We all tried to reach out to him,' he said. The expedition leader also questioned why regulatory agencies hadn't intervened, calling it 'the biggest clown show in history.' Diddy indictment: Music mogul denied bail following indictment The hearings, which began this week, are expected to continue for 10 days. They include testimony from former employees and examinations of OceanGate's practices. Coast Guard investigators have released new evidence, including a photo of the Titan's wreckage on the ocean floor and an animation of its final journey. The submersible's last communication, sent moments before losing contact, indicated it was 'dropping two weights.' Harris speculated that this action was likely to slow the Titan's descent rather than attempt an emergency ascent as previously thought. He added that the victims likely died instantly.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/missing-titanic-tourist-submarine/titan-submersible-ceo-murderer-titanic/	2024-09-17T16:11:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/snapshot-2-2.jpg?w=900
Kamala Harris criticizes Trump rhetoric in NABJ interview	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris took questions Tuesday from the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia and addressed the controversial things her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has said on various issues. Among other topics, she talked about the threats of violence residents of the city of Springfield, Ohio, have faced after Trump made false claims about immigrants there kidnapping and eating people's pets. 5 takeaways from Harris’s interview with NABJ Saying 'there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe,' Harris also referenced Project 2025, which conservative organizations created as a blueprint for the next Republican presidential administration, as well as GOP-led efforts to restrict abortion access. Addressing the second assassination attempt against Trump, Harris said in the NABJ interview she feels safe under Secret Service protection. While she spoke with Trump on Tuesday and said he was glad he's safe, she added that his rhetoric on certain topics should be disqualifying. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs arrested in New York after indictment 'When you have that kind of microphone in front of you, you really ought to understand at a deep level that your words have meaning,' Harris said. 'Let’s turn the page and chart a new way forward and say you can’t have that microphone again.' Ashley Davis, a former official in the George W. Bush White House, and NewsNation political contributors A. Scott Bolden, Kurt Bardella and Denise Gitsham joined 'The Hill on NewsNation' to discuss harmful rhetoric. Bardella, a Democratic strategist, called out JD Vance for his misinformation about Haitian immigrants, pointing the finger at Republicans. 'This is not a both-sides issue,' he said. 'You don't get to lecture Democrats about rhetoric when you are the one advancing dangerous and disproven claims in Springfield that is resulting in people not being able to go to school because of bomb threats,' Bardella added. Davis countered that both sides have a responsibility to tone down their talking points, adding, 'I refuse to go on TV shows that argue, and we don't usually do this. I don't think it's right. ... I will never criticize Joe Biden, Barack Obama as a sitting president.' The economy and the Israel-Hamas war were also mentioned during the discussion. While Harris didn't say specifically how she would end it, she said the hostages need to come home, and there needs to be a path toward peace for Palestinians and Israel. This interview comes as the Harris campaign is spending time reaching out to both Black and young voters. Polls indicate that they feel energized about the Harris nomination. When surveyed by the NAACP, 78% of Black people said they felt as excited as they did when former President Barack Obama first ran for office. About 56% said they felt even more excited, NewsNation partner The Hill reports. Still, that same poll showed that over a quarter of younger Black men said they would support Harris' opponent, Republican Donald Trump, in this year's U.S. presidential election. How Americans can register to vote ahead of Election Day When it comes to reaching out to younger voters, the Harris-Walz campaign and Democratic National Convention are launching a weeklong effort to engage them. This includes going to college campuses. Obama even took to TikTok to talk with social media influencers about the importance of getting out there to register and vote. Pennsylvania, where the NABJ conference is being held, is also important to candidates running in the presidential election. Decision Desk HQ polling shows that Harris holds a small lead of 48.1% to Trump's 47.4%, making it a tight race.

Who else could be charged in the Diddy investigation?	(NewsNation) — A federal prosecutor said more people may be charged in connection to a federal indictment against Sean 'Diddy' Combs, saying that 'nothing is off the table.' 'We are not done,' U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said during a news conference Tuesday where he shared more details on Combs’ indictment. 'I can't take anything off the table. Anything is possible,' he said in response to a question about the possibility of more charges and defendants. 'Our investigation is very active and ongoing … developments are certainly foreseeable.' Combs was arrested in New York Monday and faces federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and transportation to engage in prostitution. 'We are disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution of Mr. Combs by the U.S. Attorney’s Office,' Combs attorney Marc Agnifilo said in a statement Monday. Timeline: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits Prosecutors allege Combs used the resources of his music empire to create 'a criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.' They also accuse him of having used his employees to help him engage in these activities. 'I definitely think more is coming,' Richard Schoenstein, a trial attorney and legal analyst, told NewsNation. 'The indictment said he did all these things in conjunction with other people, but it doesn’t name them, it does not name the co-conspirators … so there has to be more down the road.' 'It will be interesting to see who will become a defendant, who becomes a witness and who comes forward as a witness cooperating,' he said. Schoenstein added that Combs’ associates should be very concerned right now. 'The indictment alleges his associates helped him commit heinous crimes,' he said. 'If you're one of those associates, you have a lot to think about' on how you will go about participating in this investigation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/who-else-charged-diddy-investigation/	2024-09-17T10:27:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/664e237f8bd428.09397242.jpeg?w=900
‘Consequential presidents get shot at’: Trump at Michigan town ha...	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump campaigned Tuesday in Michigan, marking his first public event since an apparent second assassination attempt at his Florida golf course. Trump attended a town hall at the Dort Financial Center in Flint, Michigan. His former press secretary and current Arkansas governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, moderated the conversation. How Americans can register to vote ahead of Election Day The event comes two days after police say a man pushed the muzzle of an AK-style rifle through the fence perimeter of Trump’s Palm Beach golf course near where the former president was playing Sunday. A Secret Service agent saw the rifle and shot at the man, who fled the scene, leaving behind the firearm, a GoPro camera and two backpacks. No one was injured in the shooting, which took place about 5 miles away from the president’s Mar-a-Lago residence.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, right, during a town hall event at the Dort Financial Center, Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2024, in Flint, Mich. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The man is now in custody and faces gun charges. Addressing the dangers of the presidency, Trump stated, 'Only consequential presidents get shot at,' suggesting the attempts on his life validate his impact. There was an electric atmosphere inside the standing-room-only sports arena, where thousands of Trump supporters greeted the former president with a deafening roar when he took the stage. The overflowing crowd interrupted Trump’s discussion with Sanders with chants of 'God bless Trump!' and 'Fight, fight, fight' at various times. 'A lot of love in this room,' Trump remarked. Trump said he had a call with Vice President Kamala Harris and described it as 'very, very nice.' He did not provide details about the conversation's content. Trump, speaking for an hour, said, 'Secret Service did a hell of a job. Now, they do need more people, and they've been complaining about that for a long time.' Chris Cuomo called Donald Trump after second attempt on his life 'It’s a dangerous business, however, being president. It’s a little bit dangerous,' he said. Trump predicted dire consequences for the auto industry if he loses the upcoming election, claiming, 'If a tragedy happens and we don't win, there will be zero car jobs.' Throughout the town hall, he praised women's intelligence while recounting how a female witness spotted an armed individual.
