Russia and Ukraine exchange drone strikes as North Korea's top di...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia and Ukraine exchanged scores of drone strikes Wednesday as North Korea's top diplomat arrived in Russia for talks after his country reportedly deployed thousands of soldiers to help Moscow's war efforts. Ukraine's air force said that Russia launched 62 drones and one missile overnight, adding that 33 of them were intercepted and 25 were jammed. The drones struck a residential building and a kindergarten in Kyiv, injuring nine people, including a child, according to the city administration. 'Russian drones did not change their constant tactics — they approached the capital from different directions, at different heights,' it said. Russian attacks also targeted other regions of Ukraine, killing at least four and injuring about 30 others over the past 24 hours, authorities said. At the same time, Russian forces have pressed their slow-moving offensive in eastern Ukraine. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry announced the capture of the village of Kruhlyakivka in the Kharkiv region. The ministry said that air defenses downed 25 Ukrainian drones over several regions in the country's west and southwest. The new attacks come as North Korea's Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui traveled to Russia for talks that South Korea's spy agency said could involve discussions on sending additional troops to Russia and what the North would get in return. The Pentagon said North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia, and that they will likely fight against Ukraine 'over the next several weeks.' Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Tuesday that a 'relatively small number' of North Korean troops are now in the Kursk region, where Russia has struggled to push back a Ukrainian incursion. Speaking to the media on Wednesday during a trip to Iceland, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denied that his government had set a goal of capturing the Kursk nuclear power plant as Russia has suggested. 'If we wanted to occupy their nuclear station, we could do it, but we never wanted it,' he said. Talking about the 'victory plan' that he has presented to Ukraine's Western allies, Zelenskyy said that while many of them began to accept it, some told him that he wanted too much. 'Too much of what? We want to live. Is it too much? Just to live,' he said. Zelenskyy also complained that some confidential parts of his plan were leaked to the media, including Kyiv's call on the U.S. to provide long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles that was reported by The New York Times. 'They say that Ukraine wants or wanted a lot of missiles, like Tomahawks and etcetera, but it was confidential information between Ukraine and White House,' he said. 'How to understand these messages? So, it means between partners there is nothing confidential.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-and-ukraine-exchange-drone-strikes-as-north-koreas-top-diplomat-visits-moscow/	2024-10-30T07:29:40-07:00	
North Korean troops sent to Russia may be pleased to be there, ev...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The thousands of young soldiers North Korea has sent to Russia, reportedly to help fight against Ukraine, include many elite special forces, but that hasn't stopped speculation they'll be slaughtered because they have no combat experience, no familiarity with the terrain and will likely be dropped onto the most ferocious battlefields. That may be true, and soon. Observers say some of the troops have already arrived at the front. From the North Korean perspective, however, these soldiers might not be as miserable as outsiders think. They may, in fact, view their Russian tour with pride and as a rare chance to make good money, see a foreign country for the first time and win preferred treatment for their families back home, according to former North Korean soldiers. 'They are too young and won't understand exactly what it means. They'll just consider it an honor to be selected as the ones to go to Russia among the many North Korean soldiers,' said Lee Woong-gil, a former member of the same special forces unit, the Storm Corps. He came to South Korea in 2007. 'But I think most of them won’t likely come back home alive.' Troop deployment is Kim's ‘big gamble’ Worries about North Korea’s likely participation in the Russian-Ukraine war were highlighted this week when the Pentagon said North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia, and that they will likely fight against Ukraine 'over the next several weeks.' South Korea’s presidential office said Wednesday that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been moved close to battlefronts in western Russia. North Korea's troop deployment could mark a serious escalation of the almost three-year war. It caught many outside observers by surprise because North Korea has its own security headache, a festering standoff with the United States and South Korea over its nuclear program. Large North Korean troop casualties would be a major political blow for the country’s 40-year-old ruler, Kim Jong Un, whose government hasn't formally confirmed the deployment. But experts say Kim may see this as a way to get much needed foreign currency and security support from Russia in return for joining Russia's war against Ukraine. 'Kim Jong Un is taking a big gamble. If there are no large casualty numbers, he will get what he wants to some extent. But things will change a lot if many of his soldiers die in battle,' said Ahn Chan-il, a former North Korean army first lieutenant who is now head of the World Institute for North Korean Studies think tank in Seoul. Ordinary soldier's wage is less than $1, defectors say The Storm Corps, also known as the 11th Corps, is one of Kim’s top units. Its main missions would be infiltrating agents into South Korea, blowing up important facilities in the South and assassinating key figures in the event of war on the Korean Peninsula. Lee, who served in the Storm Corps in 1998-2003, recalled that his unit received better food and supplies than other units, but many members still suffered from malnutrition and tuberculosis. Despite a gradual economic recovery in North Korea over the past 30 years, defectors say the average monthly wage for ordinary North Korean workers and soldiers is less than $1. They say many people engage in capitalist market activities to make a living because the country's state rationing system remains largely broken. Russia is expected to pay all the costs related to the deployment of North Korean troops, including their wages, which observers estimate will be at least $2,000 per month for each person. About 90% to 95% of their stipends will likely go to Kim’s coffers, and the rest to the soldiers. This means one year of service in Russia would earn a North Korean soldier $1,200 to $2,400. That's big enough to prompt many young soldiers to volunteer for risky Russian tours, former soldiers say. Ahn said North Korea will likely offer other incentives meant to elevate the social standings of soldiers, such as membership in the ruling Workers’ Party and the right to move to Pyongyang, the country’s showcase capital. Kang Mi-Jin, a defector who runs a company analyzing North Korea’s economy, said even family members of soldiers sent to Russia could be given benefits such as good houses or entrance to good universities. Choi Jung-hoon, a former first lieutenant in North Korea’s army, said serving on foreign soil will attract many soldiers who are eager to see other countries for the first time. North Koreans are barred from accessing foreign news and need state approval to move from one province to another within the country. North Korean construction, logging and other workers sent abroad to bring in foreign currency have often been called 'slaves' by international human rights groups. But defectors testify that such overseas jobs are often better than staying in North Korea, and many used bribery and family connections to get them. 'North Korean soldiers would see going to Russia as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,' Ahn said. Ahn and other observers say such views could change if the soldiers see colleagues dying in large numbers. They say many North Korean soldiers could surrender to Ukraine forces and ask for resettlement in South Korea. North Korean soldiers lack familiarity of the terrain North Korean soldiers have been trained on the Korean Peninsula's mountainous terrain and are not familiar with the largely flat plain battlefields in the Russian-Ukraine war. They also don't understand modern warfare, including drone use, because North Korea hasn’t fought a big battle since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, experts say. 'My heart ached,' said Choi, now leader of an activist group in Seoul, when he saw a Ukraine-released video purportedly showing undersized North Korean soldiers believed to be in their late teens or early 20s. 'None would think they are going to Russia to die,' Choi said. 'But I think they're cannon fodder because they will be sent to the most dangerous sites and will surely be killed.' Leader Kim Jong Un may also be hoping that his troop offer will push Russia to share sophisticated and highly sensitive technology that he needs to perfect his nuclear-capable missiles. That transfer could depend on how long the war continues and how many more troops Kim will send. Nam Sung-wook, a former director of a think tank run by South Korea’s spy agency, said North Korea will likely get hundreds of millions of dollars because of the soldiers' wages. The soldiers will get direct experience of modern warfare but will likely die in large numbers, and Russia will be reluctant to hand over its high-tech missile technology, he said. 'North Korea will continue to hide its troop dispatches from its own people because the public will be agitated if they know their soldiers are being sent abroad to be killed,' said Nam, who is now a professor at Korea University in South Korea.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-north-korean-troops-sent-to-fight-in-ukraine-may-welcome-rare-tour/	2024-10-30T05:24:24-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israel issues evacuation warning for the enti...	The Israeli army issued an evacuation warning for residents in the entire eastern Lebanese city of Baalbeck, along with surrounding areas and key routes in the Bekaa Valley. The area marked for evacuation includes the ancient Roman temple complex, inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Lebanon’s Heath Ministry said more than 2,790 people have been killed and 12,700 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of October. Multiple United Nations agencies rallied Tuesday around their fellow organization, UNRWA, that provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after Israel’s parliament took steps to ban it in the coming months. The foreign ministers of Cyprus and Luxembourg say the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees is 'indispensable' to providing food, education and health care to Palestinians. Turkey’s Foreign Ministry called Israel’s decision a 'clear violation of international law.' United States President Joe Biden’s administration says it is seeking an explanation from Israel about its attack Tuesday on a town in northern Gaza that Palestinians say killed at least 88 people, including dozens of women and children. The death toll from more than a year of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has passed 43,000, Palestinian officials reported Monday, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli military says Tuesday’s strike on Gaza building was targeted JERUSALEM — An Israeli military official says the target of Tuesday’s attack on a five-story building that Gaza health officials reported resulted in scores of deaths was a spotter with binoculars in the building, and that the intent was not to destroy the structure. The military official agreed to provide details only on condition of anonymity, citing military protocol and the ongoing investigation into the incident. The official said Wednesday the building was not known to be a shelter for civilians, and that it collapsed as a result of the strike on the spotter. The Gaza Health Ministry said Tuesday that at least 70 people were killed in the first of two strikes on the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya, and that more than half of the victims were women and children. The Israeli military had earlier said it was investigating the strike. The Gaza Health Ministry’s casualty tolls do not differentiate between civilians and militant fighters. The official said there were discrepancies between the numbers of victims reported by authorities in Gaza and what Israeli intelligence indicates, and that the victims included known militants. The official did not provide detailed evidence to support that assertion. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people in recent months. It says it carries out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but the strikes often kill women and children. —By Adam Schreck Israeli hospital officials say rocket from Lebanon wounded 2 JERUSALEM — Hospital officials in Israel say a rocket fired from Lebanon has wounded two men, one seriously. The men were wounded by rocket shrapnel on Wednesday in Metula, an Israeli town just across the border from Lebanon, said a spokesperson for the Rambam Hospital, where they were airlifted. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israel since Oct. 8, 2023, when it opened fire in solidarity with Hamas a day after its cross-border attack from the Gaza Strip. All-out war erupted last month, when Israel carried out large waves of airstrikes and killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground invasion at the start of October. Israel issues an evacuation warning for the entire Baalbek city in eastern Lebanon BEIRUT — For the first time in the ongoing Israel-Hezbollah war, the Israeli army has issued an evacuation warning for residents in the entire eastern city of Baalbek, along with surrounding areas and key routes in the Bekaa Valley. Earlier Wednesday, a drone strike targeted a van on Lebanon's Aaraya highway, a major road linking Beirut to the Bekaa, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Lebanese capital, resulting in flames, according to Lebanese state media. Another vehicle in Bchamoun, roughly 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of Beirut, was also targeted, as reported by the state-run National News Agency. This is the first time in the conflict that the area is targeted. The number of casualties and the intended targets were not yet known. The area marked in Wednesday’s evacuation order includes the ancient Roman temple complex, inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. On Oct. 6, an Israeli strike hit some 700 meters (750 yards) away from the ancient citadel, which houses two of the largest Roman temples in the world. Norway wants clarity on Israel's obligation to Palestinians under international law OSLO, Norway — Norway is asking for a clarification on Israel’s responsibility under international law when preventing the United Nations, international humanitarian organizations and states from helping Palestinians. 'The international community cannot accept that the U.N., international humanitarian organizations and states face systematic obstacles to being able to work in Palestine and provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians under occupation,' Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Wednesday. 'It undermines the Palestinians’ right to vital aid. Then we have to react.' The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, also known as UNRWA, provides essential services to millions of Palestinians across the Middle East and has underpinned aid efforts in Gaza throughout the Israel-Hamas war. Legislation barring it from operating in Israel passed with an overwhelming majority Monday. Israel says UNRWA has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, with the militants siphoning off aid and using the agency’s facilities as shields. UNRWA denies the allegations, saying it is committed to neutrality and acts quickly to address any wrongdoing by its staff. Norway has called for a resolution in the U.N. General Assembly that asks the International Court of Justice 'to give an advisory opinion on the duties of Israel as an occupying power to facilitate aid to the population of Palestine.' Gahr Støre added that a number of countries have expressed support for the initiative, in addition to UNRWA. Under international law, Israel has an obligation to help the Palestinian population under occupation, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said. 'With this initiative, Norway wants to establish that no country can rise above its obligations under international law,' Barth Eide said. 'We see similar trends in other countries — that leaders try to undermine humanitarian law and aid work in situations of crisis and conflict. We must stop this development.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israel-issues-evacuation-warning-for-the-entire-baalbek-city-in-eastern-lebanon/	2024-10-30T04:51:25-07:00	
Israel must step in if it bans the UN agency that is a lifeline f...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations stressed Tuesday that if Israel puts in place new laws cutting ties with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, the Israeli government will have to meet their needs under international law. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a letter obtained by The Associated Press that there is no other alternative to the agency, known as UNRWA. It has been a lifeline during the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, and the Israeli legislation 'will have devastating consequences for Palestinian refugees' in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, he said. The U.N. agencies for children, health and migration also stressed that UNRWA is the 'backbone' of the world body’s operations in Gaza, where people have relied on its emergency food aid and health centers during the more than yearlong war, which has killed tens of thousands and left much of the enclave in ruins. The United Nations is heartened by statements of support for UNRWA from all quarters and countries, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, and 'we would very much appreciate efforts by any member state to help us get over this hurdle.' Israel has alleged that some of UNRWA’s 13,000 staffers in Gaza participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas that sparked the war. It's also accused hundreds of UNRWA staff of having militant ties and said it has found Hamas military assets in or under the agency’s facilities. Israel's new laws Two laws passed Monday could prevent UNRWA from continuing its work. Even the U.S., Israel's closest ally, joined many governments and humanitarian organizations in opposing the legislation, which doesn’t take effect for three months. Guterres sent the letter Tuesday to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlining his concerns. As an occupying power, under international humanitarian law, Israel is required to ensure the needs of the Palestinians are met, including for food, health care and education, Guterres said. And if Israel isn’t in a position to meet those needs, it has an obligation to allow and facilitate the activities of the U.N., and 'UNRWA is the principal means by which assistance is supplied to Palestinian refugees,' he said. If UNRWA's activities are restricted or halted, the secretary-general said, Israel would have to fill the vacuum 'to ensure the needs of the population are met.' 'Otherwise, it would be in violation of international law,' said Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon responded to the letter by saying, 'Rather than condemning UNRWA for turning a blind eye to terrorism and in some cases participating in terrorism, the U.N. instead condemns Israel.' He claimed in a statement that UNRWA isn’t interested in providing humanitarian aid to Gaza, calling it 'nothing but an arm of Hamas operating under the guise of the United Nations.' 'Israel will continue to facilitate humanitarian aid in Gaza according to international law,' Danon said, 'but UNRWA has failed in its mandate and is no longer the right agency for this job.' Dismay from U.N. agencies World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said UNRWA health workers have provided over 6 million medical consultations over the past year. They also offered immunizations, disease surveillance and screening for malnutrition, and UNRWA’s work 'couldn’t be matched by any agency — including WHO,' he said. Jeremy Laurence, spokesman for the U.N. human rights office, said that 'without UNRWA, the delivery of food, shelter, health care, education, amongst other things, to most of Gaza’s population would grind to a halt.' UNRWA was established by the U.N. General Assembly in 1949 to provide relief for Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes before and during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that followed Israel’s establishment, as well as their descendants. Israel faces criticism Timed to the Israeli laws, Norway announced Tuesday that it will ask the 193-nation General Assembly to request a ruling from the top United Nations court about whether Israel is obligated to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians by international organizations, including the U.N. The International Court of Justice in July condemned Israel’s rule over the Palestinian territories, declaring its occupation unlawful. The nonbinding opinion called on Israel to end its occupation and immediately halt settlement construction. Norway’s foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told the AP that Israel's policy is making it increasingly difficult for Palestinians to access life-saving assistance. He said Norway will argue that even if Israel's occupation is illegal, it has obligations, 'and we believe that these are not met.' Guterres told Netanyahu that while the Israeli laws prohibit any activity by UNRWA 'within the sovereign territory of the State of Israel,' the U.N. considers Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem part of the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel has no sovereignty because of its occupation. Meanwhile, at the U.N.’s regular Security Council meeting on the Middle East — this month open to all U.N. members — speakers supported UNRWA and virtually all called for immediate cease-fires in Gaza and Lebanon. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield expressed deep concern at the Israeli legislation, saying, 'right now there is no alternative to UNRWA when it comes to delivering food and other life-saving aid in Gaza.' She also called on Guterres 'to create a mechanism to review and address allegations that UNRWA personnel have ties to Hamas and other terrorist groups.' Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said its internal watchdog is working on that. He said a letter from the Israeli government last week raising specific undisclosed issues is also being looked at 'extremely seriously.' U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller went further, warning that the Israeli legislation 'poses risks for millions of Palestinians who rely on UNRWA for essential services.' Miller reiterated that the U.S. opposes the legislation and will be discussing it with Israel in the days ahead. He says there may be consequences under U.S. law and policy if it takes effect, referencing a letter that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent to their Israeli counterparts saying humanitarian aid must increase or the country risks losing military assistance. ___ Keaten reported from Geneva.

Humanitarian crisis in Gaza could escalate to famine	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) -- The U.N. World Food Programme warned Tuesday the humanitarian crisis in Gaza could soon turn into a famine if restrictions on aid continue. This comes after Israel passed two laws Monday that could stop a key U.N. agency from entering the area. 'We are deeply troubled by this legislation,' said Matthew Miller, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department. 'It poses risks for millions of Palestinians who rely on UNRWA for essential services.' UNRWA provides food, water, health care and education to refugees amid the Israel-Hamas war, and Miller said no other agency can currently take over. 'The work is absolutely critical and irreplaceable in Gaza right now,' he said. The Israeli laws will not take effect for months, but Miller said the U.S. could take action against its ally. 'There could be consequences under U.S. law and U.S. policy for the implementation of this legislation,' he said. UNRWA called the new laws unprecedented. 'We are the backbone of the aid operation,' said John Fowler, a spokesperson for UNRWA. 'That's not just us saying that. All other agencies from the U.N. rely completely on our logistical platforms, our thousands of staff to be able to do their work.' However, Israel accuses UNRWA of being 'a terrorist front' for Hamas, saying some of its staff participated in the Oct. 7 attack and even more have militant ties. 'These are not aid workers,' said Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. 'These are savages who have seized UNRWA Gaza and transformed it into a Hamas chapter. These heinous criminal scandals can no longer be swept under the rug.' UNRWA fired nine workers after an investigation but denies it knowingly helps armed groups. The U.S. and other allies temporarily paused funding to the agency over the allegations.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/humanitarian-crisis-in-gaza-could-escalate-to-famine/	2024-10-29T13:46:45-07:00	
Ukraine’s Zelenskyy says war with Russia is being pushed 'beyond ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday the thousands of North Korean soldiers expected to reinforce Russian troops on the front line in Ukraine are pushing the almost three-year war beyond the borders of the warring parties. Western leaders say North Korea has sent some 10,000 soldiers to help Russia’s military campaign and warned that its involvement in a European war could also unsettle relations in the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan and Australia. Zelenskyy said he spoke to South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and told him that 3,000 North Korean soldiers are already at military bases close to the Ukranian front line and that he expects that deployment to increase to 12,000. South Korea, which has been in close contact with NATO, the U.S. and the European Union about the latest developments, warned last week it could send arms to Ukraine in retaliation for the North's involvement. 'There is only one conclusion — this war is internationalized and goes beyond the borders' of Ukraine and Russia, Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. The Ukrainian president also said he agreed with Yeol to step up their countries' cooperation and exchange more intelligence between them, as well as develop concrete responses to Pyongyang's involvement. Meanwhile, North Korea said its top diplomat is visiting Russia in another sign of their deepening relationship. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, with North Korea continuing a run of provocative weapons tests and South Korea and the U.S. expanding their military drills. Russian drones, missiles and bombs smashed into Kyiv and Kharkiv, Ukraine’s biggest cities, in nighttime attacks, killing four people and wounding 15 in a continuing aerial onslaught, authorities said Tuesday. Russia has bombarded civilian areas of Ukraine almost daily since its full-scale invasion of its neighbor, causing thousands of casualties. The Russian army is also pushing hard against front-line defenses in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Tuesday that Russian troops captured the Donetsk town of Hirnyk and the villages of Katerynivka, and Bohoiavlenka. Zelenskyy also spoke about the war at a meeting Tuesday in Reykjavik with the leaders of Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden. He said a conference will begin in Canada on Wednesday to address the abduction of what he said were tens of thousands of children by Russia from Ukraine’s occupied territories. A Russian aerial attack struck Kharkiv, in Ukraine’s northeast, at around 3 a.m., hitting a house and killing four people, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Nearly 20 houses were damaged in the attack, he said. Several hours earlier, Russia dropped a glide bomb on the landmark Derzhprom building in Kharkiv city center, injuring seven people, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Derzhprom, also known as the Palace of Industry, is being considered for inclusion on UNESCO’s World Heritage List. Terekhov said that Russia has concentrated attacks on Kharkiv in recent days. He urged people not to ignore air raid warnings. Authorities in Kyiv said debris from intercepted Russian drones fell on two city districts, injuring six people. Ukraine has also used long-range drones to disrupt Russia’s war machine and embarrass the Kremlin by striking targets on Russian soil. A special forces academy in the Russian province of Chechnya was hit by drones, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished, according to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who is close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was the first drone attack of the war on Chechnya, which lies about 800 kilometers (500 miles) east of Ukraine. ___ Associated Press writer Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-strikes-ukraines-2-biggest-cities-in-its-latest-barrage-officials-say/	2024-10-29T05:42:19-07:00	
Israeli strike in northern Gaza kills at least 60, officials say,...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on a five-story building where displaced Palestinians were sheltering in the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 60 people early Tuesday, more than half of them women and children, Gaza’s Health Ministry said. In a separate development, Lebanon's militant group Hezbollah said it has chosen Sheikh Naim Kassem to succeed longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike last month. Hezbollah vowed to continue with Nasrallah’s policies 'until victory is achieved.' Israel also faced backlash after passing legislation that could severely restrict the ability of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees to operate in the Palestinian territories. The agency, known as UNRWA, is the largest aid provider in Gaza. Israel has long accused it of militant ties, allegations it denies. A spokesperson for the U.N. children's agency said the decision 'means that a new way has been found to kill children.' Hezbollah's new leader has vowed to keep fighting Israel Hezbollah said in a statement that its decision-making Shura Council elected Kassem, who had been Nasrallah's deputy leader for over three decades, as the new secretary-general. Kassem, 71, a founding member of the militant group established following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, had been serving as acting leader. He has given several televised speeches vowing that Hezbollah will fight on despite a string of setbacks. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation, after Hamas’ surprise attack out of Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered the war there. Iran, which backs both groups, has also directly traded fire with Israel, in April and then again this month. The tensions with Hezbollah boiled over in September, as Israel unleashed a wave of heavy airstrikes and killed Nasrallah and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon at the start of October. Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets into northern Israel on Tuesday, killing at least one person in the northern city of Maalot-Tarshiha, authorities said. Strike in northern Gaza comes as Israel wages a major operation there Even as attention has shifted to Lebanon and Iran in recent weeks, Israel has continued to wage a large operation in northern Gaza and to carry out airstrikes across the territory. Dr. Marwan al-Hams, director of the field hospitals’ department at the Gaza Health Ministry, announced the toll from Tuesday’s strike in the northern town of Beit Lahiya at a news conference. He said another 17 people are missing. The ministry's emergency service said at least 12 women and 20 children were among the dead, including babies. The dead included a mother and her five children, some of them adults, and a second mother with her six children, according to an initial casualty list provided by the emergency service. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been waging the operation in northern Gaza for more than three weeks, targeting what it says are pockets of Hamas militants who have regrouped there. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, said it was overwhelmed by the wave of wounded people from the strike. Israeli forces raided the medical facility over the weekend, detaining dozens of medics. The military said it detained scores of Hamas militants in the raid on Kamal Adwan, the latest in a series of raids on hospitals since the start of the war. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people in recent months, saying it carried out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and tried to avoid harming civilians. The strikes have often killed women and children. Israel's latest major operation in northern Gaza, focused on the Jabaliya refugee camp, has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes in another wave of mass displacement more than a year into the war in the tiny coastal territory. On Tuesday, the military said four more soldiers were killed in the fighting in northern Gaza, bringing the toll since the start of the operation to 16, including a colonel. The military says it has killed dozens of militants, without providing evidence, while Hamas does not publicize its losses. Israeli laws targeting UN agency could further restrict aid Israel has also sharply restricted aid to the north this month, prompting a warning from the United States that failure to facilitate greater humanitarian assistance could lead to a reduction in military aid. Palestinians fear Israel is enacting a plan proposed by a group of former generals, who suggested the civilian population of the north should be ordered to evacuate, aid supplies should be cut off, and anyone remaining there should be considered a militant. The military has denied carrying out such a plan, while the government has not made a clear statement about it. On Monday, Israel's parliament passed two laws that ban UNRWA from operating on Israeli soil and cut all ties with the agency. Israel controls access to both Gaza and the occupied West Bank, and it was unclear how the agency would continue to operate there. Israel says UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas and that the militant group siphons off aid and uses U.N. facilities to shield its activities, allegations denied by the U.N. agency. Aid groups have warned that there is no immediate replacement for UNRWA, which provides education, health care and emergency aid to millions of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation and their descendants. Refugee families make up the majority of Gaza's population. James Elder, a spokesperson for the U.N. children's agency, known as UNICEF, said the suspension of UNRWA's work 'would likely see the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza.' He said UNICEF 'would become effectively unable to distribute lifesaving supplies.' He said that would impede deliveries of vaccines, winter clothes, hygiene kits, health kits, water, and ready-to-use therapeutic food to combat malnutrition. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced from their homes, often multiple times. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Mroue from Beirut.

North Korea sends foreign minister to Russia as its troops train ...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Tuesday its top diplomat is visiting Russia, in another sign of their deepening relations as rival South Korea and Western nations say the North has sent thousands of troops to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said a delegation led by Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui departed for Russia on Monday, but didn’t specify the purpose of the visit. In a closed-door hearing at South Korea’s parliament, the South’s spy agency said Choe may be involved in high-level discussions on sending additional troops to Russia and negotiating what the North would get in return, according to Lee Seong-kweun, a lawmaker who attended the meeting. The announcement of Choe’s visit came hours after the Pentagon said North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia, who are expected to arrive in battlefields in Ukraine within 'the next several weeks.' South Korean and Western leaders have expressed concern that North Korean involvement could help prolong Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, and that Russia may offer technology in return that could advance the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile program. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters Monday that some of the North Korean soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine and were believed to be heading for the Kursk border region, where Russia has been struggling to push back a Ukrainian incursion. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers it’s examining the possibility that some groups of North Korea’s military personnel in Russia, including generals or other high-ranking officials, may have already moved to frontline areas. The spy agency also said the two sides appear to be struggling to resolve communication issues although the Russian military is training North Korean troops on Russian military terminology, Lee said. The agency said space-based reconnaissance is an area where North Korea is likely receiving Russian help. It said North Korea may be acquiring advanced components from Russia as it prepares to launch another military reconnaissance satellite following a failed attempt in May, said Park Sun-won, another lawmaker who attended the hearing. North Korea first placed a spy satellite in orbit last November. Its leader Kim Jong Un has described those assets as crucial for monitoring South Korean and U.S. military activities and enhancing the threat of his nuclear-capable missiles. In a telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said deepening military cooperation between North Korea and Russia could pose a 'major security threat' to Seoul if the North gains access to Russian technology and its troops get combat experience. The leaders confirmed plans to exchange government delegations as part of efforts to strengthen communication and coordinate their responses over the conflict, Yoon’s office said. In earlier calls with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Yoon called for closer coordination with European governments aimed at 'monitoring and blocking illegal exchanges' between Pyongyang and Moscow. After initially denying the claims about North Korean troop deployments, Pyongyang and Moscow have adopted a vaguer stance, asserting that their military cooperation conforms with international law without directly admitting the presence of North Korean forces in Russia. North Korea has also been accused of providing millions of artillery shells and other military equipment to Russia to fuel its war in Ukraine. The United States and its partners have described Russia’s procurement of North Korean personnel and supplies as a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and raised suspicions that Moscow is helping Pyongyang to evade sanctions and unlawfully finance its weapons program. Russia, along with China, has blocked U.S.-led efforts at the Security Council to tighten sanctions on North Korea over its recent missile testing activities, which intensified after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia also vetoed a U.N. resolution to extend the mandate of a panel of monitors in March in a move that effectively abolished oversight by U.N. experts of Security Council sanctions against North Korea. It prompted Western accusations that Moscow was acting to shield its arms purchases from Pyongyang. 'The illegal military collusion between Russia and North Korea poses a significant security threat to the international community and a serious matter that could potentially harm our security. We must thoroughly examine all possibilities and prepare countermeasures,' Yoon said in a Cabinet meeting in Seoul on Tuesday. Yoon last week raised the possibility of supplying Ukraine with weapons while saying Seoul is preparing countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has provided humanitarian aid and other non-lethal support to Ukraine and joined U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. It has so far resisted calls by Kyiv and NATO to directly supply Ukraine with weapons, citing a longstanding policy of not providing arms to countries engaged in active conflict.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-north-korea-sends-foreign-minister-to-russia-as-its-troops-train-to-fight-in-ukraine/	2024-10-29T03:58:40-07:00	
More than 43,000 Palestinians killed in yearlong war in Gaza, Pal...	CAIRO (AP) — The number of Palestinians killed in the yearlong war in Gaza has passed 43,000, more than half of them women and children, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Monday. The tally includes 96 dead who arrived at hospitals in Gaza over the past two days, the ministry said. Israeli troops have launched an ongoing operation in northern Gaza that included a raid on a hospital over the weekend. The military said it detained 100 suspected Hamas militants in a raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya on Friday. The World Health Organization accused Israel of detaining 44 male hospital staff. Palestinian medical officials said the hospital, which was treating some 200 patients, was heavily damaged in the raid. Israel has raided several hospitals in Gaza over the course of the yearlong war, saying Hamas and other militants use them for military purposes. Palestinian medical officials deny those allegations and accuse the military of recklessly endangering civilians. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with regulations, said there was heavy fighting around Kamal Adwan Hospital, though not inside it, and that weapons were found inside the facility. The official said medical staff were detained and searched because some of the militants had disguised themselves as medics. According to the official, the military had helped international organizations relocate 88 patients and medical staff to other hospitals in the weeks leading up to the raid, and that during the raid itself, troops had brought 30,000 liters of fuel and medical supplies from international organizations to help keep the facility running. The Israeli military has called on Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza, where it has been waging a large offensive for more than three weeks. The official said the operation in the northern Gaza city of Jabaliya would last 'several more weeks.' The U.N. said earlier this month at least 400,000 people are still in northern Gaza and hunger is rampant as the amount of humanitarian aid reaching the north has plummeted over the past month. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 43,020 people have been killed and 101,110 others wounded since the war started on Oct. 7, 2023. It did not differentiate between militants and civilians. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Lidman reported from Jerusalem. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-more-than-43000-palestinians-killed-in-yearlong-war-in-gaza-palestinian-health-ministry-says/	2024-10-28T05:29:06-07:00	
Key mediator Egypt proposes a 2-day Gaza cease-fire and the relea...	RAMAT HASHARON, Israel (AP) — Egypt’s president announced Sunday his country has proposed a two-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas during which four hostages held in Gaza would be freed. There was no immediate response from Israel or Hamas as the latest talks were expected in Qatar, another key mediator. President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said the proposal includes the release of some Palestinian prisoners and the delivery of humanitarian aid to besieged Gaza. It aims to 'move the situation forward,' he said, adding that negotiations would continue to make the cease-fire permanent. Talks in pursuit of a longer, phased cease-fire have repeatedly stalled. Hamas wants Israeli forces out of Gaza as a precondition, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said they will remain until destroying Hamas. There hasn’t been a cease-fire since November’s weeklong pause in fighting in the earliest weeks of the war. Israel’s Mossad chief was traveling to Doha on Sunday for talks with Qatar's prime minister and the CIA chief in the latest attempt to end the fighting and ease regional tensions that have built since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. Those tensions now see Israel at war with both Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and openly attacking Iran, their backer, for the first time this weekend. Iran’s supreme leader on Sunday said Israel's strikes — in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack this month — 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for retaliation. During a government memorial for the Hebrew anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that 'not every goal can be achieved through only military operations,' adding that 'painful compromises will be required' to return the hostages. At the same event, protesters disrupted Netanyahu's speech, shouting 'Shame on you.' Many Israelis blame him for the security failures that led to the attack and hold him responsible for not yet bringing hostages home. Inside Gaza, the latest Israeli strikes in the north killed at least 33 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said, as an offensive in the hard-hit and isolated area entered a third week. The U.N. secretary-general called the plight of Palestinians there 'unbearable.' Israel said it targeted militants. Netanyahu says strikes on Iran achieved Israel's goals Netanyahu in his first public comments on the strikes said 'we severely harmed Iran’s defense capabilities and its ability to produce missiles that are aimed toward us.' Satellite images showed damage to two secretive Iranian military bases, one linked to work on nuclear weapons that Western intelligence agencies and nuclear inspectors say was discontinued in 2003. The other is linked to Iran's ballistic missile program. Iran said a civilian had been killed, with no details. It earlier said four people with the military air defense were killed. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s 85-year-old supreme leader, said 'it is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime.' Khamenei would make any final decision on how Iran responds. The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting Monday at Iran’s request. Switzerland, which holds the council’s rotating presidency, said Russia, China and Algeria, the council's Arab representative, supported the request. Iran's most powerful proxy is Hezbollah, which has stepped up firing on Israel in response to Israel's ground invasion in southern Lebanon in recent weeks. Two Israeli strikes killed eight people in Sidon in southern Lebanon, with 25 wounded, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. The Israeli military said four soldiers, including a military rabbi, were killed in fighting in southern Lebanon, without providing details. An explosive drone and a projectile fired from Lebanon wounded five people in Israel, authorities said. Truck ramming in Israel wounds dozens A truck rammed into a bus stop in Ramat Hasharon near Tel Aviv, killing one person and wounding more than 30. Israeli police said the attacker was an Arab citizen of Israel and had been 'neutralized.' The ramming occurred outside a military base and near the headquarters of Israel’s Mossad spy agency. Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group praised the attack but did not claim it. Tensions have soared since the war in Gaza began, and Israel has carried out regular military raids into the occupied West Bank that have left hundreds dead. ‘Harrowing levels of death’ in northern Gaza The Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service said 11 women and two children were among 22 killed in strikes late Saturday in Beit Lahiya in the north. Israel's military said it carried out a strike on militants. Ministry official Hussein Mohesin said 11 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in the Shati refugee camp in the north, with many injured. 'Most of the injuries are children and women, and most of them are in very serious condition,' he said. Israel's military did not immediately comment. Israel has waged a massive air and ground offensive in northern Gaza since early October, saying Hamas militants had regrouped there. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled in the latest wave of displacement. Aid groups have warned of a catastrophic situation. Israel has severely limited the entry of humanitarian aid in recent weeks, and the three remaining hospitals in the north say they have been overwhelmed. The U.N. secretary-general noted 'harrowing levels of death.' The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages remain in Gaza, around a third of whom thought to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The offensive has devastated much of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel, Magdy from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Russian forces thwart attempted cross-border assault from Ukraine...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces thwarted an attempt at another cross-border incursion by Ukraine into southwestern Russia, a local official reported Sunday, months after Kyiv staged a bold assault on its nuclear-armed enemy that Moscow is still struggling to halt. An 'armed group' sought Sunday to breach the border between Ukraine and Russia’s Bryansk region, its governor, Aleksandr Bogomaz, said but was beaten back. Bogomaz did not clarify whether Ukrainian soldiers carried out the alleged attack, but claimed on Sunday evening that the situation was 'stable and under control' by the Russian military. There was no immediate acknowledgement or response from Ukrainian officials. The region neighbors Kursk province, where Ukraine launched a surprise push on Aug. 6 that rattled the Kremlin and constituted the largest attack on Russia since World War II. Hundreds of Russian prisoners were blindfolded and ferried away in trucks in the opening moments of the lightning advance, and Ukraine’s battle-hardened units swiftly pressed on across hundreds of square miles (square kilometers) of territory. Responsibility for previous incursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Bryansk regions has been claimed by two murky groups: the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion. Russian officials and state media have sought to downplay the significance of Kyiv’s thunderous run in Kursk, but the country’s forces have so far been unable to dislodge Ukrainian troops from the province. Western officials have speculated that Moscow may send troops from North Korea to bolster its effort to do so, stoking the almost three-year war and bringing geopolitical consequences as far away as the Indo-Pacific region. Russian lawmakers Thursday ratified a pact with Pyongyang envisioning mutual military assistance, a move that comes as the U.S. confirmed the deployment of 3,000 North Korean troops to Russia. North Korean units were detected Wednesday in Kursk, according to Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate, known by its acronym GUR. The soldiers had undergone several weeks of training at bases in eastern Russia and had been equipped with clothes for the upcoming winter, GUR said in a statement late Thursday. It did not provide evidence for its claims. Moscow warns West against approving long-range strikes against Russia Also on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow is working on ways to respond if the U.S. and its NATO allies allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with long-range Western missiles. Putin told Russian state TV that it was too early to say exactly how Moscow might react, but the defense ministry has been mulling a range of options. Russia has repeatedly signaled that it would view any such strikes as a major escalation. The Kremlin leader warned on Sept. 12 that Moscow would be 'at war' with the U.S. and NATO states if they approve them, claiming military infrastructure and personnel from the bloc would have to be involved in targeting and firing the missiles. He reinforced the message by announcing a new version of the nuclear doctrine that considers a conventional attack on Russia by a nonnuclear nation that is supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack on his country — a clear warning to the U.S. and other allies of Kyiv. Putin also declared the revised document envisages possible nuclear weapons use in case of a massive air attack, opening the door to a potential nuclear response to any aerial assault — an ambiguity intended to deter the West. Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly said they need permission to strike weapons depots, airfields and military bases far from the border to motivate Russia to seek peace. In response, U.S. defense officials have argued that the missiles are limited in number, and that Ukraine is already using its own long-range drones to hit targets farther into Russia. That capability was evidenced by a Ukrainian drone strike in mid-September that hit a large Russian military depot in a town 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border. The U.S. allows Kyiv to use American-provided weapons in more limited, cross-border strikes to counter attacks by Russian forces. Civilian deaths reported in Kherson as warring sides trade drone strikes In a separate update, Bryansk Gov. Bogomaz claimed that over a dozen Ukrainian drones were shot down over the region on Sunday. Separately, a total of at least 16 drones were downed over other Russian regions, including the Tambov province some 450 kilometers (290 miles) north from the border, officials reported. There were no reports of casualties from any of the alleged attacks. In Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson, Russian shelling killed three civilians on Sunday, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin claimed. Another Kherson resident died in a blaze sparked by shells hitting a high-rise, according to Ukraine’s Emergency Service. Air raid sirens wailed for over three hours in Kyiv overnight into Sunday, and city authorities later reported that 'around 10' drones had been shot down. They said no one had been hurt. Ukraine’s air force on Sunday reported that it had shot down 41 drones launched by Russia across Ukrainian territory. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russian-forces-thwart-attempted-cross-border-assault-from-ukraine-official-says/	2024-10-27T12:29:49-07:00	
Russian drone strike kills teen girl in Kyiv and 5 others dead in...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian drone strike killed a teenager in Kyiv during a nighttime barrage on the Ukrainian capital that lasted for hours, officials said, while five people were reportedly killed in a missile attack on central Ukraine that also left at least 21 injured. According to Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko, the drone slammed into a 25-story apartment block Friday night in the city's west, killing a 15-year-old girl and injuring five others. Ukraine's Emergency Service said 100 people were evacuated following the strike, which damaged several apartments on the building's upper floors. Serhii Popko, who heads Kyiv's local military administration, said that Russian forces overnight pummeled the city for 7 1/2 hours. Air raid sirens wailed throughout the night, and Popko said that Ukrainian air defense shot down up to a dozen Russian drones. Also late Friday, a Russian missile hit a residential area in the central city of Dnipro, killing a 14-year-old and four others, said regional Gov. Serhii Lysak, adding that at least 21 others were injured including an 8-year-old and teenagers. The wife and teenage daughter of a local policeman were pulled dead from the rubble, police reported. The attack damaged over a dozen apartment buildings, private houses and a medical facility. A man and woman died after a Russian drone dropped explosives on a village in the southern Kherson region, local prosecutors said, while two people in their 60s were killed by shelling in the Kharkiv province in the northeast. Later on Saturday, Russian artillery shelling killed two civilian men elsewhere in the Kherson region, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In the Kyiv province, which surrounds but does not include the capital, flying debris from a drone attack killed a woman, Ukraine’s Emergency Service reported. A 13-year-old boy was wounded elsewhere in the region, it said. Russian forces overnight launched a total of 91 drones and seven missiles at Ukrainian territory, Ukraine’s air force said Saturday in the latest of regular media updates. It said 44 of the drones were shot down. In Russia, air defense brought down 17 Ukrainian drones over four regions near the border, the defense ministry in Moscow reported Saturday. Also according to the Russian defense ministry, Moscow's troops have continued eking out battlefield gains in Ukraine's industrial east, capturing the hamlet of Oleksandropil in the Donetsk region. Russia has been conducting a ferocious monthslong campaign along the eastern front in Ukraine, gradually compelling Kyiv to surrender ground. But Russia has struggled to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk border region following an incursion almost three months ago.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russian-strikes-on-kyiv-and-central-ukraine-kill-2-teenagers-and-injure-dozens/	2024-10-26T10:20:32-07:00	
Five things to know about Israel's attack on Iran	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel delivered its long-expected response to Iranian missile attacks early Saturday by carrying out a series of airstrikes against the Islamic Republic. Here's what to know: Multiple targets were struck Under the cover of darkness early Saturday, Israel struck multiple sites in different parts of Iran. Explosions were heard in the capital, Tehran, which sits deep inside the country. The Israeli military said its 'precise and targeted strikes' hit missile air defense systems and 'aerial capabilities' as well as missile manufacturing facilities used to produce weapons that have been used against Israel. Iran insisted the strikes caused only 'limited damage.' It was not immediately clear how hard of a blow Israel dealt, with neither country providing detailed assessments of the destruction. Iran said the strikes targeted military bases in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran. Israel appeared confident in its battering of Iran's air defenses, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying that 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' What wasn't hit also matters The strikes did not appear to target facilities that would all but ensure a harsh Iranian response. Those most notably include Iran's oil infrastructure, the backbone of the OPEC member's economy, and its nuclear facilities. President Biden earlier this month said he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites. U.S. officials felt they had secured agreement from Israel not to hit nuclear or oil sites after dispatching another air-defense missile battery and associated troops, though those assurances were not set in stone. This attack has finished Israel signaled that the pre-dawn bombardment was the end of this attack. 'The retaliatory strike has been completed, and its objectives have been achieved,' Hagari said early Saturday, still the Sabbath in Israel. Not long after, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization said commercial flights would resume after being halted because of the airstrikes. Tehran's shops were open and streets were calm, though lines grew at gas stations as residents stocked up on fuel. The Israeli attacks aimed to deter future aggression and 'show we won’t be silent,' but to do so in a way that would minimize the embarrassment for Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies. Outrage and calls for restraint The White House indicated that it wants the strikes to end the direct exchanges of fire between Israel and Iran, and warned Iran against responding. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there was a 'need to avoid further regional escalation' and called on all sides to show restraint. Reactions in the region were tougher. Saudi Arabia, Iran's main Arab rival, condemned the strike, calling it a threat to regional security and 'a violation of international laws and norms.' Turkey accused Israel of having 'brought our region to the brink of a greater war' and said 'putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty.' Syria and Iraq were among other countries in the region condemning the strikes. So did Hamas, which along with other militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 hostages into Gaza. Israel's retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up for more than half the deaths. Iran's response will be key The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would respond to the airstrikes, calling them a clear violation of international law as it asserted Tehran's right to self-defense. Israel characterized Saturday's attack as a response to previous aerial assaults by Iran using missiles and exploding drones in April and another missile attack this month. Many of those projectiles were shot down before reaching their targets. Iran could attempt another direct bombardment, though doing so risks provoking yet another direct Israeli attack on its territory at a moment when its defenses are weakened. It could also encourage allied militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon to intensify their attacks, though both have suffered serious blows in their ongoing wars with Israel. 'Iran will play down the impact of the strikes, which are in fact quite serious,' predicted Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. She said Iran is 'boxed in by their own military limitations, economic constraints from sanctions and by the U.S. election outcome,' which could affect the course of further escalation or diplomatic outreach.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-five-things-to-know-about-israels-attack-on-iran/	2024-10-26T08:20:46-07:00	
Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon kills 3 journalists as they sl...	BEIRUT (AP) — An Israeli airstrike killed three journalists as they slept at a guesthouse in southeast Lebanon early Friday, a rare strike on an area that had so far been spared the hostilities in the rest of the region. It was the latest in a series of Israeli attacks against journalists covering the war in Gaza and Lebanon in the past year. The 3 a.m. airstrike turned the site — a series of guesthouses nestled among trees that had been rented by various media outlets covering the war — into rubble, with cars marked 'PRESS' overturned and covered in dust and debris. The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike, and later said it was looking into it. Those killed were camera operator Ghassan Najjar and broadcast technician Mohammed Rida of the Beirut-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV, and camera operator Wissam Qassim, who worked for Al-Manar TV of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group. It came after a strike earlier in the week that hit an office belonging to Al-Mayadeen on the outskirts of Beirut’s southern suburbs. Both outlets are aligned with Hezbollah and its main backer, Iran. The strike in the Hasbaya region, which had so far been spared from the Israeli airstrikes pummeling other parts of south Lebanon, drew widespread condemnation from officials, journalists and press advocacy groups. TV crews had arrived in Hasbaya, deeming it safer after Israel had ordered an evacuation order for a town further south from which they were reporting. 'That is why we consider it a direct targetting, aimed at getting the journalists out of the south,' said Elsy Moufarrej, coordinator for the Alternative Press Syndicate in Lebanon. 'They want to prevent the journalists from covering and having presence in the south of Lebanon.' Lebanese Information Minister Ziad Makary said the journalists were killed while reporting on what he called Israel’s 'crimes,' and noted they were among a large group of members of the media. 'This is an assassination, after monitoring and tracking, with premeditation and planning, as there were 18 journalists present at the location representing seven media institutions,' he wrote in a post on X. Imran Khan, a senior correspondent for Al Jazeera English who was among the journalists in the Hasbaya Village Club guesthouses, said the airstrike hit at around 3:30 a.m. without warning. 'These were just journalists that were sleeping in bed after long days of covering the conflict,' he posted on social media, adding that he and his team were unhurt. Hussein Hoteit, a cameraman for Egypt’s Al-Qahira TV, said he was sleeping when he woke up to a 'huge weight' as the walls and ceiling collapsed. He was miraculously saved by colleagues who managed to move the debris covering him few minutes later. He said two missiles hit the chalet next door, although he didn’t hear them. He spoke from his hospital bed where he is being treated for thigh injuries. Friday’s deaths are the latest in a long list of journalists who have been killed by Israel in the past year in Gaza and Lebanon. In a report earlier this month, the Committee to Protect Journalists said at least 128 journalists and media workers, all but five of them Palestinian, had been killed in Gaza and Lebanon — more journalists than have died in any year since it started documenting journalist killings in 1992. All of the killings except two were carried out by Israeli forces, it said. 'One year in, Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza has exacted an unprecedented and horrific toll on Palestinian journalists and the region’s media landscape,' it said in the report released Oct. 4. The killing of journalists has prompted international outcry from press advocacy groups and United Nations experts, although Israel has said it does not deliberately target them. Lebanon’s Health Minister says over the past year 11 journalists have been killed and eight wounded by Israeli fire in Lebanon. In November 2023, two journalists for Al-Mayadeen TV were killed in a drone strike. A month earlier, Israeli shelling in southern Lebanon killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and wounded other journalists from France’s international news agency, Agence France-Presse, and Qatar’s Al-Jazeera TV. This week, Israel accused journalists working for Al Jazeera of being members of militant groups, citing documents it purportedly found in Gaza. The network has denied the claims as 'a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region.' The Committee to Protect Journalists has dismissed them as well, and said that 'Israel has repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence.' Jad Shahrour, spokesperson for the Samir Kassir Eyes Center for Media and Cultural Freedom, told The Associated Press Friday that bombing press centers is a deliberate effort to obliterate the truth. 'It means they are establishing a media blackout,' he said, adding that it was a troubling trend that is now shifting from Gaza to Lebanon. Al-Mayadeen’s director, Ghassan bin Jiddo, alleged that the Israeli strike Friday was intentional and directed at those covering elements of its military offensive. Ali Shoeib, Al-Manar’s well-known correspondent in south Lebanon, was seen in a video filming himself with a cellphone saying that the camera operator who had been working with him for months was killed. Shoeib said the Israeli military knew that the area that was struck housed journalists of different media organizations. 'We were reporting the news and showing the suffering of the victims and now we are the news and the victims of Israel’s crimes,' Shoeib added in the video aired on Al-Manar TV. ___ Karam reported from London.

Israeli strikes kill 38 people in Gaza's Khan Younis and 3 journa...	BEIRUT (AP) — Israeli strikes killed 38 people in Gaza and three journalists in Lebanon on Friday as growing worries about supply shortages in Gaza and international pressure for a cease-fire mounted. The deaths reported by Gaza health officials were the latest in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, where people have in recent days lined up for bread outside the city's only bakery in operation. They come a day after United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Israel had accomplished its objective of 'effectively dismantling' Hamas and implored both sides to revive negotiations. Also on Friday, an Israeli airstrike on guesthouses where journalists were staying in southeast Lebanon killed three media staffers working for news outlets that are seen as aligned with Lebanon’s Hezbollah group and its patron, Iran. Outside of now-collapsed buildings rented by various media outlets, cars marked 'PRESS' lay covered in dust and rubble after the strike, Associated Press photos showed. The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike. Representatives of the news networks and Lebanese politicians accused Israel of war crimes and intentionally targeting journalists. 'These were just journalists that were sleeping in bed after long days of covering the conflict,' said Imran Khan, a senior correspondent for Al Jazeera English who was among the journalists in the compound. In a social media post, he said he and his team were unhurt. The Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV said two of its staffers — camera operator Ghassan Najar and broadcast technician Mohammed Rida — were among the journalists killed early Friday. Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV said its camera operator Wissam Qassim was also killed in the airstrike on the Hasbaya region. Al-Mayadeen’s director Ghassan bin Jiddo alleged that the Israeli strike on a compound housing journalists was intentional and directed at those covering elements of its military offensive. He vowed that the Beirut-based station, a pan-Arab broadcaster seen as aligned with Hezbollah, would continue its work. The strike occurred hours after the Israeli military’s Arabic language spokesman, Avichay Adraee, directly challenged Al-Mayadeen war correspondent Ali Mortada in online posts and referred to him as 'my enemy' in English. The X post ended with the English phrase 'Take care.' Mortada was not involved in the strike. Lebanon's Information Minister Ziad Makary said the journalists were killed while broadcasting what he called Israel's crimes, and noted they were among a large group of members of the media. 'This is an assassination, after monitoring and tracking, with premeditation and planning, as there were 18 journalists present at the location representing seven media institutions,' he wrote in a post on X. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike. Ali Shoeib, Al-Manar’s well-known correspondent in south Lebanon, was seen in a video filming himself with a cellphone saying that the camera operator who had been working with him for months was killed. Shoeib said the Israeli military knew that the area that was struck housed journalists of different media organizations. 'We were reporting the news and showing the suffering of the victims and now we are the news and the victims of Israel’s crimes,' Shoeib added in the video aired on Al-Manar TV. The Hasbaya region has been spared much of the violence along the border and many of the journalists now staying there have moved from the nearby town of Marjayoun that has been subjected to sporadic strikes in recent weeks. Earlier in the week, a strike hit an office belonging to Al-Mayadeen on the outskirts of Beirut’s southern suburbs, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Lebanon’s Health Minister said Friday that 11 journalists have been killed and eight wounded since exchange of fire began along the Lebanon-Israel border in early October 2023. In November 2023, two journalists for Al-Mayadeen TV were killed in a drone strike. A month earlier, Israeli shelling in southern Lebanon killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and wounded other journalists from France’s international news agency, Agence France-Presse, and Qatar’s Al-Jazeera TV. The killing of journalists has prompted international outcry from press advocacy groups and United Nations experts, although Israel has said it does not deliberately target them. On Thursday, the Committee to Protect Journalists said it had preliminarily counted 128 journalists killed in Gaza since the war began. Israel has accused journalists working for Al Jazeera of being members of militant groups, citing documents it purportedly found in Gaza. The network has denied the claims as 'a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region.' The Committee to Protect Journalists has dismissed them as well, and said that 'Israel has repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence.' Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The Israeli campaign has since expanded to Lebanon, where Israel launched a ground invasion Oct. 1, after trading fire with the Hezbollah militant group for much of the past year. Lebanese health officials reported another day of intense airstrikes and shelling Thursday, which they said killed 19 people over 24 hours and raised the overall Lebanese death toll to 2,593 since October 2023. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir Al-Balah, Gaza Strip.

Ukraine's Zelenskyy claims North Korean troops will be deployed b...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — North Korean troops are poised to be deployed by Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine as early as this weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed Friday. Western officials have warned that such a development would stoke the almost three-year war and bring geopolitical consequences as far away as the Indo-Pacific region. Zelenskyy said Ukrainian intelligence had determined that 'the first North Korean military will be used by Russia in combat zones' between Sunday and Monday. He said on Telegram that the deployment was 'an obvious escalating move by Russia.' He didn’t provide any further details, including where the North Korean soldiers may be sent. Russia has been conducting a ferocious summer campaign along the eastern front in Ukraine, gradually compelling Kyiv to surrender ground. But Russia has struggled to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk border region following an incursion almost three months ago. North Korean units were detected on Wednesday in Kursk, according to Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate, known by its acronym GUR. The soldiers had undergone several weeks of training at bases in eastern Russia and had been equipped with clothes for the upcoming winter, GUR said in a statement late Thursday. It estimated the number of North Korean soldiers sent by Pyongyang to Russia at around 12,000, including some 500 officers and three generals. GUR provided no evidence for its claims. The deployment of North Korean forces under a military pact between Moscow and Pyongyang brings a new dimension to the conflict, which is Europe’s biggest war since World War II and has cost tens of thousands of lives on both sides, including many civilians. The U.S. said Wednesday that 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations, calling the move very serious. Zelenskyy said a week ago that his government has intelligence information that 10,000 troops from North Korea are being readied to join Russian forces fighting against his country. He said that a third nation wading into the hostilities would turn the conflict into a 'world war.' North Korea had already been supplying ammunition to Russia under a defense pact, but putting boots on the ground could severely complicate a war that has inflamed international politics, with most Western countries supporting Kyiv. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, has looked for support among BRICS countries. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraines-zelenskyy-claims-north-korean-troops-will-be-deployed-by-russia-in-coming-days/	2024-10-25T04:47:08-07:00	
Putin ends BRICS summit that sought to expand Russia's global clo...	KAZAN, Russia (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin closed a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies on Thursday, praising its role as a counterbalance to what he called the West's 'perverse methods.' The three-day summit in the city of Kazan was attended by leaders or representatives of 36 countries, highlighting the failure of United States-led efforts to isolate Russia over its actions in Ukraine. The conflict came up repeatedly at the meeting, which saw the first visit to Russia from United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in more than two years and drew an angry reaction from Kyiv. Guterres called for 'a just peace' in Ukraine, in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions. He also urged an immediate end to the fighting in Gaza, Lebanon and Sudan. At a news conference Thursday night, Putin was asked about former U.S. President Donald Trump's promise to end the fighting in Ukraine. 'What Mr. Trump said recently, what I heard, (is) he spoke about the desire to do everything to end the conflict in Ukraine,' Putin said. 'It seems to me that he said it sincerely. We certainly welcome statements of this kind, no matter who makes them.' Putin also was asked about whether any North Korean troops were in Russia, which he neither confirmed nor denied. The U.S. said Wednesday that 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations. 'Images are a serious thing, if there are images, then they reflect something,' he said when asked about satellite photos of troops. Putin noted that lawmakers in Moscow earlier in the day ratified a pact with North Korea on mutual military assistance as part of a 'strategic partnership' with Pyongyang. 'We have never doubted that the North Korean leadership takes our agreements seriously. What and how we will do within the framework of this article (of the agreement) is our business,' he said. The summit covered the deepening of financial cooperation, including the development of alternatives to Western-dominated payment systems, efforts to settle regional conflicts and expansion of the BRICS group of nations. The alliance that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa when it was founded in 2009 has expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and several other countries have expressed interest in joining. The Kremlin touted the summit as 'the largest foreign policy event ever held' by Russia. Speaking at what was dubbed the 'BRICS Plus' session, which included countries that are considering joining the bloc, Putin accused the West of trying to stem the growing power of the Global South with 'illegal unilateral sanctions, blatant protectionism, manipulation of currency and stock markets, and relentless foreign influence ostensibly promoting democracy, human rights, and the climate change agenda.' 'Such perverse methods and approaches — to put it bluntly — lead to the emergence of new conflicts and the aggravation of old disagreements,' Putin said. 'One example of this is Ukraine, which is being used to create critical threats to Russia’s security, while ignoring our vital interests, our just concerns, and the infringement of the rights of Russian-speaking people.' Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. In a joint declaration Wednesday, participants voiced concern about 'the disruptive effect of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions' and reiterated their commitment to enhancing financial cooperation within BRICS. They noted the benefits of 'faster, low-cost, more efficient, transparent, safe and inclusive cross-border payment instruments built upon the principle of minimizing trade barriers and non-discriminatory access.' China's President Xi Jinping has emphasized the bloc’s role in ensuring global security. Xi noted that China and Brazil have put forward a peace plan for Ukraine and sought to rally broader international support for it. Ukraine has rejected the proposal. 'We should promote the de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible and pave the way for a political settlement,' Xi said. Putin and Xi had announced a 'no-limits' partnership weeks before Russia sent troops into Ukraine in 2022. They already met twice earlier this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July. Russia’s cooperation with India also has flourished as New Delhi sees Moscow as a time-tested partner since the Cold War despite Russia’s close ties with India’s rival, China. While Western allies want New Delhi to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the fighting in Ukraine, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. Addressing the BRICS Plus session, Guterres urged an immediate end to the fighting in Gaza, Lebanon, Ukraine and Sudan. 'We need peace in Ukraine, a just peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions,' he said. Russia's Kremlin-controlled media touted the summit as a massive policy coup that left the West fearing the loss of its global clout. State TV shows and news bulletins underscored that BRICS countries account for about half the world's population comprising the 'global majority' and challenging Western 'hegemony.' TV hosts elaborately quoted Western media reports saying that the summit highlighted the failure to isolate Moscow. 'The West, the U.S., Washington, Brussels, London ended up isolating themselves,' said Yevgeny Popov, host of a popular political talk show on state channel Rossiya 1.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-putin-presides-over-brics-summit-seeking-to-expand-russias-clout/	2024-10-24T19:46:38-07:00	
U.S. sends more aid to Gaza	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) - The Biden administration announced more humanitarian aid for Gaza. The announcement comes as aid workers report a growing number of Palestinians suffering. 'We need peace in Gaza,' said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guerres. There are growing international calls to send more aid to Gaza where U.N. aid workers report men, women and children are fighting for their survival in the war-torn territory. 'Today we're announcing an additional $135 million in humanitarian assistance,' said Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is again pressing Israeli forces to allow more supplies, including water sanitation materials into Gaza immediately. Last week the U.S. threatened to withhold military assistance if Israel did not end its two-week aid blockade. U.N. leaders say Israel made it impossible to deliver fuel and critical polio vaccines into northern Gaza. 'It's imperative to stop the polio outbreak in Gaza before more children are paralyzed and the virus spreads,' said Deputy Spokesperson for the Secretary General Farhan Haq. In recent days Israel has allowed dozens of aid trucks into northern Gaza but has shown little sign of ending its military campaign. Thursday, Israel’s military struck a Gaza school where they allege Hamas militants were hiding. Palestinian medical officials report at least 17 people, including 13 children, were killed. Secretary Blinken is wrapping up a trip where he crisscrossed the Middle East to try to broker a ceasefire deal.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/u-s-sends-more-aid-to-gaza/	2024-10-24T12:53:07-07:00	
French foreign minister says conference for Lebanon raised $1 bil...	PARIS (AP) — France's foreign minister said Paris' international conference for Lebanon raised $1 billion in pledges for humanitarian aid and military support. Jean-Noël Barrot said: 'We have collectively raised $800 million in humanitarian aid and $200 million for the security forces, that’s about $1 billion,' in his closing speech at the conference, which gathered over 70 nations and international organizations. 'We’re up to the challenge,' Barrot said. French President Emmanuel Macron had called on participants to bring 'massive aid' to support the country where war between Hezbollah militants and Israel has displaced a million people, killed over 2,500, and deepened an economic crisis. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. PARIS (AP) — France pledged to provide a 100-million euro ($108-million) package to support Lebanon at an international conference Thursday, as President Emmanuel Macron said 'massive aid' is needed to support the country where war between Hezbollah militants and Israel has displaced a million people, killed over 2,500, and deepened an economic crisis. French organizers hope the Paris conference, which gathered over 70 nations and international organizations, will raise enough money to provide the $426 million in humanitarian aid the United Nations says is urgently needed. 'In the immediate term, massive aid is needed for the Lebanese population, both for the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the war and for the communities hosting them,' Macron said in his opening speech at the conference. Germany pledged a total of 96 million euros in humanitarian aid to both Lebanon and neighboring Syria, also deeply affected by escalating violence in the Middle East. Italy this week announced an additional 10 million euros ($10.8 million) in aid for Lebanon. But experts warn that delivering aid could be challenging as Lebanon’s growing dependence on the informal and cash economy increases lack of transparency and corruption risks. The Paris conference also aims at coordinating international support to strengthen Lebanon’s armed forces so they can deploy in the country’s south as part of a potential deal to end the war. Such a deal could see Hezbollah withdraw its forces from the border. This support to the Lebanese military includes 'helping with health care, fuel, small equipment, but also supporting the plan to recruit at least 6,000 additional soldiers and to enable the deployment of at least 8,000 additional soldiers in the south,' Macron said. In Lebanon, an Israeli airstrike killed three Lebanese soldiers, including an officer, as they were evacuating wounded people in southern Lebanon. The army said Israeli forces have targeted it on eight occasions since all-out war broke out between Israel and Hezbollah in September. The Israeli army apologized for a strike on Sunday that it said mistakenly killed three soldiers, and on Wednesday said it was looking into whether 'a number of soldiers of the Lebanese army were accidentally harmed' after it targeted what it says was Hezbollah infrastructure. Paris also seeks to help restore Lebanon's sovereignty and strengthen its institutions. The country, where Hezbollah effectively operates as a state within a state, has been without a president for two years while political factions fail to agree on a new one. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, in a pre-recorded video, called on Lebanon’s leaders 'to take decisive action to ensure the proper functioning of state institutions in order to meet the country’s urgent political and security challenges.' Acting Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged the international community to take action. 'The devastating impact of this war on our nation cannot be overstated, and it has left a trail of destruction and misery in its wake. The Israeli’s aggression has not only caused immense human suffering and loss of lives, but also inflicted severe damage to the country’s infrastructure, economy and social fabric,' Mikati said Thursday in Paris. Israel in the past month has launched a major aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Lebanon as it targets Hezbollah, with strikes hitting the capital, Beirut, and elsewhere. The International Organization for Migration has said about 800,000 people are displaced, with many now in overcrowded shelters, while others have fled across the border into Syria. Mikati on Thursday estimated the number of displaced people is over 1.4 million, including 500,000 children. The cash-strapped Lebanese government is ill-prepared to deal with the crisis or the increased demands on its health system. A number of hospitals have been evacuated because of nearby airstrikes and fears that they might be targeted. Lebanon's army has been hit hard by five years of economic crisis. It has an aging arsenal and no air defenses, leaving it in no position to defend against Israeli incursions or confront Hezbollah. The Lebanese army has about 80,000 troops, around 5,000 of them deployed in the south. Hezbollah has more than 100,000 fighters, according to the militant group’s late leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The militant group's arsenal, built with support from Iran, is more advanced. Conference participants also are to discuss how to support the 10,500-soldier-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL. European nations including France, Italy and Spain provide a third of its troops. Italy, which has over 1,000 troops in UNIFIL, is pushing for the peacekeeping force to be strengthened to 'be able to face the new situation' on the ground, an Italian diplomat said, speaking anonymously to discuss ongoing talks. Guterres said Thursday that 'attacks on U.N. peacekeepers are totally unacceptable and are contrary to international law, contrary to international humanitarian law and may constitute a war crime.' France’s historic links with Lebanon, a former colony, and its influential diplomacy give Paris momentum to coordinate 'a proper response to the massive challenge that the war in Lebanon now poses,' said Middle East expert Rym Montaz, editor in chief of Carnegie Europe’s blog Strategic Europe. 'What we do know is that without a strengthened Lebanese armed forces and UNIFIL, there can be no sustainable peace and stability at the border between Lebanon and Israel,' Montaz said. 'As such, the French efforts are important and crucial for the way forward.' ___ AP writers Geir Moulson in Berlin, Germany and Abby Sewell in Beirut, Lebanon, contributed.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-paris-conference-aims-to-rally-military-and-humanitarian-support-for-lebanon/	2024-10-24T06:22:42-07:00	
Palestinian officials say an Israeli strike on a school-turned-sh...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on a school where displaced people were sheltering in the central Gaza Strip killed at least 17 people on Thursday, nearly all women and children, Palestinian medical officials said. Another 42 people were wounded in the strike in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Among the dead were 13 children under the age of 18 and three women, according to the hospital's records. The Israeli military said it targeted Hamas militants in a command and control center inside the school, without providing evidence. Israel has carried out several strikes on schools-turned-shelters in recent months, saying it precisely targets Hamas militants hiding out among civilians. The strikes often kill women and children. Health workers in besieged northern Gaza meanwhile warned of a catastrophic situation there, where Israel has been waging an air and ground offensive for more than two weeks. The director of a hospital said it is running short on supplies and first responders said they can no longer rescue people. In a separate development, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced another $135 million in aid to the Palestinians. He spoke in Qatar on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the war in Gaza. The United States has pressed Israel to allow more aid into the war-ravaged Palestinian territory. The United States hopes to renew the negotiations after Israeli forces killed top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza last week, but neither side has shown any sign of moderating its demands. Hospital director in northern Gaza says supplies are running out Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have fled their homes in northern Gaza in recent days. The military says it is battling Hamas fighters who regrouped in the north, which was one of the first targets of the ground offensive at the start of the war. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiyeh, the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in the north, said in a video message released Wednesday that some 150 wounded people were being treated there, including 14 children in intensive care or the neonatal department. 'There is a very large number of wounded people, and we lose at least one person every hour because of the lack of medical supplies and medical staff,' he said. 'Our ambulances can’t transfer wounded people,' he said. 'Those who can arrive by themselves to the hospital receive care, but those who don’t just die in the streets.' Footage shared with The Associated Press shows medical staff tending to premature babies and several older children in hospital beds, some with severe burns. One child is seen attached to a breathing machine, with bandages on her face and flies hovering over her. 'We are providing the bare minimum to patients. Everyone is paying the price of what is happening now in northern Gaza,' Abu Safiyeh said. Kamal Adwan is one of three hospitals in the north left largely inaccessible because of the fighting. The war has gutted the health system across Gaza, with only 16 of 39 hospitals even partially functioning, according to the World Health Organization. First responders halt operations after saying Israel fired on them The Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government, said they had suspended operations in the north. They said Israeli forces fired on one of their teams in the town of Beit Lahiya after ordering them to relocate to the Indonesian Hospital, where troops are stationed. Three Civil Defense members were wounded in the strike, and a firetruck was destroyed, it said. It said another five of its personnel were detained by Israeli forces at the hospital. 'As a result, we declare that Civil Defense operations in the northern Gaza Strip have been completely halted, leaving these areas without any firefighting, rescue, or emergency medical services,' it said in a statement. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The war has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people are crammed into tent camps along the coast after entire neighborhoods in many areas were pounded to rubble. Months of cease-fire negotiations brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar sputtered to a halt over the summer. The war has meanwhile expanded to Lebanon, where Israel launched a ground invasion more than three weeks ago after trading fire with the Hezbollah militant group for much of the past year. ___ Khaled reported from Cairo.

Evangelicals emerge as a potent lobby for US support of Ukraine	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) — Since the war in Ukraine began, Yaroslav Pyzh, a Baptist pastor in Lviv, has worn many hats. He runs the large and growing Ukrainian Baptist Theological Seminary, while overseeing a network of 18 humanitarian aid centers across the embattled country. He’s also become an ambassador of sorts to American evangelicals. Several times a year, he treks to the Polish border and once permitted to leave, travels to the United States to preach about the plight of his country and its need for continued American support. He is not alone in his advocacy. There has been sustained outreach by Ukrainian Baptists and other evangelicals to their American counterparts in the past two years, through coordinated campaigns and individual efforts. They have crisscrossed the U.S., visiting churches and Christian colleges, Capitol Hill and the Republican National Convention. They are appealing to American evangelicals who hold sway politically within the GOP — an increasingly isolationist party with standard bearers who remain skeptical of Ukrainian aid. 'That war is a loser,' Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on a recent podcast. His running mate, JD Vance, has said, 'I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine.' Gary Marx, a longtime conservative operative in the U.S., has been working with Ukrainian evangelicals to amplify their message — part of a $3.6 million contract between a Ukrainian organization and the lobbying firm DCI Group, according to foreign agent registration documents. '(Ukrainians) know that their nation’s existence rides on whether the U.S. is supporting them,' Marx said. 'It’s that simple. If the U.S. pulls support, there’s no way that they’ll survive.' During his latest U.S. trip, Pyzh made stops in at least eight states, including meeting with Southern Baptist officials in Nashville, Tennessee. An English speaker, Pyzh has translated for American church groups visiting Ukraine. He earned his doctorate at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Texas. He is still a translator, moving between both countries. 'I serve as a bridge for two sides,' he told a gathering at a St. Louis church in August. He said he has American friends who have visited Ukraine many times and supported his ministries but now are torn. 'What I see in them is that struggle between what they want to do, the way they want to help us, and some of their ideas on the political side,' Pyzh said. 'Their heart is in Ukraine, but their mind is somewhere else.' Evangelicals in the halls of Congress Ukraine has often been called the 'Bible Belt of Eastern Europe.' Though evangelicals account for only 2% to 4% of the population, that amounts to hundreds of thousands of people — a vibrant, influential religious presence. They have an outsized connection to an important constituency: Southern Baptists, the largest Protestant denomination in the United States with 13 million members. Baptists from both countries beseeched Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson — a Southern Baptist and former denominational official — to support Ukraine aid earlier this year, even though his party’s right flank threatened to oust him if he did. Pavlo Unguryan, a prominent Ukrainian Baptist leader, met with Johnson several times. 'We are brothers in one body of Jesus Christ,' said Unguryan, who once served in Ukraine’s parliament and leads the country’s National Prayer Breakfast. After an attack in Odesa killed the daughter and infant grandson of a Baptist pastor, Unguryan arranged for the grieving son-in-law to meet with Johnson, just before the speaker helped push forward $61 billion in war-time aid to Ukraine. While intelligence briefings may have given Johnson 'the intellectual information about why it’s in U.S. interest to support Ukraine, our work and the work of others like us gave him the emotional and spiritual connection to Ukraine,' said Steven Moore, founder of the Ukraine Freedom Project. It has helped fund Unguryan’s U.S. travel. Moore, a veteran Republican Hill staffer, founded the project in 2022. It has coordinated meetings with more than 100 congressional offices. During the debate over Ukraine aid, Moore’s organization ran digital ads in Johnson’s district. A billboard went up across from Johnson’s church in Louisiana, paid for by Razom, a Ukrainian humanitarian group Moore has advised. It showed a damaged Ukrainian Baptist church and invoked the biblical book of Esther: 'Speaker Johnson, for such a time as this.' Moore’s organization also created a website with stories of Ukrainian Christians alleging they were tortured by Russians. 'Every day, we try to figure out how to build and maintain Republican support for Ukraine,' Moore said. 'And the evangelical Christian messaging is one of the ways that we do that.' Debating religious freedom in the U.S. and Ukraine This advocacy work taps into a deep well of concern among Americans about religious freedom — something that's also a talking point used by Ukraine’s critics. Russia has asserted Ukraine is the one discriminating against Christians, particularly since Ukraine passed a law seen as targeting the branch of the Orthodox Church historically aligned with Moscow. The law bans religious groups who support Russia’s invasion and those tied to the Russian Orthodox Church that backed Vladimir Putin in his efforts to seize Ukraine. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has raised concerns about Ukraine’s new law, but 'stresses that Russia remains the most profound threat to religious freedom in Ukraine.' 'There’s significantly less religious freedom and religious pluralism in Russia than there is in Ukraine,' said Catherine Wanner, a Penn State professor of history, anthropology and religious studies who focuses on the region. Evangelicals face persecution and repression in Russia and the occupied territories in part because of their faith’s perceived ties to the United States, Wanner said. Russian authorities 'assume all evangelicals are American spies,' said Igor Bandura, senior vice president of the Ukrainian Baptist Union. He spoke to The Associated Press by phone from suburban Kyiv, after a sleepless night hearing sirens and drones. Hundreds of churches and religious sites have been destroyed during the war. Bandura said 110 of 320 Ukrainian Baptist churches in the newly occupied Russian territories have ceased to exist because members fled. 'Those who stayed are really under great, great pressure.' Bandura visited the U.S. in May and June on a trip coordinated by Marx’s DCI project. His itinerary included the Southern Baptist Convention’s annual meeting in Indianapolis, where he spent much time outside the hall, talking with fellow Baptists about Ukraine. Southern Baptist churches have a long history of missionary work in Ukraine. After the war began, SBC representatives voted to 'stand in solidarity with our Ukrainian brothers and sisters.' The SBC’s humanitarian organization, Send Relief, said it has served 2 million people in the region since 2022. And Brent Leatherwood, head of the SBC’s public policy arm, has urged continued American support of Ukraine. In April, Daniel Darling, director of the Land Center for Cultural Engagement at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, signed a letter with Pyzh and other prominent Baptists, urging Johnson to support aid to Ukraine. 'For the most part, when I talk to Southern Baptist pastors — rank-and-file pastors — they really do want Ukraine to prevail,' Darling said. 'Many of them have ties there with missions. And so, I don’t think it’s as controversial as it often appears to be.' Evangelicals see military conflict in Ukraine as a spiritual war Sitting in the parlor of a Virginia Baptist church just outside Washington, Pyzh reiterated that he's grateful for American support. He noted that millions of Ukrainians will be watching the U.S. presidential election closely. His seminary keeps adapting to the many needs that war imparts. It now has more than 1,300 students, with thousands more in certificate programs. It recently started a counseling program to address growing mental health needs. This year, for the first time, the incoming class includes recent war veterans, some of them wounded and released from military duty.

Middle East latest: Blinken in Doha to discuss Gaza cease-fire wi...	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Doha on Thursday to meet with Qatari officials who have been key mediators for Hamas, as the U.S. struggles to break the logjam of cease-fire negotiations between Israel and the militant group. Blinken is on his 11th trip to the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Meanwhile, the Lebanese military said Thursday an Israeli strike killed three of its troops, including an officer, as they were evacuating wounded people in southern Lebanon, and French President Emmanuel Macron said his country will provide a 100 million-euro ($108 million) aid package to support Lebanon. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. United Nations humanitarian officials are reporting 'harrowing levels of death, injury and destruction' in northern Gaza as Israel wages another major operation there. Israel is also fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon. Lebanon’s Health Ministry says the total toll over the past year is over 2,500 killed and 12,000 wounded. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the United Nations children’s agency. Hezbollah confirmed Wednesday that Hashem Safieddine, one of its top officials who had been widely expected to be the group’s next leader, was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Over the past several weeks, Israeli strikes have killed much of Hezbollah’s top leadership. Here's the latest: Lebanon's caretaker prime minister calls for immediate cease-fire BEIRUT — Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister is calling for an immediate cease-fire, the full implementation of the U.N. resolution that ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war and the deployment of 8,000 Lebanese troops to a buffer zone along the border with Israel. Najib Mikati spoke Thursday at a conference in Paris in support of Lebanon. The Lebanese army has largely kept to the sidelines in the latest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. It says Israeli forces have targeted its soldiers on eight occasions, killing and wounding several. Israel apologized for a deadly strike on Sunday. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war, called for Hezbollah and Israeli forces to withdraw from areas south of Lebanon’s Litani River and for the area to be controlled by the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers. Israel says the resolution was never implemented and that Hezbollah built up military infrastructure all the way to the border. Lebanon has accused Israel of ignoring other provisions, including by violating its airspace. The Lebanese army has around 80,000 forces, with around 5,000 deployed in the south. Representing the Lebanese Army at the Paris conference, Brig. Gen. Youssef Haddad said that Lebanon is working on recruiting 1,500 additional soldiers to help implement the U.N. resolution, the state-run National News Agency reported. Hezbollah boasts tens of thousands of fighters. Lebanon’s military is not strong enough to impose its will on the militant group or to resist Israel’s ground invasion. Hospital director in Gaza warns of ‘catastrophic’ shortage of medical supplies DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — The director of a hospital in the northern Gaza Strip says it is facing a 'catastrophic' shortage of basic supplies and that ambulances can no longer service the facility. Israel has been carrying out a major offensive in northern Gaza for more than two weeks. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have fled their homes. The military says it is battling Hamas fighters who regrouped in the north, which was one of the first targets of the ground offensive at the start of the war. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiyeh, the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, said in a video message released Thursday that some 150 wounded people are being treated there, including 14 children in intensive care or the neonatal department. 'There is a very large number of wounded people, and we lose at least one person every hour because of the lack of medical supplies and medical staff,' he said. 'Our ambulances can’t transfer wounded people,' he said. 'Those who can arrive by themselves to the hospital receive care, but those who don’t just die in the streets.' The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Footage shared with The Associated Press shows medical staff tending to premature babies and several older children in hospital beds, some with severe burns. One child is seen attached to a breathing machine, with bandages on her face and flies hovering over her. 'We are providing the bare minimum to patients. Everyone is paying the price of what is happening now in northern Gaza,' Abu Safiyeh said. Kamal Adwan is one of three hospitals in the north left largely inaccessible because of the fighting. The war has gutted the health system across Gaza, with only 16 of 39 hospitals even partially functioning, according to the World Health Organization. French President Macron pledges 100 million euros in aid to support Lebanon PARIS — France pledged to provide a 100-million euro ($108-million) package to support Lebanon at an international conference Thursday, as President Emmanuel Macron said 'massive aid' is needed to support the country where war between Hezbollah militants and Israel has displaced a million people, killed over 2,500 and deepened an economic crisis. 'In the immediate term, massive aid is needed for the Lebanese population, both for the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the war and for the communities hosting them,' Macron said in his opening speech at the conference. French organizers hope participants’ financial pledges of humanitarian aid will meet the $426 million the United Nations says is urgently needed. Italy this week announced new aid of 10 million euros ($10.8 million) and Germany on Wednesday pledged an additional 60 million euros ($64.7 million) for people in Lebanon. An Israeli strike kills 3 members of Lebanon's military, including an officer BEIRUT — The Lebanese military says an Israeli strike killed three of its troops, including an officer, as they were evacuating wounded people in southern Lebanon. In a Thursday post on X, it said the strike hit the outskirts of the southern town of Yater. The army says Israeli forces have targeted it on eight occasions since all-out war broke out between Israel and Hezbollah in September. The Israeli military said Thursday it was looking into whether 'a number of soldiers of the Lebanese army were accidentally harmed' after it targeted what it says was Hezbollah infrastructure. The military said in a statement that it does not deliberately target Lebanese troops. It earlier apologized for a strike on Sunday that killed three Lebanese soldiers, saying it had targeted a vehicle in an area where Hezbollah had recently launched attacks without realizing it belonged to the army. Lebanon’s armed forces have largely kept to the sidelines in the latest conflict. The army is not powerful enough to impose its will on Hezbollah or to resist Israel’s ground invasion.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-french-president-macron-pledges-100-million-euros-in-aid-to-support-lebanon/	2024-10-24T03:59:39-07:00	
South Korean president raises possibility of supplying Ukraine wi...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s president on Thursday raised the possibility of supplying Ukraine with weapons while stressing that his government 'won’t sit idle' as North Korea allegedly sends troops to support Russia’s aggression toward its neighbor. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol spoke to reporters after a meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda that came a day after U.S. and South Korean officials said they believe around 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations. South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers that North Korea likely aims to send a total of 10,000 troops to Russia by the end of the year. Yoon’s meeting with Duda was focused on expanding defense cooperation between the countries amid the ongoing conflict. Poland has signed a series of arms deals with South Korea in the last two years to acquire tanks, howitzers and missile launchers in an effort to bolster its military capabilities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the presence of North Korean troops. Yoon said South Korea will work with allies and partners to prepare countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Seoul’s steps could potentially include sending weapons to Ukraine, which would mark a departure from a long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict, Yoon said. He said North Korea’s alleged troop deployment to Russia is a 'provocation that threatens global security beyond just the Korean Peninsula and Europe.' 'If North Korea dispatches special forces to the Ukraine war as part of Russia-North Korea cooperation, we will support Ukraine in stages and also review and implement measures necessary for security on the Korean Peninsula,' Yoon said during a joint press conference with Duda. 'While we have maintained our principle of not directly supplying lethal weapons, we can also review our stance more flexibly, depending on the level of North Korean military activities,' Yoon said. Yoon’s comments aligned with what a senior presidential official told reporters on condition of anonymity earlier this week. That official said South Korea is considering various diplomatic, economic and military options, including supplying Ukraine with both defensive and offensive weapons systems. South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has provided humanitarian aid and other non-lethal support to Ukraine and joined U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. It has so far resisted calls by Kyiv and NATO to directly supply Ukraine with weapons. During their summit, Yoon and Duda agreed to 'actively support' additional deliveries of South Korean military equipment to Poland, including a new deal for Korean K-2 tanks the governments hope to finalize within this year, Yoon’s office said. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened since 2022 after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate the growth of his nuclear weapons and missile program. Seoul also worries as experts say the North may seek major technology transfers in return for sending troops, including Russian know-how on intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarines that would advance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear arsenal. Experts say it’s unclear how effective the North Korean soldiers would be in combat, considering their lack of active battlefield experience, outdated conventional weaponry and training experience with Russian forces. Kim may see the troop dispatch as a crucial opportunity to expose his soldiers to modern warfare and technologies, said Hong Min, an analyst at Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification. During a parliamentary hearing, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun said that North Korean troops would likely become 'cannon fodder' when deployed in combat in Ukraine and denounced Pyongyang’s leadership for 'selling away its troops to an illegal invasion.' 'Troop deployment is just a phrase, and it would be more appropriate to call them as mercenaries,' he said. 'The North Koreans are disguising themselves in Russian uniforms and operating under Russian control with no operational autonomy, just simply following orders.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-seoul-vows-response-as-north-korean-troops-head-to-ukraine/	2024-10-24T03:21:23-07:00	
Officials say North Korea has sent troops to Russia. What would t...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — American and South Korean officials said Wednesday that there’s evidence North Korea has dispatched troops to Russia in a potential escalation of the nearly 3-year-old war with Ukraine. If the soldiers' goal is fighting with Russia in Ukraine, it would be the first time a third country puts boots on the ground in the war. Other countries on both sides of the divide have sent military aid, including weapons and training: Iran has supplied Russia with drones, and Western nations have provided Ukraine with modern weapons and financial and humanitarian assistance. South Korea’s spy chief told lawmakers that 3,000 North Korean troops were being trained to use equipment including drones before being sent to fight in Ukraine. United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters during a visit to Rome that 'we are seeing evidence that there are North Korean troops' who have gone to Russia. 'What exactly they’re doing — left to be seen,' Austin said. Neither Austin nor South Korean National Intelligence Service Director Cho Tae-yong provided details about how they knew about the North Korean troops, and many questions surround the impact of North Korean participation. What do we know about the North Korean troops? North Korean troops were arriving in Russia’s Kursk region as early as Wednesday to help Russian troops fight off a Ukrainian border incursion, Ukraine Military Intelligence Directorate head Kyrylo Budanov told the online military news outlet The War Zone on Tuesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters Monday that North Korean officers and technical personnel have already been spotted in Russian-occupied territories. He did not specify when. 'I believe they sent officers first to assess the situation before deploying troops,' Zelenskyy said. He has cautioned that the participation of a third country could escalate the conflict into a world war. Austin said that it would be a 'very, very serious issue' if Pyongyang indeed did join the war on Russia’s side. What is Ukraine doing? Ukraine is preparing as though combating North Korea in its territory is inevitable. An injection of 10,000 North Korean troops, which is what both Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence have claimed, 'could significantly destabilize Ukraine’s defense there and greatly accelerate the advancement of Russian forces,' said Glib Voloskyi, an analyst from a Ukrainian think tank, Come Back Alive Initiatives Center. Ukraine’s 'I Want to Live' project, a hotline encouraging Russian soldiers to surrender, published a video in Korean on Wednesday calling for North Korean soldiers to give up. 'We call for the soldiers of the Korean People’s Army, who were sent to help the Putin regime. You should not die senselessly on someone else’s land. There is no need to repeat the fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers who will never return home!' How is the West reacting? Zelenskyy told reporters Monday that the European Union and the U.S. have been cautious in publicly addressing North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia — describing their reactions as 'very restrained.' German and British officials also weighed in, with South Korea hinting that it could support Ukraine with military weapons in the event of North Korea’s confirmed involvement. 'We don’t even know whether we are talking about 1,500 or 12,000, or which kind of soldiers are coming to Russia and to fight where and against,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said. 'It’s a kind of escalation and it shows us a very important, a very important aspect. International conflicts are approaching very rapidly.' United Kingdom Defense Secretary John Healey said there was 'not just a concern about the potential for an escalation of conflict in Europe. There is an indivisible link with security concerns in the Indo-Pacific as well.' Why does Russia need North Korea? North Korea and Russia, both in separate confrontations with the West, have deepened their military cooperation in the past two years. In June, they signed a defense deal requiring both countries to provide military assistance if the other is attacked. For analysts, the introduction of troops would be a sign that the war isn’t going as Russia planned. 'I think Ukraine is wearing down the Russian army as we talk. You don’t get thousands of soldiers from North Korea if your war is going well,' said Justin Crump, a former British tank commander who heads Sibylline, a strategic advisory firm. 'You don’t require them.' North Korea has already sent over 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Those missiles are being actively used against Ukrainian targets, officials in Kyiv say. ___ Associated Press reporters Hanna Arhirova and Illia Novikov contributed.

Israel accuses 6 Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being Palestin...	RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — The Israeli army on Wednesday accused six Al Jazeera journalists covering the war in Gaza of also being current or former paid fighters for Palestinian militant groups. Al Jazeera rejected the claims. Israel cited documents it purportedly found in Gaza, and other intelligence it gathered, in making the accusations against the journalists, all of whom are Palestinian men. It said four are or have been affiliated with Hamas, and two with Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Al Jazeera said the accusations were 'fabricated' and 'part of a wider pattern of hostility' toward the pan-Arab network. It said the claims were 'a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region, thereby obscuring the harsh realities of the war from audiences worldwide.' The Associated Press has been unable to independently verify the authenticity of the documents Israel posted online to support its claims. Al Jazeera is based in the energy-rich nation of Qatar, where many senior Hamas officials are based. The Gulf Arab country, which funds Al Jazeera, also has been a key player in Gaza cease-fire negotiations, along with the U.S. and Egypt. Al Jazeera journalists Anas al-Sharif, Hossam Shabat, Ismael Abu Omar, and Talal Arrouki were accused by Israel of ties to Hamas. Ashraf Saraj and Alaa Salameh were accused of ties to Islamic Jihad. The men have held various roles, according to documents Israel cited -- sniper, infantry soldier, fighter, captain, training coordinator and 'propaganda.' The Committee to Protect Journalists released a statement on Wednesday that was critical of Israel, which it said 'has repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence.' In July, after an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City killed two Al Jazeera journalists, including Ismail Al Ghoul, Israel 'produced a similar document, which contained contradictory information, showing that Al Ghoul, born in 1997, received a Hamas military ranking in 2007 – when he would have been 10 years old,' the committee said in its statement. Militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad led last year's attack on Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. They have been fighting alongside each other against Israeli troops in Gaza for the past year. In January, Israel detailed allegations against 12 employees of a United Nations agency that it says were involved in the Hamas attack on Israel last year that ignited the war in Gaza. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, subsequently fired at least 21 staffers for their roles in the attack. UNRWA has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians in Gaza during the war. Four Al Jazeera journalists have been killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza over the past 12 months, according to the network. Several of the dead later have been accused by Israel of being members of either Hamas or Islamic Jihad, accusations rejected by the Qatari outlet. In May, after an Israeli court ordered the closure of Al Jazeera's operations and broadcasts within Israel, police raided a hotel room in East Jerusalem from where the network had been broadcasting live images. It was the first time Israel had ever shuttered a foreign news outlet. Four months later, Israel raided Al Jazeera's office in the Palestinian-governed West Bank city of Ramallah, shutting down the bureau there. Several of those named by Israel on Wednesday, including al-Sharif, have become mainstay figures of the outlet's 24-hour live coverage of Gaza. They have acquired celebrity-like status among Palestinians and in other countries across the Middle East. Al Jazeera is one of a handful of news organizations still broadcasting daily from the besieged enclave. The documents and intelligence Israel released Wednesday purportedly show the rank, role, enlistment date, and battalion of each of the six Al Jazeera journalists. At least 128 journalists have been killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel, and Lebanon since last October, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. They include 123 Palestinians, two Israelis and three Lebanese. Israel has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza since the war began, according to the local health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants but says more than half of the dead are women and children. Even before the war, tensions between Al Jazeera and Israel ran high. Israeli forces shot and killed Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist, in May 2022 as she reported on a story in the West Bank. Israel isn't the only critic of Al Jazeera. The U.S. singled out the broadcaster during its occupation of Iraq after its 2003 invasion toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, and for airing videos of the late al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden, who orchestrated the Sept. 11, 2001 attack against the U.S. Al Jazeera has been closed or blocked by other governments in the Middle East. In 2013, Egyptian authorities seeking to crush mass protests against President Mohammed Morsi raided a luxury hotel used by Al Jazeera. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-accuses-6-al-jazeera-journalists-in-gaza-of-being-palestinian-militants/	2024-10-23T17:14:06-07:00	
G7 allies are moving ahead with a $50 billion loan for Ukraine ba...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukraine will receive $50 billion in loans, backed by frozen Russian assets, from Group of Seven allies, the White House said Wednesday. Distribution of the money will begin by year's end, according to American officials who said the United States is providing $20 billion of the total. Leaders of the wealthy democracies agreed earlier this year to engineer the mammoth loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival after Russia's invasion. Interest earned on profits from Russia’s frozen central bank assets would be used as collateral. President Joe Biden said in a statement: 'Ukraine can receive the assistance it needs now, without burdening taxpayers. These loans will support the people of Ukraine as they defend and rebuild their country. And our efforts make it clear: tyrants will be responsible for the damages they cause.' At a ceremony Wednesday in Washington, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Ukraine's finance minister, Sergii Marchenko, put into writing assurances that the U.S. loan will be paid for by the windfall proceeds of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets, not by American taxpayer dollars. 'Letting Ukraine fall would invite further aggression by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and jeopardize the safety of our NATO allies in Europe, who we are committed by treaty to defend,' Yellen said. The additional $30 billion will come from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan, among others. 'To be clear, nothing like this has ever been done before,' said Daleep Singh, the deputy national security adviser on international economics. 'Never before has a multilateral coalition frozen the assets of an aggressor country and then harnessed the value of those assets to fund the defense of the aggrieved party all while respecting the rule of law and maintaining solidarity.' Singh said the Biden administration intends to divide the U.S. share of $20 billion between aiding Ukraine’s economy and military. It will require congressional action to send military aid, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that weapons and equipment being promised now can take weeks or months to get to Ukraine. The idea of using Russia’s frozen assets to help Ukraine faced resistance at first from European officials who cited legal and financial stability concerns. The move gained momentum after more than a year of negotiations between finance officials and after Biden in April signed legislation that allowed the government to seize the roughly $5 billion in Russian state assets in the U.S. The G7 announced in June that most of the loan would be backed by profits being earned on roughly $260 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of that money is held in EU nations. The U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. The timing of the loan's disbursement has been called into question, coming about two weeks before the presidential election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. The candidates have taken opposing views on the threat from Russia. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin dismissed suggestions that military aid to Ukraine approved by the Biden administration now could be negated by any new team in office. 'I think we’re pretty sure that these materials will continue to flow,' Austin said, adding that he is confident it all will be delivered 'on the timeline that we’ve outlined.' However, Austin also made it clear that the Biden administration is not wavering in its opposition to giving Ukraine the authority to use U.S.-provided ATACM missiles to strike deep into Russia. He said the latest infusion of about $800 million in long-term assistance will fund Ukraine’s production of drones that can strike farther than the ATACMS, which have a range of about 300 kilometers (185 miles). The World Bank’s latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years. __ Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Hezbollah confirms that top official Hashem Safieddine was killed...	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — Hezbollah announced Wednesday that Hashem Safieddine, one of its top officials who had been widely expected to be the group’s next leader, was killed in an Israeli airstrike. The announcement came a day after Israel said it had killed Safieddine in a strike earlier this month in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Safieddine, a powerful cleric within the party ranks, had been expected to succeed Hassan Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike last month. Over the past several weeks, Israeli strikes have killed much of Hezbollah’s top leadership. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli jets struck multiple buildings in Lebanon's southern coastal city of Tyre on Wednesday, sending large clouds of black smoke into the air. The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli strike on the nearby town of Maarakeh killed three people. There were no reports of casualties in Tyre, where the Israeli military had issued evacuation warnings prior to the strikes. Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group meanwhile fired another barrage of rockets into Israel, including two that set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv before being intercepted. A cloud of smoke could be seen in the sky from the hotel where U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was staying on his latest visit to the region to try to renew cease-fire talks. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, drawing retaliatory airstrikes, after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. All-out war erupted in Lebanon last month, and Israeli strikes killed Hezbollah's top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of October. The Israeli military said Tuesday that one of its airstrikes in recent weeks killed Hashem Safieddine, a senior Hezbollah leader and cleric who was widely expected to succeed Nasrallah. Tyre, a provincial capital, had largely been spared in the Israel-Hezbollah war, but strikes in an around the city have intensified recently. The 2,500-year-old city, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Beirut, is known for its pristine beaches, ancient harbor and imposing Roman ruins and hippodrome, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is among Lebanon’s largest cities and a vibrant metropolis popular with tourists. The buildings struck on Wednesday were between several heritage sites, including the hippodrome and a cluster of seaside sites associated with the ancient Phoenicians and the Crusaders. The Israeli military issued evacuation warnings a couple hours prior for dozens of buildings in the heart of the city. It told residents to move north of the Awali River, dozens of kilometers (miles) to the north. Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesman, said on the platform X that there were Hezbollah assets in the area of the evacuation warning, without elaborating or providing evidence. The city is in southern Lebanon, where the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah has a strong presence, and its legislators are members of the group or its allies. But Tyre is also home to civilians with no ties to the group, including a sizable Christian community. First responders from Lebanon’s Civil Defense used loudspeakers to warn residents to evacuate the area and helped older adults and others who had difficulty leaving. Ali Safieddine, the head of the Civil Defense, told The Associated Press there were no casualties. Dr. Wissam Ghazal, a health official in Tyre, said the strikes hit six buildings, flattening four of them, around 2 1/2 hours after the evacuation warnings. People displaced by the strikes could be seen in parks and sitting on the sides of nearby roads. The head of Tyre's disaster management unit, Mortada Mhanna, told the AP that although many people had fled, thousands of residents and others who have been displaced from other areas have chosen to stay in the city. Many people, including hundreds of families, previously had fled villages in South Lebanon to seek refuge in shelters in Tyre. An estimated 15,000 people remain in the city out of a pre-war population of about 100,000, Mhanna said. 'It’s very difficult for many to leave. They’re worried about being subjected to further chaos and displacement,' he said, adding that he and his team had chosen to stay in the city, but 'it’s a big risk. It’s not safe here anymore.' Over 2,500 people have been killed in Lebanon since the conflict began late last year, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Over a million people have fled their homes since September. On the Israeli side, attacks have killed around 60 people, half of them soldiers. Near-daily rocket barrages have emptied out communities across northern Israel, displacing some 60,000 people. In recent weeks Hezbollah has extended its range, launching scores of rockets every day and regularly targeting the northern Israeli city of Haifa. Most of the projectiles are intercepted or fall in open areas. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israeli-strikes-pound-lebanese-coastal-city-after-residents-evacuate/	2024-10-23T07:45:59-07:00	
US defense chief says there’s evidence North Korea has sent troop...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The U.S. defense secretary said Wednesday there is evidence that North Korea has sent troops to Russia, calling it a 'very, very serious issue' if the troops join the war in Ukraine on Moscow's side and warning of possible consequences. South Korea's spy chief, meanwhile, told lawmakers that 3,000 North Korean troops are now in Russia receiving training on drones and other equipment before being deployed to battlefields in Ukraine. The U.S. had not previously formally confirmed North Korea’s reported troop dispatch. 'We are seeing evidence that there are North Korean troops' that have gone to Russia, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters during a visit to Rome. 'What exactly they’re doing — left to be seen.' He added: 'If they’re co-belligerents, their intention is to participate in this war on Russia’s behalf, that is a very, very serious issue, and it will have impacts not only on in Europe, it will also impact things in the Indo-Pacific.' He called it a 'next step' after the North has provided Russia with arms, and said Pyongyang could face consequences for aiding Russia directly. He did not provide details, saying analysts were still assessing the situation. South Korean intelligence first publicized reports that the Russian navy had taken 1,500 North Korean special warfare troops to Russia this month, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join the invading Russian forces. Russia and North Korea have denied the troop movements. They have sharply boosted their cooperation in the past two years, and in June they signed a major defense deal requiring both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. South Korean officials worry that Russia may reward North Korea by giving it sophisticated weapons technologies that could boost its nuclear and missile programs that target South Korea. South Korea said Tuesday it would consider supplying weapons to Ukraine in response to the reported troop dispatch. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Tuesday said North Korea sending troops to Ukraine would mark a 'significant escalation,' and said he asked South Korea's president to send experts to Brussels next week to brief the military alliance. On Wednesday, South Korean National Intelligence Service Director Cho Tae-yong told lawmakers that another 1,500 North Korean troops have entered Russia, according to lawmaker Park Sunwon, who attended Cho's closed-door briefing. Cho told lawmakers his agency assessed that North Korea aims to deploy a total of 10,000 troops to Russia by December, Park told reporters. Park cited Cho as saying the 3,000 North Korean soldiers sent to Russia have been split among multiple military bases. Cho told lawmakers that NIS believes they have yet to be deployed in battle, Park said. Also speaking jointly about the briefing, lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun said the NIS found that the Russian military is teaching those North Korean soldiers how to use military equipment such as drones. Lee cited the NIS chief as saying Russian instructors have high opinions of the morale and physical strength of the North Korean soldiers but think they will eventually suffer heavy causalities because they lack an understanding of modern warfare. Lee, citing Cho, said Russia is recruiting a large number of interpreters. Lee said NIS has detected signs that North Korea is relocating family members of soldiers chosen to be sent to Russia to special sites to isolate them. The NIS chief told lawmakers that North Korea hasn't disclosed its troop dispatch to its own people. Ukraine’s Military Intelligence Directorate head, Kyrylo Budanov, told the online military news outlet The War Zone on Tuesday that North Korean troops were to arrive to Russia's Kursk region on Wednesday to help Russian troops fighting off a Ukrainian incursion. Last week, South Korea's spy agency said North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Reports that the North is sending troops to Russia stoked security jitters in South Korea. It has shipped humanitarian and financial support to Ukraine, but it has so far avoided directly supplying arms in line with its policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. North Korea has 1.2 million troops, one of the largest standing armies in the world, but it hasn’t fought in large-scale conflicts since the 1950-53 Korean War. Experts question how much North Korean troops would help Russia, citing a shortage of battle experiences. Experts say North Korea wants Russia's economic support and its help to modernize the North's outdated conventional weapons systems as well as its high-tech weapons technology transfers. Following a meeting in London with his German counterpart Boris Pistorius, U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said it looks 'highly likely' that North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia. Pistorius said it underscores the challenges of dealing with international conflicts that are 'getting more and more closer to each other and linked to each other.' ___ Baldor reported from Washington.

Blinken urges Israel to seek enduring deal, as officials say a li...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Israel needs to pursue an 'enduring strategic success' in Gaza after its tactical victories against Hamas, urging it to seek a deal that would end the war and bring back dozens of hostages. He spoke before traveling from Israel to Saudi Arabia on his 11th visit to the region since the war began. Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv shortly before his departure as Israel intercepted two projectiles fired from Lebanon — the latest in Israel's war with Hezbollah — and a puff of smoke could be seen in the sky from Blinken's hotel. 'Israel has achieved most of the strategic objectives when it comes to Gaza,' Blinken told reporters before boarding his plane. 'Now is the time to turn those successes into an enduring strategic success.' 'There really are two things left to do: Get the hostages home and bring the war to an end with an understanding of what will follow,' he said. Meanwhile, officials with the U.S., Israel and Egypt confirmed that a proposal for a limited cease-fire and hostage release has been discussed in recent days. No sign of a breakthrough after killing of Hamas leader The United States sees a new opportunity to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli forces in Gaza last week. But there’s no indication that the warring parties have modified their demands since talks stalled over the summer. There was also no immediate sign of a breakthrough after Blinken met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials on Tuesday. Israel blamed the failure of talks on Sinwar's hard-line stance, but Hamas says its demands for a lasting cease-fire, full Israeli withdrawal and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners have not changed. Hamas blamed the failure of the talks on Israel's demand for a lasting military presence in parts of Gaza. Talk of a more limited cease-fire and hostage release Egypt has suggested the possibility of a short pause in fighting in which Hamas would release a handful of hostages and humanitarian aid deliveries would be increased, especially in northern Gaza, an Egyptian official told The Associated Press. The official, who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Egypt and fellow mediator Qatar had discussed the idea with the United States but it was not yet a firm proposal. A senior State Department official confirmed that a proposal for a limited hostage release has been discussed in recent days but that no determination had been made, even after Blinken's meetings with Israeli officials and families of the hostages on Tuesday. An Israeli official said Israel's Security Cabinet had discussed an Egyptian initiative centered on a 12-day cease-fire and the release of six hostages. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. There was no immediate comment from Hamas, which has rejected such ideas in the past, saying it is intent on ending the war. It is still holding around 100 hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel is warned on aid during offensive in northern Gaza Israel has dramatically reduced the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza as it wages another major operation in the territory's hard-hit north. Blinken reiterated a warning that hindering humanitarian aid could force the U.S. to scale back the crucial military support it has provided to Israel since the war began. 'There’s progress made, which is good, but more progress needs to be made,' he told reporters, without elaborating. The U.N. humanitarian office says Israel has severely restricted aid operations since the start of its offensive in Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp in northern Gaza. It said one critical mission, to rescue around 40 people trapped in the rubble in Jabaliya, had been repeatedly denied since Friday. Col. Elad Goren, a senior official with the Israeli military body that oversees civilian affairs in Gaza, said he was not aware of the request. Speaking to reporters, Goren acknowledged disruptions in aid to the north in the first half of October but said they were related to the Jewish holidays and troop movements. He said people who were not evacuating Jabaliya had enough assistance from previous months to get by. The U.N. estimates that 60,000 people have fled to Gaza City since the start of the operation in Jabaliya, the latest in a series of mass displacements. Northern Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel's ground operation and has been encircled by Israeli forces since late last year. Most of the population heeded Israeli warnings to flee to southern Gaza early in the war, but an estimated 400,000 people have stayed. The north has been more heavily destroyed than other areas of Gaza, with entire neighborhoods obliterated. Israel has prevented Palestinians who fled the north from returning to their homes, a key demand from Hamas in the cease-fire talks. US urges Israel to distance itself from ‘Generals’ Plan' for Gaza The renewed offensive in the north has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel intends to implement a plan proposed by former generals in which civilians would be ordered to leave the north and anyone remaining would be starved out or killed. Far-right ministers in Netanyahu's Cabinet say Israel should remain in Gaza and re-establish Jewish settlements there. Blinken said the U.S. officials 'fully reject' any Israeli reoccupation of Gaza and that it was not the policy of the Israeli government. The State Department official said Blinken questioned Netanyahu and members of his government about the so-called Generals' Plan. The Israelis denied having such a plan and said the perception of it was damaging, the official said. The official said the Americans pressed the Israelis to publicly distance themselves from it. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250 when they stormed into southern Israel a year ago. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children. It has displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, forcing hundreds of thousands into squalid tent camps. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Fallout from 2023 Hamas attack lingers as Jews worldwide prepare ...	NEW YORK (AP) — Customarily, Simchat Torah is one of the most joyous days of the Jewish calendar, highlighted by exuberant dancing around a Torah. Jewish leaders say the joy will return during this week's celebrations, even as Jews recall that last year's Simchat Torah overlapped with Oct. 7, the day some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped in the Hamas attack on Israel. Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of Union for Reform Judaism, reflected on the inevitably that the celebrations coming on Wednesday and Thursday will include 'an overlay of pain and loss and mourning.' 'Do we dance again? Has enough time passed?' asked Jacobs, whose organization represents more than 800 Reform synagogues in North America. 'I’m of a mind that we must dance,' he said. 'There’s something defiant about dancing with the Torahs and not conceding Jewish life to those who hate us ... Jewish life cannot be put on pause.' Simchat Torah marks the conclusion of the annual cycle of public Torah readings, and the start of a new one. The highlight is the hakafot, during which participants march and dance around a Torah scroll. 'This holiday is characterized by utterly unbridled joy,' says the Hasidic organization Chabad-Lubavitch. 'There are times for mourning and times for celebration and joy, and this is one of those times of joy,' said Rabbi Motti Seligson, a Chabad spokesman. 'That's the way we celebrate the lives that are lost. It's the way we lean into who we are. We don't let others define who we are.' Reflections of a rabbi whose family was shattered by violence Among those sounding the call for joy was Rabbi Leo Dee, an educator living in the Israeli settlement of Efrat in the West Bank. His wife and two of his daughters were killed during Passover in April 2023 in an attack by Palestinian militants. Writing in The Jewish Chronicle, a London-based newspaper, Dee said rabbis worldwide were wondering how to celebrate Simchat Torah this year. 'On the one hand it is a festival, a day when it is forbidden to give eulogies and to mourn,' Dee wrote. 'On the other hand, it is the anniversary of the most tragic attack against humanity since the Holocaust. Can we dance again? Can we celebrate again? How should we respect the victims? His answer: 'Let’s make this Simchat Torah a day of true joy, a day of supporting Israel in the most tangible way possible, by promoting immigration to the most incredible country with the most impressive people and the brightest future.' In the U.S., some Jews commented on the element of sadness that will accompany some of the celebrations. 'The singing and dancing will never ever be the same as prior to October 7th, 2023. It will be tinged with a bit of sad reflection and daunting memory,' wrote Chaim Botwinick, a Florida-based executive coach and educational consultant, in a blog post contributed to The Times of Israel. 'But the one lesson that remains in my heart and soul forever is that we must never ever give up hope,' he added. 'We must continue to dance — even as we cry.' Should the children shout for joy as the grown-ups weep? Similar sentiments were expressed by Rabbi Avi Killip, executive vice president at the Hadar Institute, a Jewish education center in New York. 'There will be shouts of joy from our children as they dance and celebrate the sweetness of Torah, and there will be cries of sorrow from the elders who saw something that cannot ever be forgotten,' Killip wrote in an opinion piece for eJewish Philanthropy. 'But of course it won’t be that simple.' 'This first year, we can and probably should let our weeping overtake the sounds of the joy of the children. That is appropriate. This year we need to allow the tears to flow,' she wrote. 'In future years there will be more and more children who weren’t there, who didn’t see, and who I pray will someday bring an unbridled joy back to this holiday of Simchat Torah.' Rabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, said the commemorations in Orthodox synagogues affiliated with the union would be 'intimately Jewish. They will be just for us.' 'We will celebrate in a manner that will connect us deeply to the events and challenges of this past year, and to specifically celebrate the gift of Torah,' he said via email. 'Carrying our children on our shoulders and Torah scrolls in our arms, we will sing and dance in joyous celebration of the values that define us, reinforcing our national mission to do good, to be good, to study and live by God’s word, and to bring light to the world.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Britain and Germany sign defense pact to counter Russia's growing...	LONDON (AP) — German submarine-hunting planes will patrol the North Atlantic from a base in Scotland under a new Britain-Germany defense pact sealed in response to the growing threat from Russia. Defense ministers from Britain and Germany signed the agreement in London on Wednesday in what officials call the first such defense pact between the two NATO member countries to boost European security amid rising Russian aggression. The deal comes as the war launched by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 grinds on, and with Ukraine and its European allies anxious about the outcome of November's U.S. presidential election. U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said the need for Europe to bolster its own security, and for the U.K. to play a bigger role in NATO, 'is the driving force behind our NATO-first U.K. defense strategy, (and) behind our reset of U.K. relations with Europe.' 'In a more dangerous world, allies are our strategic strength and we must do more together,' Healey said at a news conference in London alongside German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Under the deal, German submarine hunter aircraft are expected to operate 'periodically' from a Scottish military base to patrol the North Atlantic. The allies will work closer together to protect vital underwater cables in the North Sea. The two countries say they will also cooperate to prioritize developing long-range strike weapons that can travel farther than the U.K.'s existing Storm Shadow missiles. German defense giant Rheinmetall is also expected to open a factory producing artillery gun barrels using British steel. Officials say the pact will mean British and German forces committed to NATO in Estonia and Lithuania will exercise and operate together more closely, ensuring that 'land forces on NATO’s eastern flank remain a strong deterrent and are ready to fight and win if required.' Britain and Germany are also expected to collaborate on developing new land-based and aerial drones. 'We must not take security in Europe for granted,'' Pistorius said. 'Russia is waging war against Ukraine, it is increasing its weapons production immensely and has repeatedly launched hybrid attacks on our partners in eastern Europe. 'With the Trinity House Agreement, we are showing that the NATO allies have recognized what these times require and are determined to improve their deterrence and defense capabilities.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-britain-and-germany-sign-defense-pact-to-counter-russias-growing-threat/	2024-10-23T04:00:29-07:00	
It could take 350 years for Gaza to rebuild if it remains under a...	United Nations agencies have long warned that it could take decades to rebuild Gaza after Israel's offensive against Hamas, one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns since World War II. Now, more than a year into the war, a new report speaks in terms of centuries. The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development said in a report released Monday that if the war ends tomorrow and Gaza returns to the status quo before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, it could take 350 years for its battered economy to return to its precarious prewar level. Before the war, Gaza was under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade imposed after Hamas seized power in 2007. Four previous wars and divisions between Hamas and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank also took a toll on Gaza's economy. The current war has caused staggering destruction across the territory, with entire neighborhoods obliterated and roads and critical infrastructure in ruins. Mountains of rubble laced with decomposing bodies and unexploded ordnance would have to be cleared before rebuilding could begin. 'Once a ceasefire is reached, a return to the pre-October 2023 status quo would not put Gaza on the path needed for recovery and sustainable development,' the report said. 'If the 2007–2022 growth trend returns, with an average growth rate of 0.4 percent, it will take Gaza 350 years just to restore the GDP levels of 2022.' Even then, GDP per capita would decline 'continuously and precipitously' as the population grows, it said. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas from importing arms and blames the militant group for Gaza's plight. 'There is no future for the people of Gaza as long as their people continue to be occupied by Hamas,' Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, said in response to the report. 350 years is more of a calculation than a prediction Three hundred and fifty years is a long time. It would be as though England and the Netherlands were only now recovering from the wars they fought against each other in the late 1600s. Rami Alazzeh, author of the report, said he based the calculation on the decimation of the economy during the first seven months of the war, and how long it would take to restore it at the GDP growth rate Gaza averaged from 2007 until 2022. Gross domestic product, or GDP, is the sum total of all goods and services produced in a country or territory. 'The message is the recovery in Gaza depends on the conditions in which the recovery would happen,' he said. 'We’re not saying that it will take Gaza 350 years to recover because that means that Gaza will never recover.' At the end of January, the World Bank estimated $18.5 billion of damage — nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022. That was before some intensely destructive Israeli ground operations, including in the southern border city of Rafah. A U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage found roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza had been destroyed or severely damaged. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage. The Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, calculated how long it would take to rebuild all the destroyed homes under what was known as the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism. That process was established after the 2014 war to facilitate some reconstruction under heavy Israeli surveillance. It found that under that setup, it would take 40 years to rebuild all the homes. Even in best-case circumstances, recovery could take decades The report says that even under the most optimistic scenario, with a projected growth rate of 10%, Gaza’s recovery would still take decades. 'Assuming no military operation, and freedom of movement of goods and people and a significant level of investment, and population growth of 2.8 percent per year, UNCTAD estimates that Gaza’s GDP per capita will return to its 2022 level by 2050,' it said. A separate report released Tuesday by the U.N. Development Program said that with major investment and the lifting of economic restrictions, the Palestinian economy as a whole, including the West Bank, could be back on track by 2034. In the absence of both, its predictions align with those of UNCTAD. The more positive scenarios appear unlikely. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250 when they stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don't distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children. It has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, forcing hundreds of thousands into squalid tent camps. Israel is unlikely to lift the blockade as long as Hamas has a presence inside Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control over the territory. Since May, Israel has controlled all of Gaza's border crossings. U.N. agencies and humanitarian groups say they have struggled to bring in food and emergency aid because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order inside Gaza. There's also no indication that international donors are willing to fund the rebuilding of Gaza as long as it remains in the grip of war or under Israeli occupation. Arab Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they will only do so if there is a pathway to a Palestinian state, something to which Netanyahu is deeply opposed. Meanwhile, the war rages with no end in sight. Earlier in the month, Israel launched another major operation in northern Gaza — the most heavily destroyed part of the territory — saying Hamas had regrouped there. 'Everybody now calls for a cease-fire, but people forget that once the cease-fire is done, the 2.2 million Palestinians will wake up having no homes, children having no schools, no universities, no hospitals, no roads,' Alazzeh said. All that will take a long time to rebuild, and could prove impossible under the blockade. 'If we go back to where it was before, and we shouldn’t go back to the way it was before,' he said, 'then I think it means that Gaza’s done.' ___ Follow AP’s Gaza coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-a-un-report-says-it-could-take-350-years-for-gaza-to-rebuild-if-it-remains-under-a-blockade/	2024-10-22T20:01:43-07:00	
Blinken arrives in Israel as US looks to renew cease-fire efforts...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Tuesday on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. Washington hopes to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, but so far all the warring parties appear to be digging in. Israel is still at war with Hamas more than a year after the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack, and with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where it launched a ground invasion earlier this month. Israel is also expected to strike Iran in response to its ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. Blinken landed just hours after Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into central Israel, setting off air raid sirens in the country’s most populated areas and its international airport, but causing no apparent damage or injuries. His meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stretched for more two hours on Tuesday afternoon. He is also expected to meet with President Isaac Herzog, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer. The Israeli military said that it intercepted most of the five projectiles, with one landing in an open area. Another 15 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel at around the same time, it said. Hospitals in Lebanon fear being targeted by Israel The death toll from Israeli airstrikes late Monday that destroyed several buildings facing one of Beirut’s main hospitals climbed to 13. Lebanon's Health Ministry said that 57 others were wounded, including seven who were in critical condition. The Israeli military said that it struck a Hezbollah target, without elaborating, and said that it hadn't targeted the hospital itself. Associated Press reporters visited the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the country’s largest public hospital, on Tuesday. They saw broken windows in the hospital’s pharmacy and dialysis center, which was full of patients at the time. The force of the explosions also destroyed some of the hospital’s solar panels. Staff said that in the midst of their own panic, they had to deal with wounded patients streaming into the hospital in the aftermath of the strikes across the street. Staff at another Beirut hospital feared it would be targeted after Israel alleged that Hezbollah had stashed hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold in its basement, without providing evidence. The director of the Sahel General Hospital denied the allegations and invited journalists to visit the hospital and its two underground floors on Tuesday. AP reporters saw no sign of militants or anything out of the ordinary. The few remaining patients had been evacuated after the Israeli military's announcement the night before. The rest had left earlier because of repeated airstrikes in the surrounding neighborhood. 'We have been living in terror for the last 24 hours,' hospital director Mazen Alame said. 'There is nothing under the hospital.' Many in Lebanon fear Israel could target its hospitals in the same way it has raided medical facilities across Gaza. The Israeli military has accused Hamas and other militants of using hospitals for military purposes, allegations denied by medical staff. Hospitals can lose their protection under international law if they are used for military purposes. Blinken expected to focus on Gaza The U.S. State Department said ahead of the visit that Blinken would focus on ending the war in Gaza, securing the release of hostages held by Hamas and alleviating the suffering of Palestinian civilians. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Blinken would underscore the need for a dramatic increase in the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, something that Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made clear in a letter to Israeli officials last week. That letter reminded Israel that the Biden administration could be forced by U.S. law to curtail some forms of military aid should the delivery of humanitarian aid continue to be hindered. Blinken's previous trips have yielded little in the way of ending hostilities, but he has managed to increase aid deliveries to Gaza in the past. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have brokered months of talks between Israel and Hamas, trying to strike a deal in which the militants would release dozens of hostages in return for an end to the war, a lasting cease-fire and the release of Palestinian prisoners. But both Israel and Hamas accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands over the summer, and the talks ground to a halt in August. Hamas says its demands haven't changed following the killing of Sinwar. US and Iran both step up outreach before expected Israeli strike Blinken is expected to meet with Netanyahu and other top officials, and to visit a number of Arab countries, likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has been crisscrossing the region in recent days to try and built support before Israel’s threatened retaliatory strike. Speaking in Kuwait on Tuesday, he said that Gulf Arab countries had assured him that they wouldn't allow their territory to be used for any Israeli strike. 'All the neighbors assured us that they will not allow their lands and air to be used against Iran,' Araghchi said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. The Arab Gulf countries haven't publicly offered such assurances. Gulf Arab nations like the UAE and Qatar host major military installations, and there are concerns that an all-out regional war could draw them in. Iran has repeatedly vowed to respond to any Israeli strike. War rages in Lebanon and northern Gaza The U.S. has also tried to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, but those efforts fell apart as tensions spiked last month with a series of Israeli strikes that killed the militant group’s top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel is waging another major operation in already-devastated northern Gaza, which has killed hundreds of Palestinians over the last two weeks, according to local health authorities. In Lebanon, Israel has carried out waves of heavy airstrikes across southern Beirut and the country’s south and east, areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, including some that have reached the country’s populous center. Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 hostage. Around 100 of the captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Hezbollah began attacking Israel the day after the Hamas attack. Both groups are backed by Iran. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded tens of thousands, according to local health authorities, who don't say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children. It has also caused major devastation across the territory and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million. ___ Sarah El Deeb reported from Beirut.

Ukraine's Zelenskyy says only a US green light on a NATO invitati...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's president is hoping allies will take a more positive stance on his so-called 'victory plan' after the U.S. election, but concedes that its key demand — an invitation to join NATO — is not welcome by some major Western partners, in particular Germany. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was also likely looking at the postelection scenario in the U.S. to assess the possibility of cease-fire talks with Ukraine. He assessed that if partial cease-fire deals could be reached over attacks on energy infrastructure and Black Sea shipping routes, it would signal the end of the 'hot phase' of the war. Zelenskyy spoke to journalists on Monday and his comments were embargoed until Tuesday. He said the U.S. is analyzing his plan, but he doesn't expect a meaningful response until after the Nov. 5 election. 'They said, yes, we’ve started working on the Victory Plan, they want to analyze everything, and so on. But it’s very clear to me that all the major partners, especially during the election period, will be afraid of Russia’s reaction,' he said. 'Because they understand that with this package, we can destroy them.' On NATO, Zelenskyy said France, Britain and Italy have shown signs of support. Germany has reservations, however, and Zelenskyy believes only a U.S. green light will convince Berlin to accept the idea. 'But the fact is that the German side is skeptical about our NATO membership — that’s a fact. I believe their stance is softer than it was before — this is also a fact. 'But when it comes to the invitation I’m talking about now, they are afraid of ... Russia’s reaction,' he said. 'I believe that their position will be influenced by a bigger alliance. A bigger alliance in supporting us — a confident 'Yes' from the United States.' Many significant issues will hinge on decisions taken following the fraught election period, the president said. 'After the elections, we hope for a more positive reaction from the U.S. — not because of a change in the president, but because the focus of the United States is now on the elections, and I believe that any sharp statements from the U.S. today might be inappropriate or carry risks. I think they don’t want unnecessary risks,' he said. Asked if he faced pressure from allies to end the war, Zelenskyy joked, saying, 'Over the years, people’s overall blood pressure rises.' He dismissed reports of a possible cease-fire scenario in which Ukraine exchanged occupied territories for NATO membership. 'We are not discussing this. But I think that these media leaks are not accidental. Perhaps some partners may have such thoughts. They don’t communicate this directly with me, but through the media, it’s clear they’re testing its reception.' He said the end of the 'hot phase' of the war would commence if a deal could be reached with Russia to halt attacks on energy infrastructure and Black Sea ports and shipping routes. In this case, attacks on military targets would continue as well as front-line fighting, he said. He said he plans to convince countries of the Global South to embrace Ukraine's plan as another way to push Moscow to agree to Kyiv's terms. Zelenskyy said his country is not pursuing nuclear weapons to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'We are not asking to be given or returned nuclear weapons,' he said. 'My position is very clear. We gave them up, but we got nothing in return. And we only received a full-scale war and many casualties, so today we have only one way out. That’s why we need NATO, because we don’t have the weapons that can stop Putin.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraines-zelenskyy-says-only-a-us-green-light-on-a-nato-invitation-will-sway-a-reluctant-germany/	2024-10-22T05:42:43-07:00	
Iraqi forces kill Islamic State group commander and 8 other offic...	BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq’s prime minister announced Tuesday that the Islamic State militant group’s leader in Iraq was killed in a military operation along with eight of the group’s other senior leaders.‎ Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said that Jassim al-Mazroui Abu Abdul Qader was killed in an operation by counterterrorism forces and the national security service under the Joint Operations Command in the Hamrin Mountains in Salahuddin province, 'There is no place for terrorists in Iraq, and we will pursue them to their hideouts and eliminate them,' al-Sudani said in a statement. The Joint Operations Command said in a statement that the operation was carried out 'with technical support and exchange of accurate intelligence information by the international coalition forces.' The identities of the others killed in the operation along with Abdul Qader will be announced after they are confirmed by DNA tests, it said. The statement also indicated that 'large quantities of weapons, ammunition and equipment were seized.' Last month, the U.S. announced an agreement with the Iraqi government to wrap up the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by next year, with U.S. troops departing some bases that they have long occupied during a two-decade-long military presence in the country. A coalition of more than 80 countries, led by the United States, was formed to fight IS, which lost its hold on the territory it controlled in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria in 2019, although sleeper cells remain in both countries and abroad. For years, Iraqi officials had periodically called for a withdrawal of coalition forces, and formal talks to wind down the U.S. presence in the country were ongoing for months. Iraqi officials have maintained that Iraqi security forces are able to deal with the remaining sleeper cells and prevent the group from staging a resurgence.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-iraqi-forces-kill-islamic-state-group-commander-and-8-other-officials/	2024-10-22T05:21:47-07:00	
South Korea warns it can send arms to Ukraine after reports of No...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea warned Tuesday it could consider supplying weapons to Ukraine in response to North Korea allegedly dispatching troops to Russia, as both North Korea and Russia denied the movements. The South Korean statement is apparently meant to pressure Russia not to bring in North Korean troops in its war against Ukraine. South Korean officials worry that Russia may reward North Korea by giving it sophisticated weapons technologies that can boost the North’s nuclear and missile programs that target South Korea. In an emergency National Security Council meeting, top South Korean officials condemned North Korea’s alleged dispatch of troops as 'a grave security threat' to South Korea and the international community. They described North Korea as 'a criminal group' that forces its youths to serve as Russian mercenaries for an unjustifiable war, the South Korean presidential office said in a statement. The officials agreed to take phased countermeasures, linking the level of their responses to progress in Russian-North Korean military cooperation, according to the statement. Possible steps include diplomatic, economic and military options, and South Korea could consider sending both defensive and offensive weapons to Ukraine, a senior South Korean presidential official told reporters on condition of anonymity in a background briefing. The official said North Korea could attempt to get high-tech Russian technologies to perfect its nuclear missiles. The official said Russia's possible help for North Korea's efforts to modernize its outdated conventional weapons systems and acquire a space-based surveillance system would pose a serious security threat to South Korea as well. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, South Korea has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow and shipped humanitarian and financial support to Kyiv. But it has avoided directly supplying arms to Ukraine in line with its policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. South Korea’s spy agency said last week it had confirmed that North Korea sent 1,500 special operation forces to Russia this month. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join invading Russian forces. North Korea and Russia intensify cooperation North Korea and Russia have been sharply boosting their cooperation in the past two years. In June, they signed a major defense deal requiring both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. South Korea said at the time it would consider sending arms to Ukraine, a similar statement that it made Tuesday. South Korea's spy agency said that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. North Korea and Russia have denied the North Korean troop deployment as well as the purported weapons transfer. At a U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia dismissed the South Korean assertion as well as Western allegations of Iran supplying Russia with missiles and China providing arms components. He accused the West of 'circulating scaremongering with Iranian, Chinese and Korean bogeymen, each one of which is more absurd than the one before.' At a separate U.N. committee meeting, a North Korean diplomat said his delegation feels no need to comment on the troop dispatch, calling it 'groundless, stereotype rumors aimed at smearing the image' of the North and undermining the legitimate cooperation between two sovereign states. Also Tuesday, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called South Korean and Ukraine governments 'lunatics' as she slammed them for making 'reckless remarks against nuclear weapons states.' The U.S. and NATO haven’t confirmed North Korea’s troop deployment, but they warned against the danger of such a development if true. U.S. deputy ambassador to the U.N. Robert Wood said that if true, the North Korean troop dispatch marks 'a dangerous and highly concerning development' and noted that the U.S. was 'consulting with our allies and partners on such a dramatic move.' __ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-south-korea-warns-it-can-send-arms-to-ukraine-after-reports-of-norths-troops-in-russia/	2024-10-22T03:40:27-07:00	
Middle East latest: Hezbollah fires rockets into central Israel	Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into central Israel on Tuesday, setting off air raid sirens in the country’s most populated areas but causing no apparent damage or injuries. The Israeli military said five projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israel and said most were intercepted by Israel’s missile defense system. One landed in an open area. The rocket fire came as Israel stepped up its strikes in Lebanon, targeting a Hezbollah-run financial institution, and as the U.S. pushed to resume cease-fire talks in Gaza following the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Here's the latest: Hezbollah fires rockets into central Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into central Israel on Tuesday, setting off air raid sirens in the country’s most populated areas but causing no apparent damage or injuries.

US defense chief promises Ukraine what it needs to fight Russia b...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The United States 'will get Ukraine what it needs' to fight its war with Russia, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Monday, but he gave no hint that Washington might endorse key planks of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's so-called 'victory plan.' The United States will provide Ukraine with what it requires 'to fight for its survival and security,' Austin said in a speech at the Diplomatic Academy of Ukraine. He noted that the U.S. has delivered more than $58 billion in security assistance for Ukraine since Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion, making it Kyiv's main backer. That includes a new $400 million package of military aid that the Biden administration announced Monday, including munitions for rocket systems and artillery, mortar systems and rounds, armored vehicles and anti-tank weapons. It comes just days after the U.S. said it was sending $425 million in military assistance to Ukraine. But Zelenskyy has asked Ukraine's Western allies to go a few steps further, notably inviting Ukraine to join NATO and letting it use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory. Those steps have met with a lukewarm response. Ukraine is having difficulty holding back a ferocious Russian campaign along the eastern front that is gradually compelling Kyiv’s forces to give up a series of towns, villages and hamlets. It faces a hard winter after Russia targeted its power grid. Austin's remarks were notable for what they did not include — an endorsement of Ukraine being invited into NATO, or any indication the U.S. will support Ukraine becoming more aggressive in its defense with longer-range attacks on Russian soil. With the U.S. presidential election about two weeks away, U.S. officials are treading carefully. President Joe Biden has balked at measures that might escalate the war and bring a confrontation between NATO and Russia. Austin said 'there is no silver bullet. No single capability will turn the tide. No one system will end Putin’s assault.' He added: 'Make no mistake. The United States does not seek war with Russia.' 'What matters is the way that Ukraine fights back,' Austin told the assembled diplomatic and military personnel at the academy. 'What matters is the combined effects of your military capabilities. And what matters is staying focused on what works.' Zelenskyy said in a Sunday evening video address that his ‘victory plan’ had won the backing of France, Lithuania, Nordic countries and 'many other allies' in the European Union, which he didn’t name. Zelenskyy said he had received 'very positive signals from the United States,' but he stopped short of saying he had secured Washington’s blessing for the plan. Analysts say the U.S. is unlikely to make a decision before the Nov. 5. presidential election. Russian strikes highlight Ukraine's need for weapons The latest Russian strikes on Ukraine, targeting Kyiv, Odesa and Zaporizhzhia, rammed home the urgency for Kyiv officials of clinching guarantees of more support, particularly large amounts of ammunition for the war of attrition the sides are engaged in. A Russian missile attack on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia killed two people and injured 15 in the city center and caused huge damage to civilian infrastructure, including a kindergarten and more than 30 residential buildings, regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov said. Russia conducted a ballistic missile strike at Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy’s hometown, injuring five people, city administration head Oleksandr Vilkul wrote on social media. According to Vilkul, Russia has conducted ballistic missile attacks on Kryvyi Rih for three consecutive days, injuring the total of 21 people and damaging dozens of residential buildings and civilian infrastructure. Machine gunfire and the noise of drones’ engines was also heard in Kyiv’s center throughout the night. Authorities reported minor damages to civilian infrastructure caused by falling drone debris in three districts. Russia fired three missiles and more than 100 drones at Ukraine overnight from Sunday to Monday, Ukraine's air force said. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan in Ankara on Monday to discuss cooperation between their countries. According to Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry, the meeting focused on strengthening strategic relations, defense cooperation and addressing global food security through Black Sea grain shipments from Ukraine that pass through Turkey’′ Bosphorus Strait. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought to steer a balanced line in his NATO-member country’s close relations with both Ukraine and Russia. He has previously offered to host a peace summit between the two countries. ___ Associated Press writer Tara Copp in Washington contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-defense-chief-visits-kyiv-for-talks-on-how-to-keep-supporting-ukraines-fight-against-russia/	2024-10-21T19:26:17-07:00	
Israel says more strikes are coming against a Hezbollah-run finan...	BEIRUT (AP) — Israel said late Monday it planned to carry out more strikes in Lebanon against a Hezbollah-run financial institution that it targeted the night before and which it says uses customers' deposits to finance attacks against Israel. At least 15 branches of Al-Qard Al-Hasan were hit late Sunday in the southern neighborhoods of Beirut, across southern Lebanon and in the eastern Bekaa Valley, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. One strike flattened a nine-story building in Beirut with a branch inside it. The Israeli military issued evacuation warnings ahead of the strikes, and there were no reports of casualties. Associated Press journalists witnessed strikes late Monday in the coastal region of Ouzai, near Beirut’s airport, and Lebanon’s Health Ministry said an airstrike near Beirut’s largest public hospital killed four, including a child, and wounded 24. It was the first strike on the Lebanese capital in 10 days. Israeli ground forces invaded Lebanon earlier this month. The military said it aims to push Hezbollah out of southern Lebanon so that tens of thousands of Israelis can return to their homes nearby after more than a year of cross-border rocket and drone attacks. Israeli airstrikes have pounded large areas of Lebanon for weeks, forcing over a million people to flee their homes. Hezbollah has been launching rockets into Israel nearly every day since Hamas' deadly raid into Israel last year that sparked the war in Gaza. The United States is hoping to revive diplomatic efforts to resolve both conflicts after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week, but so far all sides appear to be digging in. Hezbollah-run lender filled gaps left by Lebanon's troubled banks The Arabic language spokesman for the Israeli military, Avichay Adraee, said — without providing evidence — that Hezbollah stores hundreds of millions of dollars in the branches of Al-Qard Al-Hasan and that the money is used to purchase arms and pay fighters. The strikes were aimed at preventing the group from rearming, he said. The institution, which has more than 30 branches across Lebanon, tried to reassure customers, saying it had evacuated all branches and relocated gold and other deposits to safe areas. Many customers are civilians unaffiliated with Hezbollah. Al-Qard Al-Hasan, which is sanctioned by the United States and Saudi Arabia, has long served as an alternative to Lebanon's banks, which have imposed restrictions on customers since a severe financial crisis that began in 2019. Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said late Monday that Israel planned more strikes on Al-Qard al-Hasan. Hagari said Iran funds Hezbollah by sending cash and gold to the Iranian embassy in Beirut, though he did not provide any evidence. Hagari also said, without providing evidence, that Israeli intelligence had discovered a bunker belonging to former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah that is now being used as a vault under a hospital in southern Beirut. He said it held millions of dollars of gold and cash. A member of Lebanon’s parliament who is the director of the hospital, Fadi Alameh, denied the claim, and said the hospital has underground operation rooms. Alameh said the hospital was being evacuated in anticipation of strikes. Hagari said Israeli strikes in Beirut in early October and in Syria on Monday had also killed people responsible for transferring money between Iran and Hezbollah. Syrian state media said an Israeli airstrike hit a car in the capital of Damascus, killing two people and wounding three. Israeli airstrikes killed 17 people in Lebanon on Monday, including four first responders, according to the country's health ministry. The Israeli military said Hezbollah fired 170 projectiles into Israel on Monday. US envoy says UN resolution that ended past war is ‘no longer enough’ U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who has spent much of the past year trying to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, was back in Lebanon on Monday for talks with senior officials. He said U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, was 'no longer enough' to ensure peace and a new mechanism was needed to enforce it. The resolution called for Hezbollah to withdraw from the border with Israel and for U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army to control southern Lebanon, without any Hezbollah or Israeli presence. Israel says the resolution was never implemented and that Hezbollah built up extensive military infrastructure right up to the border. Lebanon has long accused Israel of violating its airspace and failing to abide by other provisions of the resolution. US tries to revive Gaza cease-fire talks after Sinwar’s death The United States has expressed hope that last week's killing of Hamas leader Sinwar could give new impetus for a cease-fire in Gaza, which would give a major boost to parallel efforts to halt the fighting in Lebanon. The head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency, Ronen Bar, visited Egypt for the second time in less than a week and met with Egyptian officials on Sunday, according to an Egyptian official who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said Egypt, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, remains opposed to any Israeli presence along the Gaza-Egypt border, a key sticking point in talks that sputtered to a halt in August. Hamas has said its demands remain unchanged after the killing of Sinwar. The militant group has said it will only release dozens of Israeli hostages in return for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a lasting cease-fire and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and recover all the captives, and says Israel must maintain an open-ended security presence in Gaza to keep Hamas from rearming. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 captives are still being held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don’t distinguish combatants from civilians but say most of the dead were women and children. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

South Korea calls for immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea on Monday demanded the immediate pullout of North Korean troops allegedly deployed in Russia as it summoned the Russian ambassador to protest deepening military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. South Korea's spy agency said Friday it had confirmed that North Korea sent 1,500 special operation forces to Russia this month to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join invading Russian forces. During a meeting with Russian Ambassador Georgy Zinoviev, Vice South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Hong Kyun 'condemned in the strongest terms' North Korea's troop dispatch that he said poses 'a grave security threat' to South Korea and the international community, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Kim said that South Korea in collaboration with the international community will mobilize all available means to deal with an act that threatens its vital national security interests, according to the statement. The Russian Embassy quoted Zinoviev as saying that the Russian-North Korean cooperation is not aimed against the security interests of South Korea. In a telephone call with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Monday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said that Seoul won’t sit idly by 'reckless' military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Yoon said South Korea will soon send a delegation to NATO to exchange information about Russian-North Korean cooperation, according to Yoon’s office. Rutte wrote on X that North Korea possibly fighting alongside Russia would 'mark a significant escalation.' The U.S. and NATO haven't confirmed that North Korean troops were sent to Russia. But the reports of their presence have already stoked concerns in South Korea that Russia might provide North Korea with sophisticated technologies that can sharply enhance the North's nuclear and missile programs in return for its troop dispatch. North Korea's advancing nuclear arsenal is a major security threat to South Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un recently took steps to permanently terminate all relations with South Korea and threatened to use nuclear weapons preemptively. Some observers say South Korea will likely consider supplying weapons to Ukraine if Russian transfers of high-tech nuclear and missile technologies to North Korea are verified. South Korea has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. But South Korea hasn’t directly provided arms to Kyiv, citing its longstanding policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. Russia has earlier denied using North Korean troops in its war with Ukraine. North Korea's state media hasn't commented on the matter. Ukrainian officials released a video allegedly showing North Korean soldiers lining up to collect Russian military clothes and bags at an unknown location. The Associated Press couldn’t verify the footage independently. Asked about the North Korean troops during a conference call with reporters Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that 'we are seeing a lot of contradictory information.' 'South Koreans say one thing, then the Pentagon says it has no confirmation of such statements. There is a lot of contradictory information,' Peskov said. 'It must be treated as such.' At a U.N. Security Council meeting Monday on Ukraine, Western ambassadors raised the South Korean intelligence, but none confirmed it. U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood said that if true, it marks 'a dangerous and highly concerning development' and noted that the U.S. was 'consulting with our allies and partners on such a dramatic move.' Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward said it’s 'highly likely' North Korea agreed to send troops in support of Russia’s war. Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia dismissed the South Korean assertion as well as Western allegations of Iran supplying Russia with missiles and China providing arms components. He accused the West of 'circulating scaremongering with Iranian, Chinese and Korean bogeymen, each one of which is more absurd than the one before.' North Korea's troop deployment to Russia would be its first participation in a major war since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Many experts question how much North Korean troops would help Russia on the battlefield, citing their lack of combat experience. Cooperation between North Korea and Russia has flourished over the past two years. The U.S., South Korea and their partners have accused North Korea of supplying conventional arms to Russia in return for economic and military assistance. In June, Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked. __ Associated Press writers Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul and Edith M.

Democrats urge Biden to push Israel for press freedom in Gaza	Dozens of House Democrats are pressing the Biden administration to get tougher on Israel when it comes to press freedoms in Gaza, warning that a lack of media access in the war-torn territory has stifled any push for accountability surrounding military operations that have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians. In a letter to President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, 65 House Democrats voiced their 'deep concern' that Israel’s near blockade on foreign press access — combined with the inherent dangers facing the local journalists who are covering the conflict — have left the world with a dim understanding of what’s actually happening on the ground in Gaza, where international aid groups report a burgeoning humanitarian crisis. 'The restrictions on media reporting have created significant challenges in obtaining accurate, verifiable information from Gaza, leading to increased skepticism about the limited reports that do emerge,' the lawmakers wrote earlier in the month. 'At a time when reliable information is more critical than ever, the restrictions on foreign reporting undermine the very foundation of press freedom and democratic accountability.' The Democrats noted that international media groups have pressed for months to grant better access, only to have Israeli leaders rebuff those requests. The 'few controlled [media] trips arranged by the Israeli military' are not enough to fill the void, the lawmakers wrote, particularly given the extraordinarily high casualty rate of reporters on the ground in Gaza. Of the 99 reporters killed worldwide in 2023, 72 were Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza by Israeli attacks, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. 'This effective ban on foreign reporting has placed an overwhelming burden on local journalists who are documenting the war they are living through,' the Democrats wrote. 'Tragically, at least 130 journalists have lost their lives since the start of the war, and those who remain face conditions of extreme hardship and danger.' The lawmakers want Biden and Blinken 'to take immediate action to advocate for unrestricted, independent media access to Gaza.' They did not propose how. 'A free press is essential to ensuring that the world can bear witness to the realities on the ground and hold all parties accountable,' they wrote. The letter was spearheaded by Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), who co-chairs the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, and it was endorsed by 64 other House Democrats. The list features senior members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, including Rep. Gerry Connolly (Va.); a number of prominent liberals, including Reps. Barbara Lee (Calif.), Pramila Jayapal (Wash.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.); two members of the party’s messaging arm, Reps. Veronica Escobar (Texas) and Lori Trahan (Mass.); and several veteran Jewish Democrats including Reps. Jan Schakowsky (Ill.) and Steve Cohen (Tenn.). Congress’s only three Muslim Americans — Reps. André Carson (D-Ind.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) — also signed the letter. The pressure campaign arrives shortly after the anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants based in Gaza attacked Israel, killing almost 1,200 people — most of them civilians — and kidnapping another 250. Democrats on Capitol Hill have been united, both in condemning the attack and advocating for Israel’s right to self-defense. But as the Israel-Hamas War has grown longer, many lawmakers have grown more critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for how he’s conducted the military response. Those criticisms have only intensified as the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza have surpassed 40,000, Israelis have escalated their expansion of settlements in the West Bank and Israeli leaders have largely ignored entreaties from Biden and Blinken for a cease-fire to help facilitate negotiations to free the remaining hostages and to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza. The conflict has proven a huge headache for Biden, who’s seeking a delicate balance between demonstrating support for Israel, America’s closest ally in the Middle East, and pushing Netanyahu to do more to protect Palestinian civilians. The issue could have profound political implications at home, where Vice President Harris is vying for the White House against former President Trump. Some Muslim American voters have vowed to withhold their support for Democrats unless they make stronger demands for a cease-fire. A breakthrough moment in the conflict came last week, when Israeli forces killed Yahya Sinwar, the militant head of Hamas who had helped to plan the Oct. 7 attacks. Biden, joined by many Democrats, has said Sinwar’s death creates a new opportunity for an elusive cease-fire. Netanyahu, however, has vowed to press on with the conflict.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/democrats-urge-biden-to-push-israel-for-press-freedom-in-gaza/	2024-10-21T11:19:56-07:00	
Blinken heads to the Middle East for the 11th time since the Gaza...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading again to the Middle East, making his 11th trip to the region since the war in Gaza erupted last year and as Israel steps up attacks against Hezbollah in Lebanon. The State Department said Blinken would depart Monday for a weeklong trip to Israel and a number of Arab countries on a visit that also comes as Israel weighs retaliation against Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month. His other stops are likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, officials say. The trip had been expected after President Joe Biden said last week he would dispatch Blinken to the region following Israel’s killing of Hamas military chief Yahya Sinwar, a move that some believe could open a window for new talks on a cease-fire proposal that has been languishing for months. In Israel on Tuesday, Blinken will meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog, according to Israeli officials. 'Secretary Blinken will discuss the importance of bringing the war in Gaza to an end, securing the release of all hostages, and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. In the region, Blinken will discuss planning for when the conflict ends and 'the need to chart a new path forward that enables Palestinians to rebuild their lives,' Miller added. He said Blinken also would underscore the need for a dramatic increase in the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, something that Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made clear in a letter to Israeli officials last week. That letter reminded Israel that the Biden administration could be forced by U.S. law to curtail some forms of military aid should the delivery of humanitarian assistance continue to be hindered. In addition to the conflict in Gaza, Blinken will also raise the importance the administration places on reaching a diplomatic resolution to the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and elsewhere. 'He will reaffirm the U.S. commitment to work with partners across the region to de-escalate tensions and provide lasting stability,' Miller said in the statement. Since the Hamas attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the Israeli response, Blinken has traveled to the Middle East 10 other times seeking an end to the crisis. His previous trips have yielded little in the way of ending hostilities, but he has managed to increase aid deliveries to Gaza in the past. Since just last month, the situation has grown increasingly tense, sparking renewed fears of a wider regional war, particularly since Israel began ground operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah and killed its leader Hassan Nasrallah in a massive airstrike in the Beirut suburbs. Iran has responded to Israeli attacks against its proxies with ballistic missile launches, the latest of which Israel has yet to retaliate for. Biden administration officials have cautioned Israel about its planned retaliation and believe they have won assurances from Israeli leaders that they will not hit nuclear or oil facilities. However, Netanyahu has said repeatedly that while Israel will listen to American advice, his country will act in its own national interest. And previous U.S. warnings about escalation have gone unheeded. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden was 'deeply concerned' about the unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel’s preparation for a potential retaliatory attack on Iran, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Monday. U.S. officials said an investigation is underway. ___ AP reporter Aamer Madhani contributed from Washington.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-blinken-heads-to-mideast-for-11th-time-since-gaza-war-prospects-for-a-truce-remain-uncertain/	2024-10-21T10:03:42-07:00	
Video published by Ukraine purports to show North Korean soldiers...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A video purporting to show dozens of North Korean recruits lining up to collect Russian military fatigues and gear aims to intimidate Ukrainian forces and marks a new chapter in the 2 1/2-year war with the introduction of another country into the battlefield, Ukrainian officials said. In the video, which was verified by Ukraine’s Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security, which operates under the Culture and Information Ministry, presumably North Korean soldiers stand in line to pick up bags, clothes and other apparel from Russian servicemen. The Associated Press could not verify the video independently. 'We received this video from our own sources. We cannot provide additional verification from the sources who provided it to us due to security concerns,' said Ihor Solovey, head of the center. 'The video clearly shows North Korean citizens being given Russian uniforms under the direction of the Russian military,' he said. 'For Ukraine, this video is important because it is the first video evidence that shows North Korea participating in the war on the side of Russia. Now not only with weapons and shells but also with personnel.' The center claims the footage was shot by a Russian soldier in recent days. The location is unknown. It comes after the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said in local media reports that about 11,000 North Korean infantrymen were currently training in eastern Russia. He predicted they would be ready to join fighting by November. At least 2,600 would be sent to Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an incursion in August, he was quoted as saying. 'The emergence of any number of new soldiers is a problem because we will simply need new, additional weapons to destroy them all,' Solovey told AP. 'The dissemination of this video is important as a signal to the world community that with two countries officially at war against Ukraine, we will need more support to repel this aggression.' The presence of North Korean soldiers in Ukraine, if true, would be another proof of intensified military ties between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Last summer, they signed a strategic partnership treaty that commits both countries to provide military assistance.

JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli government said a drone targeted the prime minister’s house Saturday, though there were no casualties, as Iran’s supreme leader vowed Hamas would continue its fight following the killing of the mastermind of last year’s deadly Oct. 7 attack. Sirens wailed in Israel warning of incoming fire from Lebanon. The military said dozens of projectiles were launched. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the drone targeted his house in the Mediterranean coastal town of Caesarea, though neither he nor his wife were home. The barrage comes as Israel considers its expected response to an Iranian attack earlier this month and presses its offensives against Hamas militants in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. In Gaza, Israeli forces fired at hospitals in the battered northern part of the Palestinian enclave, and strikes in the strip killed more than 50 people, including children, in less than 24 hours, according to hospital officials and an Associated Press reporter there. In September, Yemen’s Houthi rebels launched a ballistic missile toward Ben Gurion Airport when Netanyahu’s plane was landing. The missile was intercepted. Barrages from Lebanon target northern Israel In addition to the drone launched at Netanyahu’s private residence, Israel’s military said some 55 projectiles were fired in two separate barrages at northern Israel from Lebanon on Saturday morning. A 50-year-old man was killed after being hit by shrapnel while sitting in his car in northern Israel, and four people were injured, Israel’s medical services said. Israel's war with Lebanon’s Hezbollah — a Hamas ally backed by Iran — has intensified in recent weeks. Hezbollah said Friday that it planned to launch a new phase of fighting by sending more guided missiles and exploding drones into Israel. The militant group’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in late September, and Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon earlier in October. Israel also said Saturday it killed Hezbollah’s deputy commander in the southern town of Bint Jbeil. The army said Nasser Rashid supervised attacks against Israel. In Lebanon, the health ministry said an Israeli airstrike Saturday hit a vehicle on a main highway north of Beirut, killing two people. It was unclear who was in the car when it was struck. Israeli strikes pound Gaza as Hamas rejects hostage release A standoff is also ensuing between Israel and Hamas, which it’s fighting in Gaza, with both signaling resistance to ending the war after the death of Hamas’ leader Yahya Sinwar this week. On Friday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Sinwar’s death was a painful loss but noted that Hamas carried on despite the killings of other Palestinian militant leaders before him. 'Hamas is alive and will stay alive,' Khamenei said in his first comments on the killing. Since Israel claimed Sinwar’s death Thursday, confirmed by a top Hamas official Friday, Hamas has reiterated its stance that the hostages taken from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops. The staunch position pushed back against a statement by Netanyahu that his country’s military will keep fighting until the hostages are released, and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from rearming. Sinwar was the chief architect of the 2023 Hamas raid on Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped another 250. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children. More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday. The Palestinian Health Ministry said in a statement that Israeli strikes hit the upper floors of the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya, and that forces opened fire at the hospital’s building and its courtyard, causing panic among patients and medical staff. At Al-Awda hospital in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, strikes hit the building’s top floors, injuring several staff members, the hospital said in a statement. Three houses in Jabaliya were struck overnight Friday, killing at least 30 people, more than half of them women and children, said Fares Abu Hamza, head of the health ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. At least 80 people were injured. In central Gaza, at least 10 people were killed, including two children, when a house was hit in the town of Zawayda, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, where the casualties were taken. Another strike killed 11 people, all from the same family, in the Maghazi refugee camp, the same hospital said. Associated Press journalists counted the bodies from both strikes at the hospital. The strikes knocked out internet networks in northern Gaza, said Paltel, the Palestinian communications company, on Facebook Saturday. The war has destroyed vast swaths of Gaza, displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, and left them struggling to find food, water, medicine and fuel. Opportunity in Sinwar's death Sinwar’s killing appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday, and it could shift the dynamics of the war in Gaza even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah with ground troops in southern Lebanon and airstrikes in other areas of the country. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. But Netanyahu said in a speech Thursday announcing the killing that 'our war is not yet ended.' Still, the governments of Israel’s allies and exhausted residents of Gaza expressed hope that Sinwar’s death would pave the way for an end to the fighting. In Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza demanded the Israeli government use Sinwar’s killing as a way to restart negotiations to bring home their loved ones. There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead. — Associated Press reporters Jack Jeffery from Ramallah, West Bank and Bassem Mroue in Beirut, Lebanon contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-strike-launched-toward-israeli-prime-ministers-house/	2024-10-19T04:28:16-07:00	
France vows support for Ukraine's plan to end Russian invasion	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot pledged his support for Ukraine’s plan for ending the 2 1/2-year war with Russia, telling reporters in Kyiv on Saturday that he will work with Ukrainian officials to secure other nations’ backing for the proposal. Unveiled by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this week, Kyiv’s so-called 'victory plan' hopes to compel Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine through negotiations. The proposal is being considered by Ukraine’s Western partners, whose help is vital for Kyiv to resist its bigger neighbor. A key element would be a formal invitation into NATO, which Western backers have been reluctant to consider until after the war ends. 'A Russian victory would be a consecration for the law of the strongest and would push the international order toward chaos,' Barrot said at a joint press conference with his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha. 'That is why our exchanges should allow us to make progress on President Zelenskyy’s victory plan and rally the greatest number possible of countries around it.' Since the 2022 invasion, France has been one of Ukraine’s staunchest military, diplomatic and economic supporters in Europe. It is currently training and equipping what will become a full new brigade of Ukrainian soldiers for front-line deployment. French President Emmanuel Macron has also previously pushed for a policy shift from Ukraine’s Western allies that could change the complexion of the war — allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by Western partners, which include missiles from France. Long-range strikes are a key part of Zelenskyy’s five-point plan but have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. Barrot also announced that France would deliver the first batch of Mirage 2000 combat jets to Ukraine in the first three months of 2025, with Ukrainian pilots and mechanics also trained to fly and maintain them. 'By resisting against the invader with exceptional courage, you are not only fighting for Ukraine’s territorial integrity, but you are also holding a front line that separates Europe from Vladimir Putin’s Russia, that separates freedom from oppression,' the French minister said in Kyiv. Russia and Ukraine exchange POWs Barrot’s visit coincided with a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine late Friday night that included 190 POWs traded by the two sides under a deal negotiated by the United Arab Emirates. Among the 95 Ukrainians were 34 Azov fighters who defended Mariupol and the Azovstal steelworks, the fortress-like plant in the now-occupied city of Mariupol where their last-ditch stand became a symbol of resistance against Moscow’s invasion. 'Ninety-five of our people are home again. These are the warriors who defended Mariupol and ‘Azovstal,’ as well as the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Kherson regions,' Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X. The head of the Azov Brigade, Denys Prokopenko, said on Facebook that 34 Azov fighters had been returned, but that another 900 remained in Russian captivity. A well-known Ukrainian human rights activist and service member, Maksym Butkevych, was also among the 95 exchanged. His release was announced by the ZMINA Human Rights Center, the organization that he co-founded. The swap follows the repatriation of 501 dead soldiers to Ukraine Friday in what appeared to be the biggest repatriation of war dead since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Most of the soldiers were killed in action in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine, mostly around the city of Avdiivka that Russian forces captured in February after a long and grueling battle, Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said in a statement. Russia also received the bodies of 89 of its soldiers, Russian lawmaker Shamsayil Saraliyev told reporters. Elsewhere, the Russian Ministry of Defense said that it shot down 16 Ukrainian drones over Russia’s Bryansk, Rostov, and Belgorod regions in the early hours of Saturday morning. Local social media channels shared images that appeared to show a blaze at a factory in the Bryansk region specializing in microelectronics. Russian authorities did not confirm the strike. ___ Associated Press writers John Leicester in Le Pecq, France, and Katie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-france-vows-support-for-ukraines-plan-to-end-russian-invasion/	2024-10-19T04:12:26-07:00	
Freedom of expression threatened more seriously in Gaza than in a...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Freedom of expression has been threatened more seriously in Gaza than in any recent conflict, with journalists targeted in the war-torn territory and Palestinian supporters targeted in many countries, a United Nations expert said Friday. Irene Khan, the U.N. independent investigator on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, pointed to attacks on the media and the targeted killings and arbitrary detention of dozens of journalists in Gaza. 'The banning of Al Jazeera, the tightening of censorship within Israel and in the occupied territories, seem to indicate a strategy of the Israeli authorities to silence critical journalism and obstruct the documentation of possible international crimes,' she said. Khan also sharply criticized the 'discrimination and double standards' that have seen restrictions and suppression of pro-Palestinian protests and speech. She cited bans in Germany and other European countries, protests that were 'crushed harshly' on U.S. college campuses, and Palestinian national symbols and slogans prohibited and even criminalized in some countries. The U.N. special rapporteur also pointed to 'the silencing and sidelining of dissenting voices in academia and the arts,' with some of the best academic institutions in the world failing to protect all members of their community, 'whether Jewish, Palestinian, Israeli, Arab, Muslim, or otherwise.' While social media platforms have been a lifeline for communications to and from Gaza, Khan said, they have seen an upsurge in disinformation, misinformation and hate speech — with Arabs, Jews, Israelis and Palestinians all targeted online. She stressed that Israel’s military actions in Gaza and its decades of occupation of Palestinian territories are matters of public interest, scrutiny and criticism. Khan earlier presented her report on 'the global crisis of freedom of expression arising from the conflict in Gaza' to the General Assembly’s human rights committee. She said Israel responded to it, explained the country’s laws, and 'took the position that the conflict in Gaza was not really of global significance, and my mandate should not engage with it.' Israel’s U.N. mission declined to comment on her press briefing. The surprise attacks in southern Israel led by Hamas militants who controlled Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, killed about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and led to the abduction of about 250 others, around 100 of whom are still hostages. Israel’s military offensive in retaliation has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority were women and children. Khan, a former secretary-general of Amnesty International, stressed that 'no conflict in recent times has threatened freedom of expression so seriously or so far beyond its borders than Gaza.' She said attacks on the media 'are an attack on the right to information of people around the world who want to know what is happening there.' Khan said she has called on the U.N. General Assembly and Security Council to take measures to strengthen the protection of journalists 'as essential civilian workers.' ' Journalism should be seen as essential as humanitarian work,' she said. The information industry has changed, Khan said, and the issue of access to conflict situations by international media representatives — who have been banned from Gaza by Israel — must also be affirmed. 'It has to be clarified that it is not okay to just deny access to international media,' she said. Without naming any countries, Khan asked why nations that pride themselves as champions of the media have been silent in the face of unprecedented attacks on journalists in Gaza and the West Bank. 'My main message is that what is happening in Gaza is sending signals around the world that it is okay to do these things because it’s happening in Gaza and Israel is enjoying absolute impunity — and others around the world will believe that there will be absolute impunity, too,' Khan said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-freedom-of-expression-threatened-more-seriously-in-gaza-than-in-any-recent-conflict-un-expert-says/	2024-10-18T22:42:51-07:00	
Israel unearths Hezbollah's web of tunnels in southern Lebanon	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli forces have spent much of the past year destroying Hamas’ vast underground network in Gaza. They are now focused on dismantling tunnels and other hideouts belonging to Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon. Scarred by Hamas’ deadly raid into Israel last year that sparked the war in Gaza, Israel says it aims to prevent a similar incursion across its northern border from ever getting off the ground. The Israeli military has combed through the dense brush of southern Lebanon for the past two weeks, uncovering what it says are Hezbollah’s deep attack capabilities — highlighted by a tunnel system equipped with weapons caches and rocket launchers that Israel says pose a direct threat to nearby communities. Israel’s war against the Iran-backed militant group stretches far inside Lebanon, and its airstrikes in recent weeks have killed more than 1,700 people, about a quarter of whom were women and children, according to local health authorities. But its ground campaign has centered on a narrow patch of land just along the border, where Hezbollah has had a longstanding presence. Hezbollah has deep ties to southern Lebanon Hezbollah, which has called for Israel’s destruction, is the Arab world’s most significant paramilitary force. It began firing rockets into Israel a day after Hamas' attack. After nearly a year of tit-for-tat fighting with Hezbollah, Israel launched its ground invasion into southern Lebanon on Oct. 1 and has since sent thousands of troops into the rugged terrain. Even as it continues to bolster its forces, Israel says its invasion consists of 'limited, localized and targeted ground raids' that are meant to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure so that tens of thousands of displaced Israelis can return home. The fighting also has uprooted more than 1 million Lebanese in the past month. Many residents of southern Lebanon are supporters of the group and benefit from its social outreach. Though most fled the area months ago, they widely see the heavily armed Hezbollah as their defender, especially as the U.S.-backed Lebanese army does not have suitable weapons to protect them from any Israeli incursion. That broad support has allowed Hezbollah to establish 'a military infrastructure for itself' within the villages, said Eva J. Koulouriotis, a political analyst specialized in the Middle East and Islamic militant groups. The Israeli military says it has found weapons within homes and buildings in the villages. Hezbollah built a network of tunnels in multiple areas of Lebanon With Israel’s air power far outstripping Hezbollah’s defenses, the militant group has turned to underground tunnels as a way to elude Israeli drones and jets. Experts say Hezbollah's tunnels are not limited to the south. 'It’s a land of tunnels,' said Tal Beeri, who studies Hezbollah as director of research at The Alma Research and Education Center, a think tank with a focus on northern Israel’s security. Koulouriotis said tunnels stretch under the southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah's command and control are located and where it keeps a stockpile of strategic missiles. She said the group also maintains tunnels along the border with Syria, which it uses to smuggle weapons and other supplies from Iran into Lebanon. Southern Lebanon is where Hezbollah maintains tunnels to store missiles — and from where it can launch them, Koulouriotis said. Some of the more than 50 Israelis killed by Hezbollah over the past year were hit by anti-tank missiles. In contrast to the tunnels dug out by Hamas in the sandy coastal terrain of Gaza, Hezbollah's tunnels in southern Lebanon were carved into solid rock, a feat that likely required time, money, machinery and expertise. An Israeli military official said that using prior intelligence, Israel had found 'hundreds and hundreds and hundreds' of underground positions, many of which could hold about ten fighters and were stocked with rations. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military rules, said troops were blowing up the tunnels found or using cement to make them unusable. The group used tunnels during the monthlong 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, but the network has been expanded since, even as a United Nations cease-fire resolution compelled Lebanese and U.N. forces to keep Hezbollah fighters out of the south. In mid-August, Hezbollah released a video showing what appeared to be a cavernous underground tunnel large enough for trucks loaded with missiles to drive through. Hezbollah operatives were also seen riding motorcycles inside the illuminated tunnel, named Imad-4 after the group’s late military commander, Imad Mughniyeh, who was killed in Syria in 2008 in an explosion blamed on Israel. Hezbollah's tunnels could be hindering Israel's mission Israeli troops are pushing through southern Lebanon using tanks and engineering equipment, and air and ground forces have struck thousands of targets in the area since the invasion began. The military recently said it found one cross-border tunnel that stretched just a few meters into Israel but did not have an opening. Israel also exposed a tunnel shaft that was located about 100 meters (yards) from a U.N. peacekeepers ’ post, although it wasn't clear what the precise purpose of that tunnel was. Israel says the tunnels are stocked with supplies and weapons and are outfitted with lighting, ventilation and sometimes plumbing, indicating they could be used for long stays. It says it has arrested several Hezbollah fighters hiding inside, including three on Tuesday who were said to have been found armed. The Israeli military official said many Hezbollah fighters appear to have withdrawn from the area. Lebanese military expert, Naji Malaeb, a retired brigadier general, said he assessed that Hezbollah’s tunnels were preventing Israel from making major gains. He compared that achievement to the war in Gaza, where Hamas has used its tunnels to bedevil Israeli forces and stage insurgency-like attacks. Israeli authorities insist the mission in Lebanon is succeeding. It says it has killed hundreds of Hezbollah fighters since the ground operation in Lebanon began, though at least 15 Israeli soldiers have been killed during that time. Israel has encountered Hezbollah’s tunnels before. In 2018, Israel launched an operation to destroy what is said were attack tunnels that crossed into Israeli territory. Beeri said that six tunnels were discovered, including one that was 1 kilometer (1,000 yards) long and 80 meters (87 yards) deep, crossing some 50 meters (yards) into Israel. Israel believes Hezbollah was planning an Oct. 7-style invasion For Israel, the tunnels are evidence that Hezbollah planned what Israel says would be a bloody offensive against communities in the north. 'Hezbollah has openly declared that it plans to carry out its own Oct. 7 massacre on Israel’s northern border, on an even larger scale,' Israeli military spokesman Rear. Adm. Daniel Hagari said the day troops entered Lebanon. Israel has not released evidence that any such attack was imminent but has expressed concern that one might be launched once residents return. Former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by Israel last month while in an underground bunker, had signaled in speeches that Hezbollah could launch an attack on northern Israel. In May 2023, just months before Hamas’ attack, Hezbollah staged a simulation of an incursion into northern Israel with rifle-toting militants on motorcycles bursting through a mock border fence bedecked with Israeli flags. Hezbollah officials have at times framed calls for an attack against Israel as a defensive measure that would be taken in times of war. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-unearths-hezbollahs-web-of-tunnels-in-southern-lebanon/	2024-10-18T21:01:41-07:00	
Biden urges ceasefire in Gaza	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) - President Joe Biden completed a summit with world leaders in Germany, discussing future plans for the Russian war with Ukraine. 'There’s unanimity on continuing to support what’s going on in Ukraine,' Biden said. 'Helping the Ukrainians.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s plan for victory includes Ukraine’s eventual membership in NATO, though NATO leaders don’t believe that will happen this year. 'NATO is going to be in Ukraine’s future,' said White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby. 'The first thing we have to do is help them win the war.' Zelenskyy has also asked foreign leaders to let Ukraine use western-made long-range weapons to strike inside Russia. Russian President Vladamir Putin has warned, that move would put Russia at war with NATO countries. 'Right now, there’s no consensus on long-range weapons,' Biden said. The Government Accountability Office said, as of April, the United States Congress has given Ukraine $174 billion in aid to help fight Russia. 'I think Zelenskyy is the greatest salesman in history,' said former president Donald Trump at a rally last month. 'Every time he comes to our country, he walks away with $60 billion. Billion!' In Germany, President Biden addressed the price of U.S. support. 'I know the cost is heavy. Make no mistake,' Biden said. 'It pales in comparison to the cost of living in a world where aggression prevails.' The White House said, ideally, Ukraine and Russia would negotiate an end to the war. Zelenskyy has said Ukraine will not give up any territory or freedom to end the war.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/biden-urges-ceasefire-in-gaza/	2024-10-18T13:12:08-07:00	
Biden urges Western allies to keep aiding Ukraine during meeting ...	BERLIN (AP) — U.S. President Joe Biden said it's important for Ukraine's Western allies to 'sustain our resolve' in supporting the country as he met Friday with European partners, with the upcoming U.S. presidential election casting a long shadow over his visit to Germany. Biden met Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Ukraine's second-biggest military supplier after the U.S. They were joined by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer for discussions that also addressed the conflict in the Middle East. With the election just weeks away and the race extremely tight, there are worries that a victory for Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, could upset the relationships that Biden is hoping to pass on to Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. Trump has an appetite for imposing trade tariffs on key U.S. security partners. He has expressed indifference to the security of Ukraine, refusing to say during a presidential debate if he wants the U.S. ally to win its war against Russia. He’s voiced doubts about coming to the defense of NATO members if they come under attack. The gathered leaders never uttered Trump's name in public, yet their remarks often hinted at the possibility that he could withdraw support from Ukraine and scorn global alliances that Biden and his counterparts view as critical. Biden in an exchange with reporters following his meeting with the three European leaders suggested that the U.S. election was discussed in the private talks. Asked if the leaders were worried about the presidential race, Biden responded tersely, 'They're interested.' Earlier in the day Biden emphasized the need to support Ukraine. 'As Ukraine faces a tough winter, we must — we must — sustain our resolve, our effort and our support,' Biden said. Scholz said that 'we will stand beside Ukraine as long as it is necessary,' pointing to a planned $50 billion international loan package funded by interest on profits from frozen Russian assets. 'Our position is clear: We are supporting Ukraine as strongly as possible,' he added. 'At the same time, we are taking care that NATO does not become a party to the war so that this war doesn't culminate in an even bigger catastrophe.' Scholz has indicated that he's skeptical about aspects of a 'victory plan' drawn up by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and says he will stand by his refusal to supply Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Kyiv. Biden is also opposed to loosening restrictions on letting Ukraine use western weapons to strike deeper into Russia, but did not shut the door on the issue. 'In foreign policy, there’s never a ‘never will I change my mind,'' Biden said. 'Right now there is no consensus on long-range weapons.' Biden didn’t want his term to end without visiting Berlin, after having been to other key allies such as Japan, South Korea, France, India, the U.K., Poland and Ukraine. The visit was a quick one, with Biden spending about 20 hours on the ground in Berlin. Concerns about what might come next were reflected as Biden received the highest class of Germany’s Order of Merit, which was also bestowed on former U.S. President George H.W. Bush in recognition of his support for German reunification. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the friendship with the U.S. is 'and will always be existentially important' for Germany, but there have always been 'times of proximity and greater distance.' 'Even recently, just a handful of years ago, the distance had grown so wide that we almost lost each other,' Steinmeier said, in an reference to tense relations during Trump’s earlier presidency. He said Biden 'restored Europe's hope in the trans-Atlantic alliance literally overnight.' Recalling the 'wide sweep of history' he has seen in his 81 years, Biden said, 'we should never underestimate the power of democracy, never underestimate the value of alliances.' As he met Scholz, Biden said he was 'grateful for Germany’s cooperation in holding Iran accountable for destabilizing policies, including providing missiles and drones to Russia to use against Ukraine.' He pointed to new European sanctions against Iran's leading airlines and said that 'this coordination is going to have to continue.' Biden reiterated his call for Israel to pursue peace after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar — which he described as 'a moment of justice.' 'I told the prime minister of Israel yesterday, let’s also make this moment an opportunity to seek a path to peace, a better future in Gaza without Hamas,' he said. Biden said he and the European leaders discussed the way ahead following the killing of Sinwar. He suggested that negotiating a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hezbollah could be easier than forging one between Israel and Hamas. 'We think that there is a possibility of working for a ceasefire in Lebanon and it’s going to be harder in Gaza,' Biden said. 'But we agree there has to be an outcome of what happens the day after.' Biden declined to say whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave him assurance in their Thursday phone call that the Israelis are ready to get back to negotiations on the stalled cease-fire deals. 'We’re in the middle of discussions about that,' Biden said. 'I’m not going to get into that.' Trump has said his approach will help the U.S. economy and prevent foreign countries from taking advantage of the United States. He maintains that if he were still president, Russia would never have invaded Ukraine in 2022 and Hamas would never have attacked Israel in 2023. 'I will end the war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East, and prevent World War III,' he said at a recent rally in Georgia. Harris, for her part, has voiced strong backing for Ukraine and tracks with Biden on support for Israel, while placing particular emphasis on the need to relieve the suffering of Palestinian civilians whose lives have been upended by the Hamas-Israel war. — AP writer Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed reporting.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-as-biden-meets-with-european-allies-the-possibility-of-another-trump-term-hangs-over-their-talks/	2024-10-18T10:48:03-07:00	
Hezbollah vows a new phase in the war, as Israel says it has kill...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah vowed to launch a new phase of fighting against invading Israeli troops Friday, a day after Israel said its forces in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza had killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the chief architect of last year’s brutal attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Sinwar’s killing in what appeared to be a chance frontline encounter with Israeli troops offers a potential window to shift the dynamic in the Gaza war even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah along its northern border with Lebanon and continues its aerial bombardment in other areas of Lebanon. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, which hailed Sinwar as a martyr who can inspire others in challenging Israel. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. Israel says Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in Gaza Hamas has not yet commented directly on the Israeli announcement, but photos which were apparently taken by Israeli troops on the scene showed the body of a man who appeared to be Sinwar half-buried in rubble with a gaping wound in his head. A statement issued by one of Hamas’ political leaders abroad Friday seemed to be a reference to Sinwar's death and said Israel is mistaken if it 'believes that killing our leaders means the end of our movement and the struggle of the Palestinian people.' Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim, who is usually based in Qatar, said that past leaders in the organization had also been killed and 'Hamas each time became stronger and more popular, and these leaders became an icon for future generations to continue the journey towards a free Palestine.' He added that it is 'painful and distressing to lose beloved people, especially extraordinary leaders' but that the Palestinian militant group is sure it will be 'eventually victorious.' When asked if the statement was a confirmation of Sinwar’s death, however, Naim said it was not. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing Thursday night that 'our war is not yet ended.' But many, from the governments of Israel's allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar’s death would pave the way for an end to the war. Iran’s mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Sinwar, emphasizing that he died on the battlefield and not in hiding, unlike the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who was hanged in 2006. 'When U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed,' the statement said. 'However when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield — in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy — the spirit of resistance will be strengthened.' More than 1 million people on both sides were killed during the brutal Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. In Lebanon, Hezbollah issued a statement early Friday saying its fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones against Israel for the first time in recent days. The statement appeared to refer to an explosives-laden drone that evaded Israel’s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel last Sunday night, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced earlier this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. Hezbollah said its fighters were working according to 'plans prepared in advance' to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. It also announced several missile and artillery attacks on Israeli forces operating in villages in southern Lebanon’s border area overnight and Friday morning. In one case, the group said it fired a heavy missile barrage at Israeli soldiers who were trying to evacuate those wounded in an earlier strike. The group also said it had fired 'large missile salvos' at a military barracks in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights and at the Zvulun area north of Haifa. Earlier this week, Hezbollah’s acting leader Naim Kassem warned that the group will continue to target wider areas of Israel unless a cease-fire is implemented in Lebanon. As Israel fought militants in Lebanon and in Gaza, its military said Friday that its forces had killed two militants who crossed into Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea from neighboring Jordan. Such infiltrations are relatively rare, especially as Israel has ramped up border security since the Hamas attack in October 2023. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed vast swathes of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Abby Sewell and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hezbollah-vows-a-new-phase-in-the-war-as-israel-says-it-has-killed-hamas-leader-sinwar/	2024-10-18T04:12:13-07:00	
South Korean intelligence says North has sent troops to aid Russi...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's spy agency said Friday that North Korea has dispatched troops to support Russia's war against Ukraine, a development that could bring a third country into the war and intensify a standoff between North Korea and the West. The National Intelligence Service said in a statement that Russian navy ships transferred 1,500 North Korean special operation forces to the Russian port city of Vladivostok from Oct. 8 to Oct. 13. It said more North Korean troops are expected to be sent to Russia soon. The North Korean soldiers deployed in Russia have been given Russian military uniforms, weapons and forged identification documents, the NIS said. It said they are currently staying at military bases in Vladivostok and other Russian sites such as Ussuriysk, Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk, and that they will likely be deployed to battle grounds after completing their adaptation training. The NIS posted on its website satellite and other photos showing what it calls Russian navy ship movements near a North Korean port and suspected North Korean mass gatherings in Ussuriysk and Khabarovsk in the past week. South Korean media, citing the NIS, reported that North Korea has decided to dispatch a total of 12,000 troops formed into four brigades to Russia. The NIS did not immediately confirm the reports. If confirmed, it would be North Korea's first major participation in a foreign war. North Korea has 1.2 million troops, one of the largest militaries in the world, but it lacks actual combat experience. Many experts question how much the North Korean troop dispatch would help Russia, citing North Korea’s outdated equipment and shortage of battle experience. Experts also said that North Korea likely received Russian promises to provide security support over the intense confrontations over its advancing nuclear program with the U.S. and South Korea. During a meeting in Pyongyang in June, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked, in what was considered the two countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. South Korea’s presidential office said in a statement that President Yoon Suk Yeol had presided over an emergency meeting earlier Friday to discuss North Korea’s troop dispatch to Russia. The statement said participants of the meeting agreed that North Korea’s troop dispatch poses a grave security threat to South Korea and the international community. But the presidential office gave no further details like when and how many North Korean soldiers have been sent to Ukraine and what roles they are expected to play. Russia has denied using North Korean troops in the war, with Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov describing the claims as 'another piece of fake news' during a news conference last week, according to Russia media. Ukrainian media reported earlier this month that six North Koreans were among those killed after a Ukrainian missile strike in the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region on Oct. 3. On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his government has intelligence that 10,000 troops from North Korea are being prepared to join Russian forces fighting against his country, warning that a third nation wading into the hostilities could turn the conflict into a 'world war.' 'From our intelligence we’ve got information that North Korea sent tactical personnel and officers to Ukraine,' Zelenskyy told reporters at NATO headquarters. 'They are preparing on their land 10,000 soldiers, but they didn’t move them already to Ukraine or to Russia.' NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the western alliance 'have no evidence that North Korean soldiers are involved in the fight. But we do know that North Korea is supporting Russia in many ways, weapons supplies, technological supplies, innovation, to support them in the war effort. And that is highly worrying.' The U.S., South Korea and their partners have accused North Korea of supplying Russia with artillery shells, missiles and other equipment to help fuel its war on Ukraine Outside officials and experts say North Korea in exchange possibly received badly needed food and economic aid and technology assistance aimed at upgrading Kim’s nuclear-armed military. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have repeatedly denied the existence of an arms deal between the countries.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-south-korean-spies-say-north-is-sending-troops-to-support-russias-war-on-ukraine-reports-say/	2024-10-18T03:40:21-07:00	
Israel says Hamas' top leader Yahya Sinwar may be dead	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Israeli military said Thursday it was looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a military operation in Gaza. Authorities were conducting DNA tests on a body to determine if it is him, an Israeli security official said. The military said in a statement that three militants were killed during operations in Gaza, without specifying where or elaborating further. It said the identities of the three were so far not confirmed, but it was 'checking the possibility' that one of them was Sinwar. The security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said the tests on the body had not yet confirmed if it was Sinwar's. There was no immediate comment by Hamas on the report. Yahya Sinwar, head of Hamas in Gaza, chairs a meeting with leaders of Palestinian factions at his office in Gaza City, on April 13, 2022. (AP Photo/Adel Hana, File) Sinwar was one of the chief architects of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel has vowed to kill him since the beginning of its retaliatory campaign in Gaza. If confirmed, Sinwar's death could be a heavy blow to the militant group. He has been Hamas' top leader inside the Gaza Strip for years, closely connected to its military wing while dramatically building up its capabilities. Sinwar was chosen as Hamas's top leader after his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in July in an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. Israel has also claimed to have killed the head of Hamas' military wing Mohammed Deif in an airstrike, but the group has said he survived. Who is Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar? President Joe Biden has been briefed on Israel's investigation into whether it killed Sinwar, and U.S. officials have been in close contact with Israeli officials throughout Thursday morning, according to a senior administration official. The report came as Israeli forces continued a more than week-old major air and ground assault in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza. On Thursday, an Israeli strike hit a school sheltering displaced Palestinians, killing at least 15 people, including five children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Fares Abu Hamza, head of Gaza Health Ministry’s local emergency unit, said dozens of people were wounded. He said the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital was struggling to treat the casualties. 'Many women and children are in critical condition,' he said. The Israeli military said it targeted a command center run by Hamas and Islamic Jihad inside the school. It provided a list of around a dozen names of people it identified as militants who were present when the strike was called in. It was not immediately possible to verify the names. Israel has repeatedly struck tent camps and schools sheltering displaced people in Gaza. The Israeli military says it carries out precise strikes on militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its strikes often kill women and children. In a separate development, a building in central Beirut that houses offices of the Al Jazeera news network and the Norwegian Embassy was evacuated after a warning. Mazen Ibrahim, Al Jazeera’s Lebanon bureau chief, said the building’s administration received three calls telling everyone to leave the building, which he said also houses the embassies of Norway and Azerbaijan, as well as dozens of offices. He said it was unclear who called in the warning. Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ragnhild Simenstad said the building was evacuated after a 'bomb threat,' without elaborating. Israel has ordered the evacuation of several buildings, as well as entire cities, towns and villages, as it strikes what it says are targets linked to the Hezbollah militant group. There have also been several instances of evacuation warning calls and text messages that turned out to be bogus, which Lebanese security agencies say they are investigating. Did Trump actually call veterans who died in wars ‘suckers’? Israel launched its campaign in Gaza to eliminate Hamas after the militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Some 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. Northern Gaza was the first target of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, with entire neighborhoods in Gaza City and other towns reduced to rubble. Most of the population fled after Israel issued evacuation orders in the opening days of the war, but about 400,000 are believed to have remained despite the harsh conditions. Earlier this month, Israel once again ordered the full-scale evacuation of the north, and allowed no food aid to enter the area for around two weeks. That led many Palestinians to fear that it had adopted a surrender-or-starve strategy suggested by former Israeli generals. Israel allowed two shipments of aid to enter the north earlier this week after the United States warned it might reduce its military aid if its ally did not do more to address the humanitarian crisis. Since the start of the conflict, Israeli forces have launched repeated operations into Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. The military says militants have repeatedly regrouped there after major operations.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/israel-says-hamas-top-leader-yahya-sinwar-may-be-dead/	2024-10-17T08:01:56-07:00	
Ukraine's former armed forces chief endorses 'victory plan' in fi...	LONDON (AP) — Ukraine's former commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, on Thursday expressed his support for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s 'victory plan,' despite the tensions between the two that led to his dismissal. 'Ukraine must clearly follow the plan,' Zaluzhnyi said in his first public appearance since his appointment as ambassador to the U.K. He told an audience at London’s Chatham House think-tank: 'But this list of steps primarily concerns those countries that should ultimately be interested in stopping the war.' The plan lays out Ukraine’s view on how to strengthen its positions before any potential negotiations with Russia to end the conflict. After briefing U.S. and other Western officials, Zelenskyy presented the key points publicly during a speech to the Ukrainian parliament on Wednesday. The plan includes a formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. Zaluzhnyi asserted that NATO membership is the only viable security guarantee for his country, fully backing President Zelensky’s call for the alliance to extend an invitation to Kyiv. But the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO has left the alliance in a bind, with some members concerned it could escalate the conflict and risk direct confrontation with Russia. 'Declaring yet another freeze in the situation with Ukraine will not work,' said Ukraine’s former commander-in-chief. 'We want to have guarantees of security for ourselves and our children,' he said. Zaluzhnyi, who was in charge of armed forces during Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, said a shortfall in Western support during that period meant that Ukraine lost its chance to fend off Russia on its own. He said that missed opportunity turned the war into a protracted conflict where the way out 'seems rather doubtful and almost impossible,' and allowed Russia the chance to form an alliance with North Korea, Iran and China which Ukraine now cannot defeat without the help of Western partners. 'Against Ukraine now stands not only Russia, but also a quite powerful coalition of strong states,' he said. Such an 'alliance of authoritarian countries' may pose a security threat to the democratic world and the West 'should have made a plan to protect its democratic institutions,' he said. During the presentation of his plan in Brussels on Thursday, Zelenskyy said Kyiv has intelligence information that 10,000 troops from North Korea are being prepared to join Russian forces fighting against his country, warning that a third nation wading into the hostilities would turn the conflict into a 'world war.' Zelenskyy did not go into further details about the claim. As the war grinds through its third year, the mood in Ukraine is grim as its outmanned troops face difficulty holding back Russian advances, especially in the east. Although Moscow’s gains are incremental, the steady forward movement is making Kyiv feel it needs more large-scale Western help. The former armed forces chief stressed that Ukraine is battling Russia, which significantly outweighs it in resources, including in manpower. 'The only thing which works in the war is mathematics,' he said. Zaluzhnyi acknowledged the challenges his country faces with mobilization, emphasizing the need to reform recruitment practices inherited from the times Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union. Despite his popularity, he has faced widespread criticism for failing to meet the army’s need for more troops. Conscription has become a sensitive issue as infantry shortages grow, which became one of the factors that allowed Russia to gain the initiative on the battlefield. 'We had to change it (the system),' he said but adding that Ukraine doesn’t have enough time to do it while the war with Russia lasts. 'The material side does not depend entirely on us, but in working with human resources, everything completely depends on Ukraine,' he said. Tensions between Zaluzhnyi and President Zelenskyy escalated following Ukraine’s 2023 counter-offensive, which failed to achieve significant territorial gains. In February, Zelenskyy dismissed Zaluzhnyi as military commander-in-chief in a move to revitalize efforts in the stalled war. Zaluzhnyi is widely respected among Ukrainian troops and considered a national hero. He is credited with stalling Russia’s full-scale invasion in the early days of the war and expertly pushing back Moscow’s troops. ——— Arhirova contributed from Kyiv	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraines-former-armed-forces-chief-endorses-victory-plan-in-first-speech-since-his-dismissal/	2024-10-17T07:17:52-07:00	
Hunger experts say the risk of famine in Gaza remains high	The Gaza Strip is still at risk of famine more than a year into the Israel-Hamas war, even as the number of people facing the most extreme level of hunger has declined in recent months, the international authority on hunger crises said Thursday. The findings come after the United States warned Israel that it might cut off military aid if its ally does not do more to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of people there are displaced from their homes and packed into squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters. In recent weeks Israel has once again ordered the evacuation of the northern third of Gaza, and it launched another major military operation there. It allowed no food to enter the north for roughly the first two weeks of October before resuming shipments on Monday. In a statement announcing a second shipment on Wednesday, the military said it will continue to act in accordance with international law 'to facilitate and ease the entry of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.' 86% of Gaza's population faces crisis-level hunger or worse The latest findings on hunger in Gaza were released by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, an initiative set up in 2004 during the famine in Somalia that involves more than a dozen U.N. agencies, aid organizations, governments and other groups. It has repeatedly warned of famine over the course of the yearlong war, which was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel. Over 1.8 million people, or around 86% of Gaza's population, are experiencing crisis levels of hunger, defined as Phase 3 or higher on the IPC's five-point scale. Some 133,000 people, or around 6%, are at Phase 5, the highest level, known as catastrophic hunger. That is down from earlier periods of the war, when nearly a third of the population was at Phase 5. The IPC warned the situation could rapidly deteriorate, and that it expects catastrophic hunger levels to double in the coming months. It cited a slowdown in aid in recent weeks, the onset of what is typically a cold and rainy winter, and the harsh conditions people face in crowded tent camps with little in the way of food, clean water or toilets. 'One year into the conflict, the risk of famine persists throughout the whole Gaza Strip as conflict intensifies and winter approaches,' it said in the report. Israel has controlled Gaza's entire land border since May. The Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs, known as COGAT, says it places no limits on humanitarian aid entering the territory and accuses U.N. agencies and aid groups of failing to promptly deliver it. Those groups say their efforts are severely hampered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and displacement, and the breakdown of law and order in many areas. Israel cut aid to the north for 2 weeks as it launched another offensive Israel allowed no food to enter northern Gaza for the first two weeks of October, according to the U.N.'s World Food Program, as it waged a major military operation there that is still ongoing. U.N. humanitarian officials said last week that aid entering Gaza is at its lowest level in months. Most residents of northern Gaza fled after evacuation warnings at the start of the war, and Israel has not allowed them to return. An estimated 400,000 people have remained there despite the harsh conditions. Palestinians say nowhere in the besieged territory feels safe. Many fear Israel will implement a surrender-or-starve plan proposed by former generals calling for a cutoff in aid, and for anyone who ignores evacuation orders to be classified as a militant. The Israeli government has not said whether it has adopted the plan, which rights groups say would violate international law. The IPC report said the latest evacuation orders 'have significantly disrupted humanitarian operations, and repeated displacements have steadily worn down people’s ability to cope and access food, water and medicine, deepening the vulnerability of entire communities.' In a letter over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Israel that if it did not increase the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza within the next 30 days it could risk losing U.S. weapons supplies for the ongoing wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. A similar letter sent in April — after an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers — led to an increase in humanitarian aid to the territory. But State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said this week that the supply dwindled again, falling by over 50% from its peak earlier this year. Israel has so far allowed two shipments into northern Gaza this week — a total of 80 trucks — and it says around 430 trucks have entered through the southern Kerem Shalom Crossing since the start of the month. That is far below the 350 trucks a day that the U.S. said were needed. The United States has spent nearly $18 billion on military aid to Israel since the war in Gaza began, according to a report for Brown University’s Costs of War project. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hunger-experts-say-the-risk-of-famine-in-gaza-remains-high/	2024-10-17T05:42:51-07:00	
Israel pressured by UN and US to step up action to tackle Gaza's ...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The top U.N. humanitarian official accused Israel on Wednesday of blocking the delivery of desperately needed aid to Gaza, and the U.S. ambassador demanded that its government step up efforts to tackle the Palestinian territory’s 'intolerable and catastrophic humanitarian crisis.' Acting humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya and U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield stepped up the pressure on Israel at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on the escalating humanitarian emergency, especially in northern Gaza. The council meeting, called by Algeria, the Arab representative on the council, followed a U.S. warning to Israel to boost aid efforts dramatically or risk losing funding for weapons from its main supplier. The Biden administration gave Israel 30 days to take a number of actions, including sending 350 trucks with food and other aid into Gaza every day. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon insisted that his country’s humanitarian efforts remain 'as comprehensive as ever' and criticized the council for focusing on the humanitarian situation in Gaza while Israeli civilians 'are being targeted daily by those who seek our destruction.' He said Israel has delivered over 1 million tons of aid, including 700,000 tons of food, to Gaza since it launched its military operation after Hamas’ surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Danon accused the international community of missing the real issue — which he said was Hamas’ hijacking of aid shipments while fellow Palestinians suffer. 'This makes it incredibly difficult to ensure that the aid reaches its intended recipients,' he said. But Israel remains committed to working with its partners to deliver aid, 'even under these dangerous and morally reprehensible conditions.' Msuya, the top U.N. aid official, painted a grim picture, telling the council that there is barely any food left in northern Gaza where an Israeli offensive is under way. No food entered the north from Oct. 2 to Oct. 15 'when a trickle was allowed in,' she said, and 'most bakeries will be forced to shut down again in the next several days without additional fuel.' Throughout Gaza, Msuya said, less than one-third of the 286 humanitarian missions coordinated with Israeli authorities in the first two weeks of October 'were facilitated without major incidents or delays.' The level of suffering in Gaza worsens every day, she said, as Israeli bombs continue to fall, fierce fighting continues, and 'supplies essential for people’s survival and humanitarian assistance are blocked at every turn.' Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, accused Israel of besieging, bombing and starving 400,000 Palestinians in northern Gaza as part of its all-out war against the Palestinian people. 'These are crimes,' he said. 'This is genocide. They must be stopped -- and they must be stopped now.' Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador, pointed to some new Israeli commitments since the U.S. warning and two dozen trucks entering northern Gaza for the first time in several weeks. But she said Israel’s progress since last week is 'insufficient' and stressed that it must follow through on its commitments, including opening more border crossings and routes and taking steps 'to help secure delivery routes against armed gangs involved in violent looting.' 'A `policy of starvation’ in northern Gaza would be horrific and unacceptable and would have implications under international law and U.S. law,' the U.S. ambassador warned. 'The government of Israel has said that this is not their policy, that food and other essential supplies will not be cut off, and we will be watching to see that Israel’s actions on the ground match this commitment.' At the council meeting, there were repeated calls by members for action by the U.N.’s most powerful body to end the more than yearlong war in Gaza. Guyana’s U.N. Ambassador Carolyn Rodrigues Birkett lamented that 47 Security Council meetings and four legally binding resolutions in the past year, including demands for a cease-fire, 'have not had the expected results, and the situation in Gaza continues to worsen with each passing day.' 'We must not allow the shredding of the moral and legal thread that holds our organization together,' she said. 'The most fundamental question then that this council faces is, what will we do to stop this tide?' Thomas-Greenfield urged all council members to support the U.N. as it works with Israel to step up aid deliveries. She said the U.S. focus in the coming months will be 'getting humanitarian aid in, getting hostages out, and ending the conflict.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-pressured-by-un-and-us-to-step-up-action-to-tackle-gazas-escalating-humanitarian-crisis/	2024-10-16T20:03:37-07:00	
US warns of growing North Korean military support for Russia's wa...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The U.S. and its allies are 'alarmed' by North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats as well as its increasing military support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, a senior U.S. official said Wednesday, but couldn’t confirm Ukrainian claims that North Korean soldiers were sent to fight for Moscow. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell spoke with reporters following discussions with South Korean and Japanese counterparts on reinvigorating an international pressure campaign against North Korea, which faltered in recent years amid a deepening divide at the U.N. Security Council. Earlier on Wednesday, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo announced plans with eight Western governments to launch a new multinational team to monitor the enforcement of sanctions against North Korea. Russia in March vetoed a U.N. resolution in a move that effectively abolished monitoring by U.N. experts of Security Council sanctions against North Korea. It prompted Western accusations that Moscow was acting to shield its arms purchases from Pyongyang to fuel its war in Ukraine. Campbell said there are signs that North Korea was increasing its support of materials, including artillery and missiles, for Russia’s war on Ukraine, which he said was 'creating further instability in Europe.' He said the U.S. was still evaluating reports that North Korea was also sending personnel. 'We are concerned by them and ... we agreed that we will continue to monitor the situation closely,' Campbell said about the claims. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that North Korea is sending military personnel to help Russia’s war effort, without providing details. Ukrainian media reported earlier this month that six North Koreans were among those killed after a Ukrainian missile strike in the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region on Oct. 3. North Korea has also been making increasingly provocative threats against rival South Korea, including accusing the South of infiltrating drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang and threatening to attack if it happens again. North Korea on Tuesday blew up the northern sections of unused road and rail routes that once linked it with South Korea, in a choreographed demolition demonstrating its growing anger with South Korea’s conservative government. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have spiked since 2022, as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used Russia’s war on Ukraine as a window to dial up his weapons testing activities and threats. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have strengthened their combined military exercises in response and took steps to sharpen their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets. Following his talks with Campbell and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Masataka Okano, South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Hong Kyun said that the countries condemn the North’s 'intentional moves to create tensions.' 'We have agreed to maintain a solid South Korea-U.S. combined posture to respond firmly to North Korean provocations and strengthen security cooperation through close coordination between South Korea, the U.S., and Japan,' Kim said. The diplomats issued a joint statement condemning North Korea over its nuclear and missile developments, deepening military cooperation with Russia and various illicit activities to fund its weapons program and highlighted United States’ 'ironclad' commitment to defend its allies. The statement also reflected growing regional tensions with China. The diplomats expressed their opposition to 'any unilateral attempts to change the status quo' in Indo-Pacific waters and 'unlawful maritime claims' in the South China Sea. They also criticized China’s recent drills around Taiwan and stressed that 'no further actions should be taken that could undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-senior-us-official-warns-of-north-korean-nuclear-threats-and-help-for-russia/	2024-10-16T19:26:07-07:00	
Zelenskyy outlines his 'victory plan' to Ukraine's lawmakers, inc...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told lawmakers Wednesday that Ukraine’s Western partners are increasing pressure to negotiate with Russia, but he hinted such talks would be unfavorable to Kyiv as he unveiled what he called his 'victory plan' for the war. Major points of the plan include an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv's allies so far. 'If we start moving according to this victory plan now, it may be possible to end the war no later than next year,' Zelenskyy told the Verkhovna Rada, the parliament. He will present the five-point plan to the European Council on Thursday. Zelenskyy also said that in private communications with Ukraine, its partners are increasingly mentioning 'negotiations' and much less frequently using the word 'justice.' But he reiterated that Ukraine is not prepared for a 'frozen conflict' or any 'trade-offs involving territory or sovereignty,' which drew sustained applause from the lawmakers. As the war grinds through its third year, the mood in Ukraine is grim as its troops face difficulty holding back Russian advances, especially in the east. Although Moscow's gains are incremental, the steady forward movement is making Kyiv feel it needs more large-scale Western help. But there are signs that support may be hurt by the increasing focus on conflicts in the Middle East. The U.S. presidential election next month also could bring a major shift from Washington toward Ukraine. Zelenskyy's plan has been shrouded in secrecy as he outlined it to key allies including U.S. President Joe Biden in recent weeks, and he did not mention some of its more confidential parts to the lawmakers. The plan is seen as a way for Ukraine to strengthen its hand in any negotiations with Moscow. Besides the NATO invitation and seeking permission for the longer-range missile attacks, it includes continued military operations in Russia, such as the incursion into the Kursk border region that began in August. Ukraine, he said, also needs more air defense systems and assistance from partners to shoot down Russian missiles. It also requested access to a broader range of intelligence from allies. Lawmakers will prioritize the bills needed to implement Zelenskyy's plan, said Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk after the speech. Stefanchuk said that while the issue of NATO membership is political, it also requires adopting laws to match the alliance's standards. Zelenskyy’s request for an invitation leaves NATO in a bind. Since the full-scale invasion began in 2022, NATO has struggled to find a way to bring Ukraine closer without formally inviting it in. 'We understand that NATO membership is a matter of the future, not the present,' Zelenskyy acknowledged. He reckons that such an invitation would alter President Vladimir Putin's 'geopolitical calculations.' NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte remained noncommittal after the plan was unveiled. 'We are in close contact with allies, with Ukraine, to see how we can take next steps,' Rutte told reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels. He declined to provide details, saying: 'I cannot give you all the insights about that.' 'We are working with the Ukrainians to understand better … how this would help in ending the war,' he said. For now, Rutte added, the focus must be to help Ukraine to win back more territory and strengthen its position for any future peace negotiations. Zelenskyy said granting Ukraine an invitation to NATO would be a 'testament of determination' by its allies to support Kyiv. NATO’s collective security guarantee — Article 5 of its founding treaty — is the pillar on which its credibility is based. It is a political commitment by all member countries to come to the aid of any member whose sovereignty or territory might be under attack. At their summit in Washington in July, NATO’s 32 members declared Ukraine to be on an 'irreversible' path to membership. Any decision on offering to start membership talks is probably not likely before the next summit in the Netherlands in June. Despite his attempts to win approval for the plan from Western partners, none have yet publicly voiced their support. Zelenskyy and Biden spoke by phone later Wednesday to discuss a new $425 million package of security assistance for Ukraine from Washington, the White House said. Asked about Ukraine's 'victory plan,' White house press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded, 'That’s their plan, and let them speak to it,' adding that the U.S. would continue 'to show our support for the Ukrainians on the battlefield.' Biden is to travel to Germany, where he will meet Friday with Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Lawmakers had a mixed reaction to Zelenskyy's plan and whether it could be implemented. 'First of all, it’s not a plan. Plan means something with concrete steps,' said opposition lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko. 'It’s kind of a wish list from Ukraine for our partners, how they can and should support us. And it doesn’t look realistic. We were waiting for some real serious conversation about the situation and the strategy, and this is not that.' He said that delivering a plan purported to be about victory as Russia advances in the east is 'contradictory.' Lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko, from Zelenskyy’s party, called it 'realistic and rather pragmatic,' adding: 'It can be implemented if we have enough aid and support from our allies and partners.' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov mocked it as 'ephemeral,' and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called it 'a set of incoherent slogans.' In his speech, Zelenskyy also underscored his recent claim that North Korea is sending military personnel as well as ammunition to help Russia’s war effort, and that Iran and China also are aiding Moscow. He noted that Ukraine is rich in natural resources, including critically important metals 'worth trillions of U.S. dollars,' such as uranium, titanium, lithium, graphite and others. Those assets, as well as the country’s agricultural production, are among Russia’s key targets in the war, he said, but could be shared with partners to boost each others' economies. Similarly, battle-hardened Ukrainian troops would be an asset for NATO efforts to keep Russia at bay, Zelenskyy added. ___ Associated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed. ___ Follow AP's coverage at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-zelenskyy-to-unveil-victory-plan-to-ukrainian-lawmakers-after-presenting-it-to-western-allies/	2024-10-16T19:22:39-07:00	
NATO shows no sign of letting Ukraine join soon and wants more de...	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO showed no sign Wednesday it would invite Ukraine to join anytime soon as allies sought more information from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about his 'victory plan' for ending the war with Russia. The plan centers on a request for NATO to move forward on the 'accelerated' membership application that Zelenskyy made two years ago to seek protection under the military alliance's security umbrella after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. NATO’s credibility is based on its collective security guarantee, Article 5 of its founding treaty. It’s a commitment by all 32 member countries to come to the aid of any member whose sovereignty or territory might be under attack. However, it does not apply to a partner country like Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte declined to welcome the 'victory plan,' saying only that he and the allies 'take note' of it. He did not discuss when Ukraine might join the world’s biggest military alliance, beyond insisting that it would become a member. 'The plan has many aspects and many political and military issues we really need to hammer out with the Ukrainians to understand what is behind it, to see what we can do, what we cannot do,' Rutte said in his muted response at NATO headquarters in Brussels. 'We are in close contact with allies, with Ukraine, to see how we can take next steps,' he added. He declined to provide details about what more NATO wants to know, telling reporters only: 'I cannot give you all the insights about that.' For now, Rutte said, the focus must be on helping Ukraine to win back more territory and strengthen its hand for any future peace negotiations. Zelenskyy is due to explain elements of his plan on Thursday to leaders of the European Union, most of whom also stand among NATO's ranks. It all comes at a dark time for Ukraine. Its troops are struggling to hold off better manned and equipped Russian forces, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where they are gradually being pushed back. Kyiv is surviving with Western help, but Ukraine says it is coming too slowly. While outlining his plan on Wednesday, Zelenskyy told Ukrainian lawmakers that granting the country a NATO invitation would be a 'testament of (allies’) determination' to support its efforts. 'An invitation is a strong decision that requires nothing but determination,' he said. Ukraine’s future in NATO is something the alliance has weighed for 16 years. At their summit in Washington in July, the 32 members declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership. To the uninitiated, however, little seems to have progressed since NATO leaders promised Ukraine and Georgia in 2008 that 'these countries will become members of NATO' one day. For now, NATO is in a holding pattern. Its biggest and most powerful member, the United States, is facing a presidential election. European allies expect little movement on Ukraine until a new president takes office in January. Beyond that, the United States and European heavyweight Germany remain deeply concerned about being dragged into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia, and they lead a group of countries that oppose allowing Ukraine to join NATO until the conflict ends. In any case, NATO diplomats said, Ukraine’s borders would need to be clearly demarcated before it could join so that there can be no mistaking where the Article 5 guarantee would come into effect. Russian troops have seized about 20% of the country.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-nato-shows-no-sign-of-letting-ukraine-join-soon-and-wants-more-details-about-its-victory-plan/	2024-10-16T19:13:52-07:00	
Israeli strikes kill 27 in Lebanon, including in a town with a da...	QANA, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli airstrikes pounded areas across Lebanon, killing at least 27 people over the past 24 hours, officials said Wednesday, including more than a dozen in a southern town where Israeli bombardments in previous conflicts are seared into local memory. Elsewhere in the south, a city’s mayor was among the dead in a strike that Lebanese officials said targeted a meeting to coordinate relief efforts. The Israeli military said they were targeting a Hezbollah commander in the strikes late Tuesday on the southern town of Qana, where 15 people were killed. Associated Press photos and video of the scene showed several flattened buildings and others with their top floors collapsed. Rescue workers carried away the remains of dead people and used a bulldozer to remove rubble, as they searched for more victims. Israel said the target was Jalal Mustafa Hariri, a Hezbollah commander in charge of the Qana area. In 1996, Israeli artillery shelling on a United Nations compound housing hundreds of displaced people in Qana killed at least 100 civilians and wounded scores more people, including four U.N. peacekeepers. During the 2006 war, an Israeli strike on a residential building killed nearly three dozen people, a third of them children. Israel said at the time that it struck a Hezbollah rocket launcher behind the building. 'Qana always gets its share,' Mayor Mohammed Krasht told the AP, referring to the town’s grim history. Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, meanwhile accused Israel of 'intentionally targeting' a municipal council meeting to discuss relief efforts in Nabatiyeh, where six people were killed. 'What solution can be hoped for in light of this reality?' he asked in a statement. Strikes continued across Lebanon, including in the eastern Bekaa Valley and Nabatiyeh, in southern Lebanon, where the Israeli military said it targeted Hezbollah command centers and weapons facilities that had been embedded in civilian areas. Lebanon's crisis response unit recorded 138 airstrikes and shellings Wednesday. The Israeli military said Hezbollah launched more than 90 projectiles toward Israel on Wednesday. Four civilians were wounded in the strikes, according to Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue service. Israel says it blew up a Hezbollah tunnel A widely circulated video showed the Israeli army detonating massive explosives on a hill in Mhaibeb, a town about three kilometers (two miles) from the border with Israel. The Israeli military said they targeted a Hezbollah tunnel beneath the village. The mayor of the neighboring village Mays el Jabal, Abdelmoe’m Shucair, told the AP that families had already left the village. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters in Washington the US was aware of the footage and that 'obviously, we do not want to see entire villages destroyed.' He called on Israel to go after Hezbollah targets in a way that 'protects civilian infrastructure and protects civilians.' Israel also resumed its barrage on Beirut’s southern suburbs after a six-day pause, hitting what it said was an arms warehouse under an apartment building, without providing evidence. The military warned residents to evacuate before the strike, and there were no reports of casualties. During an assessment of the situation in Israel's north on Wednesday, Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel was gleaning intelligence from their capture of Hezbollah militants that was significantly weakening Hezbollah's ability to launch attacks. 'We will conduct negotiations under fire, I said that on the first day, I said it in Gaza, I said it here - this is our tool,' he told soldiers operating in southern Lebanon. Israel resumes strikes on Beirut The strikes on southern Beirut came after Mikati said the United States had given him assurances that Israel would curb its strikes on the capital. Hezbollah has a strong presence in southern Beirut, known as the Dahiyeh, which is also a residential and commercial area home to large numbers of civilians and people unaffiliated with the militant group. The Israeli military posted an evacuation warning on the social media platform X ahead of the strike in Beirut. An AP photographer saw three airstrikes in the area, the first coming less than an hour after the notice. In Nabatiyeh, more than half a dozen strikes hit the city and surrounding areas, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, which said 16 people were killed and 52 wounded. The city's mayor, Ahmad Kahil, was among those killed, provincial governor Huwaida Turk told The Associated Press. In his statement about Nabatiyeh, Mikati, the caretaker prime minister, said the international community has been 'deliberately silent' about Israeli strikes that have killed civilians. U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert called reports of Kahlil's death 'alarming.' 'This attack follows other incidents in which civilians and civilian infrastructure have been targeted across Lebanon,' she said. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, following the surprise Hamas attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza. A year of low-level fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border escalated into an all-out war last month, and Israel invaded Lebanon at the start of October. Israeli airstrikes have killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his senior commanders, and Israel has vowed to continue its offensive until its citizens can safely return to communities near the border. The Lebanese Health Ministry said 2,377 people have been killed in Lebanon since last October, more than three-quarters of them in the past month. The fighting has displaced some 1.2 million people in Lebanon, including some 400,000 children. Hezbollah's rocket attacks, which have extended their range and grown more intense over the past month, have driven around 60,000 Israelis from their homes in the north. The attacks have killed nearly 60 people in Israel, around half of them soldiers. Hezbollah has said it will keep up its attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but that appears increasingly remote after months of negotiations brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar sputtered to a halt. Palestinians say 350 bodies recovered from Israeli operation in Gaza Israel is still at war in Gaza more than a year after Hamas' attack, in which some 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and another 250 were abducted. Around 100 captives are still being held, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel has been carrying out a major operation for more than a week in Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp in the territory's north dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to Jabaliya and other areas after saying that Hamas militants had regrouped. Hospitals received around 350 bodies since the Jabaliya offensive began on Oct. 6, according to Dr. Mounir al-Boursh, the director-general of Gaza's Health Ministry. He told the AP that more than half the dead were women and children, adding that many bodies remain in the streets and under the rubble, with rescue teams unable to reach them because of Israeli strikes. 'Entire families have disappeared,' he said. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 people, according to the Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but says more than half were women and children. The offensive has left large areas in ruins and displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people, forcing hundreds of thousands into crowded tent camps or schools-turned-shelters. ___ Chehayeb and Abou AlJoud reported from Beirut.

Biden announces $425 million in Ukraine military aid	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) -- President Joe Biden announced an additional $425 million in military support for Ukraine, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lays out his plan to win the war with Russia. Zelenskyy said, if all goes according to plan, Ukraine can end the war with Russia within a year. He said it’s critical that Ukraine be accepted into NATO, but the NATO Secretary General would not commit. 'This is really a discussion which is ongoing between us and Ukraine,' said Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO. Zelenskyy has also accused North Korea of providing troops and ammunitions to Russia in their battle against Ukraine. 'We are still evaluating those reports. We are concerned by them,' said United States Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell. The White House said President Biden talked with Zelenskyy on Wednesday. The president goes to Germany on Thursday. 'Obviously, a big part of this meeting, of this travel that he’s doing, is going to be around Ukraine,' said White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. President Biden has promised unwavering support for Ukraine, but former president Donald Trump could bring a shift in U.S. policy. Trump has said he has a good relationship with Russian President Vladamir Putin. Trump would not answer, when asked if he has spoken with Putin since he left office. 'I don’t comment on that. But I will tell you, that if I did, it's a smart thing,' Trump said to John Micklethwait of Bloomberg News. Trump said if he’s elected, he will negotiate a deal to end the war with Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said Ukraine will not trade territory or freedom to end the war.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/biden-announces-425-million-in-ukraine-military-aid/	2024-10-16T14:00:30-07:00
