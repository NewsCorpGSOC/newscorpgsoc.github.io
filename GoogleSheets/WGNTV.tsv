Middle East latest: Hamas says it will free a US-Israeli hostage ...	Hamas said on Friday it has accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual nationals who died in captivity in Gaza. The Palestinian militant group's offer appears aimed at keeping up momentum on negotiations over the future of the Gaza ceasefire and the release of all Israeli hostages, living and dead. Talks are continuing in Qatar, but there are no signs of a breakthrough. The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has been paused for almost a month by the fragile ceasefire, although Israel has cut off all food, medicine and electricity for Gaza as a pressure tactic against Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office cast doubt on Hamas’ latest offer, accusing it of trying to manipulate the negotiations. Here's the latest: UN condemns widespread violence against civilians in Syria that especially targeted the minority Alawite sect The U.N. Security Council statement, co-sponsored by the United States and Russia, calls for an immediate halt to the recent violence, mass killings and 'inflammatory activities' in Syria. Member nations expressed 'grave concern' at the impact on escalating tensions among Syria’s disparate communities and called on interim authorities 'to protect all Syrians, regardless of ethnicity or religion.' A war monitor said nearly 1,500 civilians were killed in the sectarian violence, most of them Alawites from the same minority as ousted President Bashar Assad. The council's presidential statement on Friday welcomed Syrian authorities' public condemnation of the violence and called for further measures to prevent its recurrence. It noted the establishment of an independent committee to investigate the violence and called on Syrian authorities to ensure transparent and impartial probes, and to bring all perpetrators to justice. The Security Council also expressed grave concern at the 'acute threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters' and urged Syria to take decisive measures to address the threat. There’s strong opposition to Trump and Netanyahu’s vision for moving Palestinians to Africa The idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once considered a fantasy of Israel’s ultranationalist fringe. Palestinians in Gaza have rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab countries have expressed vehement opposition and offered an alternative reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place. Rights groups say forcing or pressuring the Palestinians to leave their homeland could be a potential war crime. Human Rights Watch and others have said it would amount to 'ethnic cleansing,' the forcible displacement of the civilian population of a national group from a geographic area. The White House declined to comment on the African outreach efforts, but has said Trump 'stands by his vision' presented last month at a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has hailed it as a ' bold vision.' AP Exclusive: US and Israel look to Africa for moving Palestinians uprooted from Gaza The U.S. and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for moving 2 million Palestinians uprooted from the Gaza Strip under President Donald Trump’s postwar plan, American and Israeli officials told The Associated Press. The contacts with Sudan, Somalia and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland reflect the determination by the U.S. and Israel to press ahead with a plan that has been widely condemned and raised serious legal and moral issues. Because all three places are poor, and in some cases wracked by violence, the proposal casts doubt on Trump’s stated goal of resettling Gaza’s Palestinians in a 'beautiful area.' The U.S. and Israeli officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative. Officials from Sudan said they have rejected overtures from the U.S., while officials from Somalia and Somaliland told the AP that they were not aware of any contacts.

That estimate comes from the Islamic Trust, which monitors the site. Israel is tightly controlling access for the prayers, allowing only men over 55 and women over 50 to enter from the occupied West Bank. 'The conditions are extremely difficult,' said Yousef Badeen, a Palestinian who had left the southern West Bank city of Hebron at dawn to make it to Jerusalem, said. 'We wish they will open it for good.' Hamas accused Israel of escalating a 'religious war' against Palestinians with what it called the 'systematic targeting of Muslim religious practices' through its restrictions at Al-Aqsa mosque. Israeli authorities did not immediately comment on the accusation. Hezbollah hints it won't disarm if Israel still occupies southern Lebanon A senior Hezbollah official has hinted that the Lebanese militant group will not lay down its weapons as long as Israel is occupying parts of the country. Mohammed Daamoush made his comments in Beirut during a sermon for Friday prayers adding that Israel’s occupation of five strategic hilltops and what he said were daily violations of a ceasefire aim to pressure Lebanon to normalize relations with Israel. Daamoush says the state now controls the border with Israel and Lebanon's new government is backed by the international community and has weapons, so 'what have you done to face daily Israeli violations and aggression?' He called on authorities to convince the public about why weapons should only be held by the state, adding, 'When there is occupation and a continuing aggression weapons should be in the hands of men and everyone should repel this occupation.' UN's envoy to Syria urges a ‘credible and inclusive’ interim government The U.N. special envoy for Syria said now is the time to create 'a genuinely credible and inclusive' interim government and legislative body in the war-torn country. Geir Pedersen called in a statement Friday, marking 14 years since the civil war began, for an immediate end to all violence and for protection of civilians in accordance with international law. Many of Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities are concerned about how they'll be treated by the country's new Islamist rulers, who overthrew the government late last year. Pedersen called for a credible independent investigation into the recent sectarian massacres and violence in Syria’s coastal region, and for the full cooperation of Syrian authorities with the United Nations in this regard. The statement came a day after Syria’s interim president signed a temporary constitution that leaves the country under Islamist rule while promising to protect the rights of all Syrians for five years during a transitional phase. Israel expresses immediate doubt about Hamas' hostage release offer The United States, led by the Trump administration’s hostage envoy Steve Witkoff, has been pushing for a proposal that would extend the truce and see a limited number of hostage for prisoner exchanges. Following the Hamas statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel had 'accepted the Witkoff outline and showed flexibility,' but said that 'Hamas is refusing and will not budge from its positions.' 'At the same time, it continues to use manipulation and psychological warfare — the reports about Hamas’ willingness to release American hostages are intended to sabotage the negotiations,' the prime minister’s office said. It added that Netanyahu would convene his ministerial team on Saturday night to receive a detailed report from the negotiation team and 'decide on the next steps for the release of hostages.' Hamas says it accepts a proposal to release an American-Israeli hostage and 4 hostage bodies The Palestinian militant group said in a statement Friday it has accepted a new proposal by mediators of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, agreeing to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four other hostage dual nationals who died in captivity. There was no immediate confirmation from other mediating countries. Hamas did not specify when the release would occur. It said it would release alive soldier Edan Alexander, a soldier taken from his base on the Gaza border during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023. It comes as negotiators have been in Doha, trying to salvage the fragile ceasefire nearly two weeks after the end of the truce's first phase. Israel and the United States have been pushing for a proposal to extend the truce through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Buses carrying Druze from Syria cross into Israeli-controlled area of the Golan Heights It marked a historic visit by the embattled minority to visit a religious shrine located on the Israeli side of the border. A group of Druze from the Israeli-controlled Golan heights welcomed the Syrian Druze at the crossing point, carrying Druze flags and chanting in Arabic, 'It is written on our doors, welcome to our beloved ones.' The visit comes as Israel says it is supporting the minority in a country now ruled by Islamists. But many Druze have rejected its overtures, and critics accuse Israel trying to weaken and divide Syria following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. 'This is a legitimate right for us as a Druze community; to go to Syria to visit our families, and they come here to visit their families and visit the holy sites,' said Jawlan Abu Zed, a resident of the predominantly-Druze village of Majdal Shams, on the Israeli side of the border. The Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981. Netanyahu accuses former head of Israeli security services of blackmail The police complaint escalates a growing feud between the government and the intelligence agency. The filing on Friday comes after the former head of the Shin Bet security agency, Nadav Argaman, said Thursday on Israel’s Channel 12 that he was sitting on information about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — and would make it public if it is found that Netanyahu has broken the law. In the police complaint, Netanyahu demands an investigation into Argaman’s conduct. He also lashed out at current Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar on Thursday in a post to X, accusing him of a 'campaign of extortion with threats by means of briefings to the media in the last few days.' The dispute comes as the Shin Bet has launched an investigation into ties between close Netanyahu aides and the Qatari government. Netanyahu and the current and former security chiefs have also been locked in a dispute over where blame falls for the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Netanyahu has brushed off calls for a state commission of inquiry to investigate his government’s role in the security failure that day. UN-backed experts accuse Israel of sexual and gender-based violence in Gaza A United Nations-backed group of human rights experts accused Israel on Thursday of 'disproportionate violence against women and children' during the war against Hamas in Gaza, and accused Israeli security forces of rape and sexual violence against Palestinian detainees. Israel is committing 'genocidal acts' by systematically destroying Gaza’s reproductive health care facilities, the experts concluded, although they stopped short of accusing Israel of genocide. Israel has refused to cooperate with the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council that commissioned the team of independent experts, accusing it of anti-Israel bias. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. A U.N. envoy last year said there were 'reasonable grounds' to believe Hamas committed rape and sexual violence in the attack. Israel’s retaliatory war in Gaza has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-hamas-says-it-will-free-a-us-israeli-hostage-to-keep-ceasefire-talks-rolling/	2025-03-14T09:56:29-07:00	
Hamas agrees to release a US-Israeli hostage and the bodies of 4 ...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Hamas said on Friday it has accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual-nationals, hostages who had died in captivity. The announcement came as talks continue in Qatar to try to broker the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. The militant group in the Gaza Strip did not immediately specify when the release of soldier Edan Alexander and the four bodies would occur, and other countries party to the agreement did not immediately confirm the Hamas statement. Alexander was 19 when he was taken from his base on the border with Gaza in southern Israel during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023 that sparked the war. It was not clear which parties had participated in negotiating the deal. The United States, led by the Trump administration's hostage envoy Steve Witkoff, has been pushing for a proposal that would extend the truce and see a limited number of hostage for prisoner exchanges. Following the Hamas statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu huddled with top advisers in security consultations, according to an Israeli official who was not authorized to speak on the record about the matter. The first phase of the ceasefire ended two weeks ago. The White House last week made a surprise announcement, saying that American officials had engaged in 'ongoing talks and discussions' with Hamas officials, stepping away from a long-held U.S. policy of not directly engaging with the militant group. That prompted a terse response from Netanyahu’s office. It was not immediately clear whether those talks were at all linked to Hamas’ Friday announcement about the release of the American hostage. In a separate statement, Hamas official Husam Badran reaffirmed what he said was Hamas’ commitment to fully implementing the ceasefire agreement in all its phases, warning that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one. The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza for the first time since early in the war, and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies. Israel has been pressing Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for an extension of the first phase, and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. Two weeks ago, Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza and its more than 2 million people as it pressed Hamas to agree. The militant group has said that the move would affect the remaining hostages as well. Hamas wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. The militant group said with support cut off to Gaza, some 80% of the population has now lost access to food sources, with aid distribution halted and markets running out of supplies, while 90% are unable to access clean drinking water. In Jerusalem, some 80,000 Muslim worshippers prayed on Friday at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound for the second week of Ramadan, according to the Islamic Trust, which monitors the site. Israel is tightly controlling access, allowing only men over 55 and women over 50 to enter from the occupied territory for the prayers. 'The conditions are extremely difficult,' said Yousef Badeen, a Palestinian who had left the southern West Bank city of Hebron at dawn to make it to Jerusalem, said. 'We wish they will open it for good.' Hamas accused Israel of escalating a 'religious war' against Palestinians with what it called the 'systematic targeting of Muslim religious practices' through its restrictions at Al-Aqsa mosque. ___ Associated Press writer David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hamas-agrees-to-release-a-us-israeli-hostage-and-the-bodies-of-4-other-dual-nationals/	2025-03-14T05:33:54-07:00	
US envoy is taking Putin's comments on Ukraine ceasefire proposal...	Russian President Vladimir Putin met with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss details of the American proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Ukraine, asking him to convey Moscow's thoughts to Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday. Putin asked Witkoff late Thursday to give additional messages to U.S. President Donald Trump, Peskov told reporters, after the Russian leader said at a news conference that he supported a truce in principle but set out a host of details that need to be clarified before it is agreed. Ukraine, under severe military pressure on parts of the front line three years after Russia’s full-scale invasion, has already endorsed the proposal. Russia’s army has gained battlefield momentum, and analysts say Putin likely will be reluctant to rush into a ceasefire while he feels he has an advantage. The Russian army, backed by North Korean troops, are now close to completely driving Ukrainian forces from their foothold in Russia's Kursk border region in what would be a major setback for Kyiv. A possible phone call between Putin and Trump to settle outstanding ceasefire issues could be arranged after Witkoff delivers the messages in Washington, Peskov said. 'There is an understanding on both sides that such a call is needed,' Peskov said. 'There are certainly some grounds for cautious optimism,' Peskov said of the ceasefire proposal. 'A lot still needs to be done, but the president has shown solidarity with President Trump’s position.' U.S. officials have said Washington was set to discuss technical issues related to a possible ceasefire next week. Given the range of issues on the table, and the sharp differences between what Moscow and Kyiv want, it could potentially take weeks or months for the guns to fall silent. Trump vowed during his election campaign to settle the war in 24 hours, but in January he changed that timeframe, voicing hope that peace could be negotiated in six months. Putin’s apparently amicable tone toward the White House reflects the remarkable shift in U.S. relations with Russia and Ukraine since Trump returned to office in January. Former President Joe Biden had sought to isolate Putin. Trump has threatened both Russia and Ukraine with punitive measures if they don’t engage with his peace efforts. Trump briefly cut off critical military aid and intelligence sharing in an apparent effort to push Kyiv to enter talks on ending the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a tense meeting at the White House on Feb. 28 in which Trump questioned whether Ukraine wanted to halt the war. Trump has raised the possibility of tightening sanctions on Russia, though his administration has also repeatedly embraced Kremlin positions on the conflict, including indicating that Ukraine’s hopes of joining NATO are unlikely to be realized and that it probably will not get back the land that Russia’s army occupies, which amounts to nearly 20% of the country. Meanwhile, Russian air defenses downed four Ukrainian drones attacking the Russian capital early Friday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. One damaged the roof of an apartment building a few kilometers (miles) from the Kremlin. Several other buildings were lightly damaged by drone fragments, but there were no injuries, according to emergency officials. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-envoy-is-taking-putins-comments-on-ukraine-ceasefire-proposal-to-trump-kremlin-official-says/	2025-03-14T04:05:22-07:00	
AP Exclusive: US and Israel look to Africa for resettling Palesti...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The U.S. and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for resettling Palestinians uprooted from the Gaza Strip under President Donald Trump's proposed postwar plan, American and Israeli officials told The Associated Press. The contacts with Sudan, Somalia and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland reflect the determination by the U.S. and Israel to press ahead with a plan that has been widely condemned and raised serious legal and moral issues. Because all three places are poor, and in some cases wracked by violence, the proposal also casts doubt on Trump’s stated goal of resettling Gaza’s Palestinians in a 'beautiful area.' Officials from Sudan said they have rejected overtures from the U.S., while officials from Somalia and Somaliland told The Associated Press that they were not aware of any contacts. Under Trump’s plan, Gaza’s more than 2 million people would be permanently sent elsewhere. He has proposed the U.S. would take ownership of the territory, oversee a lengthy cleanup process and develop it as a real estate project. The idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once considered a fantasy of Israel’s ultranationalist fringe. But since Trump presented the idea at a White House meeting last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed it as a ' bold vision.' Palestinians in Gaza have rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab nations have expressed vehement opposition and offered an alternative reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place. Rights groups have said forcing or pressuring the Palestinians to leave could be a potential war crime. Still, the White House says Trump 'stands by his vision.' Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative, U.S. and Israeli officials confirmed the contacts with Somalia and Somaliland, while the Americans confirmed Sudan as well. They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place. Separate outreach from the U.S. and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan alongside Netanyahu, according to the U.S. officials, who said that Israel was taking the lead in the discussions. Israel and the U.S. have a variety of incentives — financial, diplomatic and security — to offer these potential partners. It is a formula that Trump used five years ago when he brokered the Abraham Accords — a series of mutually beneficial diplomatic accords between Israel and four Arab countries. The White House declined to comment on the outreach efforts. The offices of Netanyahu and Ron Dermer, the Israeli Cabinet minister and Netanyahu confidant who has been leading Israel’s postwar planning, also had no comment. But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a longtime advocate of what he calls 'voluntary' emigration of Palestinians, said this week that Israel is working to identify countries to take in Palestinians. He also said Israel is preparing a 'very large emigration department' within its Defense Ministry. Here is a closer look at the places the officials say have been approached. Sudan The North African country was among the four Abraham Accord nations that agreed to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020. As part of the deal, the U.S. removed Sudan from its list of state supporters of terrorism, a move that gave the country access to international loans and global legitimacy. But relations with Israel never took off as Sudan plunged into civil war between government forces and the RSF paramilitary group. The conflict has been marked by atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the U.N. and rights groups. The International Criminal Court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, and then-President Joe Biden's administration in January said the RSF and its proxies were committing genocide. The U.S. and Israel would be hard-pressed to persuade Palestinians to leave Gaza, particularly to such a troubled country. But they could offer incentives to the Khartoum government, including debt relief, weapons, technology and diplomatic support. Two Sudanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic matter, confirmed that the Trump administration has approached the military-led government about accepting Palestinians. One of them said the contacts began even before Trump's inauguration with offers of military assistance against the RSF, assistance with postwar reconstruction and other incentives. Both officials said the Sudanese government rejected the idea. 'This suggestion was immediately rebuffed,' said one official. 'No one opened this matter again.' Military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan told an Arab leaders’ summit last week in Cairo that his country 'categorically rejects' any plan that aims to transfer 'the brotherly Palestinians from their land under whatever justification or name.' Somaliland Somaliland, a territory of over 3 million people in the Horn of Africa, seceded from Somalia over 30 years ago, but it is not internationally recognized as an independent state. Somalia considers Somaliland part of its territory. Somaliland’s new president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, has made international recognition a priority. An American official involved in the efforts confirmed that the U.S. was 'having a quiet conversation with Somaliland about a range of areas where they can be helpful to the U.S. in exchange for recognition.' The possibility of U.S. recognition could provide an incentive for Abdullahi to back away from the territory’s solidarity with the Palestinians. The United Arab Emirates, another Abraham Accord country that has developed strong ties with Israel, once had a military base in Somaliland and maintains commercial interests there, including a port. The territory's strategic location, in the Gulf of Aden waterway near Yemen, home to the Houthi rebel group, could also make it a valuable ally. Over the years, Somaliland has been lauded for its relatively stable political environment, contrasting sharply with Somalia’s ongoing struggles amid deadly attacks by al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab. Since 1991, Somaliland has maintained its own government, currency and security structures. Still, it has one of the lowest income levels in the world. An official in Somaliland, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said his government has not been approached and is not in talks about taking in Palestinians. Somalia Somalia has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians, often hosting peaceful protests on its streets in support of them. The country joined the recent Arab summit that rejected Trump’s plan and seems like an unlikely destination for Palestinians, even if they did agree to move. Sambu Chepkorir, a lawyer and conflict researcher in Nairobi, Kenya, said it is difficult to understand why Somalia would want to host Palestinians given the country’s strong support for Palestinian self-rule. 'The realignments keep changing, and so maybe there is a hidden agenda,' Chepkorir said. A Somali official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the country had not been approached about taking in Palestinians from Gaza and there had been no discussions about it. ___ Lee reported from Washington, and Magdy reported from Cairo.

Putin says he agrees in principle with US proposal for 30-day cea...	Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he agrees in principle with a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but the terms need to be worked out, and he emphasized that it should pave the way to lasting peace. 'So the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,' Putin told a news conference in Moscow. 'But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.' He noted the need to develop a mechanism to control possible breaches of the truce. Another issue, he said, is whether Ukraine could use the 30-day ceasefire to continue mobilization and rearmament. 'We agree with the proposals to halt the fighting, but we proceed from the assumption that the ceasefire should lead to lasting peace and remove the root causes of the crisis,' Putin said. Putin noted that while it appeared that the U.S. persuaded Ukraine to accept a ceasefire, Ukraine is interested in that because of the battlefield situation, noting that Ukrainian troops that launched an incursion into Russia’s Kursk region would be fully blocked in the coming days. 'In these conditions, I believe it would be good for the Ukrainian side to secure a ceasefire for at least 30 days,' he said. Referring to the Ukrainian troops in Kursk, he said: 'Will all those who are there come out without a fight?' Putin thanked U.S. President Donald Trump 'for paying so much attention to the settlement in Ukraine.' He also thanked the leaders of China, India, Brazil and South Africa for their 'noble mission to end the fighting to casualties,' a statement that signaled those countries' potential involvement in a ceasefire deal. Russia has said it will not accept peacekeepers from any NATO members to monitor a prospective truce. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. An envoy of U.S. President Donald Trump arrived Thursday in Moscow for talks on an American-proposed 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine has accepted, but a senior Russian official said the truce would only help Kyiv by giving its weary and shorthanded military a break. The diplomatic effort coincided with a Russian claim that its troops have driven the Ukrainian army out of a key town in Russia's Kursk border region, where Moscow has been trying for seven months to dislodge Ukrainian troops from their foothold. A U.S. official confirmed the arrival of Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the matter. The Russian Defense Ministry’s claim that it recaptured the town of Sudzha, a Ukrainian operational hub in Kursk, came hours after President Vladimir Putin visited his commanders in Kursk. The claim could not be independently verified. Ukrainian officials made no immediate comment. The renewed Russian military push and Putin's high-profile visit to his troops unfolded as Trump seeks a diplomatic end to the war, which began more than three years ago with Russia’s full-scale invasion. The U.S. on Tuesday lifted its March 3 suspension of military aid for Kyiv after senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials reported making progress on how to stop the fighting during talks in Saudi Arabia. Trump said Wednesday that 'it’s up to Russia now' as his administration presses Moscow to agree to the ceasefire. The U.S. president has made veiled threats to hit Russia with new sanctions if it does not engage with peace efforts. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov would not comment on Moscow’s view of the ceasefire proposal. 'Before the talks start, and they haven’t started yet, it would be wrong to talk about it in public,' he told reporters. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Thursday that Trump is 'willing to apply maximum pressure on both sides,' including sanctions that reach the highest scale on Russia. Senior U.S. officials have said they hope to see Russia stop attacks on Ukraine within the next few days. Russia complains about ceasefire proposal Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser, complained in televised remarks Thursday that a ceasefire would grant a 'temporary break for the Ukrainian military.' Speaking later to reporters in the Kremlin, Putin’s foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, reaffirmed that the proposed ceasefire would 'give us nothing,' adding that it would 'only give the Ukrainians a chance to regroup, consolidate their forces and keep doing the same in the future.' Ushakov would not comment on Witkoff’s talks in Moscow, saying that the parties agreed to keep them confidential. He said Russia wants a 'long-term peaceful settlement that takes into account Moscow’s interests and concerns.' His comments echoed statements from Putin, who has repeatedly said a temporary ceasefire would benefit Ukraine and its Western allies. Ukraine has leveled accusations similar to Ushakov's, claiming Russia would use a truce to regroup and rearm. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy chided Russia on the Telegram messaging app Thursday for what he said was its slow response to the ceasefire proposal, accusing Moscow of trying to delay any peace deal. He said that Ukraine is 'determined to move quickly toward peace' and hoped U.S. pressure would compel Russia to stop fighting. The U.S. still has about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding for future arms shipments to Ukraine, but the Trump administration has shown no interest so far in using that authority to send additional weapons as it awaits the outcome of peace overtures. By signaling its openness to a ceasefire at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war, Ukraine has presented the Kremlin with a dilemma — whether to accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington. The Ukrainian army’s foothold inside Russia has been under intense pressure for months from the renewed effort by Russian forces, backed by North Korean troops. Ukraine's daring incursion last August led to the first occupation of Russian soil by foreign troops since World War II and embarrassed the Kremlin. Putin visits Russian military commanders Speaking to commanders Wednesday, Putin said that he expected the military 'to completely free the Kursk region from the enemy in the nearest future.' Wearing military fatigues, Putin added that 'it’s necessary to think about creating a security zone alongside the state border,' in a signal that Moscow could try to expand its territorial gains by capturing parts of Ukraine’s neighboring Sumy region. That idea could complicate a ceasefire deal. Ukraine launched the raid in a bid to counter the unceasingly grim news from the front line, as well as to draw Russian troops away from the battlefield inside Ukraine and to gain a bargaining chip in any peace talks. But the incursion did not significantly change the dynamic of the war. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, assessed late Wednesday that Russian forces were in control of Sudzha, a town close to the border that previously was home to about 5,000 people. Ukraine’s top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Russian aircraft had carried out an unprecedented number of strikes on Kursk and that as a result Sudzha had been almost completely destroyed. He did not comment on whether Ukraine still controlled the settlement but said his country was 'maneuvering (troops) to more advantageous lines.' Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Dmytro Krasylnykov, commander of Ukraine’s Northern Operational Command, which includes the Kursk region, was dismissed from his post, he told Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne on Wednesday. He told the outlet that he was not given a reason for his dismissal, saying 'I’m guessing, but I don’t want to talk about it yet.' ___ Associated Press Writer Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at ___ This story has been corrected to show that Suzha is a key Ukrainian military hub, not Kursk’s biggest town.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-says-it-has-retaken-sudzha-the-biggest-town-in-the-kursk-region-controlled-by-ukraine/	2025-03-13T09:37:29-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli airstrike targets residential buildin...	Israel's military carried out an airstrike on the outskirts of Syria's capital Thursday targeting a residential building that Israel said was a command center of the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. A member of the group at the scene told The Associated Press the strike hit a home of the group’s leader which has been empty for years. Local paramedics said three people were wounded. Also Thursday, United Nations-backed experts accused Israel of 'the systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence' in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel has refused to cooperate with the commission, accusing it and the council of being biased against it. The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza was paused by a fragile ceasefire in January. Negotiations over the future of the truce and the release of Israeli hostages are continuing in Qatar, but there are no signs of a breakthrough. Here's the latest: Trump's apparent backtrack on Gaza plan is welcomed by Arab countries Arab countries welcomed an extremely brief remark from President Donald Trump indicating he has backed away from his plan to depopulate Gaza. Trump responded 'Nobody’s expelling any Palestinians,' to a reporter Wednesday before asking her where she worked and implying it was a dumb question. U.S. allies Egypt and Jordan seized on those four words and released statements welcoming the remarks. Both had rejected Trump’s earlier suggestion that they accept large numbers of Palestinian refugees. Hamas issued a statement welcoming Trump’s 'apparent retreat from his proposed plan to displace our people from Gaza.' Last month, Trump proposed that Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries so the U.S. could take ownership of Gaza and develop it as a beach destination for others. Human rights experts said it would likely violate international law. 25,000 Palestinian patients need medical evacuation from Gaza, global aid group says Around 50 patients are being evacuated each day from Gaza by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies alongside its local partners. 'Yesterday, we saved 39 lives,' Kate Forbes, the federation's president, told The Associated Press on Thursday. These 25,000 patients include chronically ill people with cancer, heart disease or hemophilia whose regular treatment has been interrupted due to Gaza's destroyed healthcare infrastructure. The trickle of medical evacuations is still taking place during Israel's renewed blockade of humanitarian aid and electricity into Gaza. In Cairo this week, Forbes met with some of the medical evacuees and the children accompanying them. The kids she met are deeply affected by the trauma they've witnessed, she said, leaving many of them mute upon arrival. 3 people were wounded by the Israeli strike in Syria, medics say The Syrian Civil Defense group, also known as the White Helmets, said a woman was seriously wounded and two men were lightly injured. The group said no one was killed. The paramedic group said the strike destroyed the targeted building in a Damascus suburb and damaged two nearby buildings. Syrian building targeted by Israeli strike ‘was home of militant group leader' A Palestinian Islamic Jihad member at the scene of the airstrike in Syria told The Associated Press that the apartment that was targeted was the home of the group’s leader Ziad Nakhaleh. Ismail Sindak said the apartment had been empty for years, adding that Nakhaleh is not in Syria. Asked whether anyone was killed in the strike, Sindak said 'the house was empty.' It was not immediately clear where Nakhaleh is but he is believed to spend his time between Lebanon, Iran and Syria. The Israeli military said its air force conducted an intelligence-based strike on a command center belonging to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Damascus. It added that command center was used to plan and direct 'terrorist activities' by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad against Israel. 1 reported killed after Israeli airstrike hits residential building in Syria Syria’s state news agency says an Israeli airstrike has struck a residential building on the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus. The agency did not give further details about Thursday’s strike. Israel’s defense minister confirms the airstrike in Damascus Israel’s military said that the strike targeted a command center of the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It said that the center has been used to direct attacks against Israel and vowed to 'respond forcefully' to the presence of Palestinian militant groups inside Syria. Defense Minister Israel Katz warned in a statement that 'whenever terrorist activity is organized against Israel,' Syria’s new President Ahmad al-Sharaa 'will find air force planes circling above him and attacking terrorist targets.' The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said the building targeted is located in the suburb of Dummar, northwest of the capital and was inhabited by Palestinians. It said one person was killed. Israel sends food aid to Druze minority group in Syria Israel says it has sent 10,000 packages of food aid to Syria’s Druze, as it seeks to forge ties with the minority to shape the country’s troubled transition from civil war. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the operation was conducted in recent weeks in coordination with local Druze leaders, with most of the aid delivered to the overwhelmingly Druze southern region of Sweida. Israel says it is supporting an embattled minority in a country now ruled by Islamists. But many Druze have rejected its overtures, and critics accuse Israel trying to weaken and divide Syria following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. Israel seized a buffer zone in southern Syria shortly after Assad’s overthrow and has carried out waves of airstrikes to destroy Syria’s military. It has ordered the new security forces not to operate south of the capital, Damascus. Israel says it is acting in Syria to protect its citizens from Iran-backed groups that were allied with Assad as well as the new government, led by a former senior al-Qaida leader who cut ties with the group several years ago. Report says Israel used sexual and reproductive violence in Gaza United Nations-backed experts on Thursday accused Israel of 'the systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence' in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel’s mission to the U.N. in Geneva rejected the allegations and accused the The Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which was created by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, of relying on 'second-hand, single, uncorroborated sources.' Israel has refused to cooperate with the commission, accusing it and the council of being biased against it. In its report released Thursday, the commission examined the widespread destruction of Gaza, the use of heavy explosives in civilian areas and Israeli attacks on hospitals and health facilities. It said all three led to 'disproportionate violence against women and children.' Israel says it took extraordinary measures to avoid harming civilians in the 15-month war, which has been paused by a fragile ceasefire. It blames civilian deaths and destruction on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas. The commission also accused Israeli security forces of rape and sexual violence against Palestinian detainees. Israel denies any systematic abuse of prisoners and says it takes action when there are violations. The commission is led by former U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay. Its findings can be used as evidence for the International Criminal Court or other bodies that seek to prosecute war crimes. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. A U.N. envoy last year said there were 'reasonable grounds' to believe Hamas committed rape and sexual violence in the attack. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-un-backed-experts-accuse-israel-of-sexual-and-gender-based-violence-in-gaza/	2025-03-13T07:33:31-07:00	
UN report accuses Israel of sexual violence against Palestinians....	GENEVA (AP) — United Nations-backed human rights experts on Thursday accused Israel of 'the systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence' in its war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The allegations came in one of the most extensive reports of its kind on the issue since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel ignited the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the Human Rights Council, a U.N.-backed body that commissioned the team of independent experts, as an 'anti-Israel circus' that 'has long been exposed as an antisemitic, rotten, terrorist-supporting, and irrelevant body.' His statement did not address the findings themselves. The findings by the Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which seeks to document in minute detail the allegations and evidence of crimes to bolster accountability for perpetrators, could be used by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court or in other jurisdictions to try to bring justice to victims and their relatives. In its report released Thursday, the commission examined the widespread destruction of Gaza, the use of heavy explosives in civilian areas and Israeli attacks on hospitals and health facilities. It said all three led to 'disproportionate violence against women and children.' The commission documented a range of violations perpetrated against Palestinian women, men, girls and boys and accused Israeli security forces of rape and sexual violence against Palestinian detainees. Israel denies any systematic abuse of prisoners and says it takes action when there are violations. 'Our report finds that Israel has increasingly employed sexual, reproductive, and other forms of gender-based violence against Palestinians as part of a broader effort to undermine their right to self-determination,' Chris Sidoti, a member of the commission, told reporters in Geneva. Israel’s mission in Geneva rejected the allegations and accused the commission of relying on 'second-hand, single, uncorroborated sources.' Since the commission was set up in 2021 — long before the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel — Israel has refused to cooperate with it, accusing the investigative team and the council of bias. Commission member Sidoti said the report 'also concludes that Israel has carried out genocidal acts through the systematic destruction of sexual and reproductive health care facilities.' The commission stopped short of accusing Israel of genocide, as some advocacy groups and other rights experts have. Israel, which was established in the wake of the Nazi Holocaust and is home to many survivors and their families, has vigorously denied such allegations. Israel says it took extraordinary measures to avoid harming civilians in the 15-month war, which has been paused by a fragile ceasefire. It blames civilian deaths and destruction on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas. Israeli forces carried out a number of raids on hospitals, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Israeli authorities, citing eyewitness accounts and other evidence, have accused Hamas-led militants of widespread rape and sexual violence. Israeli experts who have treated former hostages say some were subjected to physical and sexual abuse in captivity. A U.N. envoy last year reported 'reasonable grounds' to believe such allegations. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the commission held public hearings with victims, lawyers, advocacy groups and others whose accounts were included in the report. The commission was not considering allegations of sexual, gender-based and other violence committed against Israelis during the Oct. 7 attack or against hostages in Gaza, but reported on the issue last year. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-un-report-accuses-israel-of-sexual-violence-against-palestinians-netanyahu-claims-anti-israel-bias/	2025-03-13T05:27:10-07:00	
U.S. resumes intelligence sharing with Ukraine	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR)-- U.S. military deliveries and intelligence sharing were back on Wednesday for Ukrainian troops. President Donald Trump lifted his ban on that assistance in response to Ukraine supporting a 30-day ceasefire proposal Tuesday. Now, the pressure is ramping up on Russia to agree to stop the fighting within the next few days. 'The ball is truly in their court,' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. 'If their response is no, it would be highly unfortunate, and it would make their intentions clear.' President Trump's Middle East envoy could meet with President Vladimir Putin in Russia this week and for now, President Trump said financial penalties are off the table. 'It would be devastating for Russia, but I don't want to do that because I want to see peace,' the president said in the Oval Office Wednesday. A Putin spokesperson said Moscow is waiting on more information about the ceasefire proposal from the U.S. before taking a position. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine's allies also have to be ready to monitor the ceasefire. 'This is very important,' Zelenskyy said. Democrats and Republicans in Congress are calling for continued support for Ukraine as the Trump administration has gone back and forth in sharing military aid and intelligence. 'We must not pressure Ukraine to silence their guns unless Russia commits to do the same,' said U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) Bennet and U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) have both traveled to war-torn Ukraine. 'We can't let Putin have a win in Ukraine, ladies and gentlemen,' Tillis said. Tillis argues that would embolden Russia to take over more of Europe and other adversaries, like China, North Korea and Iran, to focus on the U.S. 'Vladimir Putin has a plan, and we could play right into it,' Tillis said. To pressure Putin to accept the ceasefire proposal, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) plans to introduce legislation Thursday that would impose 'bone-breaking' sanctions against Russia and tariffs on any country that buys Russian oil, gas, uranium or other products. 'So you have to pick between our economy and the Russian economy,' Graham said. 'It's now time for Russia to pay a heavier price than they've paid in the past if they continue this war.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/u-s-resumes-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine/	2025-03-12T13:33:34-07:00	
Pressed to accept a ceasefire in Ukraine, Putin seems likely to s...	By signaling its openness to a ceasefire, Ukraine has handed the Kremlin a difficult challenge at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war: Should Moscow accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or should it reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington? Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly ruled out a temporary break in hostilities, saying it would only benefit Ukraine and its Western allies by letting them replenish their arsenals. He has insisted Moscow wants a comprehensive agreement that would ensure a lasting settlement. The Kremlin responded cautiously to the news of Ukraine accepting the U.S.-proposed truce during Tuesday’s talks in Saudi Arabia, saying that it needs to know details of the discussions before expressing its view. The careful approach reflects Putin’s awareness of the risk that a blunt rejection of the offer could upset tentative efforts to normalize Russia-U.S. ties. Observers say that instead of an outright rejection, Putin will likely propose linking the truce to certain conditions that would protect Moscow’s interests. Why would the Kremlin oppose a ceasefire? The Russian military held the battlefield initiative last year, making slow but steady gains along several sections of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. The tempo of Russian advances accelerated in the fall, when Moscow’s forces captured the most territory since the start of the war. Ukraine has sought to retake the initiative with a surprise foray into Russia’s Kursk region that began in August, seeking to distract Moscow’s forces from their offensive in eastern Ukraine and make gains that potentially could be exchanged for Russia-occupied areas in peace talks. The incursion, however, has diverted Ukrainian resources from defending the Donetsk region in the east and it failed to stem Russian advances there. Now Ukrainian forces are on the verge of losing their last remaining bridgehead in Kursk under the brunt of a swift Russian counteroffensive. Moscow also ravaged Ukrainian energy infrastructure with waves of missiles and drones, destroying much of its power-generating capacity. Putin has repeatedly said a temporary halt to hostilities at a time when Russian forces firmly hold the initiative would only allow exhausted Ukrainian troops a break to rest and rearm. 'As for the settlement of the situation, I would like to emphasize that it shouldn’t be aimed at a brief truce — some sort of a break for regrouping troops and rearmament in order to continue the conflict — but a long-term peace,' Putin has said. Moscow has made it clear it wouldn’t accept any troops from NATO members as monitors under a prospective peace deal. What does Putin want? Putin key goals remain what he declared when he launched the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022: Ukraine renounce joining NATO, sharply cut its army, and protect Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow’s orbit. On top of that, he now wants Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow has seized but doesn’t fully control. Russian officials also have said that any prospective peace deal should involve unfreezing Russian assets in the West and lifting other U.S. and European Union sanctions. The Trump administration has put a potential sanctions relief on the table. Along with that, Putin has repeatedly emphasized the need to 'remove the root causes of the crisis,' a reference to the Kremlin’s demand to roll back a NATO military buildup near Russian borders it describes as a major threat to its security. The Kremlin leader has argued that Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose term expired last year, lacks the legitimacy to sign a peace deal. Kyiv maintains that elections are impossible to hold amid a war. U.S. President Donald Trump has spoken of the need for Ukraine to hold an election in comments that echoed Moscow’s view. What more could Moscow demand? Some observers noted that instead of an outright rejection of the proposed truce, Putin could put forward several conditions. Pro-Kremlin commentator Sergei Markov suggested Moscow could agree to a truce if Ukraine's allies halt arms supplies to Kyiv. The U.S. said it resumed weapons shipments and intelligence sharing with Kyiv after it agreed to a truce Tuesday in Saudi Arabia. 'Russia could say ‘yes, but’ to a ceasefire offer, accepting a 30-day truce on condition that an embargo is imposed on arms supplies to Ukraine,' Markov wrote. Another Moscow wish is a presidential election in Ukraine, which would be possible after Ukraine lifts martial law. 'Peace would allow Russia to influence Ukrainian politics and use peaceful means to ensure friendly relations,' Markov said. Moscow-based foreign policy expert Alexei Naumov also predicted that Russia would likely accept the ceasefire offer if it leads to an election in Ukraine. 'There is a paradox in these talks and peace initiatives – Ukraine and Russia are both vying for Donald Trump’s attention and seeking to improve their positions with his help,' Naumov said in a commentary. Sam Greene of the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis said it would be hard to imagine Putin saying a categoric 'no' to the ceasefire proposal, adding that the Kremlin leader 'has already achieved in some ways more through this negotiation process … then he achieved in a long time on the battlefield,' describing a brief halt in the U.S. military assistance to Ukraine and the talk about rolling back sanctions as 'big wins' for Russia. Putin’s statements against a temporary truce mean simply that Russia is 'not likely to agree to a ceasefire without extracting various things along the way,' Greene said. 'The sort of ceasefire that it might be interested in is quite clearly not the kind of ceasefire that the Ukrainians or the Europeans might be interested in, although the Americans may be more malleable on that,' he added. 'Moscow has every reason to believe that … if this process lands anywhere, it will land in a place that is more or less on Russia’s terms, as long as the process is being driven by Washington,' Greene said.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-pressed-to-accept-a-ceasefire-in-ukraine-putin-seems-likely-to-seek-his-own-conditions/	2025-03-12T11:26:07-07:00	
US arms flow to Ukraine again as the Kremlin mulls a ceasefire pr...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. arms deliveries to Ukraine resumed Wednesday, officials said, a day after the Trump administration lifted its suspension of military aid for Kyiv in its fight against Russia's invasion, and Ukrainian officials signaled that they were open to a 30-day ceasefire backed by Washington. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that it’s important not to 'get ahead' of the question of responding to the ceasefire proposal. He told reporters that Moscow is awaiting 'detailed information' about it from the U.S. and suggested that Russia must get that first before it can take a position. Arms deliveries to Ukraine have already resumed through a Polish logistics center, the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Poland announced Wednesday. The deliveries go through a NATO and U.S. hub in the eastern Polish city of Rzeszow that’s has been used to ferry Western weapons into neighboring Ukraine about 70 kilometers (45 miles) away. The American military help is vital for Ukraine’s shorthanded and weary army, which is having a tough time keeping Russia’s bigger military force at bay. But for Moscow, more American aid spells potentially more difficulty in achieving its war aims and likely will be a tough sell in Moscow for Washington’s peace efforts. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that Washington will pursue 'multiple points of contacts' with Russia to see if President Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate an end to the war. He declined to give details. 'The ball is truly in their court,' Rubio said at a refueling stopover in Shannon, Ireland on his way to talks in Canada with other Group of Seven leading industrialized nations. Rubio said he hoped to see Russia stop attacks on Ukraine within the next few days as a first step. 'We don’t think it’s constructive to stand here today and say what we’re going to do if Russia says no,' Rubio said, adding he wanted to avoid statements about Russia that 'are abrasive in any way.' Escalation of conflict amid ceasefire talks His comments came amid intensifying Russian effort to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk region that has yielded breakthroughs in recent days, Ukrainian soldiers told The Associated Press. The fighting has escalated as ceasefire talks come to a head, with Moscow intent on taking back its territory and Kyiv determined to hold onto it as a bargaining chip in any negotiations. Ukrainian forces made a daring raid into the Russian region last August in the first foreign occupation of Russian territory since World War II. They have held on despite intense pressure from tens of thousands of Russian and North Korean troops. Recent fighting reportedly has focused on the Kursk town of Sudzha, which is a key Ukrainian supply hub and operational base. Ukrainian soldiers said the situation is dynamic and fighting continues in and around the town, but three of them conceded Russian forces were making headway. Russian state news agencies RIA Novosti and Tass reported Wednesday that the Russian military have entered Sudzha. It wasn't possible to independently verify either side's claims. Inside Ukraine, Russian ballistic missiles killed at least five civilians, officials said Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump wants to end the three-year war and pressured Zelenskyy to enter talks. The suspension of U.S. assistance came days after Zelenskyy and Trump argued about the conflict in a tense White House meeting. Rubio, who led the American delegation to Tuesday's talks in Saudi Arabia, said Washington would present the ceasefire offer to the Kremlin, which has so far opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict and hasn't accepted any concessions. 'We’re going to tell (the Russians) this is what’s on the table. Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking. And now it’ll be up to them to say yes or no,' Rubio told reporters after the talks. 'If they say no, then we’ll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here.' Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel this week to Moscow, where he could meet with Putin, according to a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. The person cautioned that scheduling could change. Russian officials are wary about the U.S.-Ukraine talks Russian lawmakers signaled wariness about the prospect of a ceasefire. 'Russia is advancing (on the battlefield), so it will be different with Russia,' senior Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev noted in a post on the messaging app Telegram. 'Any agreements (with the understanding of the need for compromise) should be on our terms, not American,' Kosachev wrote. Lawmaker Mikhail Sheremet told the state news agency Tass that 'Russia is not interested in continuing' the war but at the same time Moscow 'will not tolerate being strung along.' The outcome of the Saudi Arabia talks 'places the onus on Washington to persuade Moscow to accept and implement the ceasefire,' said John Hardie, a defense analyst and deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute. 'Moscow will present itself as cooperative, but may push for agreement on basic principles for a final peace deal before agreeing to a ceasefire,' he said. 'Russia may also insist on barring Western military aid to Ukraine during the ceasefire and on Ukraine holding elections ahead of a long-term peace agreement.' Russia’s foreign intelligence service, known as the SVR, reported Wednesday morning that the service’s chief, Sergei Naryshkin, spoke on the phone with CIA Director John Ratcliffe on Tuesday. The two discussed cooperation 'in areas of common interest and the resolution of crisis situations,' according to a statement by the SVR. ___ Stefanie Dazio in Berlin, and Sylvie Corbet in Paris, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russian-missiles-kill-5-in-ukraine-as-kremlin-mulls-ceasefire-prospects/	2025-03-12T05:44:47-07:00	
US lifts military freeze on Ukraine in push for 30-day ceasefire	The U.S. will immediately restore military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine following bilateral talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, with Ukraine expressing 'readiness' to accept a 30-day ceasefire proposal. 'Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation,' said a joint statement after the talks. 'The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace,' it added. 'The United States will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.' The talks came less than two weeks after a contentious Oval Office meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky late last month. The outcome Tuesday marks a major reprieve for Ukraine after Trump and Vice President Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for U.S. support, and holding 'no cards' in negotiations to end the war. Trump had remained vague on what exactly Ukraine needed to do to restore US military and intelligence support, which Trump halted in the wake of Zelensky's explosive White House visit. 'I want them to want peace... They haven't shown it to extent they should,' Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. The bilateral talks in Jeddah signaled a rapprochement. Among the restored military aid included $4 billion in the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), a fund that allows the U.S. to send Ukraine military materials directly from Department of Defense stocks. In the joint U.S.-Ukraine statement, the Ukrainians 'reiterated the Ukrainian people’s strong gratitude to President Trump, the U.S. Congress, and the people of the United States for making possible meaningful progress toward peace.' The statement also noted that the U.S. and Ukraine agreed to name their negotiating teams and immediately begin talks toward an 'enduring peace that provides for Ukraine’s long-term security.' The U.S. 'committed to discussing these specific proposals' with Russia, and the Ukrainian delegation 'reiterated that European partners shall be involved in the peace process.' The joint statement also referenced a minerals deal between Ukraine and the U.S., though negotiators said it was not a focus of Tuesday's meeting. 'Both countries’ presidents agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine’s critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine’s economy and guarantee Ukraine’s long-term prosperity and security,' the statement read. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz led the U.S. delegation. The Ukrainian delegation included Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Zelensky, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. Yermak and Sybiha wore suits, in contrast to Zelensky, who was criticized by Trump allies over his attire in the Oval Office, wearing war-time shirt and pants. Waltz said after the meeting that the Ukrainians are 'ready for peace.' Rubio said the U.S. would communicate the ceasefire deal to the Russians and warned that if they refuse, they’ll be viewed as the impediment to peace. 'Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking, and now it'll be up to them [Russia] to say yes or no,' Rubio said. 'I hope they're going to say yes, and if they do, then I think we've made great progress. If they say no, then we'll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is.' Noticeably absent from the meeting was Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s point man on talks with Moscow and one of his closest confidantes. Witkoff, also the president’s special envoy for the Middle East, reportedly traveled to Qatar for ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas at the time of the Jeddah meeting. He is expected to travel to Moscow later this week, a source familiar told NewsNation, but cautioned the envoy’s schedule is fluid.

Middle East latest: Israeli fire kills 8 Palestinians in Gaza Str...	Israeli fire has killed eight people in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, Palestinian officials said, even as a fragile ceasefire with Hamas has largely held. Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians who the army says had approached its troops or entered unauthorized areas in violation of the January truce. Israel last week suspended supplies of goods and electricity to the territory of more than 2 million Palestinians as it tries to pressure the militant group to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. That phase ended March 1. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. Here's the latest: US cautious about peace prospects in Syria The White House is circumspect about the prospects for a peaceful Syria after clashes erupted last week that left hundreds dead. Monitoring groups said hundreds of civilians were killed in the clashes that broke out last week. Revenge attacks primarily targeted members of the Alawite religious minority to which ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad belongs. White House National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt said Tuesday that the attacks on religious minorities have raised concerns in the administration 'about whether Syria’s interim governing authorities are ready to include a religiously and ethnically diverse population, and whether the interim authorities even have the legitimacy to do so.' Syria’s interim government signed a deal Monday with the Kurdish-led authority that controls the country’s northeast, including a ceasefire and the merging of the main U.S.-backed force there into the Syrian army. 'Achieving a resolution at the negotiating table is preferable to achieving it on the battlefield and the United States will continue to watch Syria and the decisions its leaders make,' Hewitt added. An Israeli airstrike kills 4 in Gaza Palestinian first responders say an Israeli airstrike killed four people, including two brothers, in the Gaza Strip. The Civil Defense, which operates under the Hamas-run government, said Tuesday’s strike was carried out near the Netzarim corridor, where Israeli forces had carved out a military zone bisecting the territory before withdrawing from the area as part of a fragile ceasefire. The Israeli military said it carried out an airstrike against a group of militants 'engaged in suspicious activity.' The fragile ceasefire has held since it began on Jan. 19, even as Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians. Israel says it has struck Palestinians who approached its troops, entered unauthorized areas or otherwise violated the terms of the truce. Palestinians say settlers attacked a garage in West Bank Palestinians say settlers attacked a garage in the occupied West Bank overnight, torching three cars. Rafaat Sabah, the owner of the garage, said the attack overnight was not the first. He said settlers had broken into his garage previously and stolen oil, tools and other things. This time they set fire to cars belonging to his customers, he said. The Israeli military said it was investigating the incident. Marwan Sabah, head of the Umm Safa village council, said settlers have recently brought livestock to graze on village lands with the aim of eventually taking them over. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence, including settler attacks on Palestinians, since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip ignited the war there. Over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship live in well over 100 settlements across the West Bank, ranging from hilltop outposts to fully-developed suburbs. The territory’s 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority administering cities and towns. Funeral held for a Palestinian struck by an Israeli military vehicle Palestinians held a funeral on Tuesday for a 32-year-old man who died after being struck by an Israeli military vehicle in the volatile West Bank city of Jenin. The military described Monday’s incident as an accident, saying the man rode a motorcycle into an intersection where it collided with the military vehicle. Israel has been carrying out a major military operation in Jenin in recent weeks that it says is aimed at rooting out militants. Palestinians view such operations as a way of cementing Israeli control over the territory, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Israeli official says violence in Syria amounts to ‘ethnic cleansing’ Israel’s deputy foreign minister said Tuesday that deadly sectarian violence in neighboring Syria amounted to 'ethnic cleansing' and said Israel was working to prevent a threat along its border from Syria’s new 'jihadi regime.' 'Israel is committed to preventing what we saw in Syria this weekend from happening on our border,' Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel said at a news conference in Jerusalem. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said 1,130 people were killed in the clashes, including 830 civilians, most of them from ousted leader Bashar Assad's Alawite community. The Associated Press could not independently verify these numbers. Since Islamist-led insurgents ousted Assad in December, Israel has voiced concern that the group could seize Syrian military assets and use them against it, or that instability could spill over into its territory. Israel has deployed troops inside a buffer zone and vowed to prevent the new Syrian forces from entering the area south of Damascus. On Tuesday, the Israeli military said its fighter jets struck military targets in southern Syria, including radars and equipment. 3 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank The Palestinian Health Ministry says three Palestinians, including a 58-year-old woman, were killed by Israeli fire in the volatile West Bank city of Jenin on Tuesday. The Israeli military said troops killed two militants in an exchange of fire in Jenin and arrested 10 others. It said its forces eliminated a third militant who had fired at them during the operation and destroyed two vehicles loaded with weapons. Israel launched a large-scale military operation centered on Jenin shortly after reaching a fragile ceasefire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip in January. Troops have destroyed homes and infrastructure, and tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled their homes across the northern West Bank. 4 killed in Gaza in the past 24 hours, Palestinian officials say The Gaza Health Ministry says four people have been killed by Israeli fire and another 14 wounded over the past 24 hours. The ministry said Tuesday that rescuers had also retrieved 32 bodies from under the rubble. The four killed included three brothers hit by a drone strike in central Gaza on Monday and a woman killed by a drone strike Tuesday in the southern city of Rafah, the ministry said. The latest deaths brought the overall Palestinian death toll from the war to 48,503. More than 110,000 people have been wounded, according to the ministry. The ministry says women and children make up most of the dead but does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its toll. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 people.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-fire-kills-4-palestinians-in-gaza-strip-3-in-the-occupied-west-bank/	2025-03-11T06:17:31-07:00	
Ukraine-US talks on ending war with Russia start in Saudi Arabia ...	JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Senior officials from Ukraine and the United States opened talks Tuesday on how to end Moscow’s three-year war against Kyiv, hours after Russian air defenses shot down 343 Ukrainian drones in the biggest such attack since the Kremlin ordered the full-scale invasion of its neighbor. Three people were killed and 18 were injured, including three children, in the massive drone attack that spanned 10 Russian regions, officials said. Russia, meanwhile, launched 126 Shahed and other drones and a ballistic missile at Ukraine on Tuesday, the Ukrainian air force said, as part of Moscow's relentless pounding of civilian areas during the war. In the Red Sea port city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, journalists briefly entered a room where a senior Ukrainian delegation met with America’s top diplomat for talks on ending Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio smiled for the cameras and when asked what his expectations for the meeting were, he gave a thumbs up and replied, 'Good.' Across the table, Ukrainian officials, including the country's top diplomat and defense chief, sat without any facial expressions as the meeting got underway at a luxury hotel. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian or U.S. officials on the drone attack. However, Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak, who was also taking part in the talks, told reporters that the most important thing was 'how to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.' He said security guarantees were important to prevent Russia from invading again in the future. In 2014, Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine and threw its weight behind pro-Kremlin militias in eastern Ukraine. They seized large swaths of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and fought against Kyiv’s forces for the following eight years. Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister was also on hand as American, Saudi and Ukrainian flags stood in the background. Officials did not answer any of the shouted questions. The delegations met for about three hours in the morning before taking a break, and officials said the talks would continue in the afternoon. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the United States will inform Russia about the results of the Jeddah talks, which he described as 'normal practice.' Talks bring a chance to mend US-Ukraine relations The meeting in Jeddah offered an opportunity for Kyiv officials to repair Ukraine’s relationship with the Trump administration after an unprecedented argument erupted during President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s Feb. 28 visit to the White House. Critically, Ukraine needs to persuade Washington to end the U.S. suspension of military aid and some intelligence sharing after the Oval Office blowout. U.S. officials have said that positive talks in Jeddah could mean it may be only a short suspension. Ukrainian officials told The Associated Press on Monday that they will propose a ceasefire covering the Black Sea, which would bring safer shipping, as well as long-range missile strikes that have hit civilians in Ukraine, and the release of prisoners. The two senior officials said Kyiv is also ready to sign an agreement with the United States on access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals — a deal that U.S. President Donald Trump is keen to secure. While traveling to Jeddah, Rubio said the U.S. delegation would not be proposing any specific measures to secure an end to the conflict but rather wanted to hear from Ukraine about what they would be willing to consider. 'I’m not going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do,' Rubio told reporters accompanying him. 'I think we want to listen to see how far they’re willing to go and then compare that to what the Russians want and see how far apart we truly are.' Rubio said the rare earths and critical minerals deal could be signed during the meeting but stressed it was not a precondition for the United States to move ahead with discussions with either Ukraine or the Russians. He said it may make more sense to take some time to negotiate the precise details of the agreement, which is now a broad memorandum of understanding that leaves out many specifics. The Kremlin is sticking to its conditions for peace The Kremlin has not publicly offered any concessions. Russia has said it’s ready to cease hostilities on condition that Ukraine drops its bid to join NATO and recognizes regions that Moscow occupies as Russian. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine's territory since the war began. Russian forces have held the battlefield momentum for more than a year, though at a high cost in infantry and armor, and are pushing at selected points along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region, against Ukraine's understrength and weary army. Ukraine has invested heavily in developing its arms industry, especially high-tech drones that have reached deep into Russia. Most of the Ukrainian drones fired overnight — 126 of them — were shot down over the Kursk region across the border from Ukraine, parts of which Kyiv’s forces control, and 91 were shot down over the Moscow region, according to a statement by Russia's Defense Ministry. Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said over 70 drones targeted the Russian capital and were shot down as they were flying toward it — the biggest single attack on Moscow so far in the war. The governor of the Moscow region surrounding the capital, Andrei Vorobyov, said the attack damaged several residential buildings and a number of cars. Flights were temporarily restricted in and out of six airports, including Domodedovo, Vnukovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovsky just outside Moscow, and airports in the Yaroslavl and Nizhny Novgorod regions. ___ Associated Press writer Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-at-least-60-ukrainian-drones-shot-down-over-moscow-in-a-massive-attack-citys-mayor-says/	2025-03-11T05:56:17-07:00	
Ukraine will propose a limited ceasefire during talks with the US...	JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — A Ukrainian delegation set to meet with America’s top diplomat in Saudi Arabia about ending the 3-year war with Russia will propose a ceasefire covering the Black Sea and long-range missile strikes, as well as the release of prisoners, two senior Ukrainian officials said Monday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about Tuesday’s meeting, also told The Associated Press that the Ukrainian delegation is ready during the talks to sign an agreement with the United States on access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals — a deal that U.S. President Donald Trump is keen to secure. The officials discussed the confidence-building measures, with no further details, ahead of the Ukrainian negotiating team's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jeddah. Kyiv is trying to repair the damage done when Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Feb. 28 visit to Washington descended into an Oval Office argument with Trump and Vice President JD Vance. At stake is the military aid and intelligence previously offered by the United States that had helped Ukraine in the war but is now paused as Washington pushes for a peace agreement. Rubio and Zelenskyy landed a few hours apart Monday in Saudi Arabia, but did not meet. Zelenskyy met with the kingdom’s powerful crown prince Monday evening, with the president saying they 'had a detailed discussion on the steps and conditions needed to end the war and secure a reliable and lasting peace.' 'Saudi Arabia provides a crucial platform for diplomacy, and we appreciate this,' Zelenskyy said online. Rubio also met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, thanking him for hosting the talks and also discussing Yemen's Houthi rebels, who are threatening to restart their attacks in the Red Sea. Speaking to reporters aboard his plane before arriving, Rubio said he and national security adviser Mike Waltz would take stock of Ukraine’s responses in Saudi Arabia. If Ukraine and the U.S. reach an understanding acceptable to Trump, that could accelerate his administration’s push to peace talks. 'What we want to know is, are they interested entering some sort of peace conversation and general outlines of the kinds of things they could consider, recognizing that it has been a costly and bloody war for the Ukrainians. They have suffered greatly and their people have suffered greatly,' Rubio said. 'And it’s hard in the aftermath of something like that to even talk about concessions, but that’s the only way this is going to end and prevent more suffering.' He added: 'I’m not going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do. I think we want to listen to see how far they’re willing to go and then compare that to what the Russians want and see how far apart we truly are.' Zelenskyy has said his team meeting Rubio will include his chief of staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. Rubio will lead the U.S. team. The rest of Europe remains skeptical about the talks as it has been sidelined by Washington. The European Union last week agreed to boost the continent’s defenses and to free up hundreds of billions of euros for security in response to the Trump administration's shift in stance on Ukraine. White House special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News on Monday that the pause of U.S. intelligence-sharing with Ukraine has not limited defense intelligence-sharing. 'We never shut off intelligence for ... anything defensive that the Ukrainians need,' Witkoff said. A pause on sharing U.S. intelligence that can be used for offensive purposes by Ukrainian forces remains in effect, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official suggested that progress could be made toward reinstating intelligence-sharing with Ukraine during the Saudi talks. ___ Arhirova reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Israel cuts off electricity supply to Gaza, affecting a desalinat...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, officials said Sunday, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory. Hamas called it part of Israel's 'starvation policy.' Israel last week suspended supplies of goods to the territory of more than 2 million Palestinians, an echo of the siege it imposed in the earliest days of the war. Israel is pressing the militant group to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. That phase ended last weekend. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. The militant group — which has warned that discontinuing supplies would affect the hostages — said Sunday that it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position. Israel has said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday in an effort to 'advance' the negotiations. Israel had warned when it stopped all supplies that water and electricity could be next. The letter from Israel's energy minister to the Israel Electric Corporation tells it to stop selling power to Gaza. The territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated, and most facilities, including hospitals, now use generators. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam said that Israel has 'practically' cut off electricity since the war began and called the latest decision part of Israel's 'starvation policy, in clear disregard for all international laws and norms.' The desalination plant was providing 18,000 cubic meters of water per day for central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah area, according to Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement. Executive director Tania Hary said that it's expected to run on generators and produce around 2,500 cubic meters per day, about the amount in an Olympic swimming pool. Israel’s restrictions on fuel entering Gaza have a larger impact, Hary said, and water shortages are a looming issue, because fuel is needed for distribution trucks. Israel has faced sharp criticism over suspending supplies. 'Any denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,' the U.N. human rights office said Friday. The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used 'starvation as a method of warfare' when it issued an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. The allegation is central to South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide. Israel has denied the accusations, saying it has allowed in enough aid and blaming shortages on what it called the United Nations' inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid. The leader of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels off Yemen would resume within four days if aid doesn't resume to Gaza. The Houthis described their earlier attacks as solidarity with Palestinians there. The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies. US envoy describes talks with Hamas The White House on Wednesday made the surprise confirmation of direct U.S. talks with Hamas. On Sunday, envoy Adam Boehler told Israeli broadcaster Kan that Hamas has suggested a truce of five to 10 years while it would disarm. The militant group has previously called disarming unacceptable. A senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss contacts with the U.S., said that the group had expressed its longstanding position that it would lay down its arms in return for a 'fair and just solution' that includes an independent Palestinian state. Boehler also told CNN that 'I think you could see something like a long-term truce, where we forgive prisoners, where Hamas lays down their arms, where they agree they’re not part of the political party going forward. I think that’s a reality. It’s real close.' When asked if he would speak with the militant group again, Boehler replied, 'You never know.' He added: 'I think something could come together within weeks,' and expressed hope for a deal that would see all hostages released, not only American ones. Boehler has said four of the five American hostages in Gaza are dead, with Edan Alexander alive. Hamas on Sunday didn't mention the talks, but reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections. Hamas’ attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Many Israelis are pressing for a deal to bring everyone home. 'We are here to send a clear message to the Israeli government: stop stalling,' Zahiro Shahar Mor, nephew of slain hostage Avraham Munder, said in front of tents set up outside Israel’s defense ministry in one demonstration. Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t say how many of the dead were militants. With the cutoff of supplies to Gaza, Palestinians are reporting sharp price increases for dwindling items during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 'Since the ceasefire began, the situation has improved a little. But before that, the situation was very bad,' said Fares al-Qeisi in the southern city of Khan Younis. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Follow developments at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-says-it-is-cutting-off-its-electricity-supply-to-gaza/	2025-03-09T17:28:44-07:00	
Russian forces walked inside a gas pipeline to strike Ukrainian t...	LONDON (AP) — Russian special forces walked inside a gas pipeline to strike Ukrainian units from the rear in the Kursk region, Ukraine’s military and Russian war bloggers reported, as Moscow claimed fresh gains in its push to recapture parts of the border province that Kyiv seized in a shock offensive. Ukraine launched a daring cross-border incursion into Kursk in August, marking the largest attack on Russian territory since World War II. Within days, Ukrainian units had captured 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of territory, including the strategic border town of Sudzha, and taken hundreds of Russian prisoners of war. According to Kyiv, the operation aimed to gain a bargaining chip in future peace talks and to force Russia to divert troops away from its grinding offensive in eastern Ukraine. But months after Ukraine’s thunder run, its soldiers in Kursk are weary and bloodied by relentless assaults of more than 50,000 troops, including some from Russian ally North Korea. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers are at risk of being encircled, open-source maps of the battlefield show. According to Telegram posts late Saturday by a Ukrainian-born, pro-Kremlin blogger, Russian operatives walked about 15 kilometers (9 miles) inside the pipeline, which Moscow had until recently used to send gas to Europe. Some Russian troops spent several days in the pipe before striking Ukrainian units from the rear near Sudzha, blogger Yuri Podolyaka claimed. The town had some 5,000 residents before the full-scale February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and it houses major gas transfer and measuring stations along the pipeline, which was once a major outlet for Russian natural gas exports through Ukrainian territory. Another war blogger, who uses the alias Two Majors, said fierce fighting was underway for Sudzha, and that Russian forces managed to enter the town through a gas pipeline. Russian Telegram channels showed photos of what they said were special forces operatives, wearing gas masks and moving along what looked like the inside of a large pipe. Ukraine’s General Staff confirmed Saturday evening that Russian 'sabotage and assault groups' used the pipeline in a bid to gain a foothold outside Sudzha. In a Telegram post, it said Russian troops were 'detected in a timely manner' and that Ukraine responded with rockets and artillery. 'At present, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. The enemy’s losses in Sudzha are very high,' the General Staff reported. A third Russian war blogger argued that the attacking force lacked the logistical backup to succeed. 'Food, water, ammunition, communications, charging electrical devices, power banks, the approach of the main forces, evacuating the wounded … Two or three groups in the rear without all this — that’s a disaster,' the blogger, who describes himself as a soldier with the call sign Thirteenth, wrote on Telegram. The Associated Press could not independently verify the accounts. The Russian Defense Ministry reported Sunday that its troops had taken four villages north and northwest of Sudzha, with the closest lying some 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from the center of the town. The claim came a day after the ministry reported the capture of three more villages near Sudzha. Ukraine did not immediately comment on the Russian claims. Trump questions Ukraine's survival, while France announces new aid package Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday that Ukraine 'may not survive' as he continued to withhold American arms and intelligence in an effort to force Kyiv into peace negotiations with its invader. In an interview with Fox News Channel’s 'Sunday Morning Futures,' Trump was asked about a warning from Polish President Andrzej Duda 'that without American support, Ukraine will not survive' and whether he was 'comfortable' with that outcome. He replied, 'Well, it may not survive anyway.' He added, 'But we have some weaknesses with Russia. You know, it takes two.' In other developments, French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu said Sunday that France will use profits from frozen Russian assets to finance an additional 195 million euros ($211 million) in arms for Ukraine, the latest in a series of military aid deliveries funded through the assets. In an interview with the La Tribune Dimanche newspaper, Lecornu said Paris will send new 155 mm artillery shells and glide bombs for Mirage 2000 fighter jets it previously gave to Ukraine. Ukrainian drones said to target Russian oil infrastructure Elsewhere, Russian officials and Telegram channels reported that Ukrainian drones targeted oil infrastructure in southern and central Russia overnight into early Sunday. One drone struck an oil depot in Cheboksary, a Russian city on the Volga River about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the border, the local governor reported. According to Oleg Nikolaev, nobody was hurt, but the depot needed reconstruction work. Footage circulated on Russian Telegram channels of what appeared to be a fire at or near one of Russia's largest oil refineries, in the southern city of Ryazan. Shot, a news channel on Telegram, cited local residents as saying they heard several nighttime blasts near the refinery. The local governor, Pavel Malkov, said Ukrainian drones had been shot down nearby. He claimed there had been no casualties or damage. Ukraine did not immediately comment on either incident. Satellite internet fuels sharp social media exchange Concerns that Elon Musk could turn off Starlink satellite internet service to Ukraine prompted a sharp exchange Sunday on X involving Musk, the Polish foreign minister and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski wrote that if Musk's rocket company SpaceX, which runs Starlink, 'proves to be an unreliable provider,' Poland 'will be forced to look for other suppliers.' Musk told Sikorski: 'Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink.' Rubio told Sikorski: 'No one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink. And say thank you because without Starlink, Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now.' In fact, Russians are already on the border with Poland because the Russian region of Kaliningrad lies on Poland’s northern border. The back-and-forth between the three concluded with Sikorski thanking Rubio: 'Thank you, Marco, for confirming that the brave soldiers of Ukraine can count on the vital internet service provided jointly by the U.S and Poland. Together, Europe and the United States can help Ukraine to achieve a just peace.' ___ Associated Press writers Sylvie Corbet in Paris and Zeke Miller in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-uses-a-gas-pipeline-to-strike-at-ukrainian-troops-from-the-rear-in-kursk/	2025-03-09T12:27:38-07:00	
State Dept using AI to ban visas over perceived pro-Hamas posts	(NewsNation) — The State Department will launch a program using artificial intelligence that will revoke visas of foreign students the technology perceives as supporters of Hamas or other U.S.-designated terror groups. Axios reported the plan Thursday, citing State Department officials. The 'Catch and Revoke' initiative, started under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, will use AI to scan and review tens of thousands of student visa holders’ social media accounts, the outlet reported. Aid operations in Gaza imperiled as millions of promised USAID dollars do not arrive The technology will look for any posts or documentation that shows support for Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel but also anything that shows participation in anti-war or pro-Palestinan demonstrations. Axios reported that the department is also checking news reports of anti-Israel demonstrations and Jewish students' lawsuits that highlight foreign nationals allegedly engaged in antisemitic activity without consequence. The State Department is working with the departments of Justice and Homeland Security in a 'whole of government and whole of authority approach,' according to the outlet. Several civil and constitutional rights groups have called out the plan, citing free speech concerns. 'AI tools are emerging technologies, not trusted experts on the limits of protected speech under the First Amendment. They cannot be relied on to parse the nuances of expression about complex and contested matters like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,' the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression said in a statement. A charity kitchen brings hope to displaced Palestinians in the West Bank during Ramadan The group adds that the plan will 'undoubtedly encourage self-censorship on our nation’s campuses.' Abed Ayoub, head of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, also sounded the alarm, saying, 'This should concern all Americans. This is a First Amendment and freedom of speech issue, and the administration will overplay its hand… Americans won't like this. They'll view this as capitulating free speech rights for a foreign nation,' he told Axios. The move appears to fall in line with President Donald Trump’s pledge to deport non-citizen college students and others who took part in pro-Palestinian protests. 'Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or arrested,' Trump said Tuesday. The Trump administration announced Friday that he would immediately pull about $400 million in federal grants and contracts from Columbia University, citing the school's alleged 'continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.' The university had been at the center of college protests in which demonstrators demanded an end to U.S. support for Israel due to the civilian deaths and humanitarian crisis caused by Israel's assault on Gaza. There were allegations of antisemitism and Islamophobia in protests and counterprotests.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/state-dept-using-ai-to-ban-visas-over-perceived-pro-hamas-posts/	2025-03-07T15:14:57-08:00	
The Latest: Trump considering pressure on Russia and seeking deal...	President Donald Trump said he’s 'strongly considering' sanctions and tariffs on Russia in hopes of forcing a settlement to the war in Ukraine. Trump also sent a letter to Iran’s leaders seeking to negotiate a nuclear deal. In economic news, uncertainty in world markets continues after Trump declared a weeks-long delay of tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada. And as Trump's dismantling of the federal government continues, billionaire Elon Musk is telling Republicans he’s not to blame for the firings of thousands of workers. Meanwhile, the Pentagon’s diversity purge includes removing 26,000 images including photos of the Enola Gay aircraft that hastened the end of World War II by bombing Japan. Here's the latest: Trump’s interior and energy secretaries cheer natural gas exports Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright held a pep rally for expansion plans at a massive liquefied natural gas facility in Louisiana. Venture Global estimated that its $18 billion LNG expansion would enable exports of up to 20 million tons a year to Asia and Europe and generate 8.5 million tons of planet-warming emissions. There’s strong local opposition. Watchdogs say Venture Global violated its permits thousands of times by flaring gas and releasing chemicals. Former Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm warned that 'unfettered exports' could drive up gas prices for U.S. consumers. But Burgum told reporters Thursday: 'We can absolutely do both — we can sell energy to our friends and allies, we can lower the cost at home.' ▶ Read more about Trump’s energy policy Why should America worry about Trump? Try the price of eggs, say some Democrats As their party struggles to navigate the early days of Donald Trump’s second presidency, some Democrats are convinced their road to recovery lies in blaming Trump for the price of eggs, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture expects to rise 41% this year. Democratic officials shared new internal data showing voters are most worried about inflation and the cost of living. Democracy itself, by contrast, ranked No. 12. The party establishment’s focus on blaming Trump for inflation is a break with activists trying to mobilize against what they see as an existential threat — that Trump is a budding dictator has no regard for the Constitution. Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, who helped coordinate nationwide protests that put House Republicans on defense, said 'bored, tired talking points' won’t stop authoritarianism: 'It’s 2025 — this isn’t how politics works anymore.' ▶ Read more about the Democratic Party’s messaging Homeland Security ends collective bargaining agreement with TSA staffers In a major attack on worker rights, the Department of Homeland Security says it’s ending the collective bargaining agreement with the tens of thousands of frontline employees at the Transportation Security Administration who are responsible for keeping weapons and explosives off airplanes and protecting air travel. The department’s announcement Friday says poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job, and that the contract was hindering the ability of the organization 'to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe.' ▶ Read more on developments with the TSA and its union White House economist praises job numbers, noting that mass firings aren’t yet counted The director of the White House National Economic Council is cheering Friday’s report: U.S. employers added solid 151,000 jobs last month. Kevin Hassett said that’s 'really, really impressive' while noting that the mass federal firings Trump has championed likely won’t be reflected in jobs figures until next month or later. Hassett acknowledged that the Biden administration had 'some strong jobs numbers' too, but asserted that they were based on government employment, while Trump has promoted manufacturing and the private sector. The report came in below the 160,000 jobs economists had expected for last month. Unemployment also rose slightly, to 4.1%. Federal judge in DC won’t block DOGE from Treasury systems A separate court order out of New York still puts limits on what Elon Musk ’s team can do inside the Treasury Department’s systems, however. In Washington, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly previously restricted DOGE to two employees with read-only access. She declined Friday to grant a longer-term block, however. Her decision comes in a lawsuit filed by retirees and unions who fear DOGE’s activities could expose sensitive information. Kollar-Kotelly found that concerns about DOGE are 'understandable and no doubt widely shared,' but she hasn’t yet seen evidence of serious legal harm that would justify barring the team. She invited plaintiffs to return if more immediate risks emerge. Immigration judges quit, straining system backlogged with 3.7 million cases A labor union says 85 immigration courts employees have accepted Trump’s financial incentives to resign. They include 18 judges, one assistant chief immigration judge and 66 support staff in a court system that typically takes years to decide each asylum claim. Shortly after Trump took office in January, the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review fired 20 judges without explanation, according to the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers. 'This makes no sense,' said Matt Biggs, the union president. 'Immigration judges are hard to replace given their specialized knowledge and legal experience. It takes at least a year to recruit, hire, train and conduct a background check on a new judge.' Trump raises possibility of pressuring Russia Trump said he is 'strongly considering' sanctions and tariffs on Russia in hopes of forcing a settlement to the war in Ukraine. He said in a post on Truth Social that they could remain in place 'until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED.' The post came as Trump faces criticism for increasing pressure on Ukraine to reach a deal while downplaying or even denying Russia’s responsibility for starting the war with its invasion three years ago. 'To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late,' Trump added. Thrust into unemployment, axed federal workers face relatives who celebrate their firing Scrambling to replace their health insurance and to find new work, some laid-off federal workers are running into another unexpected unpleasantry: Relatives cheering their firing. The country’s bitterly tribal politics are spilling into text chains, social media posts and heated conversations as Americans absorb the reality of the government’s cost-cutting measures. Expecting sympathy, some axed workers are finding family and friends who instead are steadfast in their support of what they see as a bloated government’s waste. 'I’ve been treated as a public enemy by the government and now it’s bleeding into my own family,' says 24-year-old Luke Tobin, who was fired last month from his job as a technician with the U.S. Forest Service in Idaho’s Nez Perce National Forest. ▶ Read more about the DOGE cuts’ effects on families Trump says he’s sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader over its advancing nuclear program Trump’s comments about the letter to Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei were not immediately confirmed by the supreme leader. Trump made the comments in an interview aired Friday by Fox Business News. The White House confirmed Trump’s comments, saying he sent a letter to Iran’s leaders seeking to negotiate a nuclear deal. Trump made the comments in an interview that will air fully Sunday. Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported on Trump’s comments, citing the broadcast.

Here’s a look at how some EU leaders responded: 1. 'We are loyal and faithful allies,' French President Emmanuel Macron said late Thursday, expressing 'respect and friendship' toward U.S. leaders and adding that France was 'entitled to expect the same.' 2. Māris Riekstins, Latvia’s ambassador to NATO, stressed the military alliance remained the most important platform for addressing transatlantic security issues. He emphasized the commitment from his country — which shares a nearly 300-kilometer (186-mile) border with Russia — to defense spending. 3. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country would raise defense spending to reach NATO’s target faster than previously committed. But he did not specify when the eurozone’s fourth-largest economy — and NATO laggard — would hit the 2% of GDP military spending target. ▶ Read more about how EU leaders discussed NATO World Trade Organization chief says US concerns on tariffs need to be heard WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said it’s important for U.S. trade partners not to panic and engage in tit-for-tat measures but to embrace dialogue in reaction to Trump’s threats in recent days to impose tariffs. Okonjo-Iweala preferred to describe the threats and reversals as 'disruptions.'

U.S. District Judge Amir Ali described the partial payment as a 'concrete' first step he wanted to see from the administration, which is fighting multiple lawsuits seeking to roll back the administration’s dismantling of USAID and a six-week freeze on USAID funding. The ruling came a day after a divided Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration’s bid to freeze funding that flowed through USAID. The high court instructed Ali to clarify what the government must do to comply with his earlier order requiring the quick release of funds for work that had already been done. Ali’s line of questioning in a four-hour hearing Thursday suggested skepticism of the Trump administration’s argument that presidents have wide authority to override congressional decisions on spending when it comes to foreign policy. ▶ Read more about the court hearing over State Department debts Trump delayed some tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but says ‘reciprocal’ tariffs will start April 2 President Donald Trump on Thursday postponed 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war.

Russia bombards Ukraine's energy grid after Zelenskyy says his te...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in a large-scale missile and drone bombardment during the night, officials said Friday, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that talks with the U.S. on ending the three-year war will take place next week. Ukraine came under a 'massive missile and drone' attack, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. At least 10 people, including a child, were wounded, authorities said. 'Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians by striking energy and gas production facilities, without abandoning its goal of leaving us without light and heat, and causing the greatest harm to ordinary citizens,' Halushchenko wrote. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s power grid during the war. The attacks have depleted electricity generation capacity and disrupted critical heating and water supplies. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of 'weaponizing winter' in an effort to erode civilian morale. Zelenskyy on Friday won the support of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for Ukraine's proposals to take some first steps toward stopping the war, including a halt on firing missiles, drones and bombs at energy and other civilian infrastructure. Zelenskyy has also proposed ceasing combat operations in the Black Sea to allow safe shipping. Erdogan said that he also wants the shooting to stop without delay. 'We support the idea of an immediate ceasefire and the cessation of attacks in the air and at sea as a confidence-building measure between the parties,' he said in a video call with European leaders. Zelenskyy first suggested those initial steps in a post on X on Tuesday, when he said that he was ready to work under U.S. President Donald Trump’s 'strong leadership' to get a lasting peace, and has put them to Ukraine's European allies. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that the energy supply is a legitimate target in the war, because it's 'linked with Ukraine’s military industrial complex and weapons production.' Russian air defenses downed 39 Ukrainian drones overnight, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Ukraine’s largest private gas producer, DTEK, said that the overnight bombardment in the Odesa region was Russia’s sixth attack in the past two and a half weeks on its facilities. Russia fired 67 missiles from air, land and sea, and launched 194 strike and decoy drones, Ukraine’s air force said. Their primary target was Ukraine’s natural gas extraction facilities, it said. For the first time, Ukraine deployed French Mirage-2000 warplanes delivered a month ago to help repel the attack, according to the air force. Ukraine also has Western-supplied F-16 fighter jets to shoot down Russian missiles. Ukrainian defenses downed 34 missiles and 100 drones, the air force said, while up to 10 missiles didn’t reach their targets and 86 drones were lost from radars, presumably jammed by electronic warfare. Western-supplied air defense systems are crucial for Ukraine’s fight, but further U.S. help is uncertain under Trump, who says he's determined to end the war and has paused American military aid for Kyiv as a way of pressuring Zelenskyy to negotiate. In his nightly address, Zelenskyy said Thursday that he would travel to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet with the country’s crown prince, and his team would stay on to hold talks with U.S. officials. Zelenskyy welcomed a European Union plan to bolster the continent’s defenses. He expressed hope that some of the new spending could be used to strengthen Ukraine’s own defense industry. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-bombards-ukraines-energy-grid-after-zelenskyy-says-hell-hold-talks-with-us/	2025-03-07T04:41:45-08:00	
Aid efforts in Gaza slow as millions of promised USAID dollars do...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Trump administration’s cuts to USAID have frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in contractual payments to aid groups, leaving them paying out of pocket to preserve a fragile ceasefire, according to officials from the U.S. humanitarian agency. The cutbacks threaten to halt the small gains aid workers have made combatting Gaza’s humanitarian crisis during the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. They also could endanger the tenuous truce, which the Trump administration helped cement. USAID was supposed to fund much of the aid to Gaza as the ceasefire progressed, and the Trump administration approved over $383 million on Jan. 31 to that end, according to three USAID officials. But since then, there have been no confirmed payments to any partners in the Middle East, they said. The officials, who have survived multiple rounds of furloughs, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Two senior officials at aid organizations confirmed they have not received any of the promised funds, after spending millions of dollars on supplies and services. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the issue and of their work in Gaza, said they could not afford to continue aid operations indefinitely. Some organizations have already reported laying off workers and scaling down operations, according to internal USAID information shared with The Associated Press. That could imperil the ceasefire, under which Hamas is supposed to release hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners and ramping up the entry of humanitarian assistance. 'The U.S. established very specific, concrete commitments for aid delivery under the ceasefire, and there is no way ... to fulfill those as long as the funding freeze is in place,' said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International and a former USAID official. USAID has been one of the biggest targets of a broad campaign by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to slash the size of the federal government. USAID payments frozen, some NGOs scale down Gaza response Before Trump took office, USAID had roughly $446 million to disburse to partner organizations in Gaza in 2025, the USAID officials said. But after Trump froze global foreign assistance, USAID’s Gaza team had to submit a waiver to ensure the funds for Gaza aid could continue to flow. They received approval Jan. 31 to secure over $383 million in funding, less than two weeks after the U.S.-brokered ceasefire was reached. Some $40 million was subsequently cut under a measure that no money be provided for aid in the form of direct cash assistance. USAID then signed contracts with eight partner organizations, including prominent NGOs and U.N. agencies, awarding them money to flood supplies and services into Gaza. Then, the officials said, they began hearing that organizations were not receiving the promised payments — even as they had already spent millions, expecting USAID reimbursement. Some of those organizations are now spending less and scaling back programs. The International Medical Corps, a global nonprofit that partners with the World Health Organization and provides medical and development assistance, was awarded $12 million to continue operations at two hospitals in Gaza. These include the largest field hospital in Gaza, whose construction was funded by USAID at the request of the Israeli government, according to internal USAID information. The freeze has forced the organization to lay off some 700 staff members and offer only basic services at the hospitals, with a skeletal crew, said one USAID official. A former IMC staffer, who quit citing lack of stability, said the program providing life-saving treatment for malnutrition was significantly scaled down for lack of funds. The former staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the organization’s details, said the current nutrition services were at a minimum level. Another former IMC staffer, who also left recently and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss information not meant to be shared with media, said the USAID cuts have reduced the amount of medical supplies brought into Gaza and led the majority of IMC’s partners to reduce their programming. They said that some organizations have already purchased stocks of medical supplies, food to treat acute malnutrition, lab and medical equipment ready to enter Gaza, but because of the shortfall they have not been able to afford movement of those goods. Meanwhile, termination letters severing the contracts between USAID and Gaza partners were also sent out to organizations that were major providers of shelter, child protection and logistical support in the Gaza aid operation, a USAID official said. Some of the termination letters seen by the AP were signed by new USAID deputy chief Peter Marocco — a returning political appointee from Trump’s first term. They instruct organizations to 'immediately cease' all activities and 'avoid additional spending chargeable to the award,' citing a directive from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. USAID Gaza response in crisis as truce is tenuous In addition to the spending freeze, officials say USAID has been wracked by internal chaos and the introduction of new regulations since the new administration took office. During the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire, Israel had to allow at least 600 trucks of aid into Gaza a day, as well as 60,000 temporary homes and 200,000 tents. Two USAID officials said the agency was originally supposed to buy 400 temporary homes that would make it into Gaza by the end of Phase 1, and over 5,200 more during the next phase. That figure has since been slashed to just over 1,000. USAID was never able to purchase the mobile homes because of newly imposed policies requiring extra approvals for procurements. On Feb. 2, some 40% of the Gaza team was locked out of their email accounts and software necessary to track awards, move payments and communicate with the organizations. An email sent immediately following the lockout came from Gavin Kliger, a DOGE staffer. Access to the servers has now been restored, the officials said, but the team is smaller after waves of layoffs. From an original team of about 30 people, only six or seven remain. Very few mobile homes entered Gaza during Phase 1 of the ceasefire, which ended last week, prompting Hamas to accuse Israel of violating the truce. Since the end of Phase 1, Israel has cut off all aid shipments into Gaza in a bid to pressure Hamas to accept an extension of the ceasefire. That has sent aid groups scrambling to distribute reserves of food and shelter to the most needy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is considering cutting off electricity to raise the pressure on Hamas. With USAID in flux, the U.S. risks losing its influence, said Dave Harden, the former USAID assistant administrator of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Aid and a longtime director of the agency’s work in the Palestinian territories. 'U.S. aid assistance to Palestinians ... never, ever equated to U.S. assistance to Israel, never quite balanced, but always gave us a seat at the table, always helped us to have real discussions with both the Palestinians and the Israelis about what the future might hold,' Harden said. Now, he said, 'We’re just simply not at the table in a meaningful way, and so I think the ceasefire is fragile.' ___ AP correspondents Josef Federman in Jerusalem, Sarah El Deeb in Cairo and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed reporting.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-aid-operations-in-gaza-imperiled-as-millions-of-promised-usaid-dollars-do-not-arrive/	2025-03-07T04:38:45-08:00

Ukraine will struggle to strike targets inside Russia without US ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. decision to stop sharing military intelligence with Ukraine hobbles its ability to strike and defend against the Russian army, and increases the pressure on it to accept a peace deal being pushed by the Trump administration. Earlier in the week, the U.S. suspended weapons shipments – a severe blow, but one that experts said Ukraine could withstand for at least a few months. The suspension of intelligence has a more immediate impact by disrupting Ukraine’s ability to track and target Russian troops, tanks and ships; its other allies lack the same resources to fill the gap. Here are things to know about the U.S. decision and its likely effects: Why did the U.S. stop sharing intelligence with Ukraine? The decision to withhold intelligence – and military aid – came on the heels of a tempestuous White House visit last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance want Zelenskyy to quickly accept a truce with Russia – which now controls one-fifth of his country – and to give up significant mineral rights to the U.S. to help fund any future support for Ukraine. The Trump administration says Ukraine hasn’t demonstrated sufficient willingness to seek peace with Russia, with whom the U.S. has held separate talks to try to bring an end to the war. U.S. officials suggested Wednesday that the withdrawal of intelligence-sharing might only be a temporary measure to expedite truce negotiations, citing more positive talks since the White House blowup. 'We have taken a step back and are pausing and reviewing all aspects of this relationship,' U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz said Wednesday. CIA Director John Ratcliffe called the suspension a 'pause.' Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he is ready to discuss peace, but that any deal must offer his country sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. He has also publicly stated his regrets about the contentious, and televised, White House meeting. Trump administration officials have said the deal for mineral rights would more closely bind the U.S. and Ukraine, giving Russian President Vladimir Putin pause before considering future malign action against Ukraine. How will the lack of U.S. intelligence affect Ukraine? The White House hasn’t specified what aspects of intelligence-sharing have been suspended. But without help from the U.S. – which includes vital data captured by Elon Musk's Starlink satellites – Ukraine’s ability to strike weapons and other targets inside Russia will be severely degraded. Its attacks inside Russian territory – which rely on U.S.-provided longer-range weapons -- have been key in deterring Russia's capabilities and advances. Ukraine relies on U.S. intelligence when operating U.S.-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, and the U.S. Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS. Ukraine also relies on U.S. intelligence as an early warning system to help it defend against Russian long-range missiles and drone strikes. Such intelligence in the war’s early days allowed Ukraine to thwart Putin’s hopes for a quick victory. Before the recent restrictions imposed by the U.S., a rising tempo of Ukrainian strikes inside Russia – such as those targeting stores of ammunition -- relieved pressure on Ukrainian troops on the front lines. It is one of the reasons Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine have slowed in recent weeks, analysts say. Will the U.S. ever share intelligence again with Ukraine? Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said in a Fox News television interview that the suspension of intelligence-sharing could be reversed once Zelenskyy demonstrates to President Trump that he is sufficiently willing to discuss peace with Russia on Trump’s terms. Zelenskyy has said he would like to 'make things right' with Trump, but that does not yet appear to have assuaged the U.S. -- Ukraine’s biggest military backer since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Officials from Ukraine and the U.S. will hold talks next week in Saudi Arabia next week, Zelenskyy said late Thursday. In the meantime, Zelenskyy has been leaning into support from Europe, most of whose leaders are dismayed by the Trump administration’s decision to deprive a key American ally of assistance needed to fight Russia. On Thursday, European Union leaders launched a day of emergency talks to beef up their own security and ensure that Ukraine will still be protected. It’s unclear whether the American suspension affects the intelligence-sharing ties between Ukraine and other Western powers, including four of the Five Eyes, an intelligence sharing coalition of the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia and New Zealand. French defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said in a radio interview Thursday that his country would continue providing military intelligence to Ukraine. And French President Emmanuel Macron said he would talk with EU leaders about the possibility of using France’s nuclear deterrent to protect the continent from Russian threats.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-without-us-intelligence-ukraine-will-struggle-to-strike-targets-inside-russia/	2025-03-06T12:59:12-08:00	
Trump envoy says Ukrainians 'brought it on themselves' after US p...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukraine was given 'fair warning' by the White House before President Donald Trump this week ordered a pause on U.S. military assistance and intelligence sharing with Kyiv, a senior administration official said Thursday. The Republican administration announced the pauses this week after Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy'sOval Office meeting devolved into a shouting match, with the U.S. president and Vice President JD Vance excoriating the Ukrainian leader for being insufficiently grateful for the tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance sent to Ukraine since Russia invaded three years ago. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said the pause is already having an impact on Kyiv, adding that the Ukrainians 'brought it on themselves.' 'The best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,' Kellogg said at an event Thursday at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'You got their attention.' Kellogg said it was made clear to the Ukrainians before last week’s Oval Office meeting that the talks would focus on signing a critical minerals deal. The agreement, which the two sides still have not signed, would give the U.S. access to Ukraine's rare earth deposits and could be of value to U.S. aerospace, electric vehicle and medical manufacturing. Trump administration officials have said the economic pact would bind the U.S. and Ukraine closer together and would give Russian President Vladimir Putin pause before considering malign action against Ukraine in the future. Zelenskyy had been pressing the White House for explicit security guarantees, to no avail. Kellogg said last week's talks went sideways because Zelenskyy pressed Trump — who is trying to play the role of intermediary to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia — to side with Kyiv. Zelenskyy later called the heated words 'regrettable' and said he’s ready to sign an agreement. He told European leaders gathered in Brussels on Thursday he was grateful for their support and said the teams from the U.S. and Ukraine had resumed their work and hoped to have 'a meaningful meeting' next week. 'Ukraine has been seeking peace since the very first second of the war, and we have always said that the only reason why the war continues is because of Russia,' Zelenskyy said in his speech, which was published on the Ukrainian president’s website. But Kellogg said he couldn’t guarantee a resumption of weapons deliveries even if Zelenskyy accepts the deal. 'That’s up to the president,' Kellogg said. He added, 'You don’t negotiate peace discussions in public. You don’t try to challenge the president of the United States in the Oval Office.' Trump said in a speech before Congress on Tuesday that Zelenskyy had written to him to say he appreciates U.S. support for his country in its war with Russia. Trump said Zelenskyy told him that Ukraine is ready to negotiate a peace deal with Russia as soon as possible and would accept the minerals agreement with the U.S. to facilitate that. Although Trump said he 'appreciated' getting the letter, he did not say if it would affect his policy toward Ukraine. The suspension of U.S. intelligence sharing with Ukraine will damage Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against ongoing Russian attacks against military and civilian targets, according to an assessment by the Institute for the Study of War. The research group said suspension of all U.S. intelligence sharing with Ukraine would also allow Russian forces to intensify their drone and missile strikes against the Ukrainian rear, affecting millions of Ukrainian civilians and the growth of Ukraine’s defense industrial base. — AP writer Susie Blann in Kyiv contributed reporting.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-trump-envoy-says-ukrainians-brought-it-on-themselves-after-us-pauses-aid-and-intelligence-sharing/	2025-03-06T10:27:49-08:00	
Hamas brushes off Trump's threat and says it will only free hosta...	CAIRO (AP) — Hamas on Thursday brushed off President Donald Trump's latest threat and reiterated that it will only free the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The militant group accused Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to back out of the ceasefire agreement they reached in January. The agreement calls for negotiations over a second phase in which the hostages would be released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a permanent ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas spokesman Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua said the 'best path to free the remaining Israeli hostages' is through negotiations on that phase, which were supposed to begin in early February. Only limited preparatory talks have been held so far. On Wednesday, Trump issued what he said was a 'last warning' to Hamas after meeting with eight former hostages. The White House meanwhile confirmed it had held unprecedented direct talks with the militant group, which Israel and Western countries view as a terrorist organization. 'Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 'Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!' Both Israel and Hamas have a longstanding practice of holding onto the remains of their adversaries in order to trade them in hostage-prisoner deals. U.S. plan for the second phase Hamas is believed to still have 24 living hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, including Israeli-American Edan Alexander. It is also holding the bodies of 34 others who were either killed in the initial attack or in captivity, as well as the remains of a soldier killed in the 2014 war. Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire, which ended on Saturday. Israel supports what it says is a new U.S. plan for the second phase in which Hamas would release half the remaining hostages immediately and the rest when a permanent ceasefire is negotiated. Hamas has rejected the proposal and says it is sticking with the agreement signed in January. Israel has cut off the delivery of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians in an attempt to pressure Hamas into accepting the new arrangement. It has threatened 'additional consequences' if Hamas does not resume the release of hostages. It is unclear if the U.S.-Hamas talks made any progress. The Trump administration has pledged full support for Israel's main war goals of returning all the hostages and eradicating Hamas, which may be incompatible. Direct talks between the U.S. and Hamas could make it difficult for Israel to resume the war, according to Mkhaimar Abusada, a political science professor at Gaza’s Al-Azhar University who is currently in Egypt. 'The current U.S. administration is trying to avoid a return to war in Gaza in all possible ways,' he said. Gaza reconstruction plan Egypt said Thursday it will host an international conference to raise money for a Gaza reconstruction plan proposed this week at the Arab Summit in Cairo. A date was not announced. The conference, in cooperation with the United Nations, would secure financial pledges for the $53 billion five-year plan, Egyptian foreign ministry spokesperson Tamim Khallaf said. Egyptian and Arab officials also will tour key capitals, including Washington, to promote further details, Khallaf said, adding that Egypt believes it’s a 'workable and realistic plan' in the interest of all partners. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and took a total of 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more. Israel's military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas in Gaza and displaced most of its population. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in tents, schools-turned-shelters or war-damaged buildings, and the population relies on international aid. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hamas-brushes-off-trumps-threat-and-says-it-will-only-free-hostages-in-return-for-a-lasting-truce/	2025-03-06T07:26:48-08:00	
EU leaders meet for emergency summit on defense and Ukraine aid a...	BRUSSELS (AP) — Facing the prospect that the United States might cut them adrift under President Donald Trump, European Union leaders launched a day of emergency talks Thursday in a bid to beef up their own security and ensure that Ukraine will still be properly protected. Friedrich Merz, the likely next chancellor of Germany, and summit chairman Antonio Costa discussed over breakfast in Brussels ways to fortify Europe's defenses on a short deadline. Merz pushed plans this week to loosen the nation’s rules on running up debt to allow for higher defense spending. Meanwhile, the 27-nation bloc was waking up to news that French President Emmanuel Macron would confer with EU leaders about the possibility of using France’s nuclear deterrent to protect the continent from Russian threats. It all underscored the sea change that has taken place in the two months since Trump took office and immediately started upending the cornerstones of cooperation between the United States and Europe that had been the bedrock of Western security since World War II. 'Spend, spend, spend on defense and deterrence. That’s. the most important message,' said Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. The call is a sharp departure from decades of decline in military spending in Europe, where defense often came last in many budgetary considerations. The bloc will 'take decisive steps forward,' Macron told the French nation Wednesday evening. 'Member states will be able to increase their military spending' and 'massive joint funding will be provided to buy and produce some of the most innovative munitions, tanks, weapons and equipment in Europe,' he said. Adding to the ebullient message, he said that 'Europe’s future does not have to be decided in Washington or Moscow.' Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was attending the summit, received warm bonhomie from most leaders — a stark contrast with the verbal lashing the Ukraine president got from Trump less than a week ago. 'I want to thank all our European leaders,' Zelenskyy said. 'Strong support from the very beginning of the war. During all this period, and last week, you stayed with us.' Helping EU members increase spending European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has proposed a plan to loosen budget rules so countries that are willing can spend much more on defense. Her proposal is underpinned by 150 billion euros ($162 billion) worth of loans to buy priority military equipment. Most of the increased defense spending would have to come from national budgets at a time when many countries are already overburdened with debt. Part of von der Leyen’s plan includes measures to ensure struggling member states won’t be punished for going too deep in the red if the spending is earmarked for defense. 'Europe faces a clear and present danger, and therefore Europe has to be able to protect itself, to defend itself,' she said. France is struggling to reduce an excessive annual budget deficit of 5% of GDP, after running up its total debt burden to 112% of GDP with spending on relief for businesses and consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Five other countries using the euro currency have debt levels over 100% of GDP: Belgium, Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal. Europe’s largest economy, Germany, has more room to borrow, with a debt level of 62% of GDP. Pressing security needs Part of any security plan is also to protect the increasingly beleaguered position of Ukraine. A Russian missile killed four people staying at a hotel in Zelenskyy’s hometown overnight. He said that a humanitarian organization’s volunteers had moved into the hotel in Kryvyi Rih, in central Ukraine, just before the strike. The volunteers included Ukrainian, American and British nationals, but it wasn't clear whether those people were among the 31 injured. Early this week, Trump ordered a pause to U.S. military supplies to Ukraine as he sought to press Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia, bringing fresh urgency to Thursday's summit. Thursday's meeting is unlikely to address Ukraine’s most pressing needs. It is not aimed at urgently drumming up more arms and ammunition to fill any supply vacuum created by the U.S. freeze. Nor will all nations agree to unblock the estimated 183 billion euros ($196 billion) in frozen Russian assets held in a Belgian clearing house, a pot of ready cash that could be seized. Still, the Europeans underlined the importance of the moment. 'This is a watershed moment for Europe and Ukraine as part of our European family. It’s also a watershed moment for Ukraine,' von der Leyen said, as she stood alongside Zekenskyy before striding together into the summit. But perhaps the biggest challenge for the EU will be taking a united stance at a moment when it’s fractured, since much of the bloc's actions requires unanimous support. Hungary is threatening to veto part of the summit statement on Ukraine, as is Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico. 'We have to take decisions no matter the one or two which are opposing every time,' said Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda. 'Otherwise history will penalize us and we will pay a very high cost.' Thursday's summit is unlikely to produce immediate decisions on spending for Ukraine or its own defenses. Another EU summit where the real contours of decisions would be much clearer is set for March 20-21. ___ AP journalists Sylvie Corbet in Brussels, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Barry Hatton in Lisbon and Illia Novikov in Kyiv contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-eu-leaders-open-emergency-talks-on-defense-and-ukraine-aid-as-us-support-wanes/	2025-03-06T04:28:39-08:00	
Trump issues 'last warning' to Hamas to release all remaining hos...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued what he called a 'last warning' to Hamas to release all remaining hostages held in Gaza, directing a sharply worded message after the White House confirmed that he had recently dispatched an envoy for unprecedented direct talks with the militant group. In a statement on his Truth Social platform soon after meeting at the White House with eight former hostages, Trump added that he was 'sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job.' 'Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,' Trump said. 'Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!' The pointed language from Trump came after the White House said Wednesday that U.S. officials have engaged in 'ongoing talks and discussions' with Hamas officials, stepping away from a long-held U.S. policy of not directly engaging with the militant group. Confirmation of the talks in the Qatari capital of Doha came as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains in the balance. It’s the first known direct engagement between the United States and Hamas since the State Department designated the group a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to provide detail on the substance of talks, but said President Donald Trump has authorized his envoys to 'talk to anyone.' Egyptian and Qatari intermediaries have served as mediators with Hamas for the U.S. and Israel since the group launched its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war. 'Look, dialogue and talking to people around the world to do what’s in the best interest of the American people is something that the president ... believes is a good-faith effort to do what’s right for the American people,' she said. Leavitt added that Israel has been consulted about the direct engagement with Hamas officials, and noted that there are 'American lives at stake.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office offered a terse acknowledgement of the U.S.-Hamas talks. 'Israel has expressed to the United States its position regarding direct talks with Hamas,' the prime minister’s office said. Israeli officials say about 24 living hostages — including Edan Alexander, an American citizen — as well as the bodies of at least 35 others are believed to still be held in Gaza. Adam Boehler, Trump’s nominee to be special envoy for hostage affairs, led the direct talks with Hamas. Boehler, founder and CEO of Rubicon Founders, a healthcare investment firm, was a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords team during Trump’s first term that strove to win broader recognition of Israel in the Arab world. The talks, which took place last month, focused mainly on the release of American hostages, and a potential end of the war without Hamas in power in Gaza, according to a Hamas official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official added that no progress was made but 'the step itself is promising' and more talks are expected. Egyptian and Qatari mediators helped arrange the talks. The direct engagement comes as continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains uncertain. Trump has signaled that he has no intentions of pushing Netanyahu away from a return to combat if Hamas doesn’t agree to terms of a new ceasefire proposal, which the Israelis have billed as being drafted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners, a key component of the first phase. Trump on Wednesday welcomed eight former hostages — Iair Horn, Omer Shem Tov, Eli Sharabi, Keith Siegel, Aviva Siegel, Naama Levy, Doron Steinbrecher and Noa Argamani — to the White House. 'The President listened intently to their heartbreaking stories,' Leavitt said. 'The hostages thanked President Trump for his steadfast efforts to bring all of the hostages home.' Keith Siegel, an Israeli-American released last month as part of the ceasefire, said they came to the White House to express their appreciation to Trump and Witkoff, the Mideast envoy. 'We urged them to continue their enormous efforts. They have done so much. We trust them and we know they will get the job done to get all the rest of the 59 remaining hostages held in Gaza back to their families,' he said in a statement. The talks between U.S. and Hamas officials were first reported earlier Wednesday by the news site Axios. Leavitt, the White House press secretary, is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-white-house-confirms-ongoing-talks-and-discussions-with-hamas-officials-amid-ceasefire-uncertainty/	2025-03-05T22:58:48-08:00	
Kremlin says a 2022 Ukrainian law bans Zelenskyy from talks with ...	A Ukrainian decree from 2022 ruling out negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin raises the question of who could sit at the table in potential peace talks aimed at ending their three-year war, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'is still legally prohibited from negotiating with the Russian side,' Peskov noted during his daily conference call with reporters. He said it was 'positive' that Zelenskyy expressed readiness Tuesday to negotiate peace with Russia as soon as possible. 'But the details have not changed yet,' Peskov added, apparently referring to the Ukrainian decree. Neither Ukrainian nor Western officials have recently mentioned the September 2022 presidential decree, signed seven months after Russia’s cross-border invasion, in the context of U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to stop the fighting. The Trump administration on Monday suspended its crucial military aid to Ukraine as the United States sought to pressure Zelenskyy into negotiating an end to the war. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the support would resume after Zelenskyy’s seeming effort to placate Trump. Ukrainian forces are toiling to slow advances by the bigger Russian army along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region. The Russian onslaught, which has been costly for its troops, hasn’t yet brought a strategically significant breakthrough for the Kremlin. The war of attrition has killed tens of thousands of soldiers and more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians. Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer could travel together to Washington, the French government spokesperson said Wednesday. 'It is envisaged that President Macron could eventually travel again to Washington with President Zelenskyy and his British counterpart,' spokesperson Sophie Primas told reporters. She did not elaborate. Macron was due to give a televised address to the nation later Wednesday about what he called the 'great uncertainty' in global affairs. The three leaders traveled separately to Washington last week for meetings with Trump. Starmer didn't comment on the possibility of a joint trip when he appeared in the British Parliament on Wednesday. His spokesman, Dave Pares, would not confirm such a trip. In the early months of the war, Zelenskyy repeatedly called for a personal meeting with Putin but was rebuffed. After the Kremlin's decision in September 2022 to illegally annex four regions of Ukraine — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — Zelenskyy enacted a decree declaring that holding negotiations with Putin had become impossible. The decree enacted a decision by Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council to bolster Ukrainian defenses and seek more weapons from the country’s Western allies. The Kremlin said at the time it would wait for Ukraine to sit down for talks on ending the conflict, noting that such a step may not happen until a new Ukrainian president takes office. Meanwhile, a Russian court on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a British national captured last year fighting for Ukraine in the Kursk border region of Russia, according to court officials. James Scott Rhys Anderson was found guilty of terrorism and mercenary activities during an armed conflict and sentenced to 19 years in prison. The case was heard behind closed doors. According to media reports at the time of his capture in November 2024, 22-year-old Anderson said he had served as a signalman in the British army for four years and then joined the International Legion of Ukraine, formed shortly after Russia's invasion. Ukrainian forces captured parts of Kursk in a shock offensive in August 2024. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-kremlin-says-a-2022-ukrainian-law-bans-zelenskyy-from-talks-with-putin/	2025-03-05T05:28:22-08:00	
Israel’s cutoff of supplies to Gaza sends prices soaring as aid s...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s cutoff of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza’s 2 million people has sent prices soaring and humanitarian groups into overdrive trying to distribute dwindling stocks to the most vulnerable. The aid freeze has imperiled the progress aid workers say they have made to stave off famine over the past six weeks during Phase 1 of the ceasefire deal Israel and Hamas agreed to in January. After more than 16 months of war, Gaza’s population is entirely dependent on trucked-in food and other aid. Most are displaced from their homes, and many need shelter. Fuel is needed to keep hospitals, water pumps, bakeries and telecommunications — as well as trucks delivering the aid — operating. Israel says the siege aims at pressuring Hamas to accept its ceasefire proposal. Israel has delayed moving to the second phase of the deal it reached with Hamas, during which the flow of aid was supposed to continue. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that he is prepared to increase the pressure and would not rule out cutting off all electricity to Gaza if Hamas doesn’t budge. Rights groups have called the cutoff a 'starvation policy.' Four days in, how is the cutoff affecting Gaza? Food, fuel and shelter supplies are threatened The World Food Program, the U.N.'s main food agency, says it has no major stockpile of food in Gaza because it focused on distributing all incoming food to hungry people during Phase 1 of the deal. In a statement to AP, it said existing stocks are enough to keep bakeries and kitchens running for under two weeks. WFP said it may be forced to reduce ration sizes to serve as many people as possible. It said its fuel reserves, necessary to run bakeries and transport food, will last for a few weeks if not replenished soon. There’s also no major stockpile of tents in Gaza, said Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council. The shelter materials that came in during the ceasefire’s first phase were 'nowhere near enough to address all of the needs,' she said. 'If it was enough, we wouldn’t have had infants dying from exposure because of lack of shelter materials and warm clothes and proper medical equipment to treat them,' she said. At least seven infants in Gaza died from hypothermia during Phase 1. Urgently checking reserves 'We’re trying to figure out, what do we have? What would be the best use of our supply?' said Jonathan Crickx, chief of communication for UNICEF. 'We never sat on supplies, so it’s not like there’s a huge amount left to distribute.' He predicted a 'catastrophic result' if the aid freeze continues. During the ceasefire's first phase, humanitarian agencies rushed in supplies, with about 600 trucks entering per day on average. Aid workers set up more food kitchens, health centers and water distribution points. With more fuel coming in, they could double the amount of water drawn from wells, according to the U.N. humanitarian agency. Around 100,000 tents also arrived as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians tried to return to their homes, only to find them destroyed or too damaged to live in. But the progress relied on the flow of aid continuing. Oxfam has 26 trucks with thousands of food packages and hygiene kits and 12 trucks of water tanks waiting outside Gaza, said Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam’s policy lead in the West Bank. 'This is not just about hundreds of trucks of food, it’s about the total collapse of systems that sustain life,' she said. The International Organization for Migration has 22,500 tents in its warehouses in Jordan after trucks brought back their undelivered cargo once entry was barred, said Karl Baker, the agency's regional crisis coordinator. The International Rescue Committee has 6.7 tons of medicines and medical supplies waiting to enter Gaza and its delivery is 'highly uncertain,' said Bob Kitchen, vice president of its emergencies and humanitarian action department. Medical Aid for Palestinians said it has trucks stuck at Gaza's border carrying medicine, mattresses and assistive devices for people with disabilities. The organization has some medicine and materials in reserve, said spokesperson Tess Pope, but 'we don’t have stock that we can use during a long closure of Gaza.' Prices up sharply Prices of vegetables and flour are now climbing in Gaza after easing during the ceasefire. Sayed Mohamed al-Dairi walked through a bustling market in Gaza City just after the aid cutoff was announced. Already, sellers were increasing the prices of dwindling wares. 'The traders are massacring us, the traders are not merciful to us,' he said. 'In the morning, the price of sugar was 5 shekels. Ask him now, the price has become 10 shekels.' In the central Gaza city of Deir Al-Balah, one cigarette priced at 5 shekels ($1.37) before the cutoff now stands at 20 shekels ($5.49). One kilo of chicken (2.2 pounds) that was 21 shekels ($5.76) is now 50 shekels ($13.72). Cooking gas has soared from 90 shekels ($24.70) for 12 kilos (26.4 pounds) to 1,480 shekels ($406.24). Following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, Israel cut off all aid to Gaza for two weeks — a measure central to South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice. That took place as Israel launched the most intense phase of its aerial bombardment of Gaza, one of the most aggressive campaigns in modern history. Palestinians fear a repeat of that period. 'We are afraid that Netanyahu or Trump will launch a war more severe than the previous war,' said Abeer Obeid, a Palestinian woman from northern Gaza. 'For the extension of the truce, they must find any other solution.' ___ This version corrects to say Wednesday is the fourth day of the freeze, not the second.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-cut-off-food-and-supplies-to-gaza-aid-groups-are-scrambling-whats-happening-on-the-ground/	2025-03-05T05:24:55-08:00	
What Trump’s aid freeze means for Ukraine war	(The Hill) -- President Donald Trump’s freeze on U.S. aid going to Ukraine threatens to create severe problems for Kyiv in its war against Russia, leaving the country more vulnerable to aerial attacks on population centers and key infrastructure. Experts predict the pause could be felt within a matter of weeks, depending on its scope. 'In terms of the immediate battlefield effect, this is bad,' said George Barros, an expert on the Ukraine-Russia conflict for the Institute for the Study of War. Barros said the freeze will have 'a significant effect' that will become more apparent should the suspension stretch into summer when ammunition supplies are likely to dwindle. But the biggest gap will be felt when the Ukrainians run low on U.S.-made Patriot interceptors and other air defenses, which could happen within weeks. 'There are certain niche systems and capabilities that the United States provides Ukraine that the Ukrainians do not have an analogue for, and neither do the Europeans, particularly air defense interceptors,' he said. Retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, a senior fellow with the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said there is simply no European substitute for U.S. air defense munitions such as Patriot interceptors and Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles — used to defend from incoming Kremlin drone and missile attacks on cities. Nor is there an easy replacement for long-range strike weapons such as HIMARS and ATACMS, which Ukrainian troops have used to strike targets just over the border in Russia. 'Their critical infrastructure is getting hammered by cruise and ballistic missiles,' Montgomery said. 'Without these weapons systems, more Russian stuff hits, more infrastructure is damaged. Without the long-range strike, Russia can bring contact to the enemy quicker with less risk. This [freeze] makes things worse.' Jennifer Kavanagh, senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, said once air defenses are gutted, 'it will force Ukraine to make choices. Do they defend the power station? Or do they defend their F-16 center on the ground? ... That's where the pinch will be felt first.' Trump on Monday directed his administration to 'pause' all military aid to Ukraine following a contentious Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week. Trump has been ramping up pressure on Kyiv to sign a critical minerals deal to repay U.S. assistance and agree to major concessions toward a peace deal with Russia. 'The President has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well,' a White House official said in a statement. 'We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.' US, Ukraine sound optimistic notes on mineral deal Senate Republicans, who are generally hawkish on Ukraine, on Tuesday defended Trump's move as a negotiating tactic, predicting it wouldn't last long. But the news has still been met with despair in Ukraine, with parliament member Oleksiy Goncharenko telling Sky News that 'thousands of people will die' due to Trump’s 'catastrophic' choice. 'The mood in Ukraine is that of betrayal. The mood is that of hopelessness,' Barros said. 'Telling them, ‘Congratulations, you're not getting any more weapons,’ it's a very poor incentive to actually try to increase and boost recruitment numbers.' Zelensky has quickly sought to remedy the situation, on Tuesday saying Ukraine is 'ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible' to sign the minerals deal and bring a peace deal closer. 'None of us wants an endless war,' Zelensky said in a statement that did not comment directly on the aid pause. 'Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.' It's unclear what lethal aid earmarked for Ukraine will be affected by the freeze, given that there has been no official statement from the administration on how far the pause will extend and what it will touch. Trump took office with nearly $4 billion in drawdown authority for Ukraine available from previously approved congressional funding, which could now go unused. And he could move to scrap contracts Ukraine has signed with U.S. defense firms – meant to guarantee a steady flow of newly produced arms into the country for at least the next several years. Trump could also withhold training for Ukrainians on weapons maintenance, providing spare parts, or allowing European allies to transfer crucial material such as F-16 fighter jet parts. Ukraine also partners with the U.S. for intelligence and relies on Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite network for communication and internet connectivity. The freeze could not come at a better time for Russia, which over the past six months has seen its military tempo decreasing as it has rapidly burned through troops and ammunition, allowing the Ukrainians to increasingly engage in counterattacks in southeastern parts of the country. With these trends, the Kremlin would likely have to face a series of very difficult decisions in how it would resource the war in the coming year, experts say, making it an ideal time to press Russia for hard concessions. With the American aid paused, however, experts said they wouldn't be surprised if the Russians started intensifying their air campaign to try to eliminate what remaining air defense interceptors the Ukrainians have. 'Depending on the intensity of the air campaign, they could run out of interceptors within a matter of days, if not weeks,' Barros said of Ukraine. Once that happens, Moscow 'can really unleash fury.' Polish PM tells European leaders to ‘keep calm and carry on’ amid US-Ukraine tensions That has put the spotlight on Europe, which has rallied in support of Ukraine in recent days, with leaders meeting over the weekend to chart a path forward without the U.S. But Europe’s ability to fill the gap is limited by various factors, including domestic politics. Branislav Slantchev, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego who studies the war, said despite the supportive rhetoric coming from Europe, leaders will struggle to sell the public on major boosts to defense spending if it requires big sacrifices such as cuts to the social safety net. 'I'm not sure that the Europeans can fill the gap quickly enough, even if they had the political will to do so. Now, they're saying all the right things, but their political reality in Europe is quite difficult,' he said. Ukraine may be able to sustain its current level of resistance for three to six months, Slantchev said, but will eventually have to make painful battlefield decisions if Trump sticks with the freeze. 'Essentially, they will begin to lose territory, because they will have to essentially withdraw to more defensible positions. They will have to rearrange how they do this. It's going to be a lot harder for them,' he said. Trump has proven willing to quickly shift positions in foreign relations as negotiations play out, and Slantchev said the aid suspension may be an attempt to see how far he can push Ukraine toward Russia’s negotiating positions. 'This is basically typical Trumpian moves to essentially force Ukraine to show ... the absolute maximum they can concede, and then take this to the Russians and see if it will work,' he said. 'My belief is that it will not work, and then all bets are off.'

Middle East latest: Israel demolished 181 Palestinian homes in ea...	An Israeli rights group says Israel demolished a record number of Palestinian homes in annexed east Jerusalem last year. Ir Amim, which closely tracks settlement activity and demolitions in the city, said Wednesday that 181 homes were destroyed last year, in addition to dozens of other structures. It said that more recently, Israel appears to have dropped a longstanding policy against demolishing homes during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began last weekend. It said a residential building and three apartments have been destroyed over the past week. Rights groups say discriminatory policies make it nearly impossible for Palestinians to expand or redevelop their neighborhoods in east Jerusalem, forcing many to build without permits. Israel also demolishes the family homes of Palestinians who carry out attacks. Here's the latest: Israel demolished 181 Palestinian homes in annexed east Jerusalem Ir Amim, an Israeli rights group, says Israel demolished a record number of Palestinian homes — 181 — in annexed east Jerusalem last year. It said that more recently, Israel appears to have dropped a longstanding policy against demolishing homes during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began last weekend. It said a residential building and three apartments have been destroyed over the past week. The Jerusalem municipality did not respond to a request for comment. Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three for their future state. Rights groups say discriminatory policies make it nearly impossible for Palestinians to expand or redevelop their neighborhoods in east Jerusalem, forcing many to build without permits. Israel also demolishes the family homes of Palestinians who carry out attacks. Arab leaders approve a counterproposal to Trump’s postwar Gaza plan Arab leaders meeting in Cairo on Tuesday endorsed a counterproposal to U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for the Gaza Strip to be depopulated of Palestinians and transformed into a beach destination, even as the continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire is uncertain. Israel is again blocking food, fuel, medicine and other desperately needed supplies from entering Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept an alternative U.S. proposal for the ceasefire and the release of hostages. The suspension of aid drew widespread criticism, with human rights groups saying that it violated Israel’s obligations as an occupying power under international law.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israel-demolished-181-palestinian-homes-in-east-jerusalem-group-says/	2025-03-05T03:00:32-08:00	
Ukraine selling T-shirts with Zelensky quote from Trump-Vance mee...	(The Hill) – The Ukrainian government has launched a T-shirt fundraising effort seeking to capitalize on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's now-infamous Oval Office meeting on Friday with President Trump and Vice President Vance. The meeting, which unraveled to such an extent that a joint press conference between the two sides scheduled for afterwards was canceled, including multiple moments that went viral, including when Zelensky was criticized for not wearing a suit. He has dressed in more military-themed garb since Russia invaded his country three years ago. United24, a Ukrainian state-sponsored platform that raises funds amid the ongoing war, is raffling off 100 T-shirts with Zelensky's response: 'I’ll wear a costume when the war is over.' In Ukrainian, the word 'costume' is used as a translated term for suit. The raffle is open to those who donate $24 or more toward Kyiv's defense efforts. 'They’re emphasizing the words of our President — a reminder that there is a time and place for everything,' United24's online post reads. 'There will be a time when we can all wear suits. Right now, it is time to help Ukraine finish this war. You have all the cards to support Ukraine — it’s time to play them. Donate to help Ukraine finish this war and win something to wear instead of a suit,' it concluded. During Friday’s Oval Office spat, Zelensky tried to tell Trump of the brutality endured by his citizens amid the conflict. Trump urged his counterpart to show more gratitude for American dollars fueling the war. 'Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. You’re in no position to dictate that. You don’t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards,' Trump said in front of cameras. 'You’re gambling with World War III, and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that has backed you.' The president and members of his administration have called on Zelensky to apologize over the meeting. Tensions have risen between Trump and Zelensky in recent weeks after the former called the latter a 'dictator without elections' who had done a 'terrible job.' Trump recently suggested Ukraine was to blame for the start of the war with Russia. On Monday, Trump, who has been pressuring Ukraine to sign a a deal that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine’s critical mineral supply, paused American military aid to Kyiv.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ukraine-selling-t-shirts-with-zelensky-quote-from-trump-vance-meeting/	2025-03-04T13:59:10-08:00	
Zelenskyy calls Oval Office spat with Trump 'regrettable,' says h...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that the Oval Office blowup with U.S. counterpart Donald Trump last week was 'regrettable,' adding that he stands ready to work under Trump's 'strong leadership' to get a lasting peace. Zelenskyy’s remarks — an apparent attempt to placate Trump — came in a social media post on X, hours after the White House announced a pause in military aid to Ukraine that is critical to fighting Russia’s invasion. But later during his nightly address, Zelenskyy indicated that Ukraine didn't receive direct notification from the U.S. that aid had been cut, and was seeking confirmation. 'I have instructed Ukraine’s Minister of Defense, the heads of our intelligence agencies, and our diplomats to contact their counterparts in the United States and obtain official information. People should not have to guess,' he said. 'Ukraine and America deserve a respectful dialogue and a clear position from one another. Especially when it comes to protecting lives during a full-scale war,' he added, saying that military aid had been cut once before in January for a brief period. Zelenskyy also said Ukraine is ready to sign a lucrative deal on rare-earth minerals and security with Washington. Trump was weighing whether to agree to the signing Tuesday, when he is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress, after Zelenskyy's sign of contrition, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. In an apparent reference to Trump’s criticism following the contentious White House meeting on Friday that Zelenskyy does not want a peace deal, the Ukrainian leader said, 'None of us want an endless war.' 'Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,' he said. Asked by reporters in Moscow about Zelenskyy voicing readiness for the resumption of talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, 'It’s good, it’s positive.' In his post, Zelenskyy said the Oval Office meeting 'did not go the way it was supposed to be.' 'It is regrettable that it happened this way. It is time to make things right,' he added. 'We would like future cooperation and communication to be constructive.' The pause of U.S. military aid catapulted Ukraine into alarm and apprehension. Zelenskyy’s statement came before Trump was expected to address the U.S. Congress later Tuesday. 'Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it in any time and in any convenient format,' Zelenskyy said. 'We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively.' French President Emmanuel Macron spoke by phone successively with Trump and Zelenskyy, Macron's office said, and 'welcomes' the Ukrainian's 'willingness to re-engage in dialogue with the U.S.' It released no details about the discussion with Trump. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also spoke to the Ukrainian leader and 'welcomed President Zelenskyy’s steadfast commitment to securing peace.' Zelenskyy’s post came as officials in Kyiv said they were grateful for vital U.S. help in the war and want to keep working with Washington. Ukraine’s prime minister, though, said the country still wants security guarantees to be part of any peace deal and won’t recognize Russian occupation of any Ukrainian land. Those are potential stumbling blocks for Washington and Moscow, respectively. Ukraine and its allies are concerned Trump is pushing for a quick ceasefire that will favor Russia, which Kyiv says cannot be trusted to honor truces. A White House official said the U.S. was 'pausing and reviewing' its aid to 'ensure that it is contributing to a solution.' The order will remain in effect until Trump determines that Ukraine has demonstrated a commitment to peace negotiations, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the assistance. The pause in U.S. aid isn’t expected to have an immediate impact on the battlefield. Ukrainian forces have slowed Russian advances along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the fiercely contested Donetsk region in the east. The Russian onslaught has been costly in troops and armor but hasn’t brought a strategically significant breakthrough for the Kremlin. Ukraine needs help to fight Russia Ukraine, which depends heavily on foreign help to hold back Russia’s full-scale invasion that began on Feb. 24, 2022, has feared that aid could be stopped since Trump took office. U.S.-made Patriot air defense missile systems, for example, are pivotal to protecting Ukraine. Just as vital is U.S. intelligence assistance, which has allowed Ukraine to track Russian troop movements and select targets. 'I feel betrayed, but this feeling is not really deep for some reason. I was expecting something like that from Trump’s side,' said a Ukrainian soldier fighting in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a daring incursion in August 2024 to improve its hand in negotiations. The soldier spoke by phone to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. On the front line, where Ukraine is struggling to fend off the larger and better-equipped Russian army, another soldier said the U.S. decision would allow further battlefield gains for Moscow. 'War is very pragmatic,' he told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity in compliance with military regulations. 'If we have weapons, enough ammunition, infantry, armored vehicles and aviation — great. If not, then we’re done,' he said. He recalled a seven-month delay in U.S. aid that ended in April 2024 but opened a door for Russia's capture of the strategic city of Avdiivka. Olena Fedorova, 46, of the southern port city of Odesa, said she hoped Trump’s decision would be temporary because 'we really need help.' U.S. support is vital because Europe cannot fully provide what Ukraine needs in air defense systems, leading to increased civilian casualties, said lawmaker Yehor Chernov. The suspension of U.S. military aid is already being felt at a hub in eastern Poland that has been used to ferry Western weapons into neighboring Ukraine, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. The U.S.-Ukraine relationship has taken a downturn since Trump took office and his team launched bilateral talks with Russia. Trump had vowed during his campaign to settle the war in 24 hours, but later changed that time frame and voiced hope that peace could be negotiated in six months. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said U.S. help is 'vital' and has saved 'perhaps tens of thousands' of civilian and military lives. But he emphasized that any peace agreement must be 'on Ukraine’s terms, as the victim country.' Ukraine wants 'concrete security guarantees' from Washington, European countries and Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, he said. Giving up territory to Russia, which occupies nearly 20% of Ukraine, 'is not possible' under the U.N. Charter, he said. European allies stress support for Kyiv Noting that the U.S. has been 'the chief supplier' of aid to Ukraine, Peskov said that if Washington suspends these supplies, 'it will make the best contribution to peace.' Poland’s Foreign Ministry said the U.S. had not consulted with or informed NATO countries before announcing the pause. Russia will likely try to use the halt in supplies to extend its territorial gains and strengthen its position in prospective peace talks. Andrei Kartapolov, a retired general who heads a defense committee in parliament, told Russia's state RIA news agency that Ukraine would exhaust its current ammunition reserves within months. 'We need to keep up the pressure and continue to target their bases and depots with long-range precision weapons to destroy the stockpiles,' he said. Ukraine’s European allies, meanwhile, reaffirmed their commitment to Kyiv. The chief of the European Union’s executive proposed an 800-billion-euro ($841 billion) plan to bolster defenses of EU nations and provide Ukraine with military muscle. The U.K. government, which has been leading European efforts to keep Trump from pushing to end the war on terms that could favor Moscow, said it remains 'absolutely committed to securing a lasting peace in Ukraine.' Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based defense think tank, said Washington’s move could encourage Russia to seek more Ukrainian concessions, including demilitarization and neutrality. ___ Volodymyr Yurchuk in Kyiv, Vanessa Gera in Warsaw, Poland, and Aamer Madhani, Zeke Miller and Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukrainians-wake-up-to-trumps-pause-on-all-military-aid/	2025-03-04T12:53:29-08:00	
Zelensky calls Trump meeting 'regrettable,' stops short of apolog...	(The Hill) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday called his contentious meeting last week with President Trump at the White House a 'regrettable' gathering but stopped short of issuing an apology for the public blowup. In a post online, Zelensky signaled Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table to end the three-year-war with Russia. 'Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be. It is regrettable that it happened this way,' the Ukrainian leader wrote in a post on social platform X. 'It is time to make things right.' 'We would like future cooperation and communication to be constructive,' he added. Zelensky reiterated on Tuesday that his country is committed to reaching a peace deal and he is ready to sign the mineral deal to reinvigorate cooperation between the war-torn country and the U.S. The two leaders were expected to sign the agreement, which would give Washington access to Ukraine's critical minerals in exchange for security guarantees, on Friday, but the clash derailed the plan. 'Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it in any time and in any convenient format,' he wrote on X. 'We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively.' Tensions have been simmering between the leaders for months. Trump has previously hammered Zelensky over his leadership, accusing him of being a 'dictator without elections,' doing a 'terrible job' as the country’s head official and blaming Kyiv for starting the war in Eastern Europe. The Ukrainian president has shot back, accusing Trump of living in a 'disinformation space,' and questioning the administration's peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Friday, Trump, along with Vice President Vance, went after Zelensky, arguing he was insufficiently grateful for U.S. military assistance and that his leverage in reaching a ceasefire with Russia was miniscule. Trump called off the signing of the minerals deal and claimed his Ukrainian counterpart was not prepared to reach a peace deal. Zelensky, after the meeting, told Fox News's Bret Baier in an interview that he would not apologize for the heated back-and-forth. On Monday, Trump instituted a freeze on all U.S. aid going to Ukraine. Zelensky said Tuesday that his team is 'ready' to work with Trump’s administration to bring an end to the conflict with Moscow. 'We are ready to work fast to end the war, and the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky — ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure — and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same,' Zelensky wrote. 'Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the US to agree a strong final deal,' he added. The Ukrainian leader also expressed gratitude for the aid the U.S. has provided. 'We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. And we remember the moment when things changed when President Trump provided Ukraine with Javelins,' Zelensky said. 'We are grateful for this.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/zelensky-calls-trump-meeting-regrettable-stops-short-of-apology/	2025-03-04T09:47:56-08:00	
Arab leaders gather to endorse counterproposal to Trump's Gaza pl...	CAIRO (AP) — Arab leaders meeting in Cairo on Tuesday are set to endorse a counterproposal to U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for the Gaza Strip to be depopulated and transformed into a beach destination, even as the continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire is uncertain. The summit hosted by Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi included the foreign ministers of regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, whose support is crucial for any postwar plan. Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative U.S. proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the war. It has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting. The suspension of aid drew widespread criticism, with human rights groups saying that it violated Israel's obligations as an occupying power under international law. The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase. Egypt's postwar plan Egypt has developed a postwar plan in which Palestinians would be relocated to safe areas inside Gaza, and equipped with mobile homes while its cities are rebuilt. Hamas would cede power to an interim administration of political independents until a reformed Palestinian Authority can assume control. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Western-backed authority and an opponent of Hamas, was attending the summit. Israel has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and, along with the United States, has demanded Hamas’ disarmament. Hamas, which doesn't accept Israel's existence, has said that it's willing to cede power in Gaza to other Palestinians, but won't give up its arms until there is a Palestinian state. An early draft of the statement endorsing the plan called for a 'permanent and just solution' for the Palestinian cause, and for the U.N. Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The mention of peacekeepers was dropped from a later draft. Israel has vowed to maintain open-ended security control over both territories, which it captured in the 1967 Mideast war and which Palestinians want for their future state. Israel’s government and most of its political class are opposed to Palestinian statehood. Trump shocked the region last month when he suggested that Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries. He said that the United States would take ownership of the territory and redevelop it into a Middle Eastern 'Riviera.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embraced the proposal, which was roundly rejected by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who said it would likely violate international law. Children from Gaza head to Jordan for treatment Trump has suggested that Egypt and Jordan, two close American allies, could take in large numbers of Palestinian refugees from Gaza. Both countries have adamantly rejected any such plan. Meeting with Trump at the White House last month, King Abdullah II of Jordan offered to take in around 2,000 children for medical treatment. The first batch of around 30 children left Gaza for Jordan on Tuesday, according to Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The children are being accompanied by up to two family members. Jordan said that the children are amputees, and will return to Gaza when their treatment is complete. The kingdom has also set up field hospitals in Gaza and delivered aid by air and land. The war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 people hostage. Hamas-led militants are still holding 59 hostages, 35 of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements. Israel has rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more. Israel's 15-month offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It doesn't say how many were fighters, but the ministry says women and children made up more than half the dead. Israel says it killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed large areas of Gaza, including much of its health system and other infrastructure. At its height, the war displaced abou 90% of the population, mostly within the territory, where hundreds of thousands packed into squalid tent camps and schools repurposed as shelters. ___ Jahjouh reported from Khan Younis, Gaza Strip. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-arab-leaders-gather-to-endorse-counterproposal-to-trumps-gaza-plan-with-ceasefires-fate-uncertain/	2025-03-04T05:44:48-08:00	
Trump pauses aid to Ukraine amid clash with Zelensky	President Trump has ordered a pause on U.S. aid going to Ukraine in its war against Russia, a consequential move as he clashes with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about the path to ending the conflict. 'The President has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well,' a White House official said in a statement. 'We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.' The pause applies to all military aid not already on the ground in Ukraine and will effect munitions, anti-tank weapons and other materials the U.S. has provided to Kyiv since Russia invaded roughly three years ago. Trump took office with nearly $4 billion in drawdown authority available from previously approved congressional funding for Ukraine. That funding now appears poised to go unused. The move is likely to increase the pressure on Zelensky to get back in Trump’s good graces or risk losing ground in the war. It is also likely to put the spotlight on European nations seeking to rally more support for Kyiv. As of the end of fiscal 2024, Congress had approved nearly $183 billion in Ukraine aid, according to a federal government oversight office. The European Union has contributed roughly $145 billion in total assistance to Ukraine since the war began. Trump campaigned on a pledge to end the war in Ukraine. Since taking office, he has spoken with both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tensions have been heightened between Trump and Zelensky in recent weeks after the U.S. president called the Ukrainian leader a 'dictator without elections' who had done a 'terrible job.' Trump recently suggested Ukraine was to blame for the start of the war with Russia. Zelensky responded at the time that Trump was living in a 'disinformation space.' The tensions appeared to culminate last Friday at a confrontational meeting in the Oval Office, after which Trump said the Ukrainian leader was not 'ready for peace.' Zelensky had arrived at the White House last week expecting to meet with Trump and sign off on a deal that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine’s critical mineral supply. Trump had touted the deal as a way for the U.S. to recoup some of the aid it had provided to Ukraine in its war against Russia, while boosting Ukraine’s economy in the long term. But Trump called off peace talks, and the deal was left unsigned after the Oval Office blowup. Trump said earlier Monday that the minerals deal was not dead, and that Zelensky could restart talks by showing appreciation for U.S. assistance.

The Latest: Trump and his allies lash out at Ukraine’s Zelenskyy ...	President Donald Trump ’s senior aides and allies lashed out at Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy from Washington as he attended a European summit in London to rally international support for his military’s fight against the Russian invasion. Meanwhile, Trump on Tuesday night will deliver the first joint congressional address of his second presidency. It’s not officially called the State of the Union, a title reserved for a president’s annual address to Congress during other years of an administration. Here's the latest: Waltz commends UK Prime Minister Starmer, French President Macron for stepping up on Ukraine 'We welcome the Europeans taking a lead in European security,' National security adviser Mike Waltz told reporters at the White House. 'I mean that’s been an underpinning. They have to invest in the capability to do that. They’re certainly showing a will.' Waltz’s comments come after Starmer gathered his European counterparts in London on Sunday for talks and called on them to shore up their borders and throw their full weight behind Ukraine as he announced outlines of a plan to end Russia’s war. Both Starmer and Macron have said they would send troops to Ukraine for a peacekeeping mission once a truce in the fighting between Ukraine and Russia is achieved. ‘There’s initial signs’ of effect on the budget, Congressional Budget Office director says of DOGE cuts Phillip Swagel, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said Monday that cuts enacted by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, are slowing government spending but added that it’s 'too early' to make any broader judgement about DOGE’s impact on spending or deficits. 'There’s initial signs that there has been a budgetary impact,' Swagel said in remarks at the National Association for Business Economics. He noted that government spending in some agencies has come in below what was projected before the Trump administration took office. But he said the cuts won’t show up as official budgetary savings unless Congress rescinds the money through legislation later this year. Some of DOGE’s spending cuts could be reversed by the courts, he said. He also noted that the majority of government spending is in the form of mandatory benefit programs and hasn’t been affected. RFK Jr. lays out benefits of measles vaccines, but stops short of calling for people to get a dose The nation’s top health official wrote Sunday that the measles vaccine has benefits but he stopped short of calling on parents to inoculate their children from the deadly disease. In an opinion piece for Fox News, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urged parents to consult with 'healthcare providers' on whether their children should get the vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella. 'Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,' Kennedy wrote in the piece, published Sunday. Kennedy has previously criticized the vaccines, although research and real-world use has proven that they are safe and effective. Waltz adds to doubt about whether White House willing to deal with Zelenskyy going forward National security adviser Mike Waltz also on Monday said Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s posture during Friday’s Oval Office 'put up in the air' whether he’s someone the U.S. administration will be able to deal with going forward. 'Is he ready? Personally, politically, to move his country towards an end to the fighting?' Waltz said on Fox News on Monday. 'And can he and will he make the compromises necessary?' Waltz added another layer of doubt about U.S. support in the aftermath of Friday’s contentious meeting with President Trump and Vice President JD Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz calls Oval Office blowup a ‘truly ridiculous and unacceptable session’ He was speaking on Fox News on Monday morning. The meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which was meant to result in the signing of a minerals deal between the two nations was abruptly ended after an extraordinary blowup between the Ukrainian and American leaders. 'He’s not ready to talk peace at all,' Waltz said. 'This wasn’t an ambush,' he said. 'Zelenskyy did his country a disservice.' Unlike some Republican lawmakers who over the weekend called for Zelenskyy’s resignation — Waltz did not call on the Ukrainian leader to step down, but after asked whether Zelenskyy is fit to lead Ukraine, Waltz said: 'what happened Friday really put that up in the air.' Senate will vote on confirming Linda McMahon to lead an education agency Trump has vowed to close The Senate will be voting Monday. McMahon would face the competing tasks of winding down the Education Department while also escalating efforts to achieve Trump’s agenda. Already the Republican president has signed sweeping orders to rid America’s schools of diversity programs and accommodations for transgender students while also calling for expanded school choice programs. At the same time, Trump has promised to shut down the department and said he wants McMahon 'to put herself out of a job.' A billionaire and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon, 76, is an unconventional pick for the role. She spent a year on Connecticut’s state board of education and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University but otherwise has little traditional education leadership. ▶ Read more about Linda McMahon Trump’s next first speech to Congress is bound to have little resemblance to his last first one The nation will hear a new president sing a far different tune in his prime-time address before Congress on Tuesday night. Some Americans will lustily sing along. Others will plug their ears. The old tune is out — the one where a president declares 'we strongly support NATO,' 'I believe strongly in free trade' and Washington must do more to promote clean air, clean water, women’s health and civil rights. That was Donald Trump in 2017. That was back when gestures of bipartisanship and appeals to national unity were still in the mix on the night the president comes before Congress to hold forth on the state of the union. Trump, then new at the job, was just getting his footing in the halls of power and not ready to stomp on everything. It would be three more years before Americans would see Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, then the House speaker and his State of the Union host in the chamber, performatively rip up a copy of Trump’s speech in disgust over its contents. ▶ Read more about what to expect from Trump’s address to congress The Trump administration may exclude government spending from GDP, obscuring the impact of DOGE cuts Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that government spending could be separated from gross domestic product reports, in response to questions about whether the spending cuts pushed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency could possibly cause an economic downturn. 'You know that governments historically have messed with GDP,' Lutnick said on Fox News Channel’s 'Sunday Morning Futures.' 'They count government spending as part of GDP. So I’m going to separate those two and make it transparent.' Doing so could potentially complicate or distort a fundamental measure of the U.S. economy’s health. Government spending is traditionally included in the GDP because changes in taxes, spending, deficits and regulations by the government can impact the path of overall growth. GDP reports already include extensive details on government spending, offering a level of transparency for economists. ▶ Read more about government spending and the GDP Trudeau is expected to bring up Trump’s threat to annex Canada when he meets King Charles Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will meet with King Charles III, the country’s head of state, on Monday where he will discuss U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to make Canada the 51st state. The king has come under criticism in Canada for being silent about Trump’s threats to annex Canada. Trudeau said in London on Sunday he will discuss matters of importance to Canadians with Charles and said 'nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation.' ▶ Read more about Trudeau’s meeting with King Charles III What to watch when Trump gives his big speech to Congress Trump loves a good spectacle, and it’s hard to top a speech to a joint session of Congress. The House chamber is packed with lawmakers, and the president’s arrival is announced in a booming voice by the sergeant-at-arms, triggering cacophonous applause. Trump’s speech on Tuesday evening isn’t technically considered a State of the Union address — that comes next year, after he’s been on the job for longer — but there’s no distinguishable difference for anyone watching at home. Almost no detail is left to chance in these situations. Here’s some ideas of what to look and listen for: 1. Is Elon Musk in attendance? 2. What does Trump say about Ukraine? 3. How do lawmakers behave? 4. Does Trump spell out a legislative plan? 5. Which version of Trump shows up? ▶ Read more on what to watch for in Trump’s big speech UK’s Starmer says Europe is at ‘crossroads in history’ as leaders agree to steps to Ukraine peace British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rallied his European counterparts Sunday to shore up their borders and throw their full weight behind Ukraine as he announced outlines of a plan to end Russia’s war. 'Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can, bringing different capabilities and support to the table, but all taking responsibility to act, all stepping up their own share of the burden,' he said. Starmer’s exhortation to 18 fellow leaders that they need to do the heavy lifting for their own security comes two days after U.S. backing of Ukraine appeared in jeopardy when Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy. Starmer said he had worked with France and Ukraine on a plan to end the war and that the group of leaders — mostly from Europe — had agreed on four things. The steps toward peace would: 6. keep aid flowing to Kyiv 7. maintain economic pressure on Russia to strengthen Ukraine’s hand 8. make sure Ukraine is at the bargaining table and any peace deal must ensure its sovereignty and security 9. continue to arm Ukraine to deter future invasion ▶ Read more about Starmer’s meeting with European leaders Following Trump’s lead, his allies lash out at Ukraine’s Zelenskyy and suggest he may need to resign President Donald Trump’s senior aides and allies lashed out at Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy from Washington as he attended a European summit Sunday in London to rally international support for his military’s fight against the Russian invasion. Following Trump’s lead, White House officials and Republicans in Congress used news show appearances to demand that Zelenskyy display more gratitude for U.S. support and an openness to potential war-ending concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some suggested Zelenskyy should consider resigning even as Ukrainians rally around him. But they offered little clarity as to what Zelenskyy and Ukraine could do after Friday’s Oval Office meeting in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated him before canceling the signature of an economic agreement between Washington and Kyiv. The dispute leaves the future of that relationship in question, as well as the prospects for ending a conflict that began when the Kremlin invaded in February 2022. ▶ Read more about the European summit on Ukraine	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-the-latest-trump-and-his-allies-lash-out-at-ukraines-zelenskyy-and-suggest-he-may-need-to-resign/	2025-03-03T07:17:00-08:00	
European leaders hold summit for Ukraine	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) – The fallout continues after President Donald Trump's Oval Office blowup with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president was quickly ushered out of the White House on Friday. President Trump called him 'disrespectful'. President Zelenskyy spent the weekend in Europe. The U.K.’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted European leaders to show support for Ukraine. Starmer says he spoke with President Trump after the Oval Office dust-up between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Democrats and Republicans were divided on who's to blame. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz blamed Zelenskyy. 'He found every opportunity to Ukraine-splain on every issue. Then he confronts the Vice President,' said Rubio. Democrats blamed President Trump and Vice President JD Vance. 'Either it was an ambushed setup, or they just got so hot-headed,' said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Senator James Lankford (R-Okla.) responded to calls from some in his own party for Zelenskyy to step down. 'Quite frankly I think that would spiral Ukraine into chaos right now,' said Lankford. President Trump and President Zelenskyy were supposed to sign a minerals agreement, a chance for Ukraine to pay back the U.S. for support in the war and President Trump says it would've moved Ukraine and Russia closer to peace. President Zelenskyy says he's still willing to sign the deal.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/european-leaders-hold-summit-for-ukraine/	2025-03-03T04:59:03-08:00	
With the Gaza ceasefire in limbo, Israel tries to impose an alter...	Israel this week introduced what it said was a new U.S. ceasefire plan — different from the one it agreed to in January — and is trying to force Hamas to accept it by imposing a siege on the Gaza Strip. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to it as the 'Witkoff proposal,' saying it came from U.S. President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff. But the White House has yet to confirm that, saying only that it supports whatever action Israel takes. Netanyahu's remarks came a day after the first phase of the negotiated ceasefire ended, with no clarity on what would come next since the agreement's second phase has not yet been hammered out. The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group's main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase. Hamas has accused Israel of trying to sabotage the existing agreement, which called for the two sides to negotiate the return of the remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire. But no substantive negotiations have been held. On Sunday, Israel halted all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza’s population of some 2 million people and vowed 'additional consequences' if Hamas did not embrace the new proposal. Arab leaders are meanwhile finalizing a separate plan for postwar Gaza to counter Trump's suggestion that its population be relocated so it can be transformed into a tourist destination. But all bets are off if the war resumes. The existing agreement is in limbo The ceasefire reached in January, after more than a year of negotiations mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, laid out a three-phase plan to return all the hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, and ending the war triggered by the attack. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage. More than 100 were released in an earlier ceasefire. Israeli forces rescued eight and recovered dozens of bodies before the current ceasefire took hold. During the first, six-week phase, Hamas released 25 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces withdrew from most of Gaza and allowed an influx of desperately needed humanitarian aid. Each side accused the other of violations, but the deal held. Phase 2 was always going to be far more difficult because it would force Israel to choose between securing the return the hostages and annihilating Hamas — two of Netanyahu's main war goals. Hamas, which remains in control of Gaza, has said it will only release the remaining hostages if Israel ends the war. But that would leave the militant group intact and with major influence over the territory, even if it hands over formal power to other Palestinians, as it says it is willing to do. The new plan favors Israel Hamas still has 59 hostages, 35 of whom are believed to be dead. Under the so-called Witkoff plan, it would release half the hostages on the first day — apparently without getting anything new in return. The sides would then have around six weeks — through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover holiday ending April 20 — to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and the return of the remaining hostages. But with fewer hostages, Hamas' hand would be weakened, and Israel and the United States are already speaking about new conditions — like the disarmament of Hamas or the exile of its leadership — that were not part of the original agreement. A political lifeline for Netanyahu Netanyahu's narrow coalition is beholden to far-right allies who want to eliminate Hamas, depopulate Gaza through what they refer to as 'voluntary emigration' and rebuild Jewish settlements in the territory. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has threatened to bring down the government if Netanyahu enters Phase 2 of the existing agreement and does not resume the war. The new plan would buy Netanyahu six weeks of breathing room and enough time to pass a budget by the end of the month — something he must do to keep his government from automatically falling. If it falls, elections would be held roughly a year and a half ahead of schedule and could see him removed from power. Opposition parties say they would ensure Netanyahu's government is not brought down over a deal that returns the rest of the hostages. But that would still weaken him politically. The American position is unclear Netanyahu says his government has 'fully coordinated' its approach with the Trump administration, which has publicly endorsed Israel's war goals, including the eradication of Hamas. But Witkoff has not said a word in public about the plan that supposedly bears his name. Trump himself has sent mixed signals about Gaza. As a candidate, he pledged to end wars in the Middle East, and he took credit for pushing the ceasefire agreement past the finish line just before his inauguration. But he has also expressed revulsion at Hamas' treatment of the captives and suggested that 'all hell' should break loose if they are not immediately returned, while leaving that decision to Israel. An Arab counterproposal to Trump's Gaza plan Trump has also floated the idea of relocating Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians to other countries so the U.S. can rebuild it as a tourist destination. Netanyahu welcomed that proposal, which was universally rejected by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who warn it could violate international law. It's hard to see how Trump's Gaza plan would be carried out without Israel resuming the war and launching an even bloodier offensive than the last one, which left much of Gaza in ruins and killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. They say more than half of those killed were women and children but do not specify how many of the dead were combatants. Egypt has developed a counterproposal expected to be endorsed at an Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday. Under its plan, Palestinians would remain in Gaza and relocate to 'safe zones' while cities are rebuilt. Hamas would hand over power to a transitional authority of political independents while the international community works to empower the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. But Israel, which has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza, is unlikely to accept such a plan. And while Trump has called on Arab countries to come up with their own proposal, it's unclear whether he would go for it either. ___ Associated Press writers Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-with-the-gaza-ceasefire-in-limbo-israel-tries-to-impose-an-alternative-plan-on-hamas/	2025-03-03T04:37:41-08:00	
Conan O'Brien swipes at Trump with 'Anora' joke: Americans 'excit...	(The Hill) — Conan O'Brien seemingly took a knock at President Donald Trump at the Oscars, saying audiences are happy to see fictional film characters stand up to 'a powerful Russian.' 'You know 'Anora' is having a good night,' O'Brien, the host of the 97th annual Academy Awards, said during the ceremony in Los Angeles on Sunday. 'That's great news. Two wins already,' the comedian said of the movie, which is about a sex worker who marries a Russian oligarch's son. 'I guess Americans are excited to see somebody finally stand up to a powerful Russian,' O'Brien deadpanned to applause from the audience. Without naming him, the quip appeared to be a swipe at Trump, following a tense Oval Office meeting on Friday between the president, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the sometimes-heated and explosive exchange, Trump and Zelensky argued over U.S. support for Ukraine. Several Republican political figures, including GOP strategist Karl Rove and Rep. Mike Lawler (N.Y.), have publicly criticized the clash between Trump and Zelensky, saying the only winner of the contentious meeting was Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'Anora' secured the Oscar for best picture on Sunday as director Sean Baker won the award for director, best original screenplay, and film editing. Mikey Madison also won best actress for her role in 'Anora.'

No Other Land' Oscar winners call for a different path on Israel...	LOS ANGELES (The Hill) — The filmmakers behind 'No Other Land,' which won the Oscar for best documentary, called for a different path forward to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in their acceptance speech Sunday. 'There is a different path, a political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people,' said Israeli filmmaker Yuval Abraham, in his acceptance speech. 'And I have to say, as I am here, the foreign policy in this country is helping to block this path,' Abraham continued, knocking President Trump’s approach to foreign policy.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) The film is a collaboration between Israelis and Palestinians, and it follows activist Basel Adra as he documents the destruction of his hometown at the southern edge of the West Bank, which Israeli soldiers are tearing down to use as a military training zone, according to The Associated Press. Adra then befriends a Jewish Israeli journalist to help tell his story. 'We made this film, Palestinians and Israelis, because together, our voices are stronger. We see each other, the atrocious destruction of Gaza and its people, which must end, the Israeli hostages brutally taken in the crime of October 7, which must be freed,' Abraham said on stage. 'When I look at Basel, I see my brother, but we are unequal,' he continued. 'We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law, and Basel is under military laws that destroy his life, and he cannot control.' Adra, on stage, said that two months ago, he became a father and said he hopes his daughter 'will not have to live the same life I’m living now, always fearing settlers, violence, home demolitions and forcible displacements.' 'We call on the world to take serious actions to stop injustice and to stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people,' Adra added in his speech. The documentary, which was filmed over four years between 2019 and 2023, wrapped production just days before Hamas launched its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, precipitating the ongoing war.

Israel cuts off Gaza aid to pressure Hamas to accept a new ceasef...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel stopped the entry of all goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip on Sunday and warned of 'additional consequences' if Hamas doesn’t accept a new proposal to extend a fragile ceasefire, while key mediator Egypt accused Israel of using 'starvation as a weapon.' Hamas accused Israel of trying to derail the ceasefire agreement hours after its first phase ended. It called the decision to cut off aid 'cheap extortion, a war crime and a blatant attack' on the truce, which took hold in January after over a year of negotiations. Both sides stopped short of saying the ceasefire had ended. LATEST: Israel and Hamas conflict The first phase, which included a surge in humanitarian assistance after months of growing hunger in the territory, expired on Saturday. The two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, in which Hamas was to release dozens of remaining hostages in return for an Israeli pullout from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire. Talks should have begun a month ago. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty condemned Israel’s decision as 'a flagrant and clear violation of humanitarian law' and called for the immediate implementation of the second phase. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has facilitated the releases of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, said the ceasefire has saved countless lives, and 'any unraveling of the forward momentum created over the last six weeks risks plunging people back into despair.' Israel described the new proposal as a U.S. one. There was no immediate comment from the United States, and it was not clear when U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, expected to visit the region last week, would arrive. UK, France and Ukraine agree to work on ceasefire plan for Russia’s war in Ukraine Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that under the existing agreements, Israel could resume fighting after the first phase if it believes negotiations are ineffective. He said the ceasefire would only continue if Hamas keeps releasing hostages, telling his Cabinet 'there will be no free lunches.' He said Israel was 'fully coordinated' with President Donald Trump’s administration. Getting the Israel-Hamas ceasefire to the next phase will be difficult. Here’s why The war has left most of Gaza’s population of over 2 million dependent on international aid. Hundreds of aid trucks had entered Gaza daily since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, easing fears of famine raised by international experts. But residents said prices doubled as word of the closure spread. 'Everyone is worried,' said Sayed al-Dairi in Gaza City. 'This is not a life.' Fayza Nassar, in the heavily destroyed urban Jabaliya refugee camp, said the closure would worsen already dire conditions. 'There will be famine and chaos,' she said. Hamas warns of consequences for hostages Israel said the new proposal called for extending the ceasefire through Ramadan — the Muslim holy month that began over the weekend — and the Jewish Passover holiday, which ends on April 20. Syrians begin fasting during first Ramadan without Assad family rule in decades Under that proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, Netanyahu said. Hamas warned that any attempt to delay or cancel the ceasefire agreement would have 'humanitarian consequences' for the hostages. It reiterated that the only way to free them is through implementing the existing deal. Hamas has said it is willing to free the hostages all at once in Phase 2, but only in return for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. An Egyptian official said Hamas and Egypt would not accept a new proposal aimed at returning the remaining hostages without ending the war. The official, who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said mediators were trying to resolve the dispute. Ceasefire marred by disputes Under the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, including some serving life sentences for deadly attacks and others held without charge. Israeli forces pulled back from most of Gaza, and Israel allowed a surge of humanitarian aid to enter. The first phase was marred by repeated disputes. Israeli strikes killed dozens of Palestinians who the military said had approached its forces or entered areas in violation of the truce. On Sunday, Israel carried out an airstrike on Palestinians it said were planting an explosive device in northern Gaza near the border. Gaza’s Health Ministry said two men were killed and that Israeli fire killed two other people elsewhere. Hamas paraded most captives — some of them emaciated — before crowds in spectacles that Israel and the United Nations said were cruel and degrading. And it initially returned the wrong set of remains instead of those of a mother who was killed in captivity along with her two young children. Israel sought to restrict public celebrations over released Palestinian prisoners, and some were freed wearing shirts emblazoned with a Star of David and the phrase 'Never forgive, never forget' in Arabic. Some people threw their sweatshirts on the ground and burned them. Israel accused of blocking aid Israel imposed a siege on Gaza in the war’s opening days and only eased it under U.S. pressure. U.N. agencies and aid groups accused Israel of not facilitating enough aid during 15 months of war. The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used 'starvation as a method of warfare' when it issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu last year. The allegation is also central to South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide. Israel has denied the accusations and rejected both court actions as being biased. Israel says it has allowed in enough aid and blamed shortages on what it called the U.N.’s inability to distribute it. Israel accused Hamas of siphoning off aid. Kenneth Roth, the former head of Human Rights Watch, said Israel as an occupying power has an 'absolute duty' to facilitate humanitarian aid under the Geneva Conventions and called Israel’s decision 'a resumption of the war-crime starvation strategy' that led to the ICC warrant. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostage. The militants currently hold 59 hostages, 35 of them believed to be dead.

UK, France and Ukraine agree to work on ceasefire plan for Russia...	LONDON (AP) — Britain, France and Ukraine have agreed to work on a ceasefire plan to present to the United States, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday as European leaders assembled in London to discuss ending the war. The meeting has been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by U.S. President Donald Trump, who blasted him Friday at the White House as being ungrateful for U.S. support against the invasion by Russia. But Starmer said he's focused on being a bridge to restore peace talks, whose collapse he used as an opportunity to re-engage with Trump, Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron rather than 'ramp up the rhetoric.' 'We’ve now agreed that the United Kingdom, along with France and possibly one or two others, will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, and then we’ll discuss that plan with the United States,' Starmer told the BBC. Starmer and Macron have both spoken to Trump since Friday. Sunday's meeting an important step The London meeting has taken on greater importance in defending the war-torn ally and shoring up the continent’s defenses. Sunday’s summit is likely to include talks on establishing a European military force to be sent to Ukraine to underpin a ceasefire. Starmer said it would involve 'a coalition of the willing.' Starmer said he does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin but does trust Trump. 'Do I believe Donald Trump when he says he wants lasting peace? The answer to that is yes,' he said. Starmer said there are 'intense discussions' to get a security guarantee from the U.S. 'If there is to be a deal, if there is to be a stopping of the fighting, then that agreement has to be defended, because the worst of all outcomes is that there is a temporary pause and then (Russian President Vladimir) Putin comes again,' Starmer said. 'That has happened in the past, I think it is a real risk, and that is why we must ensure that if there’s a deal, it is a lasting deal, not a temporary pause.' The three essentials Starmer listed for a successful peace deal were: arming the Ukrainians to put them in a position of strength; including a European element to guarantee security; and providing a 'U.S. backstop,' to prevent Putin from breaking promises. 'That’s the package. All three parts need to be in place, and that’s what I’m working hard to bring together,' Starmer said. Starmer hosted the meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace, following a charm offensive last week to persuade Trump to put Ukraine at the center of negotiations and tilt his allegiances toward Europe. Leaders from France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Canada, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania will be at the summit. The Turkish foreign minister, NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council were in attendance. European leaders backing Zelenskyy Zelenskyy received broad support from leaders across Europe after the White House fiasco, an exceptional attack on an ally broadcast on live television. Starmer embraced Zelenskyy as he arrived at the meeting Sunday, one of the final arrivals. Europe has been anxious since Trump initiated direct peace talks with Putin, who had been isolated by most Western leaders since invading Ukraine three years ago. The scramble to remain relevant and protect European interests as their once stalwart ally appeared to be cozying up to Putin was even more troubling when Trump called Zelenskyy a dictator and falsely said Ukraine started the war. Meetings in recent days had provided some hope — until Zelenskyy’s visit to the White House. Visits to the Oval Office by Macron, who had declared his visit a 'turning point,' and Starmer were seen as steps in the right direction. The meetings were cordial and Trump even took a gentler tone toward Ukraine, though he would not commit to providing U.S. security guarantees and maintained Europe would need to provide peacekeeping troops. Within 12 hours of Starmer's return from Washington, the talk of peace seemed to collapse as Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy for challenging Trump's assertions that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be trusted. 'Starmer did an impressive job of asserting Europe’s agency in the war on Ukraine and conveying to President Trump that Europe is willing and able to take a leading role in implementing any credible peace deal,' said Rachel Ellehuus, director-general of Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank. 'Unfortunately, Friday’s White House meeting was a major step backward.' Ukraine can no longer count on military or political support from the U.S. after Trump declared himself neutral in negotiations, Ellehuus said. She said Europe needs to step in and could release some 200 billion euros ($207 billion) in seized Russian assets to help fund that effort. 'The immediate goal of the meetings in London must be to keep Ukraine in the fight so it can negotiate from a maximum position of strength,' she said. Pledge to increase military spending Starmer pledged this week to boost military spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027. Other European nations may follow suit. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said Saturday that Europe faces a historic test and has to look after itself. He said European countries have to increase their arms spending to reach at least 3% of GDP. 'If we don’t increase our effort fast enough and let the aggressor dictate its conditions, we won’t end up well,' he said. Macron, who said it was legitimate for the U.S. to shift its focus to dealing with China and Asia, also called for more defense spending as he called for unity. 'We should have woken up earlier,' Macron said. 'I’ve been saying for years that we need a more sovereign, more united, more independent Europe.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/uk-france-and-ukraine-agree-to-work-on-ceasefire-plan-for-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2025-03-02T07:02:05-08:00	
Ukrainians rally around Zelenskyy as defender of national interes...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Soon after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy left the White House on Friday after an astonishing Oval Office blowout with President Donald Trump, Ukrainians rallied around Zelenskyy as a defender of his country's interests. The shouting match that unfolded in the final minutes of the highly anticipated meeting between the two leaders seemed to dash, at least for now, Ukrainian hopes that the United States could be locked in as a reliable partner in helping fend off, and conclude, Russia's three-year onslaught. The exchange, which saw a frustrated Zelenskyy lectured by Trump and Vice President JD Vance over what they saw as his lack of gratitude for previous U.S. support, delighted officials in Moscow, who saw it as a final breakdown in relations between Washington and the Ukrainian leader. ‘Zelenskyy fought like a lion’ But many Ukrainians on Friday seemed unfazed by the blowout between Zelenskyy and Trump, expressing a sense that the Ukrainian leader had stood up for their country’s dignity and interests by firmly maintaining his stance in the face of chiding from some of the world’s most powerful men. Nataliia Serhiienko, 67, a retiree in Kyiv, said she thinks Ukrainians approve of their president's performance in Washington, 'because Zelenskyy fought like a lion.' 'They had a heated meeting, a very heated conversation,' she said. But Zelenskyy 'was defending Ukraine’s interests.' The meeting at the White House was meant to produce a bilateral agreement that would establish a joint investment fund for reconstructing Ukraine, a deal that was seen as a potential step toward bringing an end to the war and tying the two countries' economies together for years to come. But as Zelenskyy and his team departed the White House at Trump's request, the deal went unsigned, and Ukraine's hopes for securing U.S. security backing seemed farther away than ever. Yet as the Ukrainian leader was set to return to Kyiv empty handed, his support at home seemed undiminished. Vitalyna Tarasova, a 43-year old English teacher in Kyiv and the widow of a Ukrainian soldier, told The Associated Press that Trump and Vance’s treatment of Zelenskyy amounted to humiliating 'all the dead and all these children who have lost their parents' in the war-weary country. 'My husband was a military pilot. He burned alive, his plane was shot down… So yesterday they spat at him, at me, at my children, and it was very painful to watch,' she said. Regional Ukrainian leader says president ‘held strong’ As two drones struck Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv on Friday night, the head of the region which sits on the border with Russia, Oleh Syniehubov, praised Zelenskyy. He said the president held strong to his insistence that no peace deal could be made without assurances for Ukraine's security against future Russian aggression. 'Our leader, despite the pressure, stands firm in defending the interests of Ukraine and Ukrainians. … We need only a just peace with security guarantees,' Syniehubov said. Kyiv resident Artem Vasyliev, 37, said he had seen 'complete disrespect' from the United States in the Oval Office exchange, despite the fact that Ukraine 'was the first country that stood up to Russia.' 'We are striving for democracy, and we are met with total disrespect, toward our warriors, our soldiers, and the people of our country,' said Vasyliev, a native of Russian-occupied Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Vasyliev criticized the U.S. president for what he said was a failure to recognize the human cost of Russia’s invasion, saying Trump 'doesn’t understand that people are dying, that cities are being destroyed, people are suffering, mothers, children, soldiers.' 'He cannot understand this, he is just a businessman. For him, money is sacred,' he said. Broad praise for Zelenskyy on social media Ukrainian social media was awash in praise for Zelenskyy late Friday, with officials on the national, regional and local level chiming in to voice their support for their leader. The outpouring resembled a recent surge in Ukrainian unity after Trump denigrated Zelenskyy by making false claims that Ukraine was led by a 'dictator' who started the war with Russia — comments that led some of the Ukrainian president's harshest critics to rally around him. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of Ukraine's southern Kherson region, which was mostly occupied by Russia early in the war but later partially retaken by Ukrainian forces, said three years of war had hardened his countrymen to the ups and downs of the fight to survive. 'We know what pressure is, on the front lines, in politics, in daily struggle,' Prokudin said. 'It has made us stronger. It has made the president stronger. Determination is the force that drives us forward. And I am confident that we will endure this time as well.' Trump's administration cast the heated exchange with Zelenskyy as part of its 'America First' policy and slammed the Ukrainian leader for a perceived lack of gratitude for U.S. assistance. But Zelenskyy's backers in Ukraine praised his commitment to acting in Ukraine's national interest — even if it meant coming into conflict with the president of the United States. 'Unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s interests and devotion to his country. This is what we saw today in the United States. Support for the President of Ukraine,' Vice Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba wrote on Telegram Friday. Not all of Ukraine's political figures, however, were as full-throated in their praise for how the Oval Office meeting concluded. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that he hoped 'that Ukraine does not lose the support of the United States, which is extremely important to us.' 'Today is not the time for emotions, from either side. We need to find common ground,' Klitschko wrote in a post on Telegram. Russians predict bleak future for Ukrainian leader In Moscow, a resident told the Associated Press that Zelenskyy 'got what he deserved.' 'I think that he’s in for some very, very difficult times' at home, Sergei Boldarev argued. 'I think the internal attacks on him will intensify.' Russian state TV described the row between Trump and Zelenskyy as 'a complete failure for Kyiv,' and speculated that Washington would soon stop military aid to Ukraine. 'Scandal, humiliation, shame and disaster - this is how Western journalists describe it. After a squabble in the Oval Office, the Ukrainian delegation was literally kicked out of the White House,' said Olga Armyakova, a presenter on the Rossiya 1 channel. ___ Associated Press writers Hanna Arhirova and Illia Novikov contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-after-oval-office-blowout-ukrainians-rally-around-zelenskyy-as-defender-of-ukraines-interests/	2025-03-01T09:12:42-08:00	
WATCH: Trump shouts at Zelenskyy as he and Vance berate Ukrainian...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump shouted at Ukraine's leader on Friday during an extraordinary meeting in the Oval Office, berating President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for 'gambling with millions of lives' and suggesting his actions could trigger World War III. Zelenskyy then abruptly left the White House without signing a critical minerals deal with the U.S. that Trump had demanded and suggested was a condition for future support for Ukraine. Untouched salad plates and other lunch items were being packed up outside the Cabinet room where the lunch between Trump and Zelenskyy and their delegations was supposed to have taken place. The last 10 minutes of the nearly 45-minute engagement devolved into a tense back and forth between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Zelenskyy — who had urged skepticism about Russia’s commitment to diplomacy, citing Moscow’s years of broken commitments on the global stage. It began with Vance telling Zelenskyy, 'Mr. President, with respect. I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.' Zelenskyy tried to object, prompting Trump to raise his voice and say, 'You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people.' 'You’re gambling with World War III, and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have,' Trump said. Watch the full final 10 minutes of the Oval Office remarks in the video player below: It was an astonishing display of open antagonism in the Oval Office, a setting better known for somber diplomacy. Trump laid bare his efforts to coerce Zelenskyy to agree to giving the U.S. an interest in his country’s valuable minerals and to push him toward a diplomatic resolution to the war on the American leader’s terms. Earlier in the meeting Trump said the U.S. would continue to provide military assistance to Ukraine, but said he hoped that not too much aid would be forthcoming. 'We’re not looking forward to sending a lot of arms,' Trump said. 'We’re looking forward to getting the war finished so we can do other things.' Trump suggested that Zelenskyy wasn't in a position to be demanding concessions. 'You’re not in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now,' Trump said pointing his finger toward Zelenskyy. 'With us you start having cards.' He also accused Zelenskyy of being 'disrespectful' to the U.S. 'It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,' Trump told Zelenskyy at one point, as the two leaders talked over each other about past international support for Ukraine. 'Again, just say thank you,' Vance interjected to Zelenskyy, blasting him for litigating 'disagreements' in front of the press. Trump, though, suggested he was fine with the drama. 'I think it’s good for the American people to see what’s going on,' he added. 'You're not acting at all thankful,' Trump said, before adding, 'This is going to be great television.' The harsh words came at a pivotal and precarious moment for Ukraine. Zelenskyy had planned to try to convince the White House to provide some form of U.S. backing for Ukraine's security against any future Russian aggression. Zelenskyy had been expected to sign a landmark economic agreement with the U.S. aimed at financing the reconstruction of war-damaged Ukraine, a deal that would closely tie the two countries together for years to come. The deal, which is seen as a step toward ending the three-year war, referenced the importance of Ukraine’s security. Earlier in the meeting, before tempers flared, Trump said the agreement would be signed soon in the East Room of the White House. 'We have something that is a very fair deal,' Trump said, adding, 'It is a big commitment from the United States.' He said the U.S. wants to see the killing in the war stopped, adding that U.S. money for Ukraine should be 'put to different kinds of use like rebuilding.' Earlier, Zelenskyy called Russian President Vladimir Putin a terrorist and told Trump that Ukraine and the world need 'no compromises with a killer.' 'Even during the war there are rules,' he said. As Ukrainian forces hold out against slow but steady advances by Russia’s larger and better-equipped army, leaders in Kyiv have pushed to ensure a potential U.S.-brokered peace plan would include guarantees for the country’s future security. Many Ukrainians fear that a hastily negotiated peace — especially one that makes too many concessions to Russian demands — would allow Moscow to rearm and consolidate its forces for a future invasion after current hostilities cease. According to the preliminary economic agreement, seen by The Associated Press, the U.S. and Ukraine will establish a co-owned, jointly managed investment fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of future revenues from natural resources, including minerals, hydrocarbons and other extractable materials. Speaking about the rare earths agreement, Trump said the U.S. is lacking in many such minerals while Ukraine has among the best on the planet. He said U.S. interests plan to take those reserves and use them on everything from artificial intelligence operations to military weapons. Asked about long-term security guarantee to guard against future Russian aggression, Trump says once the agreement is signed that a return to fighting was unlikely. Trump, a Republican, has framed the emerging agreement as a chance for Kyiv to compensate the U.S. for wartime aid sent under his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden. But Zelenskyy has remained firm that specific assurances for Ukraine’s security must accompany any agreement giving U.S. access to Ukraine’s resources. This was Zelenskyy’s fifth White House visit, but his previous four came during the Biden administration. The Ukrainian president also was meeting with U.S. senators during his time in Washington. Fears that Trump could broker a peace deal with Russia that is unfavorable to Ukraine have been amplified by recent precedent-busting actions by his administration. Trump held a lengthy phone call with Putin, and U.S. officials met with their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia without inviting European or Ukrainian leaders — both dramatic breaks with previous U.S. policy to isolate Putin over his invasion. Trump later seemed to falsely blame Ukraine for starting the war, and called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' for not holding elections after the end of his regular term last year, though Ukrainian law prohibits elections while martial law is in place.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/at-meeting-with-trump-zelenskyy-will-seek-security-assurances-against-future-russian-aggression/	2025-02-28T08:34:03-08:00	
President Trump set to meet with President Zelenskyy	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) – A high-stakes diplomatic meeting is set to take place in Washington Friday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet with President Donald Trump. The visit comes at a crucial moment for Ukraine’s future. President Trump and President Zelenskyy will meet to discuss a critical minerals agreement and ongoing peace negotiations with Russia. 'I think we're going to have a very good meeting,' said Trump. The face-to-face meeting comes after weeks of tension between the two leaders, with President Trump at one point calling Zelenskyy a dictator. 'Did a say that? I can't believe I said that…', said Trump. The two will discuss a deal that would grant the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, a key resource for high-tech industries. The meeting also comes as Ukraine faces growing pressure to negotiate an end to its war with Russia. 'I think we're going to have a very successful peace, and I think it's going to be a long-lasting peace. And, I think it's going to happen hopefully quickly,' said Trump. On Thursday President Trump hosted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer they talked about a resolution to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. The meeting with President Trump and President Zelenskyy is expected to take place at 11am eastern time.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/president-trump-set-to-meet-with-president-zelenskyy/	2025-02-28T04:23:29-08:00	
Trump on calling Zelensky a dictator: 'Did I say that?'	President Trump on Thursday backtracked on his recent sharp criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as the U.S. aims to strike a deal to end the war between Kyiv and Moscow. Trump, during an Oval Office meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, tempered his comments about Zelensky, including a social media post last week in which Trump called Zelensky a 'dictator with elections.' When asked by a reporter whether he still believed Zelensky was a dictator, Trump responded: 'Did I say that? I can’t believe I said that. Next question.' 'We want to work with him, President Zelensky … and we will work with him,' Trump said. 'I think the president and I actually have had a very good relationship. It maybe got a little bit testy because we wanted to have a little bit of what the European nations had.' Trump has repeatedly claimed European aid for Ukraine was in the form of a loan, while the U.S. provided aid that it would not recoup. Starmer, like French President Emmanuel Macron did alongside Trump on Monday, interjected to note that much of Europe's assistance for Ukraine was a 'gift.' View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Hill (@thehill) Trump has in recent days become increasingly critical of Zelensky as U.S. officials pushed for a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Trump last week raised eyebrows when he called Zelensky a 'dictator without elections,' claimed he was doing a 'terrible job' and suggested he was responsible for the start of the war. At one point, Trump said he did not think it was important for Zelensky to be part of meetings on peace negotiations because the Ukrainian leader 'has no cards.' Monday marked three years since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February after amassing troops on the border and demanding a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO. The invasion took place nearly a decade after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Zelensky is slated to visit the White House on Friday as the two countries finalize an agreement that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine’s critical minerals supply. Proponents of the deal have suggested the economic partnership would give the U.S. a vested interest in protecting Ukraine against future threats from Russia. Trump campaigned on ending the war in Ukraine, and he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month in an effort to kickstart ceasefire talks. Trump said Ukraine joining NATO was 'not gonna happen.' Asked Thursday whether he thought he could trust Putin, Trump said he thought the Russian leader would keep his word. 'Trust and verify, let's call it that. … You have to verify, because you never know what’s going to happen. I know a lot of people you’d say, ‘No chance that they would ever deceive you,’ and they’re the worst people in the world,' Trump told reporters. 'You never know what you're getting,' he added. 'No, I have confidence that if we make a deal, it's going to hold.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/trump-on-calling-zelensky-a-dictator-did-i-say-that/	2025-02-27T11:21:24-08:00	
North Korea appears to have sent more troops to Russia to back it...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s spy agency said Thursday that North Korea appears to have sent additional troops to Russia, after its soldiers deployed on the Russian-Ukraine fronts suffered heavy casualties. The National Intelligence Service said in a brief statement it was trying to determine exactly how many more troops North Korea has deployed to Russia. The NIS also assessed that North Korean troops were redeployed at fronts in Russia’s Kursk region in the first week of February, following a reported temporary withdrawal from the area. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an address on Feb. 7, confirmed a new Ukrainian offensive in Kursk and said North Korean troops were fighting alongside Russian forces there. North Korea has been supplying a vast amount of conventional weapons to Russia, and last fall it sent about 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia as well, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukraine intelligence officials. North Korean soldiers are highly disciplined and well trained, but observers say they’ve become easy targets for drone and artillery attacks on Russian-Ukraine battlefields due to their lack of combat experience and unfamiliarity with the terrain. In January, the NIS said about 300 North Korean soldiers had died and another 2,700 had been injured. Zelenskyy earlier put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 4,000, though U.S. estimates were lower at around 1,200. Earlier Thursday, South Korea’s JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, citing unidentified sources, reported that an additional 1,000-3,000 North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk between January and February. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners worry that Russia could reward North Korea by transferring high-tech weapons technologies that can sharply enhance its nuclear weapons program. North Korea is expected to receive economic and other assistance from Russia as well. During talks in Saudi Arabia last week, Russia and the U.S. agreed to start working toward ending the war and improving their diplomatic and economic ties. Ukrainian officials weren’t present at the talks. That marked an extraordinary shift in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump and a clear departure from U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia over its war in Ukraine. Observers say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could send more troops to Russia to win further Russian assistance before the war ends. ___ This story has been edited to reflect that the NIS statement was released on Thursday, not Wednesday.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-north-korea-appears-to-have-sent-more-troops-to-russia-to-back-its-war-against-ukraine-seoul-says/	2025-02-27T02:25:04-08:00	
Why the Trump administration may want Ukraine's minerals	DETROIT (AP) — The United States will have access to Ukraine's critical mineral wealth, including key ingredients for the clean energy transition, under a deal the two countries are expected to sign later this week. President Donald Trump, who has pushed for the agreement, has long been critical of a transition to green energies, which include wind and solar power, along with electrification of transportation and appliances, all things that require the various minerals the U.S. will have access to in this deal. So if Trump is against this trend, why go after these minerals? The quick answer could be they're used in a lot of other things, too. Here's a closer look: Ukraine's mineral wealth Countries vary in which minerals they deem strategically critical. The U.S. Department of the Interior has designated 50, and Ukraine has more than 20 of those. Deposits of titanium, which is in high demand, are spread across the country. Titanium is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, for marine uses, chemical processing and medical devices. Ukraine has lithium, key to several current battery technologies, and it has uranium, used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. The country also has graphite and manganese, both used in batteries for electric vehicles. Still, the data on Ukraine's geology is incomplete, according to Tom Moerenhout, adjunct associate professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. The maps date back to when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, which dissolved in 1991. So it's not clear how easy or profitable it will be to get the desired materials out of the ground. 'It’s one thing to have a deal that talks about how might we manage their extraction and their revenue,' Moerenhout said of the agreement. 'It’s another thing entirely to actually have extractive projects, to actually have mining operations going on, and that is something that the deal does not guarantee.' Some of the mineral riches lie in parts of the country currently occupied by Russia. Ukraine's rare earth metals Rare earths are a subset of critical minerals; there are 17 of them, and not one is a common word. For example, ytterbium and promethium are rare earths. Rare earths are important for many kinds of technology and electronics, including medical care, military, aerospace as well as clean energy uses. Ytterbium is used in infrared lasers, chemical reactions, rechargeable batteries and fiber optics. Lanthanum is used in batteries, specialty glass for eyeglasses and and camera lenses and in petroleum refining. A single piece of military equipment can require hundreds of pounds of a rare earth. Contrary to their name, rare earths are not necessarily rare. However, they do often occur in low concentrations, making processing complicated. It's mainly China that excels at this processing currently. Geopolitical reasons for interest in Ukraine's supply The Trump administration has steered clear of clean energy policy in favor of its 'energy dominance' agenda, focused on oil and gas. As promised during his campaign, the president's early executive orders slashed support for climate- and clean-energy related technologies, funding and programs. Electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar photovoltaic panels and other clean energy technology require the rare earths for components such as magnets and batteries; broadly, renewable energy and decarbonization are placing high demand on minerals across the globe. But clearly, the uses of the minerals Ukraine has go far beyond the energy transition. And Ukraine has tried hard to interest the new administration in its mineral wealth. Also, China controls much of the world's supply of these materials. Opening access to Ukraine’s supply could reduce U.S. dependence elsewhere. 'To the credit of the first Trump administration, they have always put critical minerals as a very important policy priority because they knew they were so heavily reliant on China,' Moerenhout said. 'That priority for the Trump administration doesn’t change at all because they are less, let’s say, less aggressive about clean energy deployment targets in the future.' ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

Trump says Zelenskyy is coming to the White House to sign US-Ukra...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit the White House on Friday to sign a long-sought minerals deal that will closely tie the two countries together for years to come. Trump made the announcement at the start of the first Cabinet meeting of his second term, hailing the deal as 'a very big agreement.' The Republican president has long complained that the United States has spent too much taxpayer money to support Ukraine in the war with Russia that began when the Kremlin invaded three years ago. Trump has framed the emerging deal that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine's deposits of so-called rare earth minerals — used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries — as a chance for Kyiv to pay back the U.S. for aid already sent for the war effort under Democratic President Joe Biden. 'The previous administration put us in a very bad position, but we’ve been able to make a deal where we’re going to get the money back and and a lot of money in the future,' Trump said. Zelenskyy said a news conference early Wednesday in Kyiv that a framework of an economic deal had been reached, but that it did not yet include U.S. security guarantees, which his country sees as vital. The full agreement could hinge on the upcoming talks in Washington. The framework is a preliminary step toward a comprehensive package that will be subject to ratification by the Ukrainian parliament, Zelenskyy said. Ukraine needs to know first where the U.S. stands on its continued military support, Zelenskyy said. He said he expected a wide-ranging conversation with Trump. The economic agreement 'may be part of future security guarantees, but I want to understand the broader vision. What awaits Ukraine?' Zelensky said. But Trump, in announcing the meeting, was noncommittal about any coming American security guarantees. 'I’m not going to make security guarantees ... very much,' Trump said. 'We're going to have Europe do that.' He said a U.S. presence working on mineral extraction would amount to 'automatic security because nobody’s going to be messing around with our people when we’re there.' 'It’s a great deal for Ukraine too, because they get us over there and we’re going to be working over there,' Trump said. 'We will be on the land.' Trump also said Ukraine 'could forget about' joining NATO, the Western military alliance, and he hopes to soon speak face to face with Russian President Vladimir Putin about reaching an agreement to end the war in Ukraine that began when Moscow invaded in February 2022. The Republican president declined to detail what concessions he would ask the two sides to make, but he underscored his administration’s position that Ukraine’s aspiration to join NATO, the Western military alliance, is not tenable. 'NATO, you can forget about it,' Trump said. 'I think that’s probably the reason the whole thing started.' Since returning to office last month, Trump let Ukraine know that he wanted something in return for tens of billions of dollars in U.S. help for Ukraine. The White House has applied heavy pressure on Ukraine to grant American access to its vast reserves of the minerals. Zelenskyy balked at initial U.S. offers, arguing they did not contain adequate security assurances for Ukraine and that the proposed price tag of $500 billion would saddle generations of Ukrainians with debt. But Kyiv is also keen to use the investments as a way of locking the U.S. into Ukraine’s fate. The latest version of the agreement, seen by The Associated Press, says the U.S. 'supports Ukraine’s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.' It does not spell out any U.S. commitment to provide them. 'Participants will seek to identify any necessary steps to protect mutual investments as defined in the ... agreement,' it says. After Zelenskyy spoke, a White House official made clear that accepting the agreement would be a precondition of Trump’s invitation to meet Friday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the invitation. 'This agreement may either be a great success or quietly fade away,' Zelenskyy said. 'And I believe success depends on our conversation with President Trump.' 'I want to coordinate with the U.S.,' Zelenskyy said. Trump has abruptly ditched some previous Washington policies. He scrapped efforts to isolate Putin and cast doubt on U.S. support for its European allies. That has brought momentous geopolitical shifts that could reset the war’s path this year. Diplomats from Russia and the U.S. will meet Thursday in Istanbul to discuss the operation of their respective embassies in Moscow and Washington, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Wednesday. Zelenskyy said he wants to discuss with Trump whether the U.S. plans to halt military aid and, if so, whether Ukraine would be able to purchase weapons directly from the U.S. He also wants to know whether Ukraine can use frozen Russian assets for the purchase of weapons and investments and whether Washington plans to lift sanctions on Russia. The preliminary economic agreement also sets out the terms and conditions of an investment fund for the rebuilding of Ukraine, according to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. ___ Arhirova and Spike reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Desperation grows in northern Gaza as Palestinians struggle to re...	BEIT LAHIYA, Gaza Strip (AP) — When night falls over northern Gaza, much of the cityscape of collapsed buildings and piled wreckage turns pitch black. Living inside the ruins of their home, Rawia Tambora’s young sons get afraid of the dark, so she turns on a flashlight and her phone’s light to comfort them, for as long as the batteries last. Displaced for most of the 16-month-long war, Tambora is back in her house. But it is still a frustrating shell of a life, she says: There is no running water, electricity, heat or services, and no tools to clear the rubble around them. Nearly 600,000 Palestinians flooded back into northern Gaza under the now month-old ceasefire in Gaza, according to the United Nations. After initial relief and joy at being back at their homes — even if damaged or destroyed — they now face the reality of living in the wreckage for the foreseeable future. 'Some people wish the war had never ended, feeling it would have been better to be killed,' Tambora said. 'I don’t know what we’ll do long-term. My brain stopped planning for the future.' The six-week ceasefire is due to end Saturday, and it’s uncertain what will happen next. There are efforts to extend the calm as the next phase is negotiated. If fighting erupts again, those who returned to the north could find themselves once again in the middle of it. A massive rebuilding job has no way to start A report last week by the World Bank, U.N. and European Union estimated it will cost some $53 billion to rebuild Gaza after entire neighborhoods were decimated by Israel’s bombardment and offensives against Hamas militants. At the moment, there is almost no capacity or funding to start significant rebuilding. A priority is making Gaza immediately livable. Earlier in February, Hamas threatened to hold up hostage releases unless more tents and temporary shelters were allowed into Gaza. It then reversed and accelerated hostage releases after Israel agreed to let in mobile homes and construction equipment. Humanitarian agencies have stepped up services, setting up free kitchens and water delivery stations, and distributing tents and tarps to hundreds of thousands across Gaza, according to the U.N. President Donald Trump turned up the pressure by calling for the entire population of Gaza to be removed permanently so the U.S. can take over the territory and redevelop it for others. Rejecting the proposal, Palestinians say they want help to rebuild for themselves. Gaza City’s municipality started fixing some water lines and clearing rubble from streets, said a spokesperson, Asem Alnabih. But it lacks heavy equipment. Only a few of its 40 bulldozers and five dump trucks still work, he said. Gaza is filled with over 50 million tons of rubble that would take 100 trucks working at full capacity over 15 years to clear away, the U.N. estimates. Families try to get by day by day Tambora’s house in the northern town of Beit Lahiya was destroyed by an airstrike early in the war, so she and her family lived in the nearby Indonesian Hospital, where she worked as a nurse. After the ceasefire, they moved back into the only room in her house that was semi-intact. The ceiling is partially collapsed, the walls are cracked; the surviving fridge and sink are useless with no water or electricity. They stack their sheets and blankets in a corner. Tambora said her 12-year-old son lugs heavy containers of water twice a day from distribution stations. They also have to find firewood for cooking. The influx of aid means there is food in the markets and prices went down, but it remains expensive, she said. With the Indonesian Hospital too damaged to function, Tambora walks an hour each day to work at the Kamal Adwan Hospital. She charges her and her husband’s phones using the hospital generator. Many of Tambora’s relatives returned to find nothing left of their homes, so they live in tents on or next to the rubble that gets blown away by winter winds or flooded during rains, she said. Asmaa Dwaima and her family returned to Gaza City but had to rent an apartment because their home in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood was destroyed. It was only weeks after returning that she went to visit their four-story house, now a pile of flattened and burned wreckage. 'I couldn’t come here because I was afraid. I had an image of my house in my mind — its beauty, and warmth. ... I was afraid to face this truth,' the 25-year-old dentist said. 'They don’t just destroy stone, they are destroying us and our identity.' Her family had to rebuild the house once before, when it was leveled by airstrikes during a round of fighting between Israel and Hamas in 2014, she said. For the time being, they have no means to rebuild now. 'We need to remove the rubble because we want to pull out clothes and some of our belongings,' she said. 'We need heavy equipment … There are no bricks or other construction tools and, if available, it’s extremely expensive.' Desperation is growing Tess Ingram, a spokesperson with UNICEF who visited northern Gaza since the ceasefire, said the families she met are 'grieving the lives that they used to live as they begin to rebuild.' Their desperation, she said, 'is becoming more intense.' Huda Skaik, a 20-year-old student, is sharing a room with her three siblings and parents at her grandparents’ house in Gaza City. It’s an improvement from life in the tent camps of central Gaza where they were displaced for much of the war, she said. There, they had to live among strangers, and their tent was washed away by rain. At least here they have walls and are with family, she said. Before the war interrupted, Skaik had just started studying English literature at Gaza’s Islamic University. She is now enrolled in online classes the university is organizing. But the internet is feeble, and her electricity relies on solar panels that don’t always work. 'The worst part is that we’re just now grasping that we lost it all,' she said. 'The destruction is massive, but I’m trying to remain positive.' ___ Khaled reported from Cairo.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-palestinians-struggle-to-restart-their-lives-in-the-ruins-of-gaza/	2025-02-25T04:59:19-08:00	
US refuses to blame Russia for Ukraine war, splitting with Europe...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — In a dramatic shift in transatlantic relations under President Donald Trump, the United States split with its European allies by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in votes on three U.N. resolutions Monday seeking an end to the three-year war. The growing divide follows Trump’s decision to open direct negotiations with Russia on ending the war, dismaying Ukraine and its European supporters by excluding them from the preliminary talks last week. In the U.N. General Assembly, the U.S. joined Russia in voting against a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution that calls out Moscow’s aggression and demands an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops. The U.S. then abstained from voting on its own competing resolution after Europeans. led by France, succeeded in amending it to make clear Russia was the aggressor. The voting was taking place on the third anniversary of Russia's invasion and as Trump was hosting French President Emmanuel Macron in Washington. It was a major setback for the Trump administration in the 193-member world body, whose resolutions are not legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion. The U.S. then pushed for a vote on its original draft in the more powerful U.N. Security Council, where resolutions are legally binding and it has veto power along with Russia, China, Britain and France. The vote in the 15-member council was 10-0 with five European countries abstaining – Britain, France, Denmark, Greece and Slovenia. The dueling resolutions also reflect the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine. In escalating rhetoric, Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator' for not holding elections during wartime, when much of Ukraine is under Russian occupation, its soldiers are on the frontlines and the country is under martial law. Trump also has falsely accused Kyiv of starting the war and warned that he 'better move fast' to negotiate an end to the conflict or risk not having a nation to lead. Zelenskyy responded by saying Trump was living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space.' In a whirlwind of diplomacy, Trump’s meeting with Macron will be followed by a visit on Thursday from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, key U.S. allies who were in lockstep with Washington on Ukraine just over a month ago. They now find themselves on opposite sides on the best pathway for the UN to call for an end to the war. The General Assembly voted 93-18 with 65 abstentions to approve the Ukrainian resolution. The result showed some diminished support for Ukraine, because previous assembly votes saw more than 140 nations condemn Russia’s aggression and demand an immediate withdrawal. The assembly then turned to the U.S.-drafted resolution, which acknowledges 'the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict' and 'implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia,' but never mentions Moscow’s aggression. In a surprise move, France proposed three amendments, which add that the conflict was the result of a 'full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.' The amendments reaffirm the assembly’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity, and call for peace that respects the U.N. Charter. Russia proposed an amendment calling for 'root causes' of the conflict to be addressed. All the amendments were approved and the resolution passed 93-8 with 73 abstentions, with Ukraine voting 'yes,' the U.S. abstaining, and Russia voting 'no.' Both assembly resolutions were supported by U.S. allies in Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, its neighbors Canada and Mexico and European countries, with the exception of Hungary. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa said her country is exercising its 'inherent right to self-defense' following Russia’s invasion, which violates the U.N. Charter’s requirement that countries respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations. 'As we mark three years of this devastation — Russia’s full invasion against Ukraine — we call on all nations to stand firm and to take … the side of the Charter, the side of humanity and the side of just and lasting peace, peace through strength,' she said. Trump has often stated his commitment to bringing 'peace through strength.' Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward warned the council, 'If Russia is allowed to win, we will live in a world where might is right, where borders can be redrawn by force, where aggressors think they can act with impunity.' Denmark’s Lotte Machon, a deputy foreign minister, stressed that in peace negotiations, 'nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, nothing about European security without Europe.' U.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea, meanwhile, said multiple previous U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops 'have failed to stop the war,' which 'has now dragged on for far too long and at far too terrible a cost to the people in Ukraine and Russia and beyond.' 'What we need is a resolution marking the commitment from all U.N. member states to bring a durable end to the war,' Shea said before the vote. In the Security Council, Russia used its veto to prevent European amendments to the U.S. resolution, which is legally blinding but essentially toothless. It only operative paragraph 'Implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.' Shea called it 'a first step, but a crucial one,' saying it 'puts us on the path to peace.' The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body on Ukraine because the Security Council has been paralyzed by Russia’s veto power. It has approved half a dozen resolutions since Russian forces stormed across the border on Feb. 24, 2022. The Ukrainian resolution adopted Monday recalls the need to implement the previous resolutions, singling out the demand that Russia 'immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine.' The resolution reaffirms the assembly’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and also 'that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.' It calls for 'a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine' and it reiterates 'the urgent need to end the war this year.' ___ AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-the-un-will-vote-to-demand-russia-pull-troops-out-of-ukraine-but-the-us-wants-a-softer-approach/	2025-02-24T17:58:45-08:00	
Trump expresses hope Russia's war in Ukraine is nearing an endgam...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump expressed hope that Russia's war in Ukraine is nearing an endgame as he met Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron on the third anniversary of the invasion. But France's leader cautioned that it's crucial that any potential agreement with Moscow does not amount to surrender for Ukraine. Their talks come at a moment of deep uncertainty about the future of transatlantic relations, with Trump transforming American foreign policy and effectively tuning out European leadership as he looks to quickly end the war in Ukraine. While Macron and Trump made nice at the White House, their countries were at loggerheads at the United Nations over resolutions describing Russia as the aggressor in the war. In broad comments on the state of the conflict, Trump said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine. 'Yeah, he will accept it,' Trump told reporters. 'I have asked him that question. Look, if we do this deal, he’s not looking for more war.' And Trump said he hoped that the war could end within weeks and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would soon come to the U.S. to sign a deal giving America access to Ukraine's critical minerals, which are used in key technology. Trump is pressing the economic deal to help repay some of the $180 billion in American aid for Kyiv since the start of the war — tens of billions of which is being spent in the U.S. to replenish older weapons sent to Ukraine. 'It looks like we’re getting very close,' Trump told reporters of the minerals deal before his meeting with Macron. He said Zelenskyy could potentially visit Washington this week or next to sign it. Ensuring security for Ukraine Ukraine also is looking for future security guarantees as part of any agreement. Trump, however, did not say whether the emerging deal would include such assurances from the United States: 'Europe is going to make sure nothing happens.' A French official with knowledge of Macron’s meeting with Trump said the U.S. president didn’t object to the need for U.S. security guarantees in a possible peace deal but details were still being worked out. The official wasn’t authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. At a joint press conference, Macron acknowledged that European nations must do more to bolster defense on the continent. But he also warned against capitulating to Russia. 'This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine,' Macron said. 'It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees. This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty.' Macron cut off direct communication with Putin after Russian forces carried out brutal operations in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha months into the conflict. But he said the moment has changed and he hopes Trump's engagement with Putin can lead to something fruitful. 'Now, there is a big chance because there is a new U.S. administration, so this is a new context,' Macron said. 'So there is good reason for President Trump to reengage with President Putin.' Putin said Monday that he has not discussed resolving the conflict in Ukraine in detail with Trump and neither did Russian and American negotiating teams when they met in Saudi Arabia last week. Putin also said Russia does not rule out European countries — who were dismayed that they and Ukraine were not invited to the table in Riyadh — participating in a peace settlement. America's foreign policy turnaround The war's anniversary — and the talks at the White House — come at an unnerving moment for much of Europe as it witnesses a dramatic shift in American foreign policy under Trump. Trump has made demands for territory — Greenland, Canada, Gaza and the Panama Canal. Just over a month into his second term, the 'America First' president has cast an enormous shadow over what veteran U.S. diplomats and former government officials had regarded as America’s calming presence of global stability and continuity. Despite some hiccups, the military, economic and moral power of the United States has dominated the post-World War II era, most notably after the Cold War came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union. All of that, some fear, may be lost if Trump gets his way and the U.S. abandons the principles under which the United Nations and numerous other international bodies were founded. 'The only conclusion you can draw is that 80 years of policy in standing up against aggressors has just been blown up without any sort of discussion or reflection,' said Ian Kelly, a U.S. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administrations and now a professor at Northwestern University. European leaders in Washington Trump is set to hold a meeting Thursday with another key European leader, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump shook Europe with repeated criticism of Zelenskyy for failing to negotiate an end to the war and rebuffing a push to sign off on a deal giving the U.S. access to Ukraine's critical minerals, which could be used in the American aerospace, medical and tech industries. Zelenskyy initially bristled, saying it was short on security guarantees. He said Sunday on X that 'we are making great progress' but noted that 'we want a good economic deal that will be part of a true security guarantee system for Ukraine.' Zelenskyy, who said Sunday in response to a question that he would trade his office for peace or to join NATO, had angered Trump by saying the U.S. president was living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space.' In the public spat, Trump called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and falsely charged Kyiv with starting the war. Russia, in fact, invaded its smaller and lesser-equipped neighbor in February 2022. Asked Monday if he thought Putin was also a dictator, Trump demurred: 'I don’t use those words lightly.' Some daylight between allies While Macron and Trump held talks, including participating in a virtual meeting with fellow Group of Seven leaders, the United States split with its European allies at the U.N. by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in a series of resolutions. The U.S. abstained from voting on its own proposal after the Europeans, led by France, succeeded in changing it to make clear that Russia was the aggressor. Before meeting with Trump, Macron said he intended to tell him that it’s in the joint interest of Americans and Europeans not to 'be weak in the face of President Putin.' 'It’s not you, it’s not your trademark, it’s not in your interest,' Macron said. 'How can you then be credible in the face of China if you’re weak in the face of Putin?' Yet, Trump said this month he'd like to see Russia rejoin the G7. It was suspended from the G8 after annexing Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. 'I really believe he wants to make a deal,' Trump said. 'I may be wrong, but I believe he wants to make a deal. ___ AP writers Edith M.

McConnell suggests Trump has ‘gross misunderstanding’ of Ukraine ...	(The Hill) – Former Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday suggested that President Trump’s refusal to blame Russia as the sole aggressor who provoked the war in Ukraine 'reflects a gross misunderstanding of the nature of negotiations and leverage.' McConnell declared in a statement marking the three-year anniversary of the war that the 'human catastrophe rests solely on Vladimir Putin' and that if Ukrainian forces laid down their arms, 'Putin’s aims would not stop with Kyiv.' 'Mistaking this fact is as embarrassing as it is costly,' McConnell said. He also criticized what he called the Biden administration’s 'shameful hesitation and half-measures' in responding to Russian aggression but, without naming Trump specifically, he warned that refusing to recognize the United States’ interest in defeating Russian aggression would be 'even more disgraceful.' 'Refusing to acknowledge Russia as the undeniable and unprovoked aggressor is more than an unseemly moral equivalency — it reflects a gross misunderstanding of the nature of negotiations and leverage,' he said. McConnell, the chairman of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, issued his statement a few days after Trump suggested that Ukraine started the war with Russia and called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 'a dictator without elections.' Russia’s army invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, after Putin said he needed to protect the Russian-speaking population in eastern Ukraine and contain NATO expansion. Trump refused to call Putin a 'dictator' when asked by a reporter whether he would use the same words for the Russian president. 'I don’t use those words lightly,' Trump responded during a joint press appearance with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday at the White House. Trump and Macron discussed their efforts to bring an end to the three-year war. Those comments came on the same day the United States voted against a U.N. resolution condemning Russia as the aggressor in the war, joining Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Israel and Hungary in voting no. McConnell, who has devoted his final two years in the Senate to pushing back against the isolationists in his party, said that hoping that 'appeasement will check the ambitions' of Putin is 'as naïve today as it was in 1939,' referring to western Europe's initial hesitancy in standing up to Nazi Germany. 'America is right to seek an end to this war, but an end that fails to constrain Russian ambition, ensure Ukrainian sovereignty, or strengthen American credibility with both allies and adversaries is no end at all,' he warned. 'Instead, such a hollow peace would invite further aggression,' he said. McConnell said the 'axis of aggressors from Beijing to Moscow,' which includes Iran and North Korea, is seeking an outcome in Ukraine that 'undermines the credibility of American deterrence and leaves U.S. interests more vulnerable.' 'Without a clear and resolute commitment to the leadership and order that underpins our prosperity and security, America’s adversaries will receive exactly what they hope for,' he declared.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/mcconnell-suggests-trump-has-gross-misunderstanding-of-ukraine-talks/	2025-02-24T15:46:16-08:00	
Western leaders visit Kyiv and pledge military support against Ru...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine on Monday marked the bleakest anniversary yet of its war against the Russia invasion, with the country's forces under severe pressure on the battlefield and U.S. President Donald Trump's administration apparently embracing the Kremlin in a reversal of American policy. The three-year milestone drew more than a dozen Western leaders to Kyiv for commemorative events in a conspicuous show of support. They warned of the war’s wider implications for global security and vowed to keep providing billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine as uncertainty deepens over the U.S. commitment to help. Washington did not send any senior official to the occasion. Hours after the anniversary observances, Trump said he believed that Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the war. Separately, Putin suggested that European countries could be part of a settlement, but he also said that he had not discussed resolving the conflict in detail with Trump. The fourth year of fighting could be pivotal as Trump uses his return to office to press for peace. 'The autocrats around the world are watching very carefully whether there’s any impunity if you violate international borders or invade your neighbor, or if there is true deterrence,' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned in Kyiv. Some observers say Russian success in Ukraine could embolden China’s ambitions. Just as Moscow claims that Ukraine is rightfully Russian territory, China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own. North Korea and Iran have also aided Russia's war effort. In a cascade of unwelcome developments for Kyiv, Trump has in recent days called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator, suggested Ukraine is to blame for the war and ended Putin’s three-year diplomatic isolation by the United States. U.S. officials have also indicated to Ukraine that its hopes of joining NATO are unlikely to be realized and that it probably won’t get back the land that Russia’s army occupies, which amounts to nearly 20% of the country. On the battlefield, Putin’s troops are making steady progress, while Ukraine grapples with shortages of troops and weapons. Alarm bells sound in Europe as Washington changes course The shift in Washington's policy has set off alarm bells in Europe, where governments fear being sidelined by the U.S. in efforts to secure a peace deal. They are mulling how they might pick up the slack of any cut in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The changes have strained transatlantic relations. European Council President Antonio Costa announced Sunday that he would convene an emergency summit of the 27 EU leaders in Brussels on March 6, with Ukraine at the top of the agenda. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are both visiting Washington this week. EU foreign ministers on Monday approved a new raft of sanctions against Russia. The measures target Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet' of ships that it uses to skirt restrictions on transporting oil and gas, or to carry stolen Ukrainian grain. The EU said 74 vessels were added to its shadow fleet list. Asset freezes and travel bans were imposed on 83 officials and 'entities' — usually government agencies, banks or companies. Britain, too, imposed new sanctions aimed at 107 businesses and individuals in what it says is its biggest package targeting Russia’s war machine since the early days of the conflict in 2022. The measures are designed to disrupt the Kremlin's military supply chains. Starmer said Ukrainian voices 'must be at the heart of the drive for peace' and that Trump’s intervention had 'changed the global conversation' and 'created an opportunity.' 'Russia does not hold all the cards in this war,' he said. Coming off a victory in Sunday’s German elections, conservative leader Friedrich Merz — also a staunch backer of Ukraine — posted on X: 'More than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength.' 'For a fair peace, the country that is under attack must be part of peace negotiations,' he wrote. Diplomacy ramps up after record Russian drone attack On Sunday, Russia launched its biggest single drone attack of the war, pounding Ukraine with 267 drones. The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, insisted that the U.S. cannot seal any peace deal without Ukraine or Europe being involved. 'You can discuss whatever you want with Putin. But if it comes to Europe or Ukraine, then Ukraine and Europe also have to agree to this deal,' Kallas told reporters in Brussels, where she led a meeting of EU foreign ministers. Kallas is scheduled to travel to Washington on Tuesday for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council approved a U.S.-sponsored resolution that called for a swift end to the Ukraine war but made no mention of Russian aggression. Earlier Monday, the U.N. General Assembly rejected the resolution, which passed only after it was amended to state that the conflict was the result of a 'full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.' Washington and Moscow draw closer Trump said he thought Putin would not object to European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the war. 'Yeah, he will accept it,' Trump told reporters at the White House. 'I have asked him that question. Look, if we do this deal, he’s not looking for more war.' In remarks broadcast on state television, Putin said he had not talked with Trump in detail about ending the war, and neither did Russian and American negotiating teams when they met last week in Saudi Arabia. Russia, he said, does not rule out European countries participating in a peace settlement. Putin has previously said that European or U.S forces in Ukraine would be a major security issue for Russia. He has never publicly indicated that he would accept Western troops in Ukraine, and multiple Russian officials have said that would be a red line for Moscow. Referring to U.S. interest in Ukrainian rare earth minerals, Putin said he would be interested in exploring similar opportunities with Trump, saying Russia has 'significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine.' Russian and American officials discussed improving economic ties during their meeting in Saudi Arabia, and if U.S. companies come to work in Russia, it will be 'a benefit and a considerable one,' Putin said, suggesting cooperation could be in the rare earth minerals, aluminum and energy sectors. Putin also said he is 'not against' Trump’s idea to cut defense spending by half and is 'ready for discussion in this regard.' 'I think it’s a good idea. The U.S. would cut by 50 percent, and we would cut by 50 percent, and then China would join if it wanted,' Putin said. Russia has massively ramped up defense spending since its invasion of Ukraine, and the economy has effectively pivoted to a war footing. Many Russians have become accustomed to higher salaries as a labor shortage caused by the war means the Russian military and employers compete to hire them. Russia's foreign ministry said Saturday that preparations for a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin were underway. ___ Associated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Emma Burrows in London contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-foreign-leaders-visit-ukraines-capital-to-mark-3rd-war-anniversary/	2025-02-24T14:56:15-08:00	
Russia-Ukraine war enters third year	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) - As the war in Ukraine enters its third year, the United States is ramping up efforts to broker a peace deal, but sharp divisions are emerging over how to approach Russia’s role in the conflict. On the three-year mark of the war Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he'll give up his presidency, in exchange for peace. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is making headlines after declining to call Russia’s invasion 'unprovoked.' 'Does all the finger pointing and pearl clutching make peace more likely? That’s the enduring question. The president is asking, he wants peace,' stated Hegseth. Special envoy Steve Witkoff shared similar comments in an interview. 'Irrespective of who started it, it needs to end too. Many people's lives have been expunged as a result of it,' said Witkoff. Not everyone in Washington is on board with the Trump administration's approach. 'I think Trump is much closer, ideologically to Putin and other autocrats around the world, than he is to democratic countries,' said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.). President Trump will hold a call with other G-7 leaders on Monday to discuss the three-year mark of the war and next steps toward a possible resolution.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/russia-ukraine-war-enters-third-year/	2025-02-24T04:13:32-08:00	
Zelenskyy says progress made on reaching an agreement with the US...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A contentious Trump administration proposal to give the U.S. $500 billion worth of profits from Ukraine's rare earth minerals as compensation for its wartime assistance to Kyiv has been taken off the table, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday, indicating a more equitable deal is in the works. Zelenskyy had earlier declined a U.S. draft agreement on exploitation of his country's valuable minerals such as lithium used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries because it did not contain security guarantees and came with the $500 billion price tag. 'The question of $500 billion is no longer there,' Zelenskyy told a news conference at a forum of government officials in Kyiv marking the three-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainian leader said considering aid as a debt to be repaid would be a 'Pandora's box' that would set a precedent requiring Kyiv to reimburse all its backers. 'We do not recognize the debt,' Zelenskyy said. 'It will not be in the final format of the agreement.' No further details were given on the state of negotiations. Ukraine has insisted on security guarantees that it needs to deter any potential Russian aggression in the future. Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said on CNN’s 'State of the Union' that he expects a deal this week allowing the U.S. to play a greater role in exploiting Ukraine's mineral resources. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration's minerals plan was to create a U.S.-Ukraine partnership, calling it a 'win-win.' 'We make money if the Ukrainian people make money,' Bessent told Fox News Channel’s Sunday Morning Futures program. Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, left the Kyiv forum early along with Economic Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko for what Yermak said were talks with U.S. officials on a potential deal. Later Sunday, Yermak posted on social media that he'd spoken with U.S. officials, including Bessent and Trump's national security adviser Mike Walz, saying it had been a 'constructive conversation.' 'We are making progress ,' Yermak wrote. 'The USA is our partner and we are grateful to the American people.' Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency for NATO membership In response to a pointed question from a reporter on whether he would give up his presidency for peace in Ukraine, Zelenskyy said he would if it achieved a durable end to the fighting under the security umbrella of the NATO military alliance. 'If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I’m ready,' he said. 'I can trade it for NATO.' His comment appeared to be aimed at recent suggestions by President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that elections should be held despite Ukrainian legislation prohibiting them during martial law. Ukraine fears Trump's policy shift toward Putin Trump's engagement with Russian officials and his recent agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow have marked a dramatic about-face in U.S. policy that has rattled leaders in Ukraine and across Europe. Zelenskyy has expressed fear that Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in Ukraine losing territory and being left vulnerable to future Russian aggression. U.S. officials have asserted the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start. Trump, however, prompted alarm and anger in Ukraine this week when he suggested Kyiv had started the war and Zelenskyy was acting as a 'dictator' by not holding elections. On Sunday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the state TASS news agency that Moscow and Washington would continue bilateral talks at the end of next week. Ryabkov said the talks would take place between department heads from both countries’ foreign ministries, adding that 'quite a lot' of contact was ongoing between the Russian and American sides. European leaders prepare for talks with Zelenskyy and Trump European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other top EU officials were headed to Kyiv Monday for talks with Ukraine’s government as Europe scrambles to devise a response to the Trump administration's U.S. policy changes, and to maintain support for Kyiv if aid from Washington ends. The U.K. said it would announce new sanctions against Russia on Monday, describing them as the biggest package since the early days of the war. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the measures would be aimed at eroding Russia’s 'military machine and reducing revenues fueling the fires of destruction in Ukraine.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were to both visit Washington this week as Europe attempts to persuade Trump not to abandon Ukraine in pursuit of a peace deal. Russia launches record drone strikes on eve of anniversary Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia had launched 267 drones into Ukraine overnight, more than in any other single attack of the war. Ukraine’s air force said 138 drones were shot down over 13 Ukrainian regions, with 119 more lost enroute to their targets. Three ballistic missiles also were fired, the air force said. One person was killed in the city of Kryvyi Rih, according to the city military administration. Reacting to the latest Russian attacks, Andrii Sybiha‎, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, said on social media: 'No one should trust Putin’s words. Look at his actions instead.' More sanctions imposed on Russia New Zealand will sanction an additional 52 people and entities involved in Russia’s military and energy sectors, North Korea’s support to Russia’s war effort, and the forced relocation and reeducation of Ukrainian children, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Monday. Since March 2022, New Zealand has placed sanctions on more than 1,800 individuals and entities. New Zealand will contribute a further 3 million New Zealand dollars ($1.7 million) to the World Bank-administered fund for Ukraine, Peters said in a statement. ___ Associated Press writers Thomas Strong and Will Weissert in Washington and Charlotte Graham-McLay in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-launches-a-record-number-of-drones-into-ukraine-on-the-eve-of-the-wars-3-year-anniversary/	2025-02-23T20:03:57-08:00	
US pressures Ukraine to nix its UN resolution demanding Russian f...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.S. has pressured Ukraine to withdraw its European-backed U.N. resolution demanding an immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine in favor of an American proposal that does not mention Moscow’s invasion, a U.S. official and a European diplomat said Sunday. But Ukraine refused to pull its draft resolution, and the U.N. General Assembly will vote on it Monday, the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, two European diplomats said. The 193-nation General Assembly then is expected to vote on the U.S. draft resolution, according to the diplomats and the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because private negotiations are still ongoing. The Trump administration is also seeking a vote on its proposal in the more powerful U.N. Security Council. China, which holds the Security Council presidency this month, scheduled a vote on the U.S. resolution for Monday afternoon. The dueling resolutions — the first since the invasion — highlight the tension between the U.S., Ukraine and European countries in the five weeks since President Donald Trump took office and has opened talks with Russia after years of isolation in a bid to end the war. European leaders were dismayed that they and Ukraine were left out of preliminary negotiations between the U.S. and Russia last week. The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body on Ukraine because the Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, has been paralyzed by Russia’s veto power. There are no vetoes in the General Assembly, and its votes are closely watched as a barometer of world opinion. However, its resolutions are not legally binding, unlike those adopted by the Security Council. Since Russian forces crossed Ukraine’s border on Feb. 24, 2022, the assembly has adopted half a dozen resolutions condemning the war and demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops. The assembly votes have shown strong global opposition to Russia's conflict, and the votes on the rival resolutions Monday will be closely watched to see if that support has waned — and to assess support for Trump’s effort to bring a speedy end to the war. One European diplomat said there has been intense lobbying and arm-twisting on the rival resolutions. The U.S. official said the U.S. is trying to get Ukraine and the Europeans to back down on their draft. It comes as Trump plans to host French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday in Washington. The United States believes 'this is the moment to commit to ending the war. This is our opportunity to build real momentum toward peace,' Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement late Friday. He said that 'while challenges may arise, the goal of lasting peace remains achievable' and that the resolution would 'affirm that this conflict is awful, that the U.N. can help end it, and that peace is possible.' The Ukraine resolution, co-sponsored by the 27-nation European Union, refers to 'the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation' and recalls the need to implement all previous assembly resolutions 'adopted in response to the aggression against Ukraine.' It singles out the General Assembly’s demand that Russia 'immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders' and its demand to immediately halt all hostilities. And it calls for 'a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine.' The very brief U.S. draft resolution acknowledges 'the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict' and 'implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.' It never mentions Moscow's invasion. Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told reporters last week that the U.S. resolution was 'a good move.' Russia also suggested an amendment, seeking to add the phrase 'including by addressing its root causes' so the final line of the U.S. resolution reads, 'implores a swift end to the conflict, including by addressing its root causes, and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.' ___ Lee reported from Washington.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-pressures-ukraine-to-nix-its-un-resolution-demanding-russian-forces-withdraw/	2025-02-23T19:31:41-08:00	
Netanyahu says Israel won't allow Syrian forces 'south of Damascu...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will not allow Syria’s new army or the insurgent group that led the ouster of former President Bashar Assad to 'enter the area south of Damascus' as his government made clear Israeli forces would stay in parts of southern Syria for an indefinite period. Netanyahu’s comments Sunday at a military graduation led to new concerns over the Israeli presence, and sway, in a swath of southern Syria as Damascus' new leaders attempt to consolidate control after years of civil war. 'Take note: We will not allow HTS forces or the new Syrian army to enter the area south of Damascus,' Netanyahu said, referring to Syria’s new authorities as well as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main former rebel group. 'We demand the complete demilitarization of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa and Suwayda from the forces of the new regime. Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.' There was no immediate response from Syrian authorities. Defense Minister Israel Katz added that Israeli forces will remain on the peak of Mt. Hermon in southern Syria and in a buffer zone 'for an indefinite period of time to protect our communities and thwart any threat.' He said Israeli forces have built two posts on the mountain and another seven in the buffer zone 'to ensure defense and offense against any challenge.' After the fall of Assad in December, Israel seized the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory. The zone was set up under a 1974 ceasefire agreement. Syria’s new authorities and U.N. officials have called for Israel to withdraw. Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s government has been under pressure to protect Israelis living near border areas in the north. Katz said Israel will 'strengthen ties with friendly populations in the region,' notably the Druze, a religious minority who live in both southern Syria and in Israel’s Golan Heights, where Druze navigate their historically Syrian identity while living under Israeli rule. 'We will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria,' Netanyahu said. More broadly, Israeli forces 'will not allow hostile forces to establish themselves and be present in the security zone in southern Syria from here to Damascus. And we will act against any threat,' Katz said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-netanyahu-says-israel-wont-allow-syrian-forces-south-of-damascus/	2025-02-23T16:31:50-08:00	
Israel sends tanks into West Bank for first time in decades, says...	JENIN, West Bank (AP) — Israeli tanks moved into the occupied West Bank on Sunday for the first time in decades in what Palestinian authorities called a 'dangerous escalation,' after the defense minister said troops will remain in parts of the territory for a year and tens of thousands of Palestinians who have fled cannot return. Associated Press journalists saw several tanks move along unpaved tracks into Jenin, long a bastion of armed struggle against Israel. Israel is deepening its crackdown on the Palestinian territory and has said it is determined to stamp out militancy amid a rise in attacks. It launched the offensive in the northern West Bank on Jan. 21 — two days after the current ceasefire in Gaza took hold — and expanded it to nearby areas. Palestinians view the deadly raids as part of an effort to cement Israeli control over the territory, where 3 million Palestinians live under military rule. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the military to 'increase the intensity of the activity to thwart terrorism' in all refugee camps in the West Bank. 'We will not allow the return of residents, and we will not allow terrorism to return and grow,' he said. Earlier, Katz said he had instructed the military to prepare for 'an extended stay' in some of the West Bank's urban refugee camps from which about 40,000 Palestinians have fled, leaving them 'emptied of residents.' The camps are home to descendants of Palestinians who fled during wars with Israel decades ago. It was not clear how long Palestinians would be prevented from returning. Katz said Israeli troops would stay 'for the coming year.' Netanyahu said they would stay 'as long as needed.' Tanks were last deployed in the West Bank in 2002, when Israel fought a deadly Palestinian uprising. The Palestinian foreign ministry called the Israeli moves 'a dangerous escalation of the situation in the West Bank,' and urged the international community to intervene in what it termed Israel's illegal 'aggression.' 'Even if they stay, we will return to the camp at the end,' said Mohamed al-Sadi, one of those displaced from Jenin. 'This camp is ours. We have no other place to go.' Netanyahu under pressure to crack down With fighting in Gaza and Lebanon on hold, Netanyahu has been under pressure from far-right governing partners to crack down on militancy in the West Bank. The U.N. says the current Israeli military operation is the longest since the Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s. Under interim peace agreements from the early 1990s, Israel maintains control over large parts of the West Bank, while the Palestinian Authority administers other areas. Israel regularly sends troops into Palestinian zones but typically withdraws them after missions. More than 800 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the war in Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, with a Hamas attack on southern Israel. Israel says most were militants, but stone-throwing youths protesting Israeli raids as well as bystanders have also been killed. In the most recent operation, a pregnant Palestinian woman was killed. Jewish settlers also have carried out rampages in Palestinian areas in the territory. And there has been a spike in Palestinian attacks emanating from the West Bank. On Thursday, blasts rocked three empty buses in Israel in what police view as a suspected militant attack. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. Palestinians want all three territories for their future independent state. U.S. envoy to pursue extended ceasefire The truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza remains tenuous. A week is left in the ceasefire’s first phase, and no negotiations have been reported on the second phase. The truce’s collapse could lead to renewed fighting in Gaza, where Netanyahu says 63 hostages remain, about half of them believed dead, including a soldier captured in 2014. 'We are ready to return to intense fighting at any moment,' Netanyahu said Sunday. The military increased its 'operational readiness' around Gaza. The U.S. special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told CNN he expects the second phase to go forward, adding: 'We have to get an extension of phase one and so I’ll be going into the region this week, probably Wednesday, to negotiate that.' He told CBS he will visit Qatar, Egypt, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. But a senior Hamas leader, Mahmoud Mardawi, said Sunday the group will not engage in further discussions with Israel through mediators until Israel releases the 620 Palestinian prisoners meant to be freed on Saturday. Israel said early Sunday it was delaying the release until it gets assurances that Hamas stops what Israel calls 'humiliating' handovers of hostages in staged ceremonies criticized by the U.S. and Red Cross as cruel. Egypt and Qatar were pressing Israel to release the prisoners, and Egypt refused to discuss any Israeli demands before then, said an Egyptian official involved in the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to talk to the media. Palestinian family members were distraught. 'What have the prisoners done? We don’t know what happened. They killed our joy,' said one mother, Najah Zaqqot. The White House is supporting Israel’s decision to delay releasing the Palestinians prisoners, calling it 'appropriate.' National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said Sunday that, 'given Hamas’ barbaric treatment of the hostages, including the hideous parade of the Bibas children’s coffins through the streets of Gaza, Israel’s decision to delay the release of prisoners is an appropriate response.' 'The President is prepared to support Israel in whatever course of action it chooses regarding Hamas,' Hughes said in a statement. Meanwhile, Netanyahu faced new criticism over the war while speaking at a military graduation. As he held up a picture of Shiri Bibas and her young boys, Ariel and Kfir, whose remains were returned from Gaza last week, to demonstrate 'what we are fighting against,' audience members called out 'Shame!' and 'Why didn’t you save them?' The prime minister didn’t react. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed revenge Friday for what he described as a 'cruel and malicious violation' of the ceasefire agreement after authorities determined that a body released by Hamas was not an Israeli mother of two small boys, as the militant group had promised. The incident raised new doubts about the future of the fragile ceasefire deal, which has paused over 15 months of war but is nearing the end of its first phase. In the short term, though, there were indications that the deal's next step — the release of six living Israeli hostages on Saturday in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners — would proceed as planned. Hamas suggested in a statement Friday that a mix-up of remains might have occurred after Israel bombed the area where both the Israeli hostages and Palestinians were present. The group said it would 'conduct a thorough review.' Later on Friday, the Red Cross said in a short statement it had received human remains inside Gaza and transferred them to Israeli authorities. The remains were expected to be taken to Israel’s national forensics lab for testing. It was not immediately known how long it would take to confirm identification. Speaking during a phone interview with Al Araby, a Qatar-based television network, Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi confirmed the militants handed over the body of Shiri Bibas to the Red Cross. Dr. Salem Attalah, deputy secretary general for the Palestinian Mujahedeen Brigades, said it handed over Bibas’ remains to the Red Cross. The militant group, which collaborates with Palestinian Islamic Jihad inside Gaza, is thought to have been holding the mother and her two boys, Kfir and Ariel Bibas. In other developments, U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that he will not try to muscle through his plan for the United States to take over and rebuild the Gaza Strip into a tourist destination, displacing Palestinians. The plan was welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries. Hamas’ military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, said it would go ahead with the release of the six Israeli hostages Saturday. Hamas turned over four bodies Thursday as part of the ceasefire deal. They were supposed to have been those of Shiri Bibas, her sons, Kfir and Ariel, and Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas that ignited the war. Israeli authorities said they had positively identified the remains of the two boys and of Lifshitz. However, the fourth body was determined to be that of an unidentified woman from Gaza. 'We will work with determination to bring Shiri home together with all our hostages — both living and dead — and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and malicious violation of the agreement,' Netanyahu said. 'The sacred memory of Oded Lifshitz and Ariel and Kfir Bibas will be forever enshrined in the heart of the nation. May God avenge their blood. And so we will avenge.' Hamas said it had 'no interest in retaining any bodies,' adding that it had 'demonstrated full compliance with the agreement' in recent days and remained 'committed to all its terms.' 'We reject Netanyahu’s threats, which serve only to manipulate Israeli public opinion,' Hamas said, calling on mediators to ensure the continued implementation of the ceasefire. The group also called for the return of the unidentified remains. Netanyahu's vow for revenge was rejected by the aunt of the Bibas children, who said Israeli officials had failed to protect them on the day of the attack and then abandoned them in captivity. 'Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we did not receive an apology from you in this painful moment,' Ofri Bibas Levy said in a video statement released Friday by a group representing the families of hostages. 'We are not seeking revenge right now. We are asking for Shiri.' The confusion over the body’s identity was a shocking twist in the saga of the Bibas family, which has been widely viewed as a symbol of the Israeli hostages' plight. During the ceasefire, which began in January, Hamas has been releasing living hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails. Thursday’s release marked the first time the group has returned the remains of dead hostages. The Israeli army said Thursday that the fourth body released by Hamas was an 'anonymous, unidentified body.' It said the Bibas family had been notified, including Yarden Bibas, Shiri’s husband and father of the two boys, who had been taken captive separately from his wife and children and was released early this month as part of the ceasefire deal. Hamas has claimed Lifshitz, Shiri Bibas and her sons were killed in Israeli airstrikes. But Israel said tests found the two boys and Lifshitz were killed by their captors. U.S. envoy Adam Boehler described the release of the wrong body as 'horrific' and a 'clear violation' of the ceasefire. 'If I were them, I’d release everybody or they are going to face total annihilation,' Boehler, who serves as the U.S. envoy for hostages, told CNN. The six Israeli men set for release Saturday are expected to be the last living hostages freed during the ceasefire’s first phase. They include Eliya Cohen, 27; Omer Shem Tov, 22; and Omer Wenkert, 23. All three were abducted from a music festival during the Oct. 7 attack. Tal Shoham, 40, who was taken from the community of Kibbutz Beeri, is also set to be released. In addition, Avera Mengistu, 39, and Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, who have been held since crossing into Gaza on their own years ago, are scheduled to be returned. The names, released by Hamas, were confirmed earlier this week by the Hostages and Missing Families forum, the group representing hostage families. More than 600 Palestinians jailed in Israel will be freed in exchange, the Palestinian prisoners media office said Friday. The prisoners set for release include 50 serving life sentences, 60 with long sentences, 47 who were released under a previous hostage-for-prisoner exchange and 445 prisoners from Gaza arrested since the war began. Hamas has said it will also release four more bodies next week, completing the first phase of the ceasefire. It is unclear whether the truce will be extended. In a potential blow to the deal, a series of explosions struck three parked, empty buses in central Israel overnight. There were no injuries and no claim of responsibility. But the Israeli military said in response that it was beefing up its forces in the West Bank, raising the likelihood of further escalation in the area. Israel has been carrying out a broad military offensive in the occupied territory since the ceasefire took effect. If the current phase of the ceasefire goes according to plan, Hamas would retain about 60 hostages living and dead. About half — all men — are believed to be alive. Hamas has said it won’t release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he’s committed to destroying Hamas’ military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Trump’s proposal to permanently remove about 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and develop it has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. In his latest comments, Trump said that he was 'a little surprised' by Egypt and Jordan's rejection of the idea and that he would not impose it. 'I’ll tell you, the way to do it is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works. But I’m not forcing it. I’m just going to sit back and recommend it,' Trump said in a Fox News interview. Hamas could be reluctant to free more hostages if it believes that the war will resume. Israel’s military offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza’s population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding. ___ Associated Press writer Julia Frankel in Jerusalem contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-netanyahu-slams-cruel-and-malicious-violation-of-gaza-ceasefire-deal-over-release-of-body/	2025-02-21T16:34:10-08:00	
Israel identifies remains of child hostages but says another body...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The Israeli military said Friday it had positively identified the remains of two young hostages but another body released by Hamas under a ceasefire deal was not the boys’ mother as the militant group had promised. The revelation was a shocking twist in the saga surrounding the Bibas family, who have become global symbols of the plight of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and threw the future of the fragile ceasefire into question. 'This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organization,' the army said in a statement. During the monthlong ceasefire, Hamas has been releasing living hostages in exchange hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Thursday’s release marked the first time the group has returned the remains of dead hostages. Early in the day, Hamas had turned over four bodies to the Red Cross. Israel quickly confirmed one body was that of Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted during the Hamas attack that started the war on Oct. 7, 2023. Hamas had said the other remains belonged to Shiri Bibas, and her two young boys, Ariel and Kfir. In an overnight announcement, the army said Israel’s National Institute of Forensic Medicine had identified the boys, but the final set of remains did not belong to their mother. It said the remains did not match any other hostage either. 'This is an anonymous, unidentified body,' it said. 'We demand that Hamas return Shiri home along with all our hostages.' It said the army had notified their family, including Yarden Bibas, Shiri’s husband and father of the two boys, who was released early this month as part of the ceasefire deal. Hamas has claimed all four of the hostages returned Thursday were killed in Israeli airstrikes. But Israel said the testing had found the two boys and Lifshitz were killed by their captors. Hamas did not immediately respond to Israel’s announcement that the body was not of the boys’ mother. A top U.S. official issued a stark warning for Hamas after the Israeli military said the militant group released an 'anonymous' body and not that of a slain Israeli hostage. Speaking to CNN, U.S. envoy Adam Boehler called the Hamas decision to reportedly release the wrong body 'horrific' and a 'clear violation' of the ceasefire halting fighting in the Gaza Strip 'If I were them, I’d release everybody or they are going to face total annihilation,' said Boehler, who serves as the U.S. envoy for hostages. It is now unclear whether the next scheduled swap, set for Saturday, will take place. It also is not clear whether the truce, which halted 15 months of fighting, will be extended when the current phase expires in early March. In another potential blow to the deal, a series of explosions Thursday on three parked buses rattled central Israel. There were no injuries and no claim of responsibility. But the Israeli military said in response it was beefing up its forces in the West Bank, raising the likelihood of further escalation in the area. Israel has been carrying out a broad military offensive in the occupied territory since the ceasefire took effect. Outpouring of grief The return of the remains Thursday had set off a nationwide outpouring of grief as flag-waving crowds lined highways on a rainy day to pay their respects to a convoy carrying the coffins and thousands packed a Tel Aviv square in an emotional nighttime vigil. Many people wiped away tears and softly sang the national anthem as the caravan wound through southern Israel — a stark contrast to the celebratory return of 24 living hostages in recent weeks under the tenuous ceasefire. The handover was a grim reminder of those who died in captivity. Militants who handed over the bodies displayed four black coffins on a stage in the Gaza Strip surrounded by banners, including one depicting Netanyahu as a vampire. On each coffin, a photo of one of the hostages was stapled to the side. Large numbers of masked and armed militants looked on as the coffins were loaded onto Red Cross vehicles before being driven to Israeli forces. The military later held a small funeral ceremony, at the request of the families, before transferring the bodies to the forensics lab for DNA testing. In Tel Aviv where the bodies were transported, a double rainbow unfolded across the sky just before sunset. Thousands of people gathered at the city’s Hostage Square and recited traditional mourning prayers. Some held orange balloons, in honor of the red-headed Bibas boys, and the crowd swelled after sundown as musicians performed subdued ballads, matching the nation’s grief. 'Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters,' Israeli President Isaac Herzog said. 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely.' Lifshitz’s son, Yizhar, said the identification of his father had brought some closure to the family and would allow them to bury him on his kibbutz. Infant was the youngest taken hostage Kfir Bibas, who was 9 months old at the time, was a red-headed infant with a toothless smile when militants stormed the family’s home on Oct. 7, 2023. His brother, Ariel, was 4. Video from that day showed a terrified Shiri swaddling the boys as militants led them into Gaza. Her husband, Yarden Bibas, was held separately before his release. Relatives in Israel had clung to hope, marking the boys’ birthdays. The Bibas family said it was waiting for official identification before acknowledging that their loved ones were dead. A cousin of Shiri Bibas who lives in Buenos Aires, told the local Radio Con Vos station she has been reliving the trauma of the abduction. Romina Miasnik said she hoped her loved ones 'can become a symbol of something new, of coexistence, of hatred no longer having a place.' Like the Bibas family, Oded Lifshitz was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, along with his wife, Yocheved, who was freed early in the war as an apparent humanitarian gesture. Hamas-led militants abducted 251 hostages, including about 30 children, in the Oct. 7 attack, in which they also killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Most of the hostages have been released or rescued, or their remains have been recovered. But Israel estimates 66 remain in captivity, roughly half of whom are still believed to be alive. It’s not clear if the ceasefire will last Hamas is set to free six living hostages on Saturday in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and says it will release four more bodies next week, completing the first phase. That will leave the militants with about 60 hostages, all men and about half believed to be dead. Hamas has said it won’t release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he’s committed to destroying Hamas’ military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Trump’s proposal to remove about 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it, which has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries, has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. Hamas could be reluctant to free more hostages if it believes that the war will resume.

Pakistan steps up arrests of Afghans without papers. Kabul says i...	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Authorities have stepped up arrests of Afghan citizens in Pakistan's capital and a nearby city in an effort that the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad described on Wednesday as a push to force the expulsion of all Afghan refugees from the country. Pakistan's foreign ministry promptly dismissed the allegation, saying that the authorities were only trying to facilitate conditions for the swift return of Afghans to their home country. Pakistan has long threatened to deport Afghans living in the country illegally. Separately, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last month approved a March 31 deadline to deport those awaiting relocation to third countries unless their cases are swiftly processed by the governments that have agreed to take them, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press. More than 800,000 Afghans have returned home or have been expelled by force from Pakistan since 2023, according to the International Organization for Migration, a U.N. agency that tracks migrations. In a strongly worded statement on Wednesday, the Afghan Embassy — which represents the Taliban-run government of Afghanistan — criticized 'the short timeframe' given by the authorities in Islamabad and 'the unilateral nature of Pakistan’s decision.' Afghans in Islamabad and the nearby garrison city of Rawalpindi have been subjected to arrests, searches, and orders from police to leave the two cities and relocate to other parts of Pakistan, the embassy said. It further claimed that for all Afghans, 'expulsion is imminent' — something the embassy said Pakistani authorities had not communicated to Kabul ' through any formal correspondence.' More than half a million Afghans who fled the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 have been living without papers in Pakistan, thousands of them waiting for resettlement in the United States and elsewhere. There are also some 1.45 million Afghan refugees, registered with the U.N. refugee agency, most of whom fled during the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation of their country. Last July, Pakistan extended the stay of refugees registered with the UNHCR until June 2025, saying they will not be arrested or deported at least until the extension expires. Sharif's January decision appears to be a reversal of that extension and followed a widely criticized anti-migrant crackdown by his government targeting anyone without valid documentation regardless of nationality, according to Pakistani authorities. Ultimately, the embassy said, 'Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that there is a definitive and final plan to deport all Afghan refugees not only from Islamabad and Rawalpindi but also from the entire country in the near future.' Pakistan foreign ministry defended its stance on Wednesday. 'While Pakistan has done what it could, we expect ... Afghan authorities to create conducive conditions so returnees are fully integrated in Afghan society,' it said. After President Donald Trump paused U.S. refugee programs last month, around 20,000 Afghans who were awaiting resettlement in Pakistan are now in limbo. Ahmad Shah, a member of an Afghan advocacy group, urged Pakistan on Wednesday to allow Afghans waiting for relocation to continue living in Islamabad — at least until the Trump administration makes a final decision about their fate. He said it would be hard for them to visit Western embassies in the Pakistani capital if they are forced to move to other areas.	https://wgntv.com/news/international/ap-international/ap-pakistan-wants-to-expel-all-afghan-refugees-from-the-country-says-afghan-embassy/	2025-02-19T11:43:16-08:00	
Israel's ceasefires with Hezbollah and Hamas are both in doubt ag...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's military says its forces will remain in five strategic locations in southern Lebanon after Tuesday's deadline for their withdrawal under a ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group, as Lebanon’s government expressed frustration over another delay. A separate ceasefire in Gaza was also in doubt as the region marked 500 days of Israel's war with Hamas, while Israel and the United States sent conflicting signals over whether they want the truce to continue. Talks on the ceasefire's second phase are yet to start. Military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said the five locations in Lebanon provide vantage points or are located across from communities in northern Israel, where about 60,000 Israelis are still displaced. He said the 'temporary measure' was approved by the U.S.-led body monitoring the truce, which earlier was extended by three weeks. Under the agreement, Israeli forces should withdraw from a buffer zone in southern Lebanon to be patrolled by the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers. The ceasefire has held since taking effect in November. Israel is committed to a withdrawal in 'the right way, in a gradual way, and in a way that the security of our civilians is kept,' Shoshani told reporters. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun told reporters the ceasefire 'must be respected,' saying 'the Israeli enemy cannot be trusted.' He said Lebanese officials were working diplomatically for the withdrawal. Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said Sunday 'there can be no excuses' for any delay past Tuesday. Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out massive waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group’s senior leaders. Earlier on Monday, Israel's military said its drone strike killed Muhammad Shaheen, head of Hamas’ operations in Lebanon. The strike in the port city of Sidon was the deepest inside Lebanese territory since the ceasefire took effect. Associated Press video footage showed a charred vehicle. 'Now the fear has come back to people,' said Ahmed Sleim, a Sidon resident, who worried about a return to war. 500 days of war in Gaza Israelis held protests calling for the Gaza ceasefire to be extended so that more hostages abducted in the Oct. 7 attack can be freed. An Israeli official said four bodies are expected to be returned to Israel on Thursday. The official gave no further details and spoke on condition of anonymity because details were being arranged. So far, no bodies have been handed over during the ceasefire's current phase. There was no immediate comment from Hamas. Israeli officials have said they believe eight of the 33 people to be returned in the ceasefire's first phase are dead. Hamas is gradually releasing the 33 in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most parts of Gaza and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid. This first phase ends in less than two weeks. Negotiations on the more difficult second phase — which would release more hostages and see the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza — should have started two weeks ago. 'All I care about, all I want, is for my friends to return. There were six of us living in unbearable conditions' Ohad Ben Ami, released a week and a half ago, told Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Families have described loved ones barefoot or in chains. 'It’s just not within the realm of possibility that they’re still there,' said protester Eleanor Satlow in Jerusalem. Others rallied in Tel Aviv, where newly released hostage Iair Horn told them: 'I’m telling you, the hostages don’t have time, we don’t have time.' His brother Eitan is still in Gaza. In the second phase, Hamas would release over 70 remaining hostages — around half believed to be dead — in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners and a lasting ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump 's administration say they are committed to the eradication of Hamas and the return of all hostages. Those goals are widely seen as incompatible. The militant group, though weakened, remains in control of Gaza. Hamas has said it is willing to relinquish power to other Palestinians but will not accept any occupying force. Israel welcomes Trump's proposal Trump calls for Gaza’s population of over 2 million to be permanently relocated to other countries and for the United States to take ownership of the territory. Israel welcomes the plan, while Palestinians and Arab nations have rejected it. Rights groups say implementation would likely violate international law. Egypt is working on a counter-plan to rebuild Gaza without removing Palestinians. Hamas-led militants in their Oct. 7 attack killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. More than half of the hostages have been returned. Eight have been rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. 'Everything is destroyed, nothing is left in Gaza, Gaza is not fit for life,' said one resident, Mohammed Barash, reflecting on 500 days of war. Settlement expansion is set to accelerate A watchdog opposed to Jewish settlements on Palestinian territory said Israel has issued a tender for the construction of nearly 1,000 additional settler homes in the occupied West Bank. Peace Now said the 974 new housing units would allow the population of the Efrat settlement to expand by 40% and further block the development of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem. There was no immediate Israeli government comment. Israel has built over 100 settlements across the West Bank, ranging from hilltop outposts to fully developed communities. Over 500,000 settlers live in the West Bank, home to about 3 million Palestinians. The settlers have Israeli citizenship. Palestinians live under military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers. Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want them for their future state. ___ Abou AlJoud reported from Beirut.

500 days of the Israel-Hamas war, by the numbers	Monday is the 500th day of the war triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. A tenuous ceasefire in the Gaza Strip has held for nearly a month. But the current phase of the truce is set to expire in early March and it is unclear if the sides will extend it, begin negotiations for a more lasting ceasefire or resume fighting. Here are some numbers that show the scale of death and devastation. Sources include the Israeli government, the Gaza Health Ministry and U.N. agencies. People killed in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023: Around 1,200 Hostages taken into Gaza: 251 Hostages remaining in Gaza: 73, including 3 taken before Oct. 7, 2023 Hostages in Gaza believed to be dead: 36, including one from before Oct. 7, 2023 Palestinians killed in Gaza: Over 48,200 (This figure from the Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but the ministry says more than half of the dead were women and children) Palestinians wounded in Gaza: Over 111,600 Israeli soldiers killed since Oct. 7, 2023: 846 Rockets fired at Israel from Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023: Over 10,000 Percentage of Gaza’s population displaced: Around 90% Palestinians who have crossed into northern Gaza since the ceasefire began: 586,000 Israelis displaced by attacks from Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon at their peak: Over 75,500 Housing units damaged or destroyed in Gaza: Over 245,000 Primary roads damaged or destroyed in Gaza: Over 92% Health facilities damaged or destroyed in Gaza: Over 84% ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-500-days-of-the-israel-hamas-war-by-the-numbers/	2025-02-16T23:35:06-08:00	
Israel and Hamas complete their latest exchange as ceasefire's fi...	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel and Hamas completed the sixth exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners on Saturday with just over two weeks remaining in their fragile Gaza ceasefire's initial phase, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio landed in Israel to begin a Mideast tour. Israelis expressed relief as the three hostages — Argentinian-Israeli Iair Horn, 46; American-Israeli Sagui Dekel Chen, 36; and Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, 29 — seemed in better condition than the emaciated ones freed a week ago. Troufanov was informed of his father's death in the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the 16-month war. Chen was meeting his youngest daughter for the first time. Horn's brother, Eitan, remains in captivity. Armed militants made the pale, worn men speak to a crowd before handing them over to the Red Cross in the southern city of Khan Younis. The 369 Palestinian prisoners were later released. A tense dispute had threatened to derail the ceasefire, but Hamas said Thursday it would move ahead with the planned exchange after it said mediators Egypt and Qatar pledged to 'remove all hurdles' so Israel would allow more tents, medical supplies and other essentials into devastated Gaza. U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to remove Gaza’s over 2 million Palestinians and settle them elsewhere in the region also shook the truce. Rubio will hear more about that, starting with his meeting Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump on Saturday posted on social media that 'Israel will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O’CLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES. The United States will back the decision they make!' Israel has not imposed such a deadline. Netanyahu’s office said he would convene the Cabinet as soon as possible to decide on next steps. In the occupied West Bank, released prisoners were greeted by a cheering crowd. Some appeared gaunt, and the Palestinian Red Crescent emergency service said four were taken for treatment. Buses transported 333 others to Gaza. The ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19. Before Saturday, 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners had been freed during the truce's first phase. There have not been substantive negotiations over the ceasefire's second phase, in which Hamas would release all remaining hostages in return for ending the war. The hostages and prisoners released The three hostages had been abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, a community hard-hit in the Oct. 7 attack. Horn was taken with his brother, who is not expected to be released in the ceasefire's first phase. 'Now, we can breathe a little. Our Iair is home after surviving hell in Gaza,' his family said. 'Now, we need to bring Eitan back so our family can truly breathe.' Chen's wife, Avital Dekel Chen, hid in a safe room with their daughters. She gave birth to their third daughter two months later. She told Israeli media she was overwhelmed with happiness to see her husband back in Israel, where he was meeting his youngest daughter, Shachar. Troufanov was taken hostage with his grandmother, mother and girlfriend. The women were released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. His family said they were 'overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude' Saturday. Of the 251 people abducted during the Oct. 7 attack, 73 remain in Gaza, around half believed to be dead. Nearly all are men, including Israeli soldiers. One hostage, 65-year-old Keith Siegel, said Friday in a video message addressed to Trump that his captors treated him worse as the war intensified, kicking him, spitting on him and holding him without water or light. The released Palestinian prisoners included 36 serving life sentences for involvement in deadly attacks against Israelis. They include Ahmed Barghouti, 48, a close aide of militant leader and iconic Palestinian political figure Marwan Barghouti. Twenty-four of those will be exiled abroad. 'When I saw my son, my soul came back to me again and I came back to life,' said Om Bashar, mother of Hassan Aweis, sentenced to life in 2002 on charges of voluntary manslaughter, planting an explosive device and attempted murder. Israel also committed to releasing over 1,000 detained from Gaza provided they did not participate in the Oct. 7 attack. The Israeli Prison Service released the Palestinians in sweatshirts emblazoned with a Star of David and the phrase 'Never forgive, never forget' in Arabic. Some threw their sweatshirts on the ground and burned them. The truce remains fragile Netanyahu’s far-right allies want the war to resume in early March with the goal of destroying Hamas. The militant group remains in control of the territory after one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. Hamas may be unwilling to release more hostages if it believes the war will resume. Many Israelis want a deal to bring all remaining hostages home, fearing time is running out. They urge Netanyahu to send a senior-level delegation to talks on the ceasefire's second phase. 'Any other decision is sabotage that endangers the lives of the abductees,' Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, told Saturday's rally in Tel Aviv. A new challenge is Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza, welcomed by Israel’s government. It has been rejected by Arab countries and Palestinians, who fear they won't be able to return. Human rights groups say the relocation could amount to a war crime. Trump also proposed that once the war ends, Israel would transfer control of Gaza to the United States, which would redevelop it as the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million. Hundreds of thousands have returned to their homes during the ceasefire, though many found only rubble, human remains and unexploded ordnance. The war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Bwaitel reported from Beitunia, West Bank, and Lidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Middle East latest: Palestinian militants name 3 Israeli men to b...	The families of Israeli hostages still held by the Hamas militant group on Friday welcomed the 'joyous news' that three men, all taken from the same kibbutz on Oct. 7, 2023, are expected to be freed on Saturday in exchange for more than 300 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Hamas-led militants released the three names Friday in the latest indication that the fragile ceasefire deal — which had teetered in recent days — will hold. Nearly all the 73 remaining hostages are men, including Israeli soldiers, and about half are believed to be dead. The sides have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, freeing 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners so far during the first phase of the truce. The war could resume if no agreement is reached on the more complicated second phase, which calls for the return of all remaining hostages captured in Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and an indefinite extension of the truce. Here's the latest: ___ A top commander with the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon is injured after protesters attack a convoy in Beirut BEIRUT — The departing deputy commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon was injured Friday when protesters attacked a convoy taking peacekeepers to the Beirut airport, the force known as UNIFIL said in a statement. 'We are shocked by this outrageous attack on peacekeepers who have been serving to restore security and stability to south Lebanon during a difficult time,' it said. The Lebanese army intervened to disperse the protesters. The army said in a statement that acting Lebanese commander Maj. Gen. Hassan Odeh had contacted UNIFIL and promised to 'work to arrest the citizens who attacked its members and bring them to justice.' Demonstrators have been blocking the road leading to the airport and other roads in the capital. They're protesting that Lebanese authorities revoked permission for a passenger plane from Iran to fly to Beirut on Thursday. That came after the Israeli army claimed Iran was smuggling cash to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah via civilian flights. Israeli settlers attack a village in the West Bank and wound at least 16 Palestinians, medics say JERUSALEM — A group of Israeli settlers descended on a Palestinian village in the southern Israeli-occupied West Bank on Friday, wounding at least 16 Palestinians, according to paramedics. The Palestinian Red Crescent said in a statement that it brought four people to the hospital with fractures and wounds from the village of Al-Maniya, near Bethlehem. It said it treated 10 of the injured in the field. The Israeli military described the event as a 'violent confrontation' between Palestinians and Israelis that included destruction of property and physical violence, which police forces and soldiers dispersed. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence by Israeli settlers during the war in Gaza. These are some of the high-profile Palestinians being freed by Israel on Saturday RAMALLAH, West Bank — Among the most prominent Palestinian prisoners set to be released Saturday is Ahmed Barghouti, 48, a close aide of Marwan Barghouti, a militant leader and iconic Palestinian political figure. Israel sentenced Ahmed Barghouti to life on charges that he dispatched suicide bombers during the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in the early 2000s to carry out attacks that killed Israeli civilians. He was arrested alongside Marwan Barghouti in 2002. Ahmed Barghouti and 23 other prisoners serving life sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis will be deported to Egypt. Other prominent prisoners being released include the three Sarahneh brothers from the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan, who have been imprisoned since 2002 for involvement in suicide bombings against Israelis during the second intifada. Two of them — Ibrahim, 55, and Musa, 63 — are being released back to their homes while the third, 45-year-old Khalil, who was sentenced to life for driving a suicide bomber to Jerusalem for an attack that killed an Israeli police officer, is being transferred to Egypt on Saturday. Nearly all of the 369 Palestinians being released will go back to Gaza or be deported to Egypt RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Palestinian Authority’s commission of prisoners’ affairs has published the names of 369 Palestinians jailed by Israel slated to be released on Saturday in exchange for three Israeli hostages in the latest swap of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal. Just eight Palestinians will be received by crowds of family, friends and supporters in the occupied West Bank. Four prisoners will be released back to their homes in east Jerusalem. Twenty-four prisoners serving life sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis will be sent to exile in Egypt. The remaining 333 Palestinians who will be released Saturday were detained from the Gaza Strip after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack and Israel’s subsequent invasion of the enclave. Israeli forces in Gaza have arrested hundreds of people in the search for militants. As part of the ceasefire deal that paused the fighting in Gaza last month, Israel committed to releasing more than 1,000 the Palestinians detained from Gaza without trial, on the condition that they had not participated in the Oct. 7 attack. Lebanese protesters set fire to UN peacekeeping vehicles BEIRUT — Protesters in Lebanon's capital attacked a convoy of U.N. peacekeepers near the Beirut airport and burned three vehicles on Friday, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported. The Lebanese army intervened to disperse them. The U.N. peacekeeping force did not immediately comment on the episode and it was unclear if anyone had been hurt. Demonstrators have blocked the road to the airport to protest Lebanese authorities' decision to revoke permission for a passenger plane from Iran to fly to Beirut on Thursday, leaving dozens of Lebanese passengers stranded. The decision to ban the Iranian plane came after the Israeli army issued a statement claiming Iran was smuggling cash via civilian flights to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Lebanon’s civil aviation agency said 'additional security measures' meant some flights were temporarily rescheduled until Feb. 18 -- the same day as a deadline for Israel and Hezbollah to fully implement their ceasefire agreement, including a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon. Palestinian and other diplomats at the UN call for the Gaza ceasefire to be upheld UNITED NATIONS — The Palestinian U.N. ambassador and diplomats from about 30 other nations urged that the Gaza ceasefire deal be upheld and for countries to oppose any plan to relocate the territory’s population. Ambassador Riyad Mansour noted that hundreds of thousands of his fellow Palestinians eagerly returned to Gaza’s decimated north during the ceasefire. 'It is a clear signal that they want to go back to the places where they were born, where they have memories, where they have their stories,' Mansour told reporters at the U.N. headquarters on Friday. U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and settle them elsewhere in the region has thrown the ceasefire's future into further doubt. Trump envisions redeveloping the coastal strip into a 'Riviera of the Middle East.' Kuwaiti U.N. Ambassador Tareq Al Banai retorted Friday that Arab countries 'want to see a Riviera — a Palestinian, Gazan Riviera.' In Gaza, hunger and anxiety about an uncertain future DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Displaced Palestinians in central Gaza remain fearful that the war could resume, longing for stability as they struggle to find shelter and secure food. 'The war paused, but starvation is still ongoing,' said Um Yehia Shaheen, a displaced woman from Gaza City. Some 30 people lined up in front of a charity kitchen on Friday in Deir al-Balah, carrying buckets or pots for their share of yellow rice and small chunks of meat. Children in line held bags of flatbread. Frozen meat is now available in the market, an AP journalist confirmed. 'If it wasn’t for this charity kitchen,' she said, 'we wouldn’t have been able to find an alternative for ourselves because everything is expensive and there are no humanitarian assistance coupons.' Nearby, a camp for displaced Palestinians is filled with tents made from torn fabric and tarps, set against a backdrop of damaged and abandoned buildings. 'I’m scared the war would resume, and I hope the situation would improve and things get calm,' said Abdel Qader Saed, a displaced man from Jabaliya, 'and that equipment to remove the rubble would be brought in so that if any of us went back home, we would be able to set up a tent for shelter.' US general sees progress as Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deadline approaches BEIRUT — The U.S. representative on a committee overseeing the ceasefire agreement that ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war said Friday that 'significant progress' had been made ahead of a looming deadline to implement all the terms of the deal. However, Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers' statement appeared to leave some ambiguity on whether Israel would withdraw its forces from all of southern Lebanon by the ceasefire's Feb. 18 deadline, saying only that he was confident 'all population centers in the Southern Litani Area' would be back under Lebanese control by then. In areas where Israeli forces pull out, the Lebanese army and a U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL are tasked with ensuring Hezbollah does not reestablish a military presence. The deadline for Israel and Hezbollah to withdraw was initially set for late January, but Israel and Lebanon agreed to extend it. Lebanese officials say they won't agree to another extension and adamantly reject an Israeli proposal to keep its forces in five border points after leaving other areas. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said Thursday that his country had proposed a beefed-up UNIFIL presence, including French forces, in place of Israeli troops at those five points. The monitoring committee also includes France, Lebanon, Israel and UNIFIL. More than 360 Palestinian prisoners to be released RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Hamas-linked prisoners’ information office says that a total of 369 Palestinians jailed by Israel will be released Saturday in exchange for three Israeli hostages held in Gaza. It said Friday that 36 of the Palestinians scheduled for release were serving life sentences. The statement did not specify how many of them would be released into exile in Egypt ahead of deportation to other countries as part of the agreement between Israel and Hamas. The rest of the 333 Palestinians were from Gaza, all arrested after Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that ignited the 15-month war. Under the ceasefire deal, Israel committed to release more than 1,000 Palestinians from Gaza detained during the Israeli invasion of the enclave on the condition that they had not participated in the Oct. 7 attack. The Palestinian Authority did not immediately announce the names of those set to be freed Saturday. 3 Israelis with dual nationalities to be released JERUSALEM — The three men set to be freed by Hamas on Saturday in the sixth wave of hostage releases under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire are all Israeli civilians with dual nationalities. All were from the same communal farm, Kibbutz Nir Oz, where some 80 of roughly 400 residents were taken hostage in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack. The men are Israeli-Argentinian Iair Horn, 46, Israeli-Russian Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov, 29, and Israeli-American Sagui Dekel Chen, 36. Horn is an Israel-Argentinian who was kidnapped along with his brother, Eitan Horn, who was staying with him at the time. Eitan Horn remains in Hamas captivity. Chen was outside working on a bus renovation when militants stormed the kibbutz. His wife, Avital, hid in the safe room with their two daughters. Avital was seven months pregnant and gave birth to a third daughter, Shachar Mazal, in December, while Dekel Chen was in captivity. Israeli-Russian Sasha Trufanov was taken hostage along with three members of his family: grandmother Irena Tati, mother Yelena (Lena) and his girlfriend Sapir Cohen. Sasha’s father Vitaly Trufanov was killed on October 7, 2023. The rest of his family was released in a brief ceasefire period November 2023. Hamas released the names in a statement earlier Friday. Saturday’s release will be the sixth since the Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect. Turkish president blasts Trump's Gaza proposal ANKARA, Turkey - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan continued his strong criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza, arguing that the U.S. president was making a mistake by trusting Israeli 'lies' and disregarding the 'history and values' of the region. Speaking to a group of journalists on his return from a trip to three Asian nations, Erdogan urged Trump to fulfil his promises to promote peace rather than conflict. 'Believing what (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu — whose legal process is still ongoing in his country — says will do nothing but shed blood in the region,' Erdogan said, according to a transcript of comments that were made available to The Associated Press on Friday. 'This will not bring the longed-for peace, on the contrary, it will deepen conflicts and increase blood and tears.' Erdogan, a vocal advocate of Palestinian rights, also appeared to suggest that the U.S. president should refrain from taking decisions regarding the region without consultations. 'There is no room for a ‘it’s done whether you like it or not’ approach in this region,' Erdogan said. 'The expulsion of the Palestinian people from Gaza is unacceptable.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-3-israeli-men-named-as-latest-to-be-freed-in-hostage-release/	2025-02-14T13:13:49-08:00
