Israel-Hamas war latest: With nearly 700 killed in a week, Lebano...	Nearly 700 people have been killed in Lebanon this week, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Israel has dramatically escalated strikes, saying it is targeting Hezbollah’s military capacities and senior Hezbollah commanders. Top Israeli officials have threatened to repeat the destruction of Gaza in Lebanon if the Hezbollah fire continues, raising fears that Israel’s actions in Gaza since Oct. 7 would be repeated in Lebanon. The International Organization for Migration estimated Thursday that more than 200,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel, sparking the Israel-Hamas war. Lebanon says a total of 1,540 people have been killed within its borders in that time. The United States, France and other allies jointly called for a 21-day cease-fire. Lebanon's foreign minister said the country welcomed the cease-fire efforts, and decried Israel’s 'systematic destruction of Lebanese border villages.' Israeli military vehicles were seen transporting tanks and armored vehicles toward the country’s northern border with Lebanon, and commanders have issued a call-up of reservists. Netanyahu says Israel is striking Hezbollah 'with full force' and won’t stop until its goals are achieved. ___ Here’s the latest: Houthi rebels claim missile attack targeting Israel DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels have claimed a missile attack that targeted Israel early Friday morning. Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, claimed the attack in a pre-recorded statement released by the Houthis. He claimed the rebels launched both a missile and drone. The missile targeted Tel Aviv while the drone targeted another city, though Israel did not acknowledge the drone. No injuries were reported. Israel’s military said earlier Friday it used an Arrow interceptor missile to down the Houthi missile, which saw some shrapnel fall. It’s the second attack by the Houthis to target Tel Aviv in recent weeks. Friday’s launch comes amid Israel’s intensified airstrike campaign targeting Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia. Both Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Iran. UN: More than 30,000 people crossed from Lebanon into Syria in 3 days GENEVA — The U.N. refugee agency says 'well over 30,000' people have crossed from Lebanon into neighboring Syria over the last 72 hours in the wake of fighting between the militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces in Lebanon. Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, the representative for refugee agency UNHCR in Syria, said roughly half of the people who have fled were children and adolescents. He said about 80% were Syrians returning to their home country and the rest were Lebanese. 'Now these, of course, are people who are fleeing bombs and who are crossing into a country that has been suffering from its own crisis and violence for 13 years now,' he told reporters in Geneva by video from the Lebanon-Syria border. Syria is facing 'economic collapse,' he said. 'I think that this just illustrates the kind of extremely difficult choices both Syrians and Lebanese are having to make,' he said. Israeli strike kills a family of 9 in a Lebanese border town, authorities say BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike on a border village has killed nine members of the same family, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Friday. NNA said nine people were killed in the early Friday airstrike on the village of Chebaa that destroyed their three-story building. Chebaa is in an area where the borders of Syria, Israel and Lebanon meet, and was struck several times in recent months. On Friday, Israeli warplanes struck towns and villages in southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley, according to NNA. Israeli military reports more strikes from Lebanon JERUSALEM — Incoming fire from Lebanon into Israel continued Friday, with one man suffering wounds from shrapnel. The Israeli military said four drones came across the border Friday, all of which were intercepted. Earlier Friday, the Israeli military said another 10 projectiles came into Israel from Lebanon, with some intercepted and others falling into open fields. It said it later targeted launchers in Lebanon behind the missile attacks. Hezbollah claimed it had targeted the Israeli city of Tiberias with missiles. The Israeli military said its warplanes had struck launchers in Haddatha, Lebanon, that it said fired the rockets at Tiberius in northern Israel. Israeli strike in Syria kills 5 soldiers DAMASCUS — An overnight Israeli airstrike on a military site in the area of Kfar Yabous in Syria near the border with Lebanon killed five Syrian army soldiers and injured another, Syrian state news agency SANA reported Friday, citing an unidentified military official. Israel's military did not immediately acknowledge the strike. Israel regularly targets military sites in Syria and facilities linked to Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah but rarely acknowledges them. Those strikes have become more frequent as Hezbollah has exchanged fire with Israeli forces for the past 11 months against the backdrop of Israel’s war against Hamas — a Hezbollah ally — in Gaza. Tens of thousands of Lebanese and Syrians have fled across the border from Lebanon into Syria since the beginning of the week under intense Israeli bombardment that Israel says is targeting Hezbollah militants and weapons. The week's strikes have killed an estimated 700 people, including at least 150 women and children. Trade unions file claim at United Nations for Palestinian workers GENEVA — A group of international trade unions on Friday filed a complaint against Israel at the United Nations labor organization in a bid to win compensation for 200,000 Palestinians who have gone unpaid or seen their benefits withheld after the Oct. 7 attacks. The nine unions say the workers from both Gaza and the West Bank had been employed in Israel before the deadly attacks by armed militants, but were barred from entering to go to their jobs afterward. As a result, the workers and their families have faced millions of dollars’ worth of lost income, financial insecurity and no access to remedies through the courts, they said. 'These workers have experienced widespread wage theft due to the suspension of work permits and the unilateral termination of their contracts,' said a joint statement from the unions, whose members are active in industries as diverse as construction, education, journalism, agriculture, hospitality and transportation. The filing at the International Labor Organization in Geneva, of which Israel is a member country, is based on language in its constitution that seeks to ensure that countries uphold international commitments they have already made. Such economic woes that many Palestinians have faced come on top of the bloodshed, displacement and other troubles faced by Gaza and the West Bank as Israel continues its campaign against armed Palestinian militants. The Philippines is preparing to evacuate thousands of its citizens from Lebanon MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine government is bracing to evacuate thousands of Filipino workers in Lebanon in case the deadly conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group further escalates, Philippine officials said Friday. More than 11,000 Filipinos live and work in Lebanon, often as house cleaners. Philippine officials have not yet ordered a mandatory evacuation of its citizens because it was not yet clear whether a full-scale war would erupt, including an Israeli ground attack. Many Filipinos were adamant not to leave their jobs in Lebanon and return to uncertainties at home, but they have been told to be ready to evacuate any time, Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo De Vega told a news briefing in Manila. They say 'it’s better for them to die in war than to die of hunger,' De Vega said. But he added without elaborating that the Philippine government prepared a contingency plan for a massive evacuation if widespread ground fighting erupts across Lebanon. Philippine Ambassador to Lebanon Raymond Balatbat told reporters in Manila via video on Friday that many Filipinos there 'will only decide to leave when the situation is so bad, when the war is at their doorsteps.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-hamas-war-latest-with-nearly-700-killed-in-a-week-lebanon-fears-gaza-level-violence/	2024-09-27T04:50:35-07:00	
As the Ukraine war enters a critical period, the EU moves ahead w...	BRUSSELS (AP) — As the war in Ukraine enters a critical period, the European Union has decided that it must take responsibility for what it sees as an existential threat to security in its own neighborhood and is preparing to tackle some of the financial burden, perhaps even without the United States. EU envoys have been working in Brussels this week on a proposal to provide Ukraine with a hefty loan package worth up to 35 billion euros ($39 billion). It was announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during a trip to Kyiv last Friday. 'Crucially, this loan will flow straight into your national budget,' she told President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 'It will provide you with significant and much-needed fiscal space. You will decide how best to use the funds, giving you maximum flexibility to meet your needs.' Zelenskyy wants to buy weapons and bomb shelters and rebuild Ukraine's shattered energy network as winter draws near. In international matters, particularly involving major conflicts, the EU rarely moves ahead without the U.S., but it hopes this decision will encourage others to come forward. Russian troops and an election close in Almost 1,000 days since their full-scale invasion, Russian forces are making advances in the east. Ukraine’s army has a shaky hold on part of the Kursk region in Russia, which has provided a temporary morale boost, but as casualties mount it remains outmanned and outgunned. On the political front, Zelenskyy hopes to secure support for a 'victory plan' that might force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. He’s trying to persuade U.S. President Joe Biden and other allies to help strengthen Ukraine’s hand in any future talks. But a U.S. election looms, and polls suggest that Donald Trump might return to the White House in January. Trump has been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine. On Wednesday, he said Zelenskyy should have made concessions to Putin before the invasion began in February 2022. Most of the 27-nation EU fears that a Putin victory would lead to deep uncertainty. Russia’s armed forces are depleted and currently incapable of another war, but the prospect of a future land grab in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland remains. Reworking a G7 loan plan The EU loans are part of a plan by the Group of Seven major industrialized nations to take advantage of interest earned on about $250 billion worth of frozen Russian assets, most of them held in Europe. These windfall profits are estimated at around 4.5 billion to 5.5 billion euros ($5 billion to $6 billion) a year. The profits underpin the G7 plan. The EU would stump up $20 billion, the U.S. $20 billion, and Canada, Japan and the U.K. $10 billion together, for a combined total of $50 billion. The scheme expires at the end of the year, before the next U.S. president takes office. Now, amid differences over how long the Russian asset freeze should be guaranteed, the EU has decided to go it alone. Its offer of up to $39 billion in loans accounts for almost the entirety of the U.S. share as well. The U.S. wants to ensure that the assets are locked away for at least three years to guarantee the income. But EU member Hungary insists this should only happen in 6-month increments. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán styles himself as a peacemaker and is too close to Putin for many of his partners' comfort. The other 26 EU countries feel they must move now because time is running out. An evolving alliance with the United States The U.S. election is just weeks away. The Europeans are wary of Trump’s unpredictability and are testing scenarios to help protect themselves from the kind of battering, like tariff hikes, their economies received during his past presidency. But they also see the Democrats as more inward looking these days. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act left European leaders fuming over rules that favored American products. China and war in the Middle East are the foreign policy priorities of Democrat or Republican candidates alike, and for now the U.S. is in the grip of election campaign fever. The EU hopes that Vice President Kamala Harris, if she is elected president, would enter the loan program as previously planned and reduce the EU's financial burden. But that remains an open question for now, and EU members say Ukraine’s position is too precarious to hesitate. Political delays in the U.S. Congress last year over a $60 billion support package starved Ukrainian troops of weapons and ammunition for months, resulting in 'real consequences on the battlefield,' in the words of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Pressing ahead on pressing needs Helping Ukraine in military terms is a challenge for the Europeans. They could not do it alone, and cannot match the U.S. transport, logistics and equipment superiority, despite progress in ramping up their defense industries to supply arms and ammunition. But the world’s biggest trading bloc does wield economic might. It has already given Ukraine about $132 billion since the full-scale invasion started. Within weeks it appears ready to provide tens of billions more, even though going it alone is not in the EU's DNA. 'I do not know what the Americans, the United States with the new presidency, will do or not,' EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Tuesday. But, he said, 'as long as the Ukrainians want to resist, we have to support them. Otherwise, we will make a historical mistake.' The Biden administration did announce Wednesday that the U.S. will send Ukraine a major military aid package, including cluster bombs and an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles. A U.S. official also said billions of dollars more in assistance would arrive over the coming months. Meanwhile, deliberations on the EU's share of the G7 loan package will be high on the agenda of a summit of the bloc's leaders in Brussels on Oct. 17-18. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-as-the-ukraine-war-enters-a-critical-period-the-eu-moves-ahead-without-the-us/	2024-09-26T23:17:33-07:00	
Lebanon fears Gaza-like carnage as Israel ramps up airstrikes acr...	When she first heard about the evacuation warnings Israel was sending to residents of Lebanon, Aline Naser’s thoughts immediately turned to Gaza. For the past year, the 26-year-old Beirut resident has been following with horror the reports about besieged Palestinians in the Gaza Strip ordered to move from one place to the other, fleeing to 'humanitarian zones' only to be bombed and ordered to leave again. The Israeli calls for Lebanese citizens to evacuate ahead of a widening air campaign, delivered via mobile phone alerts, calls and leaflets this week, seemed chillingly familiar. 'It’s definitely something on the back of my mind, and we don’t really know where exactly is safe,' she said. Almost a year after the start of its war in Gaza, Israel has turned its focus on Lebanon, significantly ratcheting up its campaign against its archenemy Hezbollah. Among many in Lebanon, there is fear that Israel’s military operations in Lebanon would follow the same Gaza playbook: Evacuation orders, mass displacement and overwhelming airstrikes. Israel says its strikes target Hezbollah weapons sites and militants. There are key differences between Gaza and Lebanon and how Israel has so far conducted its operations, which it says aim to push back Hezbollah from the border so that tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by Hezbollah's rocket attacks can return to their homes. Although it has said it is preparing for a possible ground operation, Israel has so far not sent troops into Lebanon. Still, there are fears that Israel’s actions in Gaza, including the use of overwhelming and what rights groups and the United Nations have described as disproportionate force, would be repeated in Lebanon. Top Israeli officials have threatened to repeat the destruction of Gaza in Lebanon if the Hezbollah fire continues. On Monday, Israel struck 1,600 targets across Lebanon, killing 492 people and wounding 1,645, and causing a massive wave of displacement as thousands fled from south Lebanon north. It was a staggering one-day toll that shocked a nation used to war. It was by far the deadliest barrage since the monthlong 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, when an estimated 1,000 people in Lebanon were killed. Throughout the day, the Israeli military sent warnings to residents to immediately evacuate in anticipation of the strikes and to stay away from places where Hezbollah stores weapons — something most would have no way of knowing. 'Please get out of harm’s way now,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded message. 'Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes.' Israel’s evacuation orders have been a central part of its military campaign in Gaza for the past year. In the first week after launching war, Israel ordered 1.1 million civilians in the Gaza Strip to relocate from the north to the south, sowing confusion and fear in the overcrowded enclave. Since then, the Israeli military has issued dozens of evacuation orders calling on Palestinians to evacuate to Israeli-designated 'humanitarian zones.' Israeli officials say they are targeting Hamas militants who have embedded themselves among the population. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza. The Health Ministry, part of the territory’s Hamas government, does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says that just over half the dead have been women and children.' With Gaza's borders sealed, residents of the crammed territory are trapped with nowhere to go, whereas in Lebanon, those fleeing Israeli strikes have been able to move to safer areas. Thousands have fled to neighboring Syria, while others have left through the country’s airport. A second front for Israel Hezbollah started firing rockets on Israel in support of Gaza on Oct. 8, a day after Hamas militants launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250. Since then, the two sides have been engaged in cross border strikes that have gradually escalated and displaced tens of thousands of civilians on both sides of the border. Many Lebanese have been following the growing hostilities with a mixture of nonchalance and dread, hoping they would remain contained. Lebanon has been in the throes of an economic meltdown since 2019 and can ill afford another devastating war with Israel. Hostilities escalated dramatically last week when thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing dozens of people and leaving thousands, including many civilians, with severe injuries to the eyes, face and limbs. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack. Israel has also killed several top Hezbollah commanders in Beirut. Meanwhile, intensifying Hezbollah barrages have wounded several people in Israel. As the region appeared to be teetering toward another all-out war, Jana Bsat, 25, who works for a media analysis company in Beirut, said she now has a bag packed, ready for immediate evacuation. She feels it’s only a matter of time. 'It feels surreal, to be honest. We heard about what was happening in Gaza and now we’re experiencing it for ourselves,' she said. 'I am in disgust of all this fear-mongering and psychological torture,' she said, adding: 'But then you remember, it’s all part of a warfare strategy and it’s not going to stop anytime soon.' Lebanon is not Gaza While Israel’s actions in Lebanon may have echoes of Gaza, the conflicts are different. In Gaza, Israel’s goal is the complete destruction of Hamas, whereas Israel’s stated goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from its border. Whereas Hamas rules Gaza, Hezbollah is a powerful militia with enormous influence inside Lebanon, and has representatives in the country's parliament and government. In 2006, Israel flattened entire Beirut neighborhoods and bombed Lebanon's only international airport as well as key infrastructure, including bridges and power stations. By contrast, its current campaign seems to be, for the large part, targeting Hezbollah, although many civilians have also been killed. Unlike Gaza, Lebanon is also a mixed tapestry of political and religious groups, including Christian and Sunni-majority areas where there is significant opposition to the Iran-backed Shiite Hezbollah. Ali Safa, a 30-year-old interior designer who fled to Beirut from south Lebanon with his family this week, said he isn’t worried about the Gaza scenario being repeated in Lebanon. 'Gaza is an open prison, it is besieged. Lebanon is much larger, it is not encircled. And it has Hezbollah, which is a much bigger force, much better-equipped than Hamas,' he said. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, speaking at the United Nations Wednesday, said the world 'cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza.' Frayed nerves Whether the current hostilities will expand into an all-out war or whether Israel will launch a ground invasion remains to be seen. Israel’s army chief said Wednesday that preparations were underway for a possible ground operation. Many in Lebanon say they are haunted by the nonstop churn of horrifying images from Gaza over the past year, fearing the same scenario in Lebanon. For several months, low-flying Israeli fighter jets have launched sonic booms over Lebanon, rattling windows and terrifying residents. More recently, the buzzing sound of Israeli military drones in Lebanese skies have added to the anxiety. Some have gotten used to it. At a funeral for a Hezbollah commander recently where a few hundred people gathered, hardly anyone flinched when low-flying Israeli planes caused a thundering boom that shook the ground. Bsat said at some point she, too, got used to hearing sonic booms that made the windows in her house shake. 'The drones I also got used to and now, unfortunately, the bombing,' she said via Whatsapp. 'I’ve come to terms with reality, but my hands still can’t stop shaking as I’m writing this,' she said. 'I’m still dreading what is going to happen here.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-lebanon-fears-gaza-like-carnage-as-israel-ramps-up-airstrikes-across-the-country/	2024-09-26T21:27:17-07:00	
Israel's Netanyahu appears to downplay hopes for a cease-fire as ...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The Israeli prime minister on Thursday appeared to downplay hopes of an imminent truce with Hezbollah after the United States and its allies called for an immediate 21-day cease-fire to 'provide space for diplomacy.' In a statement released as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was en route to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly, his office said there was only a proposal on the table and that he had not yet responded to it. The statement also denied that there had been any directive to ease up on fighting on the northern border with Lebanon. The comments raised questions about a new international initiative to halt increasingly heavy exchanges of fire that have killed hundreds of people in Lebanon and threatened to trigger an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah. The statement was issued as Israel threatens to launch a ground invasion into Lebanon to push the militant group away from the border and after an Israeli strike in Lebanon killed 20 people, most of them from Syria. Soon after the statement was issued, the TV station of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group reported an Israeli airstrike in a suburb of Beirut. Al-Manar TV did not give details about the strike. The Israeli military said it carried out a strike south of Beirut without elaborating. Military officials said details will would be released later. The Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, previously said that the country would continue fighting 'with all our might until victory and the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes.' Hezbollah has not yet responded to the proposal for a pause in fighting. Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has welcomed it, but his government has no sway over the group. Hezbollah has insisted it would halt its strikes only if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, where Israel has been battling Hamas for nearly a year. That appears out of reach despite months of negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. In its statement, Netanyahu's office said that 'the fighting in Gaza will also continue until all the objectives of the war have been achieved.' Netanyahu is expected to meet with other world leaders on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. In other developments, a far-right partner in Netanyahu’s government threatened to quit the coalition if a permanent cease-fire is reached with Hezbollah. Itamar Ben-Gvir, head of the Jewish Power party, threatened to suspend cooperation with the coalition if a temporary deal is reached. 'If a temporary cease-fire becomes permanent, we will resign from the government,' he said. It was the latest sign of displeasure from Netanyahu’s hard-line government toward international cease-fire efforts. If Ben-Gvir leaves the coalition, Netanyahu would lose his parliamentary majority and could see his government come toppling down, though opposition leaders have said they would offer support for a cease-fire deal. Israel launched a massive operation in Gaza after a Hamas-led attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, and some 250 were taken hostage. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since then, according to local officials. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel one day after the Oct. 7 attack in support of its Hamas allies, and Hezbollah and Israel have traded fire ever since. Israeli families of the hostages said they are pushing for a possible cease-fire deal for Lebanon to include provisions for the war in Gaza, especially securing release of the roughly 70 hostages still presumed to be alive and the bodies of some 30 others. Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was kidnapped and was one of six Israelis whose bodies were recovered from tunnels in Gaza in August, said the hostages' families are feeling forgotten as attention shifts to the northern front. 'We know that these things are connected to each other, the northern part and the southern part. They’re all part of the same large situation which we are in from Oct. 7 on, and we’re very worried that if we don’t make the right decisions now, we will miss this amazing opportunity to get the hostages out,' Dickmann said on Tuesday, as hopes for cease-fire deal swelled. He slammed Netanyahu for missing multiple opportunities to free his cousin and begged him not to miss another chance by agreeing to a truce with both Hezbollah and Hamas that would include provisions for the hostages. Dickmann’s sister-in-law, Yarden Roman-Gat, was released in a weeklong cease-fire deal last November, along with some 100 other hostages. Israel has carried out days of heavy strikes across Lebanon, targeting what it says are Hezbollah rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. The militants have fired hundreds of rockets into Israel and on Wednesday targeted Tel Aviv for the first time with a longer-range missile that was intercepted. On Thursday, an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon hit a building housing Syrian workers and their families, killing 19 Syrians and one Lebanese, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It was one of the deadliest single strikes in the intensified air campaign against Hezbollah. Lebanon’s National News Agency said the strike occurred near the ancient city of Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley, which runs along the Syrian border. The news agency initially reported that 23 people were dead. Hussein Salloum, a local official in Younine, said most of the dead were women and children, and that rescue efforts lasted through the night and into Thursday morning. 'We dug through the rubble with our own hands' until a small bulldozer was brought in, Salloum told The Associated Press by telephone. 'We had very limited capabilities.' The Lebanese Red Cross said it recovered nine bodies, while others were recovered by Hezbollah’s paramedic service and the Lebanese Civil Defense. Lebanon, with a population of around 6 million, hosts nearly 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands who are unregistered — the world’s highest refugee population per capita. Israel struck 75 sites overnight across southern and eastern Lebanon, the military said. At least 45 projectiles were fired from Lebanon early Thursday, all of which were intercepted or fell in open areas, it said. Israeli strikes since Monday have killed more than 630 people in Lebanon, according to local health authorities, who say around a quarter were women and children. Several people have been wounded by shrapnel in Israel. The fighting has killed dozens of people in Israel and driven tens of thousands from their homes on both sides of the border. Israel has vowed to do whatever is necessary to allow its citizens to return, and it has moved thousands of troops to the northern border in preparation for a possible ground operation. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-lebanese-state-media-says-an-israeli-strike-killed-23-syrian-workers/	2024-09-26T05:50:37-07:00	
Trump says Ukraine's people are 'dead'	Former President Donald Trump described Ukraine in bleak and mournful terms Wednesday, referring to its people as 'dead' and the country itself as 'demolished,' and further raising questions about how much the former president would be willing if elected again to concede in a negotiation over the country's future. Trump argued Ukraine should have made concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the months before Russia's February 2022 attack, declaring that even 'the worst deal would’ve been better than what we have now.' Trump, who has long been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine, frequently claims that Russia never would have invaded if he was president and that he would put an end to the war if he returned to the White House. But rarely has he discussed the conflict in such detail. Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Mint Hill, N.C., Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Nell Redmond) His remarks, at a North Carolina event billed as an economic speech, come on the heels of a debate this month in which he pointedly refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war. On Tuesday, Trump touted the prowess of Russia and its predecessor Soviet Union, saying that wars are 'what they do.' The Republican former president, notoriously attuned to slights, began his denunciation of Ukraine by alluding to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent criticism of Trump and running mate JD Vance. Zelenskyy, who is visiting the U.S. this week to attend the U.N. General Assembly, told The New Yorker that Vance was 'too radical' for proposing that Ukraine surrender territories under Russian control and that Trump 'doesn’t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows how.' Said Trump, 'It's something we have to have a quick discussion about because the president of Ukraine is in our country and he’s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me.' Trump painted Ukraine as a country in ruins outside its capital, Kyiv, short on soldiers and losing population to war deaths and neighboring countries. He questioned whether the country has any bargaining chips left to negotiate an end to the war. 'Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have now,' Trump said. 'If they made a bad deal it would’ve been much better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years.' 'What deal can we make? It’s demolished,' he added. 'The people are dead. The country is in rubble.' Zelenskyy is pitching the White House on what he calls a victory plan for the war, expected to include an ask to use long-range Western weapons to strike Russian targets. While Ukraine outperformed many expectations that it would fall quickly to Russia, outnumbered Ukrainian forces face grinding battles against one of the world’s most powerful armies in the country's east. Ukraine has lost a fifth of its territory and tens of thousands of lives in the conflict. Trump laid blame for the conflict on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival in November. He said Biden 'egged it all on' by pledging to help Ukraine defend itself rather than pushing it to cede territory to Russia. 'Biden and Kamala allowed this to happen by feeding Zelenskyy money and munitions like no country has ever seen before,' Trump said. Notably, Trump did not attack Putin's reasoning for launching the invasion, only suggesting Putin would not have started the war had Trump been in office. He did say of Putin, 'He's no angel.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/trump-says-ukraines-people-are-dead/	2024-09-26T05:15:26-07:00	
Russian missiles and drones target Kyiv for 5 hours and hit Ukrai...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s air defenses battled an overnight Russian aerial attack on the capital Kyiv for five hours, officials said Thursday, as missiles and drones again hammered the Ukrainian power grid. The Kyiv attack injured at least two people, Ukraine’s Emergency Service said. A kindergarten, a gas pipe and around 20 cars were damaged in the city, said the Kyiv Military Administration. In western Ukraine, the air force said, Russia fired three Kinzhal hypersonic ballistic missiles — one of Russia’s most advanced weapons — 'in the direction of' Starokostiantyniv, a city in the Khmelnytskyi region, on Thursday morning. The air force said it could not make further information public, suggesting the missiles were aimed at a sensitive site. Long-range strikes have been a hallmark of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, now deep in its third year, often hitting civilian areas. Attacks on the electricity network have knocked out around 70% of Ukraine’s energy generation capacity, according to the United Nations, bringing blackouts as winter approaches. Air defense systems are a critical need for Ukraine, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was due to meet President Joe Biden in Washington on Thursday in an effort to ensure continuing U.S. military support for his country. Energy infrastructure was hit in Ukraine's western Ivano-Frankivsk region, causing a blackout in parts of the regional capital of the same name, regional Gov. Svitlana Onyshchuk said. The power grid was also targeted in the southern Mykolaiv region, local authorities said without immediately providing further details. Russia launched six missiles and 78 Shahed drones at Ukraine overnight from Wednesday to Thursday, Ukraine’s air force said. Defenses destroyed four of the missiles and 66 drones in the air, it said. In the south, a missile killed a 62-year-old woman in the Odesa region, where homes and cars were damaged, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said. In the city of Zaporizhzhia, at least 10 people were injured in the overnight attack, including a 14-year-old, said regional governor Ivan Fedorov. He published photographs of houses with their windows blown out and walls riddled with shrapnel. The Emergency Service said 12 residential buildings were damaged in the city and 18 people were evacuated. Meanwhile, in the northeastern Sumy region ordnance experts defused a 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) glide bomb that landed without exploding next to a bridge over the River Psel. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russian-missiles-and-drones-target-kyiv-for-5-hours-hitting-ukraines-power-grid/	2024-09-26T04:39:25-07:00	
US and allies call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire between Isr...	NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S., France and other allies jointly called Wednesday for an immediate 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations in the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 600 people in Lebanon in recent days. The joint statement, negotiated on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, says the recent fighting is 'intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.' 'We call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy,' the statement said. 'We call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately.' There was no immediate reaction from the Israeli or Lebanese governments — or Hezbollah — but senior U.S. officials said all parties were aware of the call for a cease-fire. Earlier, representatives for Israel and Lebanon reiterated their support for a U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 war between Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group. The U.S. hopes the new deal could lead to longer-term stability along the border between Israel and Lebanon. Months of Israeli and Hezbollah exchanges of fire have driven tens of thousands of people from their homes, and escalated attacks over the past week have rekindled fears of a broader war in the Middle East. The U.S. officials said Hezbollah would not be a signatory to the cease-fire but believed the Lebanese government would coordinate its acceptance with the group. They said they expected Israel to 'welcome' the proposal and perhaps formally accept it when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks at the General Assembly on Friday. While the deal applies only to the Israel-Lebanon border, the U.S. officials said they were looking to use a three-week pause in fighting to restart stalled negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, another Iranian-backed militant group, after nearly a year of war in Gaza. The allies calling for a halt to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict are the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Work on the proposal came together quickly this week with President Joe Biden’s national security team, led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, meeting with world leaders in New York and lobbying other countries to support the plan, according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic conversations. Blinken first raised the proposal with the French foreign minister Monday and then broadened his outreach that evening at a dinner with the foreign ministers of all the Group of Seven industrialized democracies. During a meeting Wednesday morning with Gulf Cooperation Council foreign ministers, Blinken approached Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan to ask their approval and got it. Blinken and senior White House adviser Amos Hochstein then met with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who signed off on the deal. Sullivan, Hochstein and senior adviser Brett McGurk were also in touch with Israeli officials about the proposal, one of the U.S. officials said. McGurk and Hochstein have been the White House’s chief interlocutors with Israel and Lebanon since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas launched the war in Gaza. The officials said the deal crystallized by late Wednesday afternoon during a conversation on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly between Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron. Blinken expects to meet Netanyahu’s top strategic adviser in New York on Thursday ahead of the prime minister’s arrival. An Israeli official said Netanyahu has given the green light to pursue a possible deal, but only if it includes the return of Israeli civilians to their homes. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing behind-the-scenes diplomacy. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told the U.N. Security Council during a special meeting that 'we are counting on both parties to accept it without delay' and added that 'war is not unavoidable.' At the meeting, Mikati, the Lebanese prime minister, publicly threw his support behind the French-U.S. plan that 'enjoys international support and which would put an end to this dirty war.' He called on the Security Council 'to guarantee the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Lebanese territories and the violations that are repeated on a daily basis.' Israel’s U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, told journalists that Israel would like to see a cease-fire and the return of people to their homes near the border: 'It will happen, either after a war or before a war. We hope it will be before.' Addressing the Security Council later, he made no mention of a temporary cease-fire but said Israel 'does not seek a full-scale war.' Both Danon and Mikati reaffirmed their governments’ commitment to a Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah war. Never fully implemented, it called for a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon to be replaced by Lebanese forces and U.N. peacekeepers, and the disarmament of all armed groups including Hezbollah. Earlier Wednesday, Biden warned in an appearance on ABC’s 'The View' that 'an all-out war is possible' but said he thinks the opportunity also exists 'to have a settlement that can fundamentally change the whole region.' Biden suggested that getting Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a cease-fire could help achieve a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. That war is approaching the one-year mark after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking hostages. Israel responded with an offensive that has since killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not provide a breakdown of civilians and fighters in their count. 'It's possible and I'm using every bit of energy I have with my team … to get this done,' Biden said. 'There's a desire to see change in the region.' The U.S. government also raised the pressure with additional sanctions targeting more than a dozen ships and other entities it says were involved in illicit shipments of Iranian petroleum for the financial benefit of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah. ___ AP reporters Zeke Miller and Darlene Superville in Washington, Josef Federman in Jerusalem, Edith M.

Israel-Hamas war latest: Israel threatens ground operation after ...	The Israeli military is preparing for a possible ground operation in Lebanon, the Israeli army chief said Wednesday as Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets into Israel, including a longer-range projectile that set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv and across central Israel. It was the group’s farthest strike yet. Israel said it intercepted the projectile, and there were no reports of casualties or damage. Addressing troops on the northern border, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said the latest airstrikes were designed to 'prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah.' It was not clear whether Halevi was referring to a ground operation, airstrikes or some other form of retaliation against Hezbollah, which is Lebanon’s strongest political force and, with backing from Iran, is widely considered the top paramilitary group in the Arab world. The Israeli military has said in recent days it had no immediate plans for a ground invasion. Halevi’s comments were the strongest yet suggesting troops could move in. With hostilities intensifying, the Israeli military said Wednesday it would activate two reserve brigades for missions in the north — another sign that Israel plans tougher action. Late Wednesday. the U.S., France and other allies jointly called for an 'immediate' 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The statement was negotiated on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander Tuesday as part of a two-day bombing campaign. The Lebanese health minister said Israeli strikes on Wednesday killed more than 72 people. That raised the death toll from the past three days to 636, with more than 2,000 people wounded, prompting thousands in southern Lebanon to seek refuge from the widening conflict. Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire since the Israel-Hamas war began. Also on Wednesday, a drone hit the port of the southern Israeli city of Eilat an Iran-backed militia in Iraq claimed responsibility. ___ Here’s the latest: US, France and other allies call for an ‘immediate’ 21-day cease-fire between Israel, Hezbollah The U.S., France and other allies called Wednesday for an 'immediate' 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 600 people in Lebanon in recent days. The joint statement, negotiated on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, says the recent fighting is 'intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.' 'We call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy,' the statement reads. 'We call on all parties, including the Governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately.' The signatories include the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar. French citizen living near Lebanon's coastal city Tyre is killed in building collapse after powerful explosion BEIRUT — The French embassy in Lebanon said in a statement that an 87-year-old French citizen living near the coastal city of Tyre was killed on Monday after the building in which he was living collapsed following a 'powerful explosion' nearby. More than 600 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon over the past three days, the highest death toll since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The statement said no other French citizens were known to have been killed. Lebanese official says aim of talks is to reach a deal that begins with a 4-week cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah A Lebanese official said that there are serious efforts, led by the United States, to end fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The official, who has knowledge of the negotiations and who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not permitted to speak to the press on the matter, said the aim of negotiations is to reach a temporary four-week cease-fire. Talks are ongoing in New York where Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati is attending the UN General Assembly. A new deal will be based on implementing U.N. Security Council resolution 1701 that ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, he said. Local media have reported that if reached, the deal will begin with a four-week cease-fire during which there will be talks for on further issues including land border demarcation, boosting Lebanese army presences along the border area. By BASSEM MROUE President of France urges both Israel and Hezbollah to cease launching missiles UNITED NATIONS — President Emmanuel Macron told the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday that, 'Hezbollah for too long has been running an untenable risk of dragging Lebanon into a war,' and that 'Israel cannot, without consequence, just expand its operations to Lebanon.' 'France demands that everyone respect their obligations along the Blue Line,' he said. 'We will therefore act to ensure a diplomatic voice can be heard.' 'There cannot be a war in Lebanon. This is why we urge Israel to cease this escalation in Lebanon, and to Hezbollah to cease missile launches to Israel,' he added. 'We urge all of those who provide them with the means to do so, to stop doing so.' Umbrella group for Iranian-backed Iraqi militias claims the attack on the port of Israel's southern city Eilat BAGHDAD — A group calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group for Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, claimed the attack on the port of Israel’s southern city of Eilat. The group has frequently claimed launching strikes on Israel. Israel’s rescue services said two people suffered light injuries. The attack caused minimal damage. Israeli military says a drone hit the port of the southern Israeli city of Eilat, causing minimal damage JERUSALEM — A drone hit the port of the southern Israeli city of Eilat on Wednesday, and a second one was intercepted by the Israeli Navy, the Israeli military said. Israel’s rescue services said two people suffered light injuries. Footage aired on Israeli media showed a plume of smoke in the area of the port and at least one damaged building. The army said the drones were identified 'approaching from the East.' U.S. is floating a proposal for a temporary Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire, officials say The Biden administration has been floating a proposal for a temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah to calm the escalating conflict that has driven tens of thousands of people from their homes in northern Israel and southern Lebanon, U.S. officials said Wednesday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other U.S. officials have spent the past three days at and on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting of world leaders in New York lobbying other countries to support the plan, which they hope could lead to longer-term stability along the border, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic conversations. However, they said the specifics of the proposal were not yet complete. One official said Israel is supportive of U.S. efforts to deescalate the situation. ON THE SCENE: Lebanese who were injured in bombings describe the attacks BAALBEK, Lebanon — At Dar Al Amal hospital in the city of Baalbek in Lebanon’s Bekaa valley, Soumaya Moussawi was lying in bed with her head bandaged and face bruised Wednesday. She had been sitting outside with family members when warplanes started striking in the distance, she said. 'Then suddenly it hit next to us - we were all thrown in different directions,' she said. 'My two cousins and my father were killed, and my other cousin is in a dangerous condition.' Moussawi insisted that there was no military site near them. She said she is trying to 'remain strong' in her father’s memory. Ali Moussawi, a farmer from the town of Nabi Chit who is not related to Soumaya, said 'it was a normal day and we were working on our land' when a strike hit a house next to it. A missile fragment hit him in the stomach. 'Thank God it wasn’t too bad this time,' he said. 'All the guys who were killed, we’re no better than them.' Blinken and GCC foreign ministers urge diplomatic process in Lebanon to avoid full-blown war UNITED NATIONS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at a meeting with GCC foreign ministers at the United Nations General Assembly said that 'With regard to Lebanon, we’ve been working tirelessly with partners to avoid a full-blown war and to move to a diplomatic process that would allow Israelis and Lebanese alike to go back to their homes.' Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani at the same meeting said: 'I believe it’s getting more and more dangerous and worrying, and we believe that all of us, we have a responsibility to stop this, and just to stand up and to step up and to say enough is enough, and we need to find a solution. GCC Secretary General Jasem Mohamed Al-Budaiwi at the same meeting said that the council is calling on the international community to take urgent measures to halt provocative actions by Israel in Lebanon territory, and to work towards lasting stability in the region. 'The Gulf Cooperation Council reaffirms its steadfast position in supporting Lebanon’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, security, and stability. The council also expresses deep concern regarding the recent Israeli violations in Lebanon territory, which poses serious threat of escalating the region,' he said. Netanyahu says Israel will continue ‘inflicting blows on Hezbollah’ until displaced Israelis can return to their homes JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will continue 'inflicting blows on Hezbollah' until displaced Israeli citizens can return to their homes. In a video statement released by his office on Wednesday, Netanyahu said 'I cannot detail everything we are doing, but I can tell you one thing: we are determined to return our residents in the north safely to their homes.' He added, 'we will not rest until they come home.' Earlier on Wednesday the Israeli army’s Chief of Staff said the military was preparing for the possibility of a ground offensive in Lebanon, after days of extensive Israeli strikes on the country. Biden says all-out war is still possible as fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalates WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Wednesday that 'all-out war' is still possible as fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalates, but he’s hopeful an off-ramp can be found to prevent further bloodshed. Biden spoke during an interview on ABC’s 'The View.' His comments come after days of back and forth between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon that have killed hundreds and rekindled fears of a broader war in the Middle East. Blinken urges Israel and Hezbollah to step back from conflict U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is urging both Israel and Hezbollah to step back from their intensifying conflict, saying that an all-out war would be disastrous for the region and its people. In New York for the annual UN General Assembly, Blinken said Wednesday the U.S. was working on a plan to de-escalate tensions and allow tens of thousands of Israelis and Lebanese to return to homes they have had to evacuate in border areas. 'The best way to get that is not through war, not through escalation,' he said in an interview with CBS news. 'It would be through a diplomatic agreement that has forces pulled back from the border, create a secure environment, people return home.' U.S. officials say they are floating a number of ideas to calm the situation but they have not been specific. Some of those ideas may be discussed at a special UN Security Council meeting on Lebanon that France called for later Wednesday. 'What we’re focused on now, including with many partners here in New York at the UN General Assembly, the Arab world, Europeans and others, is a plan to de-escalate,' Blinken said. 'If there were to be a full-scale war — which we don’t have and which we’re working to avoid — that’s actually not going to solve the problem.' IDF says troops preparing for possible ground operation in Lebanon The Israel Defense Force’s chief of staff says the military is preparing for a possible ground operation in Lebanon. Addressing troops on Israel’s northern border, the IDF Chief of Staff, LT. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said: 'You hear the jets overhead; we have been striking all day. This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah.' He added: 'Today, Hezbollah expanded its range of fire, and later today, they will receive a very strong response. Prepare yourselves.' Halevi said that to achieve the goal of returning displaced citizens of northern Israel to their homes, 'we are preparing the process of a maneuver.' Lebanon says 51 killed and 223 injured in Israeli strikes on Wednesday Lebanon’s health minister says 51 people were killed and 223 injured in Israeli strikes Wednesday. The death toll comes on top of 564 who were killed and more than 1,800 injured in the previous two days, including around 150 women and children. This week has been the deadliest in Lebanon since the bruising monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. In the current conflict, Israel has said it is targeting Hezbollah fighters and weapons storage, while Lebanese officials say it has targeted civilian sites. Human Rights Watch calls for UN probe into strikes in Lebanon and Israel Human Rights Watch says Israel’s ongoing aerial bombardment in Lebanon has put civilians 'across the country at grave risk,' and called for a United Nations investigation into strikes in Lebanon and rocket fire by Hezbollah militants into northern Israel. The global rights group documented over a thousand Israeli strikes across Lebanon since the Israeli military announced a new phase in its conflict with Hezbollah, which has launched over 200 rockets into northern Israeli towns. The organization added that Israel’s warnings for thousands of civilians in Lebanon to evacuate from southern and eastern towns with only two hours’ notice did not give them adequate time to flee and could amount to violations of international law. Israel says it struck 280 Hezbollah targets across Lebanon JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says its air force has struck some 280 Hezbollah targets across Lebanon so far on Wednesday. It said the targets included launchers used to fire rockets on the northern Israeli cities of Safed and Nahariya. Also among the targets were Hezbollah militants, buildings used to store weapons, and ready-to-use launchers, as well as some 60 targets belonging to Hezbollah’s intelligence unit, the army said. The military says its strikes in Lebanon are continuing. UN: Over 90,000 displaced by Israeli strikes on Lebanon The U.N. says over 90,000 people have been displaced by five days of Israeli strikes on Lebanon. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Wednesday that a total of 200,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel nearly a year ago, drawing Israeli retaliation. UN calls for a unified Gaza-West Bank administration RAMALLAH, West Bank — The United Nations have called for the Palestinian Authority to have a postwar role in Gaza and for it to be united with the West Bank. The appeal came in a postwar recovery strategy released Wednesday that provided few details on how the war-ravaged territory would be governed or rebuilt. It said Gaza and the West Bank should be 'unified politically, economically and administratively.' It said there should be no lasting Israeli military presence in the territory but that 'Israel’s legitimate security concerns must be addressed.' The nearly yearlong war, ignited by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel, is still raging with no end in sight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and is opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state. He has suggested that postwar Gaza be governed by local Palestinians with no ties to Hamas or the PA, with Israel maintaining lasting security control. The World Bank in January estimated that the war has caused some $18.5 billion in damage in Gaza, and that was before several months of large-scale Israeli military operations and bombardment. Gulf Arab countries have said they will only contribute to Gaza’s reconstruction and postwar governance as part of a plan for an eventual Palestinian state. Israeli military activates reserve troops as conflict with Hezbollah escalates JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it is activating reserve troops in response to rising tensions with the Hezbollah militant group. The announcement Wednesday indicates that Israel is planning even tougher action against the Lebanese group. It comes hours after Hezbollah fired a missile toward Tel Aviv for the first time. The army said it was calling up 'two reserve brigades for operational missions in the northern arena.' 'This will enable the continuation of combat against the Hezbollah terrorist organization,' it said. 2 wounded by rocket fire in northern Israel First responders say two people were wounded by a rocket fired into northern Israel from Lebanon. The Magen David Adom rescue service said a 32-year-old man was seriously wounded and a 52-year-old was moderately wounded by shrapnel in the agricultural village of Kibbutz Saar. Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets into northern Israel on Wednesday as Israel carried out heavy strikes against the militant group in Lebanon. Pregnant woman and her 4 children killed in Gaza, officials say An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza has killed a pregnant woman and her four children, Palestinian medical officials say. The strike on Wednesday hit a house in the urban Bureij refugee camp, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah. An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies. Hospital records showed that the 35-year-old woman was 6 months pregnant. Her four children were aged between 8 and 18. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and accuses Hamas of putting them in danger by operating in crowded residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. Gaza adds 28 people to the war's death toll, bringing the total to nearly 41,500 CAIRO — The bodies of 28 people killed in Israeli airstrikes were brought to local hospitals over the past day and another 85 people were wounded, the Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday. A total of 41,495 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war nearly a year ago, according to the ministry, which says another 96,006 have been wounded. The ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. It says women and children make up slightly more than half of those killed. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war began with Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 hostages. Around 100 captives are still being held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Pope Francis asks the international community to help stop escalating tensions in Lebanon Pope Francis called for a stop to escalating tensions in Lebanon, calling it 'unacceptable.' 'I am saddened by the news coming from Lebanon, where intense bombing in recent days has caused much death and destruction,' the pope said Wednesday during a regular audience at the Vatican. 'I hope that the international community will make every effort to stop this terrible escalation. It is unacceptable. I express my closeness to the Lebanese people, who have already suffered too much in the recent past.' Hezbollah launches dozens of rockets into northern Israel JERUSALEM — Hezbollah has launched dozens of rockets into northern Israel following days of heavy Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon. The Israeli military said that at one point on Wednesday, more than 40 projectiles were launched simultaneously, though most were intercepted. The municipality in the northern city of Safed said a projectile hit a home, causing a fire. There were no injuries as the residents were not there, it said. Safed has been a frequent target for Hezbollah due to military infrastructure in the area. Earlier on Wednesday, Hezbollah fired a missile at Tel Aviv, triggering air raid sirens. The military said it intercepted the projectile, and there were no casualties or damage. The military said it was launching 'extensive strikes' across southern and eastern Lebanon. An Israeli airstrike on Beirut killed a top Hezbollah commander Tuesday, part of a two-day bombing campaign that has killed hundreds of people and prompted thousands in southern Lebanon to seek refuge from the widening conflict. Israeli warplanes pound southern and eastern Lebanon for a third day BEIRUT — Israeli strikes Wednesday hit a town near the northern coastal town of Byblos, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported. There were no immediate reported casualties, as Israeli warplanes pound southern and eastern Lebanon for a third day in a new phase of their ongoing conflict with the Hezbollah militant group. A photo circulated by the NNA and local media shows large plumes of smoke between the houses and green fields of the town of Maisara, a stone’s throw away from the Mediterranean Sea. The renewed strikes come hours after Hezbollah announced it launched a missile toward Tel Aviv, targeting the headquarters of the Mossad intelligence agency that it blames for a string of assassinations of its top commanders and for the explosion of hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to members of the group and its civilian institutions that wounded thousands and killed dozens of people. As thousands of Lebanese flee the airstrikes from the country’s southern and eastern provinces, NNA said Israel launched three strikes airstrikes over the northeastern city of Hermel, the town of Labweh, and a handful of towns and villages across the country’s southern province. The Israeli army says it will continue its strikes until it can return the tens of thousands of residents who were displaced from Israel's north, near its border with Lebanon. Israel maintains that Hezbollah is launching rocket attacks in and near civilian areas. While Lebanon’s north has mostly been spared from the strikes, Israel has launched rare strikes near the northern town of Mayrooba and in the outskirts of Qartaba. The days of strikes have killed over 560 people, in some of Lebanon’s deadliest days since Israel’s war with Hezbollah in 2006. Israel is pushing the Middle East into an all-out war, neighboring countries say CAIRO — Egypt, Jordan and Iraq say Israel is pushing the Middle East into an all-out war and are calling on the United Nations Security Council to intervene. In a joint statement Wednesday, the three countries’ foreign ministers affirmed that averting a regional war requires the cessation of 'the Israeli aggression on Gaza.' The ministers also condemned the Israeli aggression on Lebanon, and said that 'Israel is pushing the region into an all-out war.' Egypt and Jordan were the first two Arab countries to make peace with Israel. But relations have been strained since the war began in Gaza, triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. Iraq has close ties to Iran, which supports both Hamas and the Lebanese militant group. Hezbollah has traded heavy fire with Israel in recent days. Thousands seek refuge from fighting around the Lebanon-Israel border BEIRUT — Thousands of Lebanese and Syrians have fled from Lebanon across the border to Syria following heavy Israeli bombardment, a United Nations refugee agency official said Wednesday. Rula Amin, Middle East and North Africa spokesperson for the agency known as UNHCR, said that families were 'arriving in buses and cars, but also travelling by foot.' 'Crowds of people — many of whom are women, young children and even infants — continue to await processing for entry,' she said. 'Many will have to spend the night outdoors waiting their turn.' Amin said that UNHCR teams, along with the Syrian Red Crescent, were providing water, mattresses, blankets and food. She noted that the team has 'also seen people, including children, bearing injuries suffered from the recent attacks on Lebanon.' Some 775,000 Syrians are registered with the U.N. Refugee Agency in Lebanon, and hundreds of thousands more are believed to be unregistered in the country. A wave of Israeli strikes on Monday and Tuesday killed more than 560 people in Lebanon, including around 150 women and children. It was the highest death toll in nearly a year of clashes between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, and the deadliest Lebanon has seen since a bruising monthlong war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah. A central Gaza hospital receives 3 more bodies from an Israeli strike DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — A hospital in the central Gaza Strip said Wednesday it received the bodies of three people who were killed in an Israeli strike the previous day. The Awda hospital in the Nuseirat refugee camp said the strike late Tuesday hit a civilian vehicle northeast of the camp, and three bodies were recovered Wednesday morning. The death toll from Tuesday’s strike on a house in the Nuseirat camp reached 11 after the body of a woman arrived at the hospital early Wednesday, the facility said. The dead included at least four children, according to the hospital records. The house strikes also wounded 11 people, the hospital said. Israel intercepts Hezbollah’s farthest strike in 11 months of exchanges JERUSALEM — The Israeli military intercepted a missile launched from Lebanon into central Israel on Wednesday morning in the latest escalation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel Rescue Services said there were no injuries or damage reported from the missile, which triggered sirens in Tel Aviv and Netanya, two large cities in central Israel. It was Hezbollah's farthest strike yet in nearly a year of exchanges. Hezbollah said it had fired a ballistic missile at the headquarters of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, which it said was responsible for the targeted killing of its senior leaders. Israel said it struck the site the missile was launched from in southern Lebanon. Tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have steadily escalated over the past 11 months. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander Tuesday as part of a two-day bombing campaign that left more than 560 people dead and prompted thousands in southern Lebanon to seek refuge from the widening conflict. Hezbollah has launched hundreds of projectiles towards Israel, causing some damage to buildings and homes and lightly injuring a number of people. Britain sends troops to prepare for possible evacuation of its citizens from Lebanon LONDON — Britain will send 700 troops to the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus as it prepares for the possible evacuation of its citizens from Lebanon. Cyprus is located across a strip of water from Lebanon, and Beirut harbor has been used before to evacuate foreign nationals by sea from Lebanon. During the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, tens of thousands of foreigners were evacuated by sea to Cyprus in a fleet of commercial and military vessels, many supplied by American, British, European and other naval forces. The British troops and members of the Border Force were to arrive Wednesday, even as the government made repeated appeals for its nationals to immediately evacuate Lebanon. Britain retains sovereign military base areas in Cyprus, which are considered its territory. 'We continue to urge all sides to step back from conflict to prevent further tragic loss of life. Our government is ensuring all preparations are in place to support British Nationals should the situation deteriorate,' said British Defense Secretary John Healey. 'The Royal Air Force also have aircraft and transport helicopters on standby to provide support if necessary,' Healy said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-hamas-war-latest-israel-intercepts-hezbollahs-farthest-strike-yet-in-11-months-of-exchanges/	2024-09-25T18:45:06-07:00	
US is sending $375 million in military aid to Ukraine and will an...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Wednesday that the U.S. will send Ukraine an undisclosed number of medium-range cluster bombs and an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles in a military aid package totaling about $375 million; a U.S. official also said billions more in assistance over the coming months would be announced Thursday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the $375 million package as global leaders met at the U.N. General Assembly this week and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy used his appearance there to rally support. Zelenskyy will meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington on Thursday to continue his push to get them to allow his troops to use long-range weapon s to strike deeper into Russia. The package announced by Blinken includes air-to-ground bombs, which have cluster munitions and can be fired by Ukraine's fighter jets, as well as munitions for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Javelin and other anti-armor systems, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, bridging systems and other vehicles and military equipment. 'The United States is committed to Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s brutal aggression,' Blinken said in a statement. 'We will deploy this new assistance as quickly as possible to help Ukraine protect its territory and its people.' The latest package of weapons, provided through presidential drawdown authority, is one of the largest approved recently and will take stocks from Pentagon shelves to deliver the weapons more quickly to Ukraine. It comes as nearly $6 billion in funding for aid to Ukraine could expire at the end of the month unless Congress acts to extend the Pentagon’s authority to send weapons from its stockpiles to Kyiv. A U.S. official said, however, that the Biden administration is expected to notify Congress on Thursday of its intent to spend the remaining amount of money under presidential drawdown authority contained in the supplemental budget for Ukraine after the current fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. That amount, $5.5 billion, must either be used or notified to Congress by Sept. 30 or be lost and returned to the Treasury. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the expected move, said lawmakers would be told that the administration will spend the money in multiple aid packages that will be announced after Oct. 1, in the next budget year. Ukrainian and Russian forces are battling in the east, including hand-to-hand combat in the Kharkiv border region where Ukraine has driven Russia out of a huge processing plant in the town of Vovchansk that had been occupied for four months, officials said Tuesday. At the same time, Ukrainian troops continue to hold ground in Russia’s Kursk region after a daring incursion there last month. The aid announcement also came on the heels of Zelenskyy's highly guarded visit on Sunday to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank the workers who are producing 155 mm shells, one of the most critically needed munitions for his country’s fight to fend off Russian ground forces. Including this latest package, the United States has provided more than $56.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russian forces invaded in February 2022. ___ Lee reported from New York.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-to-send-375-million-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-including-medium-range-cluster-bombs/	2024-09-25T16:02:47-07:00	
Ukraine's president calls for unspecified global 'action' to forc...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Ukraine’s president dismissed the notion of peace talks with Moscow on Tuesday, calling instead for unspecified global 'action' to force Russia into peace for invading his country and to comply with the U.N. Charter’s requirement that every country respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all other nations. Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council that Russian President Vladimir Putin is committing 'an international crime' and has broken so many international rules that he won’t stop on his own. 'And that’s why this war can’t simply fade away. That’s why this war can’t be calmed by talks,' Zelenskyy said at a meeting on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly. 'Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what’s needed — forcing Russia into peace as the sole aggressor in this war, the sole violator of the U.N. Charter.' The high-level meeting on the more than 2½-year war in Ukraine was attended by ministers from 14 of the council's 15 member nations. Russia chose to send its lower-level U.N. ambassador. Vassily Nebenzia opened the meeting protesting that Zelenskyy was being given the U.N. spotlight again. He also criticized Slovenia — which holds the rotating council presidency this month — for allowing the Ukrainian leader's 'chorus' to speak. He meant about 10 European Union and NATO members who aren’t on the council but march 'in lockstep' every time they come to the council 'to malign the Russian Federation.' 'When it comes to listening to these hackneyed statements, and these cookie-cutter statements, we have no intention of wasting time on that,' Nebenzia said. Ukraine's sovereignty is defended U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres briefed the council, reiterating the United Nations’ strong support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity under the U.N. Charter. 'Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 – following the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol a decade ago – is a clear violation of these principles,' the U.N. chief said. Zelenskyy said Ukraine knows some countries want to talk to Putin. But, he asked, 'What could they possibly hear from him — that he’s upset because we are exercising our right to defend our people, or that he wants to keep the war and terror going just so no one thinks he was wrong?' China has repeatedly called for talks between Ukraine and Russia. Its foreign minister, Wang Yi, told the council that the suffering and destruction and increasing volatility in the region 'must be turned around.' Wang stressed that Chinese President Xi Jinping believes 'the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected.' China is pursuing peace talks and conducting shuttle diplomacy, Wang said, and its efforts have received wide international support. He pointed to a joint China-Brazil peace plan issued earlier this year. Zelenskyy also went after countries that supply weapons and ammunition to Russia, telling the council Moscow has no legitimate reason to make Iran and North Korea 'de facto accomplices.' The U.S. includes China, Iran and North Korea in its accusations U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised similar issues but also accused China, which has close ties to Russia, of providing Russia with machine tools, microelectronics and other items it is using 'to rebuild, restock and ramp up its war machine and sustain its brutal war.' Wang, who spoke after him, didn't directly respond but said: 'I also wish to make it clear that on the Ukraine issue, any move to shift responsibility onto China or attack and smear China is irresponsible and will lead nowhere.' Blinken also accused Iran of providing armed drones to Russia since 2022 and transferring hundreds of short-range ballistic missiles a few weeks ago – which its new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has denied. North Korea has also delivered trainloads of weapons and ammunition to Russia including ballistic missiles and artillery rounds, Blinken said. 'The more Russia relies on their support, the more Iran and North Korea extract in return,' Blinken said. 'And the more Putin gives to Pyongyang and Tehran, the more he exacerbates threats to peace and security.' To those who ask how the United States and others can help Ukraine defend itself and criticize countries supplying military materiel to Russia, Blinken said the answer is simple: 'Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim.' ___ Edith M.

Trump praises Russia's military record in argument to stop fundin...	SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — Donald Trump on Tuesday praised Russia's military record in historical conflicts and derided U.S. aid to Ukraine as he again insisted he would quickly end the war launched by Moscow's invasion if elected president. Speaking in Savannah, Georgia, Trump mocked President Joe Biden's frequent refrain that the U.S. would back the Ukrainian armed forces until Kyiv wins the war. He raised two long ago conflicts to suggest Moscow would not lose — the former Soviet Union's role in defeating Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in World War II in the 1940s, and French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's failed invasion of Russia more than a century earlier. Trump insisted that the U.S. had 'to get out,' though he did not specify how he would negotiate an ending to U.S. involvement in the war. 'Biden says, ‘We will not leave until we win,’' Trump said, lowering his voice to mimic the Democratic president. 'What happens if they win? That’s what they do, is they fight wars. As somebody told me the other day, they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon. That’s what they do. They fight. And it’s not pleasant.' An official on Trump's campaign also said Tuesday that the Republican nominee will not meet this week with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is visiting the U.S. to attend the opening of the U.N. General Assembly. No meeting had been scheduled between the two, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning, despite a statement from Ukrainian officials last week that said Zelenskyy had planned to see the former president. Trump on Tuesday repeated his characterization of Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for winning U.S. aid to help Ukraine. 'Every time Zelenskyy comes to the United States, he walks away with $100 billion,' Trump said, erroneously. The U.S. has provided more than $56 billion in security assistance since Russia invaded in 2022, according to the State Department. Trump and Zelenskyy have a long history dating back to the former U.S. president's time in the White House. The then-president pressured Zelenskyy to open investigations of Biden and his son Hunter as well as a cybersecurity firm Trump falsely linked to Ukraine. That call — and the hold placed by the White House on $400 million in military aid — led to Trump's first impeachment. Zelenskyy plans to meet with Biden and Harris in Washington. Earlier this week, in an interview with The New Yorker, Zelenskyy implied Trump does not understand and oversimplifies the conflict, and said his running mate JD Vance is 'too radical' and essentially advocates for Ukraine to 'make a sacrifice' by 'giving up its territories.' On Monday, Trump's son Donald Jr. criticized Zelenskyy on X, reminding his followers that the suspect in his father's second assassination attempt had lambasted Trump's approach to foreign policy, including the war in Ukraine. 'So a foreign leader who has received billions of dollars in funding from American taxpayers, comes to our country and has the nerve to attack the GOP ticket for President?' he posted. ___ Associated Press writer Michelle L.

Biden in farewell U.N. address says peace still possible in confl...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Joe Biden declared in his final address to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that the U.S. must not retreat from the world, as Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon edged toward all-out war and Israel’s bloody operation against Hamas in Gaza neared the one-year mark. Biden used his wide-ranging address to speak to a need to end the Middle East conflict and the 17-month-old civil war in Sudan and to highlight U.S. and Western allies' support for Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. He also raised concern over artificial intelligence and its potential to be used for repression. His appearance before the international body offered Biden one of his last high-profile opportunities as president to make the case to keep up robust support for Ukraine, which could be in doubt if former President Donald Trump defeats Vice President Kamala Harris in November. Biden insisted that despite global conflicts, he remains hopeful for the future. 'I’ve seen a remarkable sweep of history,' Biden said. 'I know many look at the world today and see difficulties and react with despair but I do not.' 'We are stronger than we think' when the world acts together, he added. Biden came to office promising to rejuvenate U.S. relations around the world and to extract the U.S. from 'forever wars' in Afghanistan and Iraq that consumed American foreign policy over the last 20 years. 'I was determined to end it, and I did,' Biden said of the Afghanistan exit, calling it a 'hard decision but the right decision.' He acknowledged that it was 'accompanied by tragedy' with the deaths of 13 American troops and hundreds of Afghans in a suicide bombing during the chaotic withdrawal. But his foreign policy legacy may ultimately be shaped by his administration's response to two of the biggest conflicts in Europe and the Middle East since World War II. 'There will always be forces that pull our countries apart,' Biden said, rejecting 'a desire to retreat from the world and go it alone.' He said, 'Our task, our test, is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than the forces pulling us apart.' The Pentagon announced Monday that it was sending a small number of additional U.S. troops to the Middle East to supplement the roughly 40,000 already in the region. All the while, the White House insists Israel and Hezbollah still have time to step back and de-escalate. 'Full scale war is not in anyone’s interest,' Biden said, and despite escalating violence, a diplomatic solution is the only path to peace. Biden had a hopeful outlook for the Middle East when he addressed the U.N. just a year ago. In that speech, Biden spoke of a 'sustainable, integrated Middle East' coming into view. At the time, economic relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors were improving with implementation of the Abraham Accords that Israel signed with Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates during the Trump administration. Biden's team helped resolve a long-running Israel-Lebanon maritime dispute that had held back gas exploration in the region. And Israel-Saudi normalization talks were progressing, a game-changing alignment for the region if a deal could be landed. 'I suffer from an oxymoron: Irish optimism,' Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they met on the sidelines of last year's U.N. gathering. He added, 'If you and I, 10 years ago, were talking about normalization with Saudi Arabia ... I think we’d look at each other like, ‘Who’s been drinking what?’' Eighteen days later, Biden's Middle East hopes came crashing down. Hamas militants stormed into Israel killing 1,200, taking some 250 hostage, and spurring a bloody war that has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza and led the region into a complicated downward spiral. Now, the conflict is threatening to metastasize into a multi-front war and leave a lasting scar on Biden's presidential legacy. Israel and Hezbollah traded strikes again Tuesday as the death toll from a massive Israeli bombardment climbed to nearly 560 people and thousands fled from southern Lebanon. It's the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Israel has urged residents of southern Lebanon to evacuate from homes and other buildings where it claimed Hezbollah has stored weapons, saying the military would conduct 'extensive strikes' against the militant group. Hezbollah, meanwhile, has launched dozens of rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes last week that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters. Dozens were also killed last week and hundreds more wounded after hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah militants exploded, a sophisticated attack that was widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. Israel's leadership launched its counterattacks at a time of growing impatience with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah's persistent launching of missiles and drones across the Israel-Lebanon border after Hamas started the war with its brazen attack on Oct. 7. Biden reiterated his call on the parties to agree to a cease-fire and hostage release deal, saying it's time to 'end this war' — even as hopes for such a deal are fading as the conflict drags on. Biden, in his address, called for the sustainment of Western support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Biden helped galvanize an international coalition to back Ukraine with weapons and economic aid in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 assault on Ukraine. 'We cannot grow weary,' Biden said. 'We cannot look away.' Biden has managed to keep up American support in the face of rising skepticism from some Republican lawmakers — and Trump — about the cost of the conflict. At the same time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pressing Biden to loosen restrictions on the use of Western-supplied long-range missiles so that Ukrainian forces can hit deeper in Russia. So far Zelenskyy has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Putin has warned that Russia would be 'at war' with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. Biden and Harris are scheduled to hold separate meetings with Zelenskyy in Washington on Thursday. Ukrainian officials were also trying to arrange a meeting for Zelenskyy with Trump this week, though a Trump campaign official said it wasn't going to materialize. The president also sounded an alarm about the rapid advances in artificial intelligence development, particularly around disinformation, respect for human life and the potential exploitation by totalitarian powers. He told the world leaders, 'There may well be no greater test of our leadership than how we deal with A.I.' 'We must make certain that the awesome capabilities of A.I. will be used to uplift and empower everyday people, not to give dictators more powerful shackles on the human spirit,' he added. Later, he held a bilateral meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and joined other world leaders in an event highlighting their partnership to combat the production and distribution of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which drive tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S. annually alone. Biden struck a wistful tone in his remarks, peppering his speech with references to his first time attending the General Assembly more than 50 years ago, and quoting Irish poetry. Biden held up his decision to step aside up as an instructive moment as he addressed a gathering that has no small share of totalitarian and nondemocratic leaders. 'Some things are more important than staying in power,' Biden said. 'It’s your people that matter the most. Never forget, we are here to serve the people. Not the other way around.' ___ Miller reported from Washington.

As Israel's fight with Hezbollah heats up, people of Gaza fear be...	MUWASI, Gaza Strip (AP) — As the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah grabs global attention, Palestinians in Gaza wonder: What will become of their plight after nearly a year of devastating war? They are petrified that international concern has been diverted, and that a dark possibility looms: abandonment. The families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza have the same worry. Nezar Zaqout, one of some 1.9 million Palestinians forced to flee their homes since the Israel-Hamas war broke out, said he fears the fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border will overtake interest in the abysmal living conditions in Gaza and efforts to negotiate a cease-fire. 'We have become completely forgotten,' said Zaqout, who is living in Khan Younis after fleeing from Gaza City months ago. 'There is no news about us in the media.' Palestinians fret the miserable conditions in Gaza will become permanent. Ninety percent of the population is homeless, with hundreds of thousands in unsanitary tent camps struggling to find food and clean water. 'A year on, and no one cares about us. Every day there is bombing, every day there are martyrs, and every day there are injuries,' said Saadi Abu Mustafa, who fled Khan Younis to Muwasi, a sprawling tent camp along Gaza's southern coast. Since Hamas launched the war on Oct. 7, Israel's retaliatory invasion of Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 95,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead were women and children. Months of intense air and ground assaults have razed entire housing blocks to the ground; researchers who study satellite imagery estimate nearly 60% of buildings in the Gaza Strip have likely been damaged since the start of the war. Israel vowed to destroy Hamas after Oct. 7, when its militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others. While it has been badly hobbled, the militant group backed by Iran remains in power. Israel’s government says about 70 of the 100 hostages are still presumed alive. Their families dread the government's focus on ending the war is fading. 'My biggest concern is that all the public’s attention and the world’s attention would be gone to the north,' said Udi Goren, a relative of Tal Haimi, an Israeli killed on Oct. 7 and whose body was taken to Gaza. 'Eventually the hostages will just be completely left alone without anyone to bring them out.' As the threat of all-out-war between Israel and Hezbollah has risen, Israel has drawn down its troop presence in Gaza to move key units to its northern border with Lebanon. Still, thousands of soldiers remain in Gaza, carrying out sporadic raids and preventing displaced Palestinians from returning home. Daily strikes have continued in Gaza, too. An Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in northern Gaza Saturday killed at least 22 people and wounded 30 others, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. Recent rains have made already difficult living conditions in the Israeli-designated 'safe zone' of Muwasi unbearable. On Sunday, children living there walked barefoot through mud that reached above their ankles, while men dug through the muck to salvage precious canned goods and furniture. 'The entire kitchen in which we prepare food was filled with water. We did not know what to do. This is the beginning of winter. What will happen in the coming days?' said Rana Goza’t, a mother displaced from Gaza City. Others lamented water-logged mattresses and pleaded for international groups to help keep attention on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. 'We hope that all peoples care about us and see where we have reached,' said Enas Kollab, who relocated to Muwasi from northern Gaza. A flurry of diplomatic activity to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas appears to have subsided, with each side accusing the other of negotiating in bad faith and making untenable demands. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must keep troops in two areas of Gaza to prevent Hamas from rearming. But Hamas has said it will not agree to any deal that allows Israeli troops to remain. Hopes for a deal have further dimmed as the United States, a key mediator in the talks, appears to be losing the ability to influence its closest ally. In a trip to the region last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited only Egypt because U.S. officials believed having him travel to Israel in support of a deal might cause Netanyahu to say something that would undermine mediation efforts. No clear vision has emerged for postwar Gaza — or who will guide and govern that process — but one thing is clear: Rebuilding the territory will take decades. The U.N. estimated this summer that just removing some 40 million tons of rubble would take 15 years.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-as-israels-fight-with-hezbollah-heats-up-people-of-gaza-fear-being-forgotten/	2024-09-24T05:07:53-07:00	
Israel-Hamas war latest: Two-day death toll from Israeli strikes ...	Lebanese health authorities on Tuesday raised the death toll from two days of Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah militants to 558. Palestinian officials in Gaza, meanwhile, said new Israeli strike killed at least seven people in the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel’s military says it will do 'whatever is necessary' to push Hezbollah away from Lebanon’s border with Israel. Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire since the Israel-Hamas war began. On Monday, Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, killing nearly 500 people and wounding more than 1,600 others. Thousands of people fled southern Lebanon, jamming the main highway to Beirut in the biggest exodus since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. It's a staggering toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices the week before. Lebanon blamed the attacks on Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny its responsibility. Hezbollah again launched some 100 projectiles toward Israel on Tuesday, the Israeli military said. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli military reports 10 more rockets fired from Lebanon JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said on Tuesday afternoon that 10 more rockets from Lebanon were fired into Israeli territory, injuring a reservist and raining shrapnel onto a road in northern Israel. The rockets came in two volleys, the first targeting the Upper Galilee area and the second an area south of Haifa known as Eliakim. Rocket fragments from a rocket that was intercepted injured the Israeli soldier, the military said. Hezbollah said it had fired middle-range rockets at an Israeli army position in Eliakim. Israel’s military has now said that there have been at least 110 rockets fired into Israeli territory from Lebanon since Tuesday morning. Israeli strikes on the other side of the border have killed over 550 people since Monday. Another Israeli strike in central Gaza kills at least 3 women and a man, Gaza medics say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip— Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli airstrike hit a family house in central Gaza on Tuesday afternoon, killing at least three women and a man. The strike occurred in the Nuseirat refugee camp and also wounded 21 others, according to the Awda hospital in the camp, where the casualties were taken. Footage circulated online showing a woman screaming and rushing to a building that was hit. A man was seen lying on the ground, without moving and bleeding from his head. There were several other people lying on the ground nearby. Lebanon's health ministry raises two-day death toll from Israeli strikes to 558 BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry said on Tuesday that the death toll from Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon over the past two days of escalation has reached 558, including 50 children and 94 women. Health Minister Firass Abiad told reporters that 1,835 people have also been wounded since early Monday. They were taken to 54 hospitals around Lebanon, he said. Abiad added that four paramedics were among those killed, and 16 paramedics and firefighters were among the wounded. A journalist working for a pan-Arab television is killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon, the station says BEIRUT — A journalist working for the pan-Arab network Al-Mayadeen was killed in Israeli airstrikes while he was at his home in southern Lebanon, the network said Tuesday. Hadi Al-Sayyed, 22, is the third journalist from the network killed in the ongoing conflict between the Israeli military and Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group. The network said he was wounded on Monday and died of his wounds on Tuesday. According to the TV station, Al-Sayyed worked for the Al-Mayadeen’s online section and was at his house in the town of Burj Rahhal near the southern city of Tyre when it was hit in the airstrike. Last November, Al-Mayadeen's correspondent Farah Omar and cameraman Rabih Al-Maamari were killed in an Israeli strike while covering southern Lebanon. Reuters video journalist Issam Abdallah was killed in Israeli shelling last October while covering the clashes alongside colleagues from the news agency as well as reporters from Qatar’s Al-Jazeera TV and France’s international news agency, Agence France-Presse. His colleagues were all wounded but survived the attack. Bombardment from Lebanon hits supermarket in Arab town in northern Israel JERUSALEM — Bombardment from Lebanon on Tuesday damaged a supermarket in Israel’s Arab city of Tamra, where the majority of residents are Palestinian citizens of Israel. The attack spread fear through the community, which has no shelters. It was not immediately clear whether the supermarket was hit by a rocket that permeated Israel’s missile defense system or by shrapnel falling from an interception. 'I came here immediately to see what exactly happened,' said Jamal Diab, a friend of the market’s owner. 'I saw here lots of damage.' Tamra has no shelters, according to its mayor, Mousa Abu Rumi. An Israeli state comptroller’s report found in 2018 that only 11 out of 71 Arab local communities have public shelters. He told The Associated press that Tamra's residents have been instructed to find 'the most protected place' nearby to seek shelter when they hear rocket sirens go off. A hospital in central Gaza says it received bodies of two Palestinian children killed in Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — A hospital in central Gaza said the bodies of two children killed in an Israeli airstrike on Tuesday were brought there. The Awda hospital in the Nuseirat refugee camp said the strike hit a group of people in the nearby Bureij camp, and also wounded six other Palestinians. The Health Ministry in the coastal territory, meanwhile, said Gaza’s hospitals received 12 dead and 43 wounded Palestinians over the last 24 hours. The latest fatalities brought the overall death toll in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7 to 41,467, and 95,921 wounded, said the ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between combatants and civilians in its count. Israel's military says 100 rockets fired from Lebanon since early morning in second day of intense escalation JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said that 100 rockets had been fired from Lebanon into northern Israel since the early hours of Tuesday morning, setting several fires and damaging buildings in the country’s north in the second day of much-intensified hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. The rockets came in five volleys throughout the morning, the largest of them containing 50 rockets toward the Upper Galilee area. The military said it had struck the launchers where the rockets were fired. Another heavily-targeted area was southeast of the Israeli city of Haifa. Rocket sirens blared throughout the morning in the country’s north. A video circulating on Israeli media showed explosions on a highway, with drivers pulling over and lying on the ground next to their vehicles. Galilee Medical Center, a northern Israel hospital, said that two patients arrived to the hospital with minor head injuries from a rocket falling near their car. Several others were being treated for light wounds from running to shelters and traffic accidents when alarms sounded. Hezbollah has been sending heavy volleys of rockets into Israel as Israel intensifies its operation in Lebanon. In Monday, Israeli strikes killed nearly 500 people, Lebanese health officials say, and Israel’s military ordered the south of the country evacuated. Southern Lebanese families find shelters farther north as they flee violence near the border BEIRUT — Lebanese families displaced from villages farther south slept in shelters hastily set up in schools in Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon. Some who did not find shelter elsewhere slept in cars and parks and on the seaside corniche. Monday’s heavy bombardment sent thousands fleeing from south Lebanon. Hotels in Beirut were quickly booked to capacity and apartments in the mountains surrounding the capital were snapped up by families seeking safe accommodations. Some offered up empty apartments or rooms in their houses in social media posts, while volunteers set up a kitchen at an empty gas station in Beirut to cook meals for the displaced. In the eastern city of Baalbek, the state-run National News Agency reported that lines formed at bakeries and gas stations as residents rushed to stock up on essential supplies in anticipation of another round of strikes on Tuesday. Satellite data shows a wide range of Israeli airstrikes targeted southern Lebanon DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Data from fire-tracking satellites used by the United States showed the wide range of Israeli airstrikes that target southern Lebanon, an Associated Press analysis Tuesday showed. NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System typically is used by experts to track wildfires across rural areas of the U.S. However, they also can be used to track the flashes and burning that follow airstrikes. That’s particularly true when an airstrike ignites flammable material on the ground, like munitions or fuel. On Monday, Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, killing nearly 500 people and wounding more than 1,600 others. Thousands of people fled southern Lebanon, jamming the main highway to Beirut in the biggest exodus since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Data from Monday show significant fires breaking out across southern Lebanon, stretching from the border with Israel as far north as Mashghara in the Bekaa Valley, some 20 kilometers (more than 10 miles) from the border. The area of the strikes is over 1,700 square kilometers (650 square miles). There were several areas that showed multiple, intense fires. One was near the southern coastal town of Naqoura, which hosts a base for the United Nations peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon known as UNIFIL. Others were in rural areas or villages. Since its creation at the start of Israel’s occupation of Lebanon from 1982 to 2000, the Shiite militia Hezbollah is believed to have stockpiled weapons and missiles throughout southern Lebanon as a deterrent to Israel. United States Embassy in Jerusalem restricts employees from traveling to Israel's north JERUSALEM — The United States Embassy in Jerusalem has restricted American government employees from traveling to Israel’s north after a heavy exchange of fire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group. The embassy said Tuesday that employees require an armored vehicle and prior approval to travel to a large region of the north that includes the bustling coastal city of Haifa. The U.S. State Department meanwhile urged American citizens to leave the country, where Israeli strikes killed nearly 500 people on Monday. Israeli strikes kill at least 7 in Khan Younis DEIR-Al-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian officials say Israel’s strikes early Tuesday killed at least seven people in Gaza’s southern city of Khan Younis. At least 15 others, including women and children, were injured in the strikes, they said. The civil defense said the dead include five people who were killed in a strike on the Abu Harb family house in the Qizan al-Najjar area. The strike also wounded at least 10 others, it said. Another strike hit a house in the Tahlia area in Khan Younis, killing at least two people and wounding five others, according to the rescue service. The casualties from both strikes were confirmed in hospital records in Khan Younis. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians but rarely comments on individual strikes. Gaza’s Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war. It does not say how many were fighters, but says a little over half were women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 of the captives are still being held in Gaza, and a third of them are believed to be dead. Airlines in the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cancel flights to Lebanon Airlines in the United Arab Emirates, a key East-West travel hub, canceled flight Tuesday to Lebanon over the ongoing cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah. Long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad canceled flights, as did FlyDubai, the low-cost carrier. The United Arab Emirates, which reached a diplomatic recognition deal with Israel in 2020, is home to a large Lebanese population. Egypt’s flagship airliner also canceled its flights to Lebanon on Tuesday. EgyptAir operates two flights daily between Cairo and Beirut. It said the cancellation will stay in place until 'the signal stabilizes.' Also Tuesday, Israeli media reported that Wizz Air, British Airways, Iberia and Azerbaijan Airlines were among several airlines to cancel flights to Israel’s major airport, Ben-Gurion airport in Tel Aviv.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-hamas-war-latest-israeli-strikes-on-gaza-kill-at-least-7-as-people-flee-south-lebanon/	2024-09-24T05:06:45-07:00	
US is sending more troops to the Middle East as violence rises be...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is sending a small number of additional troops to the Middle East in response to a sharp spike in violence between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon that has raised the risk of a greater regional war, the Pentagon said Monday. Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not say how many more forces would be deployed or what they would be tasked to do. The U.S. now has about 40,000 troops in the region. On Monday, the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, two Navy destroyers and a cruiser set sail from Norfolk, Virginia, headed to the Sixth Fleet area in Europe on a regularly scheduled deployment. The ships' departure opens up the possibility that the U.S. could keep both the Truman and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which is in the Arabian Gulf, in the region in case more violence breaks out. 'In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional U.S. military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,' Ryder said. 'But for operational security reasons, I’m not going to comment on or provide specifics.' The new deployments come after significant strikes by Israeli forces against targets inside Lebanon that have killed hundreds and as Israel is preparing to conduct further operations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday warned Lebanese civilians in a videotaped message to evacuate their homes ahead of a widening air campaign. He spoke as Israeli warplanes struck alleged Hezbollah targets in southern and eastern Lebanon. The U.S. has 'concrete ideas' for restoring calm along the Israel-Lebanon border that it will present to allies and partners this week on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders, a senior State Department official said Monday. The official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss the private diplomatic efforts, said the U.S. and numerous other countries were eager to present an 'off-ramp' for both Israel and Hezbollah to reduce tensions and prevent an all-out war. The official would not detail what the 'concrete ideas' are because he said they had yet to be presented to allies and partners for what he termed a 'stress test' for their likelihood of success. The State Department is warning Americans to leave Lebanon as the risk of a regional war increases. 'Due to the unpredictable nature of ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and recent explosions throughout Lebanon, including Beirut, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,' the State Department cautioned Saturday. Ryder would not say if the additional forces might support the evacuation of American citizens if needed. U.S. officials said a decision is expected soon, possibly this week, on whether the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier will stay in the Middle East or continue to the Asia-Pacific. Having two carrier strike groups in the Middle East at the same time has been relatively rare in recent years. But as violence has spiked between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah, both Iranian-backed militant groups, the Biden administration has ordered the Navy to have the carriers and their warships overlap for several weeks on a couple occasions. It will take the Truman aircraft carrier about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean and get into the Mediterranean Sea. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements. There is already a Marine amphibious ready group in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard, which is expected to be able to assist in an evacuation if needed. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin held back-to-back calls with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over the weekend as he pressed for a cease-fire and a reduction of tensions in the region, Ryder said. 'Given the tensions, given the escalation, as I highlighted, there is the potential for a wider regional conflict. I don’t think we’re there yet, but it’s a dangerous situation,' Ryder said. The American presence in the Middle East is designed both to help defend Israel and protect U.S. and allied personnel and assets. Navy warships are scattered across the region, from the eastern Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Oman, and both Air Force and Navy fighter jets are strategically based at several locations to be better prepared to respond to any attacks. ___ AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee contributed from New York.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-us-is-sending-more-troops-to-the-middle-east-as-violence-rises-between-israel-and-hezbollah/	2024-09-23T15:44:34-07:00	
Israel-Hamas war latest: Israel launches intense airstrikes in Le...	Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon on Monday, killing more than 356 people, including 24 children and 42 women, as the Israeli military called on residents to immediately evacuate places where it claimed the Hezbollah militant group stores weapons. Thousands of people fled southern Lebanon, jamming the main highway to Beirut in the biggest exodus since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. More than 1,240 people were wounded in the strikes, the Health Ministry said, a staggering one-day toll for the country. The Israeli military said it hit more than 800 targets Monday linked to Hezbollah weapons sites. It said it was expanding the operation to include areas of the Bekaa Valley, along Lebanon’s eastern border. Residents of different villages in southern Lebanon posted photos on social media that they said showed their towns that were being struck. The wave of airstrikes came after a day after Hezbollah fired over 100 rockets into northern Israel, with some landing near the city of Haifa. Hezbollah’s rockets were in response to an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday that killed a top Hezbollah military commander and more than a dozen members, along with civilians including women and children. Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000. Lebanon blamed the attacks on Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny its responsibility. ___ Here’s the latest: Hezbollah denies reports that its senior commander was killed in an Israeli drone strike in Beirut Hezbollah in a statement Monday denied reports that its senior commander Ali Karaki was killed in an apparent Israeli drone strike in a southern Beirut suburb. 'Ali Karaki is fine and God willing is in full health and wellnesses. He has been transported to a safe area,' the statement from the Iran-backed group said. Death toll from Israeli strikes in Lebanon increases to 356, including 24 children, Lebanon's health ministry says MARJAYOUN, Lebanon — Lebanon’s health ministry says the death toll from Israeli strikes in Lebanon on Monday has increased to 356, including 24 children and 42 women. The barrage is the deadliest since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war as the Israeli military warned residents in southern and eastern Lebanon to evacuate ahead of a widening air campaign against Hezbollah. Thousands of Lebanese fled the south, and the main highway out of the southern port city of Sidon was jammed with cars heading toward Beirut in the biggest exodus since 2006. More than 1,240 people were wounded in the strikes, the health ministry said — a staggering one-day toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week. The death toll surpassed that of Beirut’s devastating port explosion in 2020, when hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse detonated, killing at least 218 people and wounding more than 6,000. Israeli warplanes struck 1,300 Hezbollah targets TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel’s military spokesman says Israeli warplanes struck 1,300 Hezbollah targets on Monday. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari says the strikes destroyed Hezbollah cruise missiles, rockets laden with heavy explosives, long and short-range rockets and attack drones. He said many were hidden in residential areas, showing photos of what he said were weapons hidden in private homes. 'Hezbollah has turned southern Lebanon into a war zone,' he told a news conference. Egypt condemns Israel's attack on Lebanon, warning it will aggravate the crisis CAIRO — Egypt on Monday condemned Israel’s attacks on Lebanon, warning that its military escalation will only aggravate the crisis. In a statement, the Egyptian foreign ministry urged international powers and the U.N. Security Council to intervene to stop Israel’s escalation in the region. President Biden to discuss efforts to end war in Gaza during meeting with the president of United Arab Emirates WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden says he planned to discuss 'efforts to end the war in Gaza' during a Monday Oval Office meeting with United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Biden told his UAE counterpart that he’s been briefed on the latest developments regarding Israel and Lebanon and that his team is 'working to de-escalate' in a way that allows people to return to their homes safely. Israel's offensive in Lebanon destroyed tens of thousands of Hezbollah's rockets TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s defense minister says the Israeli offensive in Lebanon has destroyed tens of thousands of rockets in Hezbollah’s formidable arsenal. Yoav Gallant said during an assessment with military commanders Monday that the results of the Israeli air campaign are 'extremely impressive.' 'Today is a significant peak,' Gallant said. 'On this day we have taken out of order tens of thousands of rockets and precise munition. What Hezbollah has built over a period of 20 years … is in fact being destroyed.' Israel estimates that Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including guided missiles and long-range projectiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel. Israel urges the UN Security Council to implement a resolution for Hezbollah to move its forces far from the Israeli border JERUSALEM — Israel’s foreign minister has urged the U.N. Security Council to implement a 2006 resolution calling on Hezbollah to move its forces far from the Israeli border. Resolution 1701 ended a monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah. The resolution required Hezbollah to move some 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the border, but it has refused, accusing Israel of failing to carry out provisions. In a letter to the council, Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the council 'must act to bring about a full implementation' of the resolution. He warned that Israel would not tolerate the 'ongoing war of attrition' with Hezbollah. 'Israel is not interested in a full-scale war,' he wrote. 'However, we will take all necessary measures to protect ourselves and our citizens in accordance with international law as part of the ongoing armed conflict against Hezbollah.' He also called for international sanctions against Iran, saying the Tehran government is the 'mastermind' behind Hezbollah’s attacks. Israel prepares for ‘next phases’ of operations against Hezbollah JERUSALEM — Israel’s military chief says Israel is preparing its 'next phases' of operations against Hezbollah. Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi told soldiers Monday that Israel’s airstrikes were 'proactive' and targeting Hezbollah infrastructure built over the past 20 years. 'We are striking targets and preparing for the next phases,' he said, promising to release details in the near future. He says the goal of the offensive is to allow tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to return to their homes in northern Israel. Israeli military carries out targeted strike in Beirut BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency is reporting an Israeli strike on a southern Beirut suburb with three missiles. Al-Manar TV of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said six people were wounded in the strike on the Beir al-Abed neighborhood adding that they were rushed to hospital. A Hezbollah official confirmed the airstrike without giving further details. The area was cordoned and journalists were not allowed to get close to the building that was hit. Netanyahu urges Lebanese to evacuate their homes JERUSALEM — Israel’s prime minister urged Lebanese civilians to heed Israeli calls to evacuate their homes, saying 'take this warning seriously.' Benjamin Netanyahu issued the warning Monday in a videotaped message his office said was aimed at Lebanese civilians. He spoke as Israeli warplanes continued to strike alleged Hezbollah targets in southern and eastern Lebanon. Earlier Monday, Israel ordered residents in the targeted areas to leave ahead of the airstrikes. Israeli officials say Hezbollah uses civilian areas to hide weapons. 'Please get out of harm’s way now,' Netanyahu said. 'Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes.' Death toll climbs in Israeli airstrikes to 274 with 1,000 injured BEIRUT — Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad says 274 people have been killed in ongoing Israeli strikes Monday, and more than 1,000 injured. At a press conference in Beirut, Abiad said thousands of families have been displaced by the attacks. He also said Israeli strikes have hit hospitals, medical centers and ambulances. The Israeli military announced that it hit some 800 targets Monday, claiming it was going after Hezbollah weapons. Hezbollah launches over 100 missiles toward Israel JERUSALEM — Hezbollah launched more than 100 projectiles toward Israel on Monday, the military said, reaching deep into Israel including around the northern city of Haifa and parts of the occupied West Bank. Most of the missiles were intercepted but two people were lightly injured from falling shrapnel in northern Israel. A number of homes suffered direct hits. School was canceled in northern Israel on Sunday and Monday and Israelis were instructed to stay close to protected areas. The Israeli military said they had struck more than 800 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon and were enlarging the operation to include eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley as well. According to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, more than 180 people were killed and 700 injured, the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon expresses ‘grave concern’ for civilians BEIRUT — The U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon expressed 'grave concern' for the safety of civilians in the south following the most intense Israeli bombing campaign since hostilities erupted in October. 'Any further escalation of this dangerous situation could have far-reaching and devastating consequences, not only for those living on both sides of the Blue Line (the border between Lebanon and Israel) but also for the broader region,' it said in a statement. It added that 'attacks on civilians are not only violations of international law but may amount to war crimes.' Lebanese health officials said more than 180 people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes Monday. It was not immediately clear how many of them were civilians. The U.N. force, known as UNIFIL, said its commander Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro had contacted Lebanese and Israeli officials to urge de-escalation. Lebanese Health Ministry says 182 killed and 727 wounded in Israeli airstrikes BEIRUT — The death toll in Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon has risen to 182 with 727 others wounded, the Lebanese Health Ministry said. The Lebanese Red Cross told The Associated Press that all ambulance stations across the country have been mobilized, supporting paramedics in southern Lebanon. Hospitals in the south are struggling with capacity and other units from the Red Cross are helping relocate wounded people to hospitals farther north, officials said. Gaza hospitals report 24 dead and 60 wounded in last 24 hours GAZA CITY — Israeli strikes in Gaza left 24 dead and 60 wounded in the last 24 hours, the Health Ministry in the Palestinian territory said Monday. The fresh fatalities brought the overall death toll in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7 to 41,455, and 95,878 wounded, said the ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between combatants and civilians. Israel launched its campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after the militants launched an attack on southern Israel in which they killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others. Israel widens aerial offensive in Lebanon JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it is widening an aerial offensive against what it says are Hezbollah weapons sites in southern and eastern Lebanon. The military said Monday that it was expanding its airstrikes to include areas of the Bekaa Valley, along Lebanon’s eastern border, after targeting more than 300 sites in southern Lebanon. Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said residents of the Bekaa Valley must immediately evacuate areas where Hezbollah is storing weapons. Thousands flee southern Lebanon BEIRUT — Thousands of people are leaving south Lebanon and heading north after Israel intensified airstrikes on Monday, leaving 100 people dead and hundreds wounded. In the southern port city of Sidon, the main north-south highway was packed with cars heading north in the direction of the capital Beirut. Following a Cabinet meeting in Beirut Monday, Minister of Environment Nasser Yassin told reporters that some schools are being prepared in Mount Lebanon to receive those fleeing. It was the biggest wave of displacement since the summer 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, when hundreds of thousands fled their homes in the south. Death toll in Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon rises to 100 BEIRUT — Lebanese authorities say 100 people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes in what would be the deadliest day in Lebanon in nearly a year of fighting against the Hezbollah militant group. The Lebanese Health Ministry said more than 400 others were wounded in the strikes in southern Lebanon on Monday. It said among them were women, children, and paramedics. At least 50 killed and over 300 wounded in Israeli airstrikes, Lebanon says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry says a wave of Israeli airstrikes on Monday has killed at least 50 and wounded more than 300 people. The ministry said that the toll was preliminary as airstrikes intensified around noon and women and children were among the dead. The airstrikes hit wide areas in southern and northeastern Lebanon. Israel’s military said it struck 300 targets across Lebanon linked to the militant group Hezbollah. Lebanon's prime minister calls on UN to ‘deter the aggression’ BEIRUT — Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister on Monday called Israel’s wave of airstrikes 'a genocide in every sense of the word.' Najib Mikati made the comments at the start of a Cabinet meeting in Beirut in which he said that Israel’s airstrikes aim to destroy Lebanon’s towns and villages. Mikati said that the Lebanese government is calling on the United Nations, the U.N. Security Council and world nations to 'deter the aggression.' Israeli strikes kill 1 and wound others in Lebanon, report says BEIRUT — Lebanon's state-run National News Agency says Israeli airstrikes on different parts of Lebanon on Monday killed at least one person and wounded others. The airstrikes hit the heights of the central province of Byblos for the first time since exchanges along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October, NNA said. A security official confirmed the airstrike in the village of Almat. Also targeted by the early morning airstrikes were the northeastern Baalbek and Hermel regions where a shepherd was killed and two members of his family were wounded in the fields of the village of Bodai, NNA said. It added that four other people were also wounded in Bodai and were all taken to hospitals in the area. NNA also said that 11 people were wounded in the southern village of Aitaroun, including 1 in serious condition. China urges its citizens in Lebanon and Israel to leave as soon as possible or move to safe areas BEIJING — China is urging its citizens in Lebanon and Israel to evacuate or move to safe areas as the conflict between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah is escalating. Chinese citizens in Lebanon should take commercial flights to return to China or otherwise leave Lebanon as soon as possible for their own safety, the Consular Department of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement posted on social media platform WeChat on Monday. 'Those who need to continue to stay in Lebanon should remain highly vigilant, effectively strengthen their security precautions and emergency preparedness and avoid going to high-risk areas and sensitive areas in the south,' the statement read. On Sunday, the Chinese Embassy in Israel cautioned its citizens in the country to be prepared for any potential attacks including by missiles, rockets and drones. It added that Chinese people were advised against traveling to Israel and entering high-risk areas in the country’s north. Israel calls on Lebanese to leave homes where Hezbollah stores arms JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has called on people in southern Lebanon to immediately evacuate homes and other buildings where Hezbollah stores weapons and says it is carrying out 'extensive strikes' against the militant group. Monday's announcement was the first warning of its kind in nearly a year of low-level conflict along the border. Lebanese media reported that residents received text messages urging them to move away from any building where Hezbollah stores arms until further notice. 'If you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice,' the Arabic message reads, according to Lebanese media. It was not immediately clear how many people would be affected by the Israeli orders. Communities on both sides of the border have largely emptied out because of the near-daily exchanges of fire. Israel has accused Hezbollah of transforming entire communities in the south into militant bases, with hidden rocket launchers and other infrastructure. That could lead it to wage an especially heavy bombing campaign, even if no ground forces move in. Israel carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern Lebanon early Monday. Israeli airstrikes on Gaza Strip kill 8 Palestinians, including 5 children DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip have killed eight Palestinians, including five children. A girl and her parents were killed in a strike on a school sheltering displaced people in central Gaza early Monday. The girl’s two siblings were wounded. Israel has struck several such schools-turned-shelters, saying militants hide out in them. Another strike hit a home near the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, killing a mother and her four children, aged 4 to 8. The casualties from both strikes were described in hospital records, and an Associated Press reporter saw the bodies. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians but rarely comments on individual strikes. Gaza’s Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war. It does not say how many were fighters. It says a little over half were women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 of the captives are still being held in Gaza, and a third of them are believed to be dead. Australia announces more aid for Gaza CANBERRA, Australia — Australia has announced it will provide an additional 10 million Australian dollars ($6.8 million) in aid to Gaza, bringing the total since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 last year to AU$82.5 million ($56.2 million). A government statement said on Monday the new money would focus on women and children. It would be provided through the United Nations Population Fund, a sexual and reproductive health agency, and the U.N. agency responsible for aiding children, UNICEF. 'Australia continues to push for safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian assistance to people in desperate need, and for all aid workers to be protected,' the statement said. A new crisis for displaced Palestinians: flooding MUWASI, Gaza Strip — As the first rain of the cool season starts to fall in the Gaza Strip, displaced Palestinians living in the sprawling Muwasi tent camp are struggling to cope with flooding that is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. Some children are entertained by the novelty of walking barefoot in the ankle-deep water, but their parents are less amused. The adults try to save what they can from their family's tents. One mother tries to dry her temporary home with a mop. 'We woke up in the morning to find the tents with rainwater pouring on us, and water from the streets entering on us,' said Rana Goza’t, a displaced person from Gaza City. 'This is the beginning of winter. What will happen in the coming days?' Suhail Al-Barawi, a displaced person from Beit Lahiya, was helping to build sand barriers to prevent more flooding in the camp. 'People wish for rain,' he said, 'and we say, ‘Oh God, do not give us rain.’' The nearly yearlong war between Israel and Hamas has displaced 90% of Palestinians in Gaza, according to the United Nations. Israel defense minister praises air strikes in Beirut Israel’s defense minister says recent attacks on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon are a step toward facilitating the return of displaced Israelis to their homes in the north of the country. Speaking Sunday evening after visiting the military’s Northern Command headquarters, Yoav Gallant described the recent air strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut as 'significant, important and powerful.' He says Israel will take all necessary measures to ensure 'the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes.' Israeli attacks since Friday have killed dozens in Lebanon, including a veteran Hezbollah commander. Hezbollah responded with more than 100 missile attacks in northern Israel early Sunday, sending hundreds of thousands of Israelis into air raid shelters. Gallant says: 'The past week has been the most difficult in the history of Hezbollah’s existence —especially over the past day.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-hamas-war-latest-israels-air-force-launches-dozens-of-airstrikes-on-southern-lebanon/	2024-09-23T11:50:40-07:00	
Lebanon sees deadliest day in nearly a year of fighting as offici...	MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli strikes killed more than 180 Lebanese Monday in the deadliest and most intense barrage in nearly a year as the Israeli military warned residents in southern and eastern Lebanon to evacuate their homes ahead of a widening air campaign against Hezbollah. Thousands of Lebanese fled the south, and the main highway out of the southern port city of Sidon was jammed with cars heading toward Beirut in the biggest exodus since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. More than 400 other people were injured in the strikes. The Israeli military announced that it hit some 300 targets Monday, saying it was going after Hezbollah weapons sites. Some strikes hit in residential areas of towns in the south and the eastern Bekaa Valley. One strike hit a wooded area as far away as Byblos in central Lebanon, more than 80 miles from the border north of Beirut. The military said it was expanding the airstrikes to include areas of the Bekaa Valley, along Lebanon’s eastern border. Hezbollah has long had an established presence in the Bekaa Valley, which runs along the Lebanese-Syrian border, and it is where the group was founded in 1982 with the help of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said residents of the valley must immediately evacuate areas where Hezbollah is storing weapons. Meanwhile, Hezbollah said in a statement that it fired dozens of rockets at an Israeli military post in Galilee. It also targeted for a second day the facilities of the Rafael defense firm, headquartered in Haifa. As Israel carried out the attacks, Israeli authorities reported a series of air-raid sirens in northern Israel warning of incoming rocket fire from Lebanon. Earlier Monday, Israel issued a broad warning urging residents of southern Lebanon to evacuate from homes and other buildings where it claimed Hezbollah has stored weapons. It was the first warning of its kind in nearly a year of steadily escalating conflict and came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire on Sunday. Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters. There was no sign of an immediate exodus from the villages of southern Lebanon, and the warning left open the possibility that some residents could live in or near targeted structures without knowing that they are risk. The increasing strikes and counterstrikes have raised fears of an all-out war, even as Israel is still battling Hamas in Gaza and trying to return scores of hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Hezbollah has vowed to continue its strikes in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel says it is committed to returning calm to its northern border. Associated Press journalists in southern Lebanon reported heavy airstrikes targeting many areas Monday morning, including some far from the border. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said the strikes hit a forested area in the central province of Byblos, about 130 kilometers (81 miles) north of the Israeli-Lebanese border, for the first time since the exchanges began in October. No injuries were reported there. Israel also bombed targets in the northeastern Baalbek and Hermel regions, where a shepherd was killed and two family members were wounded, according to the news agency. It said a total of 30 people were wounded in strikes. The Lebanese Health Ministry put the death toll at 182. It asked hospitals in southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa valley to postpone surgeries that could be done later. The ministry said in a statement that its request aimed to keep hospitals ready to deal with people wounded by 'Israel’s expanding aggression on Lebanon.' An Israeli military official said Israel is focused on aerial operations and has no immediate plans for a ground operation. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with regulations, said the strikes are aimed at curbing Hezbollah's ability to launch more strikes into Israel. Lebanese media reported that residents received text messages urging them to move away from any building where Hezbollah stores arms until further notice. 'If you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice,' the Arabic message reads, according to Lebanese media. Lebanon's information minister, Ziad Makary, said in a statement that his office in Beirut had received a recorded message telling people to leave the building. 'This comes in the framework of the psychological war implemented by the enemy,' Makary said, and urged people 'not to give the matter more attention than it deserves.' It was not immediately clear how many people would be affected by the Israeli orders. Communities on both sides of the border have largely emptied out because of the near-daily exchanges of fire. Israel has accused Hezbollah of transforming entire communities in the south into militant bases, with hidden rocket launchers and other infrastructure. That could lead the Israeli military to wage an especially heavy bombing campaign, even if no ground forces move in. The military said it had targeted more than 150 militant sites early Monday. Residents of different villages in southern Lebanon posted photos on social media of airstrikes and large plumes of smoke. The state-run National News Agency also reported airstrikes on different areas. An Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday killed a top Hezbollah military commander and more than a dozen fighters, as well as dozens of civilians, including women and children. Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000. Lebanon blamed Israel for the attacks, but Israel did not confirm or deny any responsibility. Hezbollah began firing into Israel a day after the Oct. 7 attack in what it said was an attempt to pin down Israeli forces to help Palestinian fighters in Gaza. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict has steadily intensified over the past year. The fighting has killed hundreds of people in Lebanon, dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. It has also sparked brush fires that have destroyed agriculture and scarred the landscape. Israel has vowed to push Hezbollah back from the border so its citizens can return to their homes, saying it prefers to do so diplomatically but is willing to use force. Hezbollah has said it will keep up its attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but that appears increasingly elusive as the war nears its anniversary. Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after most of the rest were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. Israel's offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. It says women and children make up a little over half of those killed. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Lidman and Mroue reported from Beirut.

Ukraine accuses Russia of seeking to illegally control strategic ...	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Ukraine on Monday accused Russia of seeking to illegally seize control of the strategically important Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait, as hearings opened in a high-stakes arbitration case between Kyiv and Moscow. The hearings at the Permanent Court of Arbitration are the latest in a string of international legal cases involving Russia and Ukraine linked to Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even as fighting continues to rage on battlefields in Ukraine. 'Russia wants to take the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait for itself, and so it has built a great gate at the entrance to keep international shipping out while allowing small Russian river vessels in,' Ukrainian representative Anton Korynevych told a panel of arbitrators. The gate he referred to is a bridge built by Russia across the Kerch Strait after the annexation of Crimea. The $3.5-billion, 19-kilometer (12-mile) bridge linking the Black and Azov seas carries road and rail traffic on separate sections and is vital to sustaining Russia’s military operations in southern Ukraine. 'The bridge is unlawful and it must come down,' Korynevych told the arbitration panel. Ukraine filed the case in 2016, two years after Russia annexed Crimea. It accuses Moscow of subsequently breaching a United Nations maritime treaty by building the bridge, barring Ukrainian fishermen from waters they traditionally fished, damaging the environment and plundering underwater archeological sites. Kyiv is seeking unspecified compensation. Russia insists the arbitration court does not have jurisdiction. It says that if its five judges decide they do have jurisdiction, the court should dismiss Ukraine's claims. 'Ukraine’s accusations in this case are, of course, completely groundless and hopeless,' Russian Agent Gennady Kuzmin told the panel. He argued that the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait constitute 'internal waters' that are not covered by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the treaty Ukraine alleges Russia is breaching. After Monday's two opening statements, the panel hearings will continue for days behind closed doors. A final ruling could take years. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine:	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraine-accuses-russia-of-seeking-to-illegally-control-strategic-sea-as-arbitration-hearings-open/	2024-09-23T02:51:13-07:00	
21 wounded in Russian strikes that hit apartment buildings in Ukr...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched new strikes in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv that hit high-rise apartment buildings, leaving at least 21 wounded in a second consecutive nighttime attack, authorities said. The bombs fell Saturday night on the district of Shevchenkivsky, north of the center of Kharkiv, which is the second-largest Ukrainian city, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Residential buildings sustained varying degrees of damage, including 16- and nine-story buildings, he added. Kharkiv's city council said that 18 buildings were damaged. The wounded included an 8-year-old child, according to Syniehubov and Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Terekhov said that 60 residents were evacuated from one of the buildings, a high-rise that was hit directly. Kharkiv has been a frequent target of Russian attacks since Moscow launched its all-out invasion of neighboring Ukraine in February 2022. On late Friday, 15 people, including children ages 10 and 12, were wounded when Russian airstrikes hit three Kharkiv neighborhoods, Terekhov said. Zelenskyy appeals for more weapons Ukrainian officials said that KAB-type aerial glide bombs — a retrofitted Soviet weapon that has for months laid waste to eastern Ukraine — were used in both attacks. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike and urged Kyiv’s Western allies to send more weapons to help it 'protect lives and ensure safety.' 'Ukraine needs full long-range capabilities, and we are working to convince our partners of this,' Zelenskyy said on X, as he prepared to kick off a busy week in the United States shoring up support for Kyiv in the war. And Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said Sunday that Kyiv was in talks with partners in Europe to secure Swedish-made Gripen and European Eurofighter Typhoon jets. Umerov said that commitments were already in place for deliveries of U.S.-made F-16s and French Mirages. Russia sends drones and missiles elsewhere in Ukraine Russia also launched 80 Shahed drones and two missiles at Ukraine overnight into Sunday, the Ukrainian air force said. Ukrainian defenses shot down 71 drones, and another six were lost on location because of electronic warfare countermeasures, the statement said. Farther south, a 12-year-old girl and a woman died after a Russian drone struck a passenger car in the city of Nikopol, local Gov. Serhii Lysak reported. Two others, including a 4-year-old child, suffered wounds. In the eastern Donetsk region, a Russian airstrike on Sunday morning struck homes in the city of Sloviansk, trapping a woman under rubble and wounding two of her neighbors, regional prosecutors reported. In the same province, two miners died and one other person was injured late Saturday after Russian forces shelled a mine west of the city of Pokrovsk, local Gov. Vadym Filashkin and Ukraine’s Energy Ministry reported. Pokrovsk and Sloviansk have both been key targets for Russian forces as they continue their grinding push westwards aimed at capturing the entirety of Ukraine’s industrial east. In southern Ukraine, a Russian drone strike on Sunday morning wounded two civilians in the city of Kherson, regional authorities said. Hours later, police reported that Russian attacks wounded at least four more people elsewhere in the province. Other Russian drone attacks Sunday damaged energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s central Poltava region and the northern city of Shostka, officials reported. Shostka lies in the Sumy region, across the border from Russia's Kursk province — the target of a startling Ukrainian military incursion launched last month. Weeks into the incursion, Zelenskyy said that the aim is to create a buffer zone to prevent further Russian cross-border strikes that have for months wreaked havoc in Sumy. Around 10,000 residents have left the nearby town of Hlukhiv because of intensified Russian shelling, around a third of its prewar population, the local military administration said Sunday. That includes almost 70% of the town’s children, following the regional government’s calls to evacuate parts of the Sumy region nearest the Russian border. Hlukhiv lies less than 15 kilometers (9 miles) from Russian territory, and about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Shostka. Ukrainian troops strike at Russian targets Also on Sunday, a firefighter was killed and two others were injured by a Ukrainian drone in the Russia-occupied Luhansk province in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Emergencies Ministry said. In Russia proper, in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, Ukrainian shelling wounded at least 12 people including a village official and members of a volunteer self-defense force, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov. Several Russian regions, including Belgorod in the south, set up so-called territorial defense units to counter-sabotage activity after Russian troops moved into Ukraine in February 2022. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-over-20-people-wounded-after-russia-strikes-apartment-blocks-in-ukraines-kharkiv/	2024-09-22T18:03:22-07:00	
Israel-Hamas war latest: Israel strikes Beirut after Hezbollah ro...	An Israeli airstrike in Beirut killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens more, Lebanese health officials said. It was the first such Israeli attack on Lebanon’s capital in months and came shortly after Hezbollah pounded northern Israel with 140 rockets. In Gaza, Palestinian authorities said 15 people were killed overnight in Israeli attacks. Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that sparked the Israel-Hamas war. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Here's the latest: Weaponizing ordinary devices violates international law, United Nations rights chief says UNITED NATIONS — Weaponizing ordinary communication devices represents a new development in warfare, and targeting thousands of Lebanese people using pagers, two-way radios and electronic equipment without their knowledge is a violation of international human rights law, the United Nations human rights chief said Friday. Volker Türk told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council there must be an independent and transparent investigation of the two attacks in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday where these devices exploded, reportedly killing 37 people and injuring more than 3,400 others. 'Those who ordered and carried out these attacks must be held to account,' he said. Lebanon has blamed Israel for the attacks, which appeared to target Hezbollah militants but also saw many civilian casualties, including children. Hezbollah has fought many conflicts with Israel, including a war in 2006, and it has conducted near-daily strikes against Israel to support Hamas militants who attacked Israel on Oct. 7. When reporters asked Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon about speculation Israel was behind the two explosions, he said: 'We are not commenting.' Lebanon’s foreign minister urges United Nations Security Council to condemn deadly explosions UNITED NATIONS — Lebanon’s foreign minister is warning the U.N. Security Council that if it doesn’t condemn this week’s deadly explosions and name Israel as the perpetrator a 'Pandora’s Box' will be opened, and governments and extremists will target and kill civilians with similar communications devices. Abdallah Bouhabib accused Israel on Friday of terrorizing the entire Lebanese population on streets, in markets and their homes where exploding pagers, two-way radios and other electronic devices reportedly killed 37 people and injured more than 3,400 others. He held up a photo of a mangled and bloodied hand, telling ambassadors from the 15 council nations: 'Look at the ugliness of what has happened in this picture.' Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon criticized the Lebanese minister for not mentioning Hezbollah, which started launching near daily attacks against Israel from Lebanon the day after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel. Many victims of the explosions were its supporters. The Lebanese people are 'trapped in the grip of this terrorist organization,' Danon said. Before the council meeting, he was asked by reporters about speculation Israel was behind the explosions. 'We are not commenting on the specific attacks you mentioned, but I can tell you that we will do everything we will do everything we can to target those terrorists to minimize casualties for civilians,' he replied. Bouhabib warned that without condemnation of Israel, other countries and extremists will use similar ordinary devices on trains, planes and elsewhere to terrorize civilians. Hezbollah confirms a top military official was killed in Friday's airstrike BEIRUT — Hezbollah announced the death of a top military official in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut Friday. Israeli officials had earlier said the rare strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs killed Ibrahim Akil, a commander of the Lebanese militant group’s elite Radwan Force. The strike killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens more, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. In a statement, Hezbollah described Akil as 'a great jihadist leader' and said he had 'joined the procession of his brothers, the great martyr leaders, after a blessed life full of jihad, work, wounds, sacrifices, dangers, challenges, achievements, and victories.' United Nations humanitarian chief calls for investigation into device explosions UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. humanitarian chief told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that weaponizing communications devices represents a new development in warfare and said targeting thousands of Lebanese people using them without their knowledge is a violation of international human rights law. Volker Türk called for an independent investigation of this week’s mass explosions of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies that killed at least 37 people and wounding about 3,000 others. The attacks have widely been attributed to Israel. 'Those who ordered and carried out these attacks must be held to account,' he told council members Friday. Türk said the explosions also appear to violate international humanitarian law’s key principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack. He said international law also prohibits the use of booby-trapped devices that look harmless. 'It is a war crime to commit violence intended to spread terror among civilians,' he added. Lebanon urges United Nations to condemn attacks that used the synchronized explosion of devices BEIRUT — Lebanon’s mission to the United Nations called attacks this week in which thousands of devices were blown up 'an unprecedented method of fighting in its brutality and terrorism.' It said targeting thousands of people of different ages and in heavily populated areas 'is an act of terrorism and a violation of international law and human rights and is designated as a war crimes.' The mass explosions of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies on Tuesday and Wednesday killed at least 37 people and wounding about 3,000 others in attacks widely attributed to Israel. Lebanon said the U.N. should hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in the Middle East and should condemn the attacks. It also said the U.N should stop Israel’s attacks to avoid 'a destructive regional war.' 14 killed in Israeli airstrike on Beirut BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry has raised the death toll from Friday's Israeli airstrike on Beirut to 14. Dozens more were wounded. The Israeli strike in the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital flattened two apartment buildings. The Israeli military said the strike killed Ibrahim Akil, a senior Hezbollah military official. There was no immediate confirmation of his death from Hezbollah. Biden says he still has hope for a cease-fire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday that his administration must keep working at trying to win a cease-fire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas as tensions rise along the Israel-Lebanon border. The president’s comments came hours after Israel carried out what it called targeted strikes near Beirut. The action is raising concerns that the nearly yearlong Gaza war could spread into a larger regional war. 'We are continuing to try to do what we tried in the beginning to make sure that both the people of northern Israel as well as southern Lebanon are able to get back to their homes and go back safely,' Biden said in an exchange with reporters at the start of a Cabinet meeting at the White House. Asked if getting an agreement may be slipping out of reach in the final months of his presidency, Biden said he still had hope and that his national security team continues to work. 'If I ever said it wasn’t realistic, we might as well leave,' Biden said. 'A lot of things don’t look realistic until we get them done. We have to keep at it.' Israel says its airstrike killed a senior Hezbollah military official JERUSALEM — The Israeli military announced that its airstrike Friday on a neighborhood of Beirut killed Ibrahim Akil, a senior Hezbollah military official. There was no immediate confirmation of his death from Hezbollah. The Israeli strike in the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital killed at least nine people and wounded nearly 60 others, according to Lebanese health officials, and flattened two apartment buildings. The Israeli military also claimed that its strike killed other 'top operatives' of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, without elaborating. A Hezbollah official has confirmed that Akil was supposed to be in the building in the Dahiya district that was hit. Akil has served on Hezbollah’s highest military body, the Jihad Council, and has been sanctioned by the United States for being involved in two terrorist attacks in 1983 that killed more than 300 people at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the U.S. Marine Corps barracks. Netanyahu is shortening a planned United States trip JERUSALEM — Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has shortened a planned trip to the U.S. because of rising tensions with Hezbollah, according to an Israeli official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media on the matter. Netanyahu is supposed to travel to the U.S. ahead of a planned speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday. The decision to shorten the trip comes as tensions with Hezbollah threaten to spiral into an all-out war, following an Israeli strike targeting a senior Hezbollah leader in a southern suburb of Beirut. ___ Associated Press writer Julia Frankel contributed to this report. Israel carries out an airstrike on Beirut BERUIT — An Israeli airstrike hit Beirut on Friday, killing at least eight people and wounding nearly 60 others in the first such Israeli attack on Lebanon’s capital in months. The Israeli strike on Beirut’s crowded southern suburbs hit during rush hour, as people headed home from work and children left school. Local networks broadcast footage that showed at least two buildings completely flattened and the main street ravaged in Dahiyeh, just kilometers from downtown Beirut where Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group holds sway. The strike came after Hezbollah pounded Israel with 140 rockets earlier Friday and tensions threaten to spill into all-out war. White House calls allegations against Israeli soldiers in West Bank ‘deeply disturbing’ WASHINGTON — The White House says a video showing Israeli soldiers pushing three apparently lifeless bodies from rooftops during a raid in the northern part of the occupied West Bank 'deeply disturbing.' An AP journalist in the town of Qabatiya witnessed three soldiers push the bodies off the roofs of adjacent multi-story buildings, sending them falling out of view. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Friday that 'it clearly would depict abhorrent and egregious behavior by professional soldiers' if the video is found to be authentic. 'We reached out immediately to our Israeli counterparts about it, and we pressed them for more details,' he said. 'They have assured us that they’re going to investigate this, and that there will be proper accountability if it’s warranted. And we’re going to be very eager to see what the IDF investigation finds.' The Israeli military in a statement called it 'a serious incident that does not coincide with IDF values and the expectations from IDF soldiers,' using the acronym the military goes by. The United States says there is still time for a diplomatic solution WASHINGTON — The Biden administration continues to hold on to hope that surging tensions between Israel and Hezbollah won’t escalate into all-out war following Israel Defense Forces air strike Friday near Beirut. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said he was unaware of Israel providing the U.S. any forewarning ahead of the operation. 'We still believe that there is time and space for a diplomatic solution,' Kirby said. 'We think that that is the best way forward. War is not inevitable up there at the Blue Line. And we’re going to continue to do everything we can to prevent it.' The Israeli strikes near Beirut followed two waves of deadly attacks earlier this week of hundreds of hand-held pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah militants exploding. The sophisticated sabotage operations are widely believed to be carried out by Israel. The White House has declined to publicly comment on the electronic device attacks beyond saying the U.S. was not involved. Palestinian authorities say 15 people were killed overnight in Gaza Palestinian authorities say 15 people were killed overnight in the Gaza Strip in multiple Israeli attacks. An airstrike early Friday morning in Gaza City hit a family home, killing six people including an unknown number of children, Gaza’s Civil Defense said. Another person was killed in Gaza City when a strike hit a group of people on a street. In Beit Hanoun, north of Gaza City, another person was killed and several others injured when a vehicle was hit by an Israeli strike, the Civil Defense said. Late Thursday, six more people were killed in a strike that hit a home in the center of Gaza City, while another was killed in Beit Lahya, north of Gaza City. Israel maintains it only targets militants and accuses Hamas and other armed groups of endangering civilians by operating in residential areas. The military, which rarely comments on individual strikes, had no immediate comment. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million. Israel challenges international court request for arrest warrants Israel's foreign ministry said Friday it submitted two legal briefs in response to the International Criminal Court prosecutor’s request for arrest warrants against the country's leaders. The court’s prosecutor is seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and other Hamas leaders. One of them was since assassinated in what was believed to be an Israeli strike. The foreign ministry said it has submitted two legal briefs challenging the court’s jurisdiction to arrest Israeli leaders and claiming the court did not provide Israel the opportunity to investigate itself before requesting the warrants. 'No other democracy with an independent and respected legal system like that which exists in Israel has been treated in this prejudicial manner by the Prosecutor,' wrote Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein on the social media platform X. He said Israel remained 'steadfast in its commitment to the rule of law and justice' and would continue to protect its citizens against militancy. Israel is not a party to the court. Rights groups say the country has struggled to investigate itself in the past. Netanyahu has brushed off calls for a state investigation into the failings that led to the Oct. 7 attack. Leader of Iraqi militia reportedly killed in Syria BAGHDAD — A leader of an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia was killed Friday in a strike in Syria, a war monitor and a militia official said. Iraq’s Kataeb Hezbollah group — which is different from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah — said in a statement that Abu Haidar al-Khafaji was killed 'while performing his duties as a security advisor in Damascus.' The United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had earlier reported that a leader in Iraq’s Kataeb Hezbollah group was killed and another person injured in a drone strike on the car they were traveling in on the road to the Damascus airport. An official with an Iraqi militia confirmed that a car carrying a group of militia members was struck in Damascus, killing one person and injuring three others. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. There was no comment from Israeli officials on the strike. Israel frequently strikes Iranian and Iran-linked groups in Syria but rarely acknowledges the strikes. Tensions have heightened in the region following a wave of apparently remotely detonated explosions in Lebanon targeting pagers and walkie talkies belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah. The attacks, widely blamed on Israel, which has not commented on them, killed at least 37 people — including two children — and wounded about 3,000. ___ Associated Press journalist Qassim Abdul-Zahra contributed to this report. Israel military says it killed 2 Hezbollah members planting explosives along the border BEIRUT — Israel’s military killed two Hezbollah members who were planting explosives along the border over the weekend, Israel’s military and an official with a Lebanese group said. The official with a Lebanese group said the two members of the militant group were killed Sunday and their bodies were taken by Israeli troops because they were too close to the fence along the tense frontier. The official spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. On Thursday, Israel’s military released a video it said was taken by one of the fighters showing the militants coming under fire. The military said that the two fighters were killed by Israeli troops as they tried to plant an improvised explosive device near a military post. In the days following the tense border interaction, thousands of devices exploded in different parts of Lebanon and Syria, killing 37 people and wounding around 3,000 others. The attack was blamed on Israel, and many of those killed or injured were members of Hezbollah. ___ Associated Press writer Bassem Mroue contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-hamas-war-latest-15-killed-overnight-in-gaza-in-multiple-attacks/	2024-09-20T20:16:17-07:00	
Rare Israeli airstrike in Beirut kills Hezbollah commander and mo...	BEIRUT (AP) — Israel launched a rare airstrike that killed a senior Hezbollah military official in a densely populated southern Beirut neighborhood on Friday. It was the deadliest such strike on Lebanon’s capital in decades, with Lebanese authorities reporting at least 14 people killed and dozens more wounded in the attack. The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the strike on Beirut's southern Dahiya district killed Ibrahim Akil, a commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, as well as 10 other Hezbollah operatives. 'We will continue pursuing our enemies in order to defend our citizens, even in Dahiya, in Beirut,' said Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, describing the Israeli strike that targeted Akil as part of 'a new phase of war.' Several hours later, Hezbollah confirmed Akil's death. In a statement, the Lebanese militant group described Akil as 'a great jihadist leader' and said he had 'joined the procession of his brothers, the great martyr leaders, after a blessed life full of jihad, work, wounds, sacrifices, dangers, challenges, achievements, and victories.' Akil served on Hezbollah’s highest military body, the Jihad Council. He was sanctioned by the United States for his alleged involvement in the 1983 bombing that killed more than 300 people at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the U.S. Marine Corps barracks. Last year, the U.S. State Department posted a $7 million reward for information leading to his identification, location, arrest or conviction, citing his role in the embassy bombing and in the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s. The strike came as a new cycle of escalation between the enemies raised fears of a full-out war erupting in the Middle East. Hours before the Israeli strike, Hezbollah pounded northern Israel with 140 rockets as the region awaited the revenge promised by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah over this week’s mass explosions of pagers belonging to members of the Shiite militant group. The Israeli military did not provide the identities of the other Hezbollah commanders allegedly killed in its strike on the crowded neighborhood just kilometers from downtown Beirut. Lebanon's Health Ministry said at least 14 people were killed and 66 others were wounded in the attack, which leveled the apartment building where the Israeli army claimed Akil had been meeting with other militants in the basement. Nine of the wounded were in serious condition, the ministry added. Local networks in Lebanon broadcast footage showing first responders sifting through the rubble of a collapsed high-rise in the Jamous area in the heart of Dahiya, where Hezbollah conducts many of its political and security operations. The rescue operation continued into the late hours of Friday, hours after the attack, as first responders wrestled to remove the rubble to reach the basement of the building where apparently many of the bodies were located. Friday's airstrike — the deadliest such attack on a neighborhood of Beirut since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bloody, monthlong war in 2006 — hit during rush hour, as people were leaving work and children heading home from school. At Beirut's St. Therese Hospital near the scene of the airstrike, crowds flocked to donate blood for those wounded in the attack. 'We are all together in this situation, so it’s my obligation,' said Hussein Harake, who lined up to donate blood. From Israel, Gallant said he briefed senior military officials on the strike and vowed Israel would press on against Hezbollah 'until we achieve our goal, ensuring the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes.' The strike came after Hezbollah launched one of its most intense bombardments of northern Israel in nearly a year of fighting, largely targeting Israeli military sites. Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of the Katyusha rockets. The few that got through sparked small fires but caused little damage and no Israeli casualties. Hezbollah described its latest wave of rocket salvos as a response to past Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon — not as revenge for the mass explosions of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies on Tuesday and Wednesday that killed at least 37 people - including two children - and wounded 2,900 others in attacks widely attributed to Israel. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in this week's sophisticated attacks, which signaled a major escalation in the past 11 months of simmering conflict along the Israel-Lebanon border. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire regularly since Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel ignited the Israeli military’s devastating offensive in Gaza. But previous cross-border attacks have largely struck areas in northern Israel that had been evacuated and less-populated parts of southern Lebanon. The last time Israel hit Beirut was in a July airstrike that killed senior Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur. 'The attack in Lebanon is to protect Israel,' Hagari said at a news conference following Friday's strike, describing both Shukr and Akil as the two military officials closest to Hezbollah leader Nasrallah. Hagari also accused Akil of plotting a series of attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians dating back decades, including a never-realized plan to invade northern Israel in a similar way to the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks. After Friday's Israeli airstrike, Hezbollah announced attacks on northern Israel, two of which it said targeted an intelligence base from where it claimed Israel directed assassinations. Israel remains on edge, with Nasrallah vowing Thursday to keep up strikes on Israel despite the humiliating 'blow' he said Hezbollah suffered in the sabotage of its communication devices. 'We are in a tense period,' Hagari told reporters Friday. 'We are prepared on high alert both offensively and defensively.' In recent days, Israel has sent a powerful fighting force to the northern border, designated as an official war goal the return of tens of thousands of displaced residents to their homes in northern Israel and ordered citizens near Israel's border with Lebanon to stay close to bomb shelters. Hezbollah has maintained that it will only halt its fire when there is a cease-fire in Gaza. Hamas, which continues to fight Israel in Gaza, condemned the Israeli strike targeting Akil as a 'new crime' and 'violation of Lebanese sovereignty.' Even as the world's attention turns to the surge in Israel-Hezbollah tensions, Palestinian casualties in the besieged Gaza Strip continued to mount. Palestinian health authorities early Friday reported that 15 people, including children, were killed in Israeli strikes that targeted a family home and a group of people on the street in Gaza City. Israel's campaign in Gaza has already killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza-based Health Ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between fighters and civilians. In response to a request for comment on the latest Gaza strikes, the Israeli military insisted on Friday that it took 'feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm' and accused Hamas of endangering civilians by operating in residential areas. Israel's bombardment and invasion of the Gaza Strip — launched in response to Hamas killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage in southern Israel on Oct. 7 — has wreaked vast destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem.

Residents in Kyiv told to stay indoors as air pollution blankets ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Authorities in Ukraine advised residents in the capital Kyiv to stay indoors Friday as air pollution, partly caused by fires in the region, blanketed the city. Ukraine’s Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources said the pollution was a result of the burning of peatlands and other wildfires in the region combined with autumn temperature fluctuations. The capital woke up to thick smog with the rancid smell of blazing fires in the air. Some people were spotted wearing masks. The Ukrainian capital topped a list of the most polluted major cities early Friday in a real-time database by IQAir, a Swiss company that monitors air quality levels. Its air quality appeared to have improved somewhat since as the city came down in the ranking later in the day. Kyiv’s Department of Environmental Protection and Climate Change said that 'the likely cause of this is fires in the Kyiv region.' Fires have been reported in the Vyshhorod district, around 20 kilometers (around 12 miles) north of the capital. Officials warned about an increased concentration of suspended particles, such as dust, soot, and smoke, in the air. In some areas of the city, air pollution levels have reached the maximum of the 100-point scale. While human-driven climate change does not directly cause fires, it can increase the risk of wildfire as warming temperatures and increasingly dry air, trees and soil can make it easier for fires to spread. Forest fires around the world have worsened in recent years, with almost twice as much tree cover burning in 2023 than 20 years ago, according to the World Resources Institute. Wildfire smoke can cause air quality to deteriorate even many miles away from fires. The main concern from the wildfire smoke is fine particle pollution, known as PM2.5. Fine particle pollution can cause short-term problems like coughing, as well as long-term impacts on the lungs and heart. Pollution is a major health concern — with one major study estimating that pollution kills around 9 million people globally a year. Residents in Kyiv were advised to close their windows, limit time spent outdoors, drink plenty of water, and use an air purifier. 'Particular attention should be paid to these recommendations by people with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,' said a statement from the Ecology Ministry. Autumn temperature variations trap harmful substances in the air, worsening pollution and reducing air quality, the ministry added.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-residents-in-kyiv-told-to-stay-indoors-as-air-pollution-blankets-the-ukrainian-capital/	2024-09-20T06:39:27-07:00	
Hezbollah leader vows retaliation against Israel for attacks on d...	BEIRUT (AP) — The leader of Hezbollah vowed Thursday to keep up daily strikes on Israel despite this week's deadly sabotage of its members' communication devices, and said Israelis displaced from homes near the Lebanon border because of the fighting would not be able to return until the war in Gaza ends. Hezbollah and Israel launched fresh attacks across the border as Hassan Nasrallah spoke for the first time since the mass bombing of devices in Lebanon and Syria that he described as a 'severe blow' — and for which he promised to retaliate. The two days of attacks targeting thousands of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies have been widely blamed on Israel, heightening fears that 11 months of near-daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel will escalate into all-out war. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the attacks. During Nasrallah's speech, Hezbollah struck at least four times in northern Israel, and two Israeli soldiers were killed in a strike earlier in the day. Israeli warplanes flew low over Beirut while Nasrallah spoke and broke the sound barrier, scattering birds and prompting people in houses and offices to quickly open windows to prevent them from shattering. Israel also launched attacks in southern Lebanon on Thursday, saying it struck hundreds of rocket launchers and other Hezbollah infrastructure, though it was not immediately clear if there were any casualties. The army claimed the launchers were about to be used 'in the immediate future.' At the same time, the army ordered residents in parts of the Golan Heights and northern Israel to avoid public gatherings, minimize movements and stay close to shelters in anticipation of possible rocket fire. In recent weeks, Israeli leaders have stepped-up warnings of a potential larger military operation against Hezbollah, saying they are determined to stop the group’s fire to allow tens of thousands of Israelis to return to homes near the border. In a Thursday briefing, the Israeli defense minister said Hezbollah would 'pay an increasing price' as Israel seeks to make conditions near its border with Lebanon safe enough for residents to return. 'The sequence of our military actions will continue,' he said. The attack on electronic devices appeared to be the culmination of a monthslong operation by Israel to target as many Hezbollah members as possible all at once — but civilians were also hit. At least 37 people were killed, including two children, and some 3,000 wounded in the explosions Tuesday and Wednesday. Nasrallah said the group is investigating how the bombings were carried out. 'Yes, we were subjected to a huge and severe blow,' he said. 'The enemy crossed all boundaries and red lines,' he said. Pointing to the number of pagers and walkie-talkies, he accused Israel of intending to kill thousands of people at one time. 'The enemy will face a severe and fair punishment from where they expect and don’t expect.' He said Hezbollah will continue its barrages into northern Israel as long as the war in Gaza continues, vowing that Israel will not be able to bring its people back to the border region. 'The only way is stop the aggression on the people of Gaza and the West Bank,' he said. 'Neither strikes, nor assassinations nor an all-out war will achieve that.' Earlier Thursday, Hezbollah said it had targeted three Israeli military positions near the border, two of them with drones. Israeli hospitals reported eight people lightly or moderately injured. Hezbollah says its near daily fire is a show of support for Hamas. Israel’s 11-month-old war with Hamas in Gaza began after its militants led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Israel has responded to Hezbollah’s attacks with strikes in southern Lebanon, and has struck senior figures from the group in the capital Beirut. The exchanges have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents on each side of the border. Israel and Hezbollah have repeatedly pulled back from an all-out war under heavy pressure from the United States, France and other countries. But in their recent warnings, Israeli leaders have said they are determined to change the status quo dramatically. Speaking to Israeli troops on Wednesday, Gallant said, 'We are at the start of a new phase in the war — it requires courage, determination and perseverance.' He made no mention of the exploding devices but praised the work of Israel’s army and security agencies, saying 'the results are very impressive.' He said that after months of fighting Hamas in Gaza, 'the center of gravity is shifting to the north by diverting resources and forces.' Israel began moving more troops to its border with Lebanon on Wednesday as a precautionary measure, Israeli officials said. Israel’s army chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said plans have been drawn up for additional action against Hezbollah, though media reported the government has not yet decided whether to launch a major offensive in Lebanon. Lebanon is still reeling from the deadly device attacks of Tuesday and Wednesday. The explosions have rattled anxious Lebanese fearing a full-scale war. The Lebanese Army said it has been locating and detonating suspicious pagers and communication devices, while the country’s civil aviation authorities banned pagers and walkie-talkies on all airplanes departing from Beirut’s international airport until further notice. The attack was likely to severely disrupt Hezbollah’s internal communication as it scrambles to determine safe means to talk to each other. Hezbollah announced the death of five combatants Thursday, but didn’t specify if they were killed in the explosions or on the front lines. The blasts went off wherever the holders of the pagers or walkie-talkies happened to be in multiple parts of Beirut and eastern and southern Lebanon — in homes and cars, grocery stores and cafes and on the street, even at a funeral for some killed in the bombings, often with family and other bystanders nearby. Many suffered gaping wounds on their legs, abdomens and faces or were maimed in the hand. Tuesday’s pager blasts killed 12 people, including two children, and wounded some 2,300 others. The following day’s explosion killed 25 and wounded more than 600, Health Minister Firas Abiad said, giving updated figures. Abiad told reporters that Wednesday’s injuries were more severe than the previous day as walkie-talkies that exploded were bigger than the pagers. He praised Lebanon’s hospitals, saying they had managed to deal with the flood of wounded within hours. 'It was an indiscriminate attack. It was a war crime,' he said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hezbollah-fires-new-volley-at-israel-as-fears-of-greater-war-mount-after-electronic-devices-bombing/	2024-09-19T19:26:13-07:00	
Harris hopes to turn Ukraine war into winning issue in battle wit...	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Democrats are stepping up their outreach to Polish Americans in this year's presidential election as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump vie for support from a community that could play a decisive role in razor-thin battleground state contests. Harris hopes to capitalize on Polish Americans' historic animosity toward Russia and on Trump's hesitancy to back Ukraine during last week's debate. The Democratic vice president's team organized a national call with Polish American supporters on Wednesday to encourage local networks to hold their own events and spread the campaign's message. Although Polish Americans are not a particularly large demographic, many of them live in the so-called 'blue wall' states that are critical to victory for either candidate. There are an estimated 784,000 in Michigan, 758,000 in Pennsylvania and 481,000 in Wisconsin, three places that Harris is visiting this week. 'We’re talking about an election where a swing of a few thousand voters in any of those states could make all the difference,' said Tom Malinowski, a Polish-born former Democratic congressman from New Jersey. Filip Jotevski, the newly hired point person for networking with diaspora and ethnic communities, said on Wednesday's Harris organizing call that if Trump returns to power 'he'll sell out Ukraine' after spending years 'cozying up to Vladimir Putin.' Trump was originally scheduled to stop by a Polish American shrine in Pennsylvania on Sunday for the unveiling of a monument to the anticommunist Solidarity movement. However, the visit was cancelled, according to a person familiar with the Republican candidates' plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Trump had been expected to be there at the same time as Polish President Andrzej Duda. The Polish American community was pushed into the spotlight during the Sept. 10 debate in Philadelphia, when Trump twice refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war against Russia. 'Negotiate a deal,' Trump said. 'Because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.' Harris fired back that if Trump had been president when the invasion took place, 'Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe.' 'Why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up,' she said. Some were surprised yet pleased to hear their community mentioned on the debate stage. 'She knew what she was talking about,' said Tony Pol, a 67-year-old retired fire chief in Erie, Pennsylvania, who spent a quarter century helping run a Polish American fraternal organization. 'I think that’s the concern of everybody — if Ukraine goes down, then Poland goes next, and that’s very concerning.' Gosia Dodi, originally from Poland and now an American citizen living in western Michigan, said she 'absolutely agrees' with Harris that Russia could target Poland if Ukraine loses. The 61-year-old described Trump's affection for Putin as 'dangerous for Poland.' 'I want the war over, but not the way he’s saying,' she said. 'He thinks he can fix everything within one day or something, which is ridiculous.' After Poland was devastated in World War II, the country spent decades as a satellite state of the Soviet Union. A revolution ended communist rule in 1989, paving the way for the country's modern multiparty democracy. Poland became a NATO member in 1999. Timothy L. Kuzma, a Pittsburgh resident who leads the Polish Falcons of America, a fraternal organization with 19th-century roots in Chicago’s large Polish immigrant community, said his community's voters want to see a candidate that's committed to strong transatlantic bonds. 'If either candidate doesn’t give those kinds of assurances, that’s problematic,' he said. 'The candidates, both parties, have to pledge their support to Poland, to Ukraine, to NATO and to the overall security of Eastern Europe — and that’s all of Eastern Europe — and Europe as well.' Trump has previously suggested withdrawing the United States from NATO, which would devastate the alliance, and he’s demanded that allies increase their defense spending to reduce the burden on Washington. If they didn't, Trump warned, the U.S. would not uphold its treaty obligations and 'would encourage them' — meaning Russia — 'to do whatever the hell they want.' Pete Alibali, 53, immigrated from Soviet-controlled Poland when he was 16, because his mother, a chemist, wanted to advance her career without becoming a communist party member. A lifelong Democrat who now lives in Madison, Wisconsin, Alibali views Putin as a 'predator and a continuation of the Soviets.' Beyond his concern for his native Poland, he worries that tiny Baltic nations could also be threatened if Ukraine is defeated. Alibali acknowledged that many Polish Americans are conservative, growing up reading Polish newspapers, working in Polish-owned businesses, listening to Polish radio and attending their neighborhood Catholic church. He described his uncle, who lives in Chicago, as a 'very rabid Trump supporter.' 'Trump divided my family,' Alibali said. Polish American voters have swung back and forth between Democrats and Republicans in presidential elections over the years. They supported Trump in 2016 but backed President Joe Biden in 2020. Malinowski said Trump's visit to the shrine 'shows that he’s nervous that he might be losing ground among a group of voters that he may have taken for granted.' He also downplayed any suggestion of friendship between Trump and Duda, a right-wing politician who once suggested renaming a military base in his country as Fort Trump. 'I know the Poles are nervous,' he said. 'The advice they’re getting is, cultivate Trump just in case. They’re doing it with fingers crossed.' Tom Kolano, a 55-year-old Republican in suburban Pittsburgh whose ancestors were Polish immigrants, said he's encouraged by Trump's relationship with Duda. 'I’m not worried that President Trump will abandon Ukraine,' Kolano said. 'Here’s one big reason — I think Poland will have a lot to say about that.' He pointed out that Duda and his political rival, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, used a visit to Washington in March to press a divided Congress to break its impasse over replenishing funds for Ukraine at a critical moment in the war. John Laka, 66, of Appleton, Wisconsin, believes that Trump will be stronger overall on foreign policy than Harris. 'I just don’t have a lot of confidence in her as a leader or president,' he said. 'She’s just really lacking.' Laka's parents immigrated to the United States from Poland, and he's not sure how much the country is really imperiled by Russia. 'The threat of Putin going further is always going to be there unless there’s that idea of deterrence and right now we’re not deterring going anywhere,' he said. ___ Megerian reported from Washington.

UN General Assembly widely supports a Palestinian resolution dema...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. General Assembly strongly supported a nonbinding Palestinian resolution Wednesday demanding that Israel end its 'unlawful presence' in Gaza and the occupied West Bank within a year. The vote in the 193-member world body was 124-14, with 43 abstentions. Among those in opposition was the United States, Israel’s closest ally. The resolution was adopted as Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza approaches its first anniversary and as violence in the West Bank reaches new highs. Troubled efforts to broker a cease-fire deal in Gaza are pressing ahead, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting fellow mediators Wednesday in Egypt, even as attacks elsewhere in the region raise fears of escalating conflict in the Middle East. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, called the vote a turning point 'in our struggle for freedom and justice.' 'It sends a clear message that Israel’s occupation must end as soon as possible and that the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination must be realized,' he said. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, slammed the vote as 'a shameful decision that backs the Palestinian Authority’s diplomatic terrorism.' 'Instead of marking the anniversary of the Oct. 7 massacre by condemning Hamas and calling for the release of all 101 of the remaining hostages, the General Assembly continues to dance to the music of the Palestinian Authority, which backs the Hamas murderers,' Danon said. The U.S. mission to the U.N. called the resolution 'one-sided,' pointing to its failure to recognize that Hamas, 'a terrorist organization,' still exerts power in Gaza and to state that Israel has a right to defend itself from acts of terrorism. 'This resolution will not bring about tangible progress for Palestinians,' the U.S. said. 'In fact, it could both complicate efforts to end the conflict in Gaza and impede reinvigorating steps toward a two-state solution, while ignoring Israel’s very real security concerns.' While the resolution is not legally binding, the extent of its support reflects world opinion. There are no vetoes in the General Assembly, unlike in the 15-member Security Council. The resolution also demands the withdrawal of all Israeli forces and the evacuation of settlers from the occupied Palestinian territories 'without delay.' And it urges countries to impose sanctions on those responsible for maintaining Israel’s presence in the territories and halt arms exports to Israel if they’re suspected of being used there. In addition, the resolution calls for Israel to pay reparations to Palestinians for the damage caused by its occupation and urges countries to take steps to prevent trade or investments that maintain Israel’s presence in the territories. It comes in response to a ruling by the top United Nations court in July that said Israel’s presence in the Palestinian territories is unlawful and must end. The court’s opinion also is not legally binding. In the sweeping condemnation of Israel’s rule over the lands it captured during the 1967 war, the International Court of Justice said Israel had no right to sovereignty over the territories and was violating international laws against acquiring the lands by force. The General Assembly’s consideration of the resolution began Tuesday with Mansour stressing that any country that thinks the Palestinian people 'will accept a life of servitude' — or that claims peace is possible without a just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — is 'not being realistic.' The solution remains an independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side in peace and security with Israel, he said. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also urged Israel to heed the call to end its occupation. The resolution asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to submit a report to the General Assembly within three months on putting the resolution in place, 'including any actions taken by Israel, other states and international organizations, including the United Nations.' 'We fully abide by the decisions of the International Court of Justice,' Guterres told reporters. 'I will implement any decision of the General Assembly in that regard.' Mansour said most likely Israel won’t pay attention to the resolution and that the Palestinians will then follow up with a stronger one. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-the-un-will-vote-on-a-palestinian-resolution-demanding-israel-end-its-occupation/	2024-09-18T11:48:00-07:00	
What to know about the deadly pager explosions targeting Hezbolla...	NEW YORK (AP) — In what appears to be a sophisticated, remote attack, pagers used by hundreds of members of Hezbollah exploded almost simultaneously in Lebanon and Syria Tuesday, killing at least 12 people — including two children — and wounding thousands more. A U.S. official said Israel briefed the U.S. on the operation — in which small amounts of explosive hidden in the pagers were detonated — on Tuesday after it was concluded. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the information publicly. The Iran-backed militant group blamed Israel for the deadly explosions, which targeted an extraordinary breadth of people and showed signs of being a long-planned operation. Details on how the attack was executed are largely uncertain and investigators have not immediately said how the pagers were detonated. The Israeli military has declined to comment. Hezbollah is hit by a wave of exploding pagers that killed at least 9 people and injured thousands Here's what we know so far. Why were pagers used in the attack? Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah previously warned the group’s members not to carry cellphones, saying they could be used by Israel to track the group's movements. As a result, the organization uses pagers to communicate. A Hezbollah official told The Associated Press the exploded devices were from a new brand the group had not used before. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press, did not identify the brand name or supplier. Taiwanese company Gold Apollo said Wednesday it had authorized use of its brand on the AR-924 pager model and a Budapest, Hungary-based company called BAC Consulting produced and sold the pagers. Further information on BAC wasn't immediately available. Nicholas Reese, adjunct instructor at the Center for Global Affairs in New York University’s School of Professional Studies, said smart phones carry a higher risk for intercepted communications in contrast to the simpler technology of pagers. This type of attack will also force Hezbollah to change their communication strategies, said Reese, who previously worked as an intelligence officer, adding that survivors of Tuesday's explosions are likely to throw away 'not just their pagers, but their phones, and leaving their tablets or any other electronic devices.' How could sabotage cause these pagers to explode? Even with a U.S. official confirming it was a planned operation by Israel, multiple theories have emerged Tuesday around how the attack might have been carried out. Several experts who spoke with The Associated Press explained how the explosions were most likely the result of supply-chain interference. Very small explosive devices may have been built into the pagers prior to their delivery to Hezbollah, and then all remotely triggered simultaneously, possibly with a radio signal. By the time of the attack, 'the battery was probably half-explosive and half-actual battery,' said Carlos Perez, director of security intelligence at TrustedSec. A former British Army bomb disposal officer explained that an explosive device has five main components: A container, a battery, a triggering device, a detonator and an explosive charge. 'A pager has three of those already,' said the ex-officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he now works as a consultant with clients on the Middle East. 'You would only need to add the detonator and the charge.' After security camera footage appeared on social media Tuesday purporting to show one of the pagers exploding on a man’s hip in a Lebanese market, two munitions experts offered opinions that corroborate the U.S. official's statement that the blast appeared to be the result of a tiny explosive device. 'Looking at the video, the size of the detonation is similar to that caused by an electric detonator alone or one that incorporates an extremely small, high-explosive charge,' said Sean Moorhouse, a former British Army officer and explosive ordinance disposal expert. This signals involvement of a state actor, Moorhouse said. He adds that Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, is the most obvious suspect to have the resources to carry out such an attack. N.R. Jenzen-Jones, an expert in military arms who is director of the Australian-based Armament Research Services, notes that Israel had been accused of carrying out similar operations in the past. Last year, AP reported that Iran accused Israel of trying to sabotage its ballistic missile program through faulty foreign parts that could explode, damaging or destroying the weapons before they could be used. How long was this operation? It would take a long time to plan an attack of this scale. The exact specifics are still unknown, but experts who spoke with the AP shared estimates ranging anywhere between several months to two years. The sophistication of the attack suggests that the culprit has been collecting intelligence for a long time, Reese said. An attack of this caliber requires building the relationships needed to gain physical access to the pagers before they were sold; developing the technology that would be embedded in the devices; and developing sources who can confirm that the targets were carrying the pagers. And it's likely the compromised pagers seemed normal to their users for some time before the attack. Elijah J. Magnier, a Brussels-based veteran and a senior political risk analyst with over 37 years experience in the region, said he has had conversations with members of Hezbollah and survivors of Tuesday's pager attack. He said the pagers were procured more than six months ago. 'The pagers functioned perfectly for six months,' Magnier said. What triggered the explosion, he said, appeared to be an error message sent to all the devices. Based on his conversations with Hezbollah members, Magnier also said that many pagers didn’t go off, allowing the group to inspect them. They came to the conclusion that between 3 to 5 grams of a highly explosive material were concealed or embedded in the circuitry, he said. Jenzen-Jones also adds that 'such a large-scale operation also raises questions of targeting' — stressing the number of causalities and enormous impact reported so far. 'How can the party initiating the explosive be sure that a target’s child, for example, is not playing with the pager at the time it functions?' he said. ___ Associated Press journalist Johnson Lai in Taipei contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/international/ap-hundreds-of-pagers-exploded-in-lebanon-and-syria-in-a-deadly-attack-heres-what-we-know/	2024-09-18T04:58:47-07:00	
Ukrainian drones strike a large military depot in a Russian town ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia overnight, causing a huge blaze and prompting the evacuation of some local residents, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s recently announced — but still confidential — plan for winning the war 'can work' and help end the conflict that is now in its third year. Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed Russian military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 6 kilometers (4 miles) wide. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a 'massive drone attack' on Toropets, which has a population of around 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuation of some local residents. There was no immediate information about whether the strikes had caused any casualties. Successful Ukrainian strikes on targets deep inside Russia have become more common as the war has progressed and Kyiv developed its drone technology. Zelenskyy is also seeking the approval from Western nations for Ukraine to use the sophisticated weapons they are providing to hit targets inside Russia. Some Western leaders have balked at that possibility, fearing they could be dragged into the conflict. Ukraine’s targeting of Russian military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia, as well as making Russian civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine, is part of Kyiv's strategy. The swift push by Ukrainian forces into Russia’s Kursk border region last month fits into that plan, which apparently seeks to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down. Putin, however, has shown no signs of backing down, and has been trying to grind down Ukraine's resolve through attritional warfare and also sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. That has come at a price, however, as the U.K. Defense Ministry estimates that the war has likely killed and wounded more than 600,000 Russian troops. On Tuesday, Putin ordered the country’s military to increase its number of troops by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million by Dec. 1. Zelenskyy last month said his plan to victory includes not only battlefield goals but also diplomatic and economic wins. The plan has been kept under wraps but the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said during a news conference Tuesday that Washington officials have seen it. 'We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,' she said, adding that the United States will bring it up with other world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. She did not comment on what the plan contains. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukrainian-drones-strike-a-large-military-depot-in-a-russian-town-northwest-of-moscow/	2024-09-18T03:10:21-07:00	
Hezbollah is hit by a wave of exploding pagers that killed at lea...	BEIRUT (AP) — Pagers used by hundreds of members of the militant group Hezbollah exploded near-simultaneously Tuesday in Lebanon and Syria, killing at least nine people, including an 8-year-old girl, and wounding several thousand, officials said. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for what appeared to be a sophisticated remote attack. An American official said Israel briefed the United States on Tuesday after the conclusion of the operation, in which small amounts of explosive secreted in the pagers were detonated. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the information publicly. The Israeli military declined to comment. Among those wounded was Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon. The mysterious explosions came amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which have exchanged fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the war in Gaza. The pagers that blew up were apparently acquired by Hezbollah after the group’s leader ordered members in February to stop using cellphones, warning they could be tracked by Israeli intelligence. A Hezbollah official told The Associated Press the pagers were a new brand, but declined to say how long they had been in use. Taiwanese company Gold Apollo said Wednesday that it authorized its brand on the AR-924 pagers used by the Hezbollah militant group, but the devices were produced and sold by a company called BAC. At about 3:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, as people shopped for groceries, sat in cafes or drove cars and motorcycles in the afternoon traffic, the pagers in their hands or pockets started heating up and then exploding — leaving blood-splattered scenes and panicking bystanders. It appeared that many of those hit were members of Hezbollah, but it was not immediately clear if non-Hezbollah members also carried any of the exploding pagers. The blasts were mainly in areas where the group has a strong presence, particularly a southern Beirut suburb and in the Beqaa region of eastern Lebanon, as well as in Damascus, according to Lebanese security officials and a Hezbollah official. The Hezbollah official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. The explosions came hours after Israel’s internal security agency said it had foiled an attempt by Hezbollah to kill a former senior Israeli security official using a planted explosive device that could be remotely detonated. The United States 'was not aware of this incident in advance' and was not involved, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. 'At this point, we’re gathering information.' Experts said the pager explosions pointed to a long-planned operation, possibly carried out by infiltrating the supply chain and rigging the devices with explosives before they were delivered to Lebanon. Whatever the means, it targeted an extraordinary breadth of people with hundreds of small explosions — wherever the pager carrier happened to be — that left some maimed. One online video showed a man picking through produce at a grocery store when the bag he was carrying at his hip explodes, sending him sprawling to the ground and bystanders running. At overwhelmed hospitals, wounded were rushed in on stretchers, some with missing hands, faces partly blown away or gaping holes at their hips and legs, according to AP photographers. On a main road in central Beirut, a car door was splattered with blood and the windshield cracked. Lebanon Health Minister Firas Abiad told Qatar's Al Jazeera network at least nine people were killed, including an 8-year-old girl, and some 2,750 were wounded — 200 of them critically — by the explosions. Most had injuries in the face, hand, or around the abdomen. It appeared eight of the dead belonged to Hezbollah. The group issued a statement confirming at least two members were killed in the pager bombings. One of them was the son of a Hezbollah member in Parliament, according to the Hezbollah official who spoke anonymously. The group later issued announcements that six other members were killed Tuesday, though it did not specify how. 'We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression that also targeted civilians,' Hezbollah said, adding that Israel will 'for sure get its just punishment.' Iranian state-run IRNA news agency said that the country’s ambassador, Mojtaba Amani, was superficially wounded by an exploding pager and was being treated at a hospital. Previously, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had warned the group’s members not to carry cellphones, saying they could be used by Israel to track and target them. Sean Moorhouse, a former British Army officer and explosive ordnance disposal expert, said videos of the blasts suggested a small explosive charge — as small as a pencil eraser — had been placed into the devices. They would have had to have been rigged prior to delivery, very likely by Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, he said. Elijah J. Magnier, a Brussels-based senior political risk analyst, said he spoke with Hezbollah members who had examined pagers that failed to explode. What triggered the blasts, he said, appeared to be an error message sent to all the devices that caused them to vibrate, forcing the user to click on the buttons to stop the vibration. The combination detonated a small amount of explosives hidden inside and ensured that the user was present when the blast went off, he said. Israel has a long history of carrying out deadly operations well beyond its borders. This year, separate Israeli airstrikes in Beirut killed senior Hamas official Saleh Arouri and a top Hezbollah commander. A mysterious explosion in Iran, also blamed on Israel, killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ supreme leader. Israel has killed Hamas militants in the past with booby-trapped cellphones and it’s widely believed to have been behind the Stuxnet computer virus attack on Iran’s nuclear program in 2010. The pager bombings are likely to stoke Hezbollah's worries about vulnerabilities in security and communications as Israeli officials are threaten to escalate their monthslong conflict. The near-daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah have killed hundreds in Lebanon and several dozen in Israel, and have displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, deplored the attack and warned that it marks 'an extremely concerning escalation in what is an already unacceptably volatile context.' On Tuesday, Israel said that halting Hezbollah’s attacks in the north to allow residents to return to their homes is now an official war goal. Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said the focus of the conflict is shifting from Gaza to Israel’s north and that time is running out for a diplomatic solution with Hezbollah. ___ This story has been updated to correct the name of the Hezbollah lawmaker’s son killed by a pager blast. ___ Associated Press writers Hussein Malla, Hassan Ammar, Fadi Tawil and Sarah El Deeb in Beirut; Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran; Michael Biesecker in Washington; Josef Federman in Jerusalem; Zeke Miller in Washington; and Edith M.

Israel says halting Hezbollah attacks is now a war goal as offici...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel said Tuesday that halting Hezbollah's attacks in the country's north to allow residents to return to their homes is now an official war goal, as it considers a wider military operation in Lebanon that could ignite an all-out conflict. Israeli officials have repeatedly threatened to take heavier military action to halt the near-daily attacks, which began shortly after the outbreak of the nearly yearlong Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Israel has regularly launched airstrikes on Lebanon in response and has targeted and killed senior Hezbollah commanders. As recently as last month it appeared a full-blown war was imminent. Tuesday's statement by Israel's security Cabinet signaled a tougher stance at a time when Israeli leaders have stepped up their warnings. But it also appeared to be largely symbolic and may not herald an immediate change in policy. The tit-for-tat strikes have displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanon border. Hezbollah has said it would halt the attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but those talks have repeatedly bogged down. The United States has pressed for restraint even as it has rushed military aid to Israel, warning its close ally that a wider war would not achieve its goals. Israeli media have meanwhile reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering firing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and replacing him with Gideon Saar, the leader of a small right-wing party who is seen as more hawkish. That would be the biggest leadership shakeup in Israel since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza and set off wider regional tensions. The announcement on Lebanon came after Israel's security Cabinet met late into the night. It said the Cabinet has 'updated the objectives of the war' to include safely returning the residents of the north to their homes. 'Israel will continue to act to implement this objective,' it said. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who has made several visits to Lebanon and Israel to try to ease tensions, met with Netanyahu on Monday. Hochstein told Netanyahu that intensifying the conflict with Hezbollah would not help return Israelis evacuated from the border area to their homes, according to a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks. According to the official, Hochstein argued that Netanyahu risked sparking a broad and protracted regional conflict if he moved forward with a full-scale war in Lebanon and said the Biden administration remained committed to finding a diplomatic solution in conjunction with a Gaza cease-fire or on its own. Netanyahu told Hochstein that residents cannot return without 'a fundamental change in the security situation in the north,' according to a statement from the prime minister's office. It said that while Netanyahu 'appreciates and respects' U.S. support, Israel will 'do what is necessary to safeguard its security.' Defense Minister Gallant has meanwhile said the focus of the conflict is shifting from Gaza to Israel's north. He told U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin this week that time is running out for an agreement with Hezbollah, saying 'the trajectory is clear.' Hezbollah has said that while it does not want a wider war it is prepared for one. Raed Berro, a member of Hezbollah’s bloc in the Lebanese parliament, said Monday that the militant group 'is ready for confrontation and has a lot in its pocket to deter the enemy and protect Lebanon in case Netanyahu thinks of expanding the war.' Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a close political ally of Hezbollah, largely dismissed the warnings, telling a local newspaper that the Lebanese have grown used to the 'increasing Israeli threats … even if their tone has become louder recently.' The war in Gaza began when Hamas launched a surprise attack into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Militants are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after releasing most of the rest during a cease-fire last year. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians in the territory since Oct. 7, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Iran supports Hamas, Hezbollah and other militant groups across the region, which have carried out strikes on Israeli and U.S. targets in solidarity with the Palestinians. A missile launched by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels on Sunday set off air raid sirens in central Israel without causing casualties. Israel has hinted at a military response. Israel and Iran traded fire directly for the first time in April, and Iran has threatened to avenge the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in an explosion in Tehran in July. The targeted killing was widely blamed on Israel, which has not said whether it was involved. The U.S., Qatar and Egypt have spent most of this year trying to broker an agreement in which Hamas would release the hostages in exchange for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. President Joe Biden endorsed the framework of the agreement in May and the U.N. Security Council backed it days later. But since then, both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands, and the talks appear to be at an impasse. ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani in Washington, and Abby Sewell and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-says-halting-hezbollah-attacks-is-now-a-war-goal-as-officials-warn-of-a-wider-operation/	2024-09-17T05:30:24-07:00	
Israel-Hamas war latest: Israeli airstrikes kill 16 in Gaza, incl...	Palestinian officials say Israeli airstrikes killed 16 people Monday in the Gaza Strip, including five women and four children. Israel says it only targets militants and accuses Hamas and other armed groups of endangering civilians by operating in residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the Israel-Hamas war nearly a year ago. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million. US ambassador to the UN criticizes Israeli attacks on schools and civilians UNITED NATIONS — The United States ambassador to the United Nations criticized Israel’s military for attacking schools, humanitarian workers and civilians in Gaza in a sign of growing frustration with its close ally Monday as the war in Gaza approaches its first anniversary. Linda Thomas-Greenfield also reiterated to the U.N. Security Council her and President Joe Biden’s outrage at the death of Turkish-American activist Aysenur Eygi, who was shot and killed Sept. 6 during a protest in the West Bank 'simply for attending a protest.' 'This horrific tragedy should never have happened,' the U.S. envoy said. 'We will continue to demand details and continue to demand access into Israel’s investigation, and press for accountability, regarding the circumstances that led to Aysenur’s death.' The Israeli military said it likely killed Eygi by mistake, and the government has launched a criminal investigation. Israel has repeatedly said it targets Hamas militants who use civilians as human shields in retaliation for their Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. Thomas-Greenfield was unusually outspoken against the Israeli military in her briefing to the council after the top U.N. humanitarian official in Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, told members the territory has been turned into 'an abyss.' Calling the situation in Gaza 'catastrophic,' Thomas-Greenfield said many of the numerous attacks in recent weeks, where U.N. personnel and humanitarian workers were injured or killed, were preventable. US official warns Netanyahu that a full-scale war in Lebanon would risk sparking broader conflict WASHINGTON — White House senior adviser Amos Hochstein told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials that intensifying the conflict with Hezbollah on the Israeli-Lebanon border would not help achieve the goal of getting Israelis forced to evacuate back in their homes, according to a U.S. official. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to lack of authorization to discuss the private talks, said Hochstein stressed to Netanyahu during Monday’s talks that the Israeli leader risked sparking a broad and protracted regional conflict if he moved forward with a full-scale war in Lebanon. Hochstein also underscored to Israeli officials that the Biden administration remained committed to finding a diplomatic solution to the tensions on Israel’s northern border in conjunction with a Gaza deal or on its own, the official said. Netanyahu told Hochstein that it would 'not be possible to return our residents without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north.' The prime minister said Israel 'appreciates and respects' US support but 'will do what is necessary to maintain its security and return the residents of the north to their homes safely.' ___ Aamer Madhani contributed to this report. UN humanitarian official says more must be done to protect civilians in Gaza UNITED NATIONS — The top United Nations humanitarian official for Gaza says more must be done to protect civilians. 'Time is slipping away as a man-made humanitarian crisis has turned Gaza into the abyss,' Sigrid Kaag, the U.N. senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told the U.N. Security Council. Kaag said humanitarian operations are impeded by lawlessness, Israeli evacuation orders, fighting and operating conditions for aid workers. She cited Israeli denials of access, delays, a lack of safety and security, and 'poor logistical infrastructure.' Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon insisted the country’s humanitarian efforts during the war in Gaza 'are unparalleled.' He told the council over 1 million tons of aid have been delivered via more than 50,000 trucks. Kaag told reporters after the briefing that the question isn’t the number of trucks but how many can be retrieved and how much aid can be distributed given the conditions. She pointed to recent attacks on humanitarian convoys and schools and health facilities. 'It’s not about trucks. It’s about what people need … as human beings,' she stressed. 'We’re way, way off what people need, not only daily, but also what we would all consider a dignified human life.' Israeli protesters gather after reports that Netanyahu will fire his defense minister TEL AVIV, Israel — Hundreds of Israeli protesters have reportedly gathered in central Tel Aviv in a show of anger following reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is preparing to fire his popular defense minister. Israeli media reported Monday that Netanyahu is set to dismiss Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and replace him with opposition lawmaker Gideon Saar. Gallant, a gruff retired general, has emerged as Netanyahu’s biggest rival in the Cabinet. In recent weeks, the pair have clashed over Gallant’s call for Israel to reach a temporary cease-fire with Hamas and to seek a diplomatic solution to end daily fighting with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Israeli media reports said hundreds of demonstrators gathered near Saar’s home in central Tel Aviv. Protesters held signs that said, 'Saar, values before politics,' as they marched through the streets. A grassroots group representing hostage families said dismissing Gallant would hurt efforts to bring their loved-ones home. Saar is a former Netanyahu ally who became a fierce rival after quitting the ruling Likud Party four years ago. However, he has struggled as leader of a small party in parliament. Saar has held a number of senior Cabinet posts but has little military experience. Netanyahu’s office said that reports of negotiations with Saar were incorrect. But Israeli media said the pair were close to a deal. White House envoy meets with Israeli leaders TEL AVIV, Israel — A key White House Mideast envoy is meeting with Israeli leaders in hopes of lowering tensions between Israel and Lebanon. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah began striking Israel shortly after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack ignited the war. Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging blows daily while avoiding an all-out war. The fighting has displaced tens of thousands of civilians on both sides of the border. During his meeting with U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that time is running out for a political settlement and that Israel is moving toward taking tougher action against Hezbollah. Gallant warned 'the only way left to ensure the return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes will be via military action,' his office said. Hochstein in 2022 brokered a maritime border deal between Lebanon and Israel. The two countries have formally been at war since Israel’s independent in 1948. Hamas leader says Yemen rebels' missile attack sent a message SANAA, Yemen — The leader of Hamas Yahya Sinwar has told Yemen’s Houthi rebels that their recent missile attack has sent a message to Israel. Yahya Sinwar’s letter to Abdul-Malek al-Houthi was published by the Houthis’ al-Masirah news channel Monday, a day after a missile fired by the Iran-backed rebels landed in an open area in central Israel and triggered air raid sirens at its international airport. 'I congratulate you for succeeding in making your missile reach the depth of the enemy’s entity after surpassing all defense systems,' Sinwar’s letter read, according to al-Masirah. Sinwar added that the Yemeni missile attack sent a message that that attempts to 'contain' Hamas have failed and that the back-up fronts by Iran-backed groups are becoming more effective. Sinwar said that Hamas carried out the Oct. 7, attack on southern Israel and has since been fighting 'a defensive war that has exhausted the enemy.' He added that Hamas had prepared for 'a long war of attrition that will break' Israel’s political will. Shortly after the Israel-Hamas war started, Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq have claimed responsibility for scores of attacks against Israel saying they are backing their allies in Hamas. Israeli settlers storm a West Bank school and beat staffers, Palestinians say. Israeli troops later arrest school's principal and 2 others RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinians say Israeli settlers wielding sticks stormed a Palestinian school in the occupied West Bank, beating staff members and tying up the principal. The Israeli military said Palestinians had attacked an Israeli nearby, inflicting a head injury, before fleeing to the school on Monday. It said a group of Israelis followed the attackers and a confrontation ensued in which a number of Palestinians were hurt. Hassan Malihat, a Palestinian lawyer who at the time was visiting the school near the city of Jericho, said the settlers entered at around 8 a.m. He says the Israeli army arrived about two hours later and arrested three staff members, including the principal. The military said soldiers and police were dispatched to the school, ended the confrontation and arrested a number of suspects. The Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service says seven Palestinians were wounded in the confrontation. Settler violence has surged across the West Bank since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack ignited the war in Gaza. In some cases, Israeli settlers have stormed Palestinian villages setting cars and properties ablaze. There has also been a rise in car-ramming, stabbing and shooting attacks carried out against Israelis by Palestinian militant groups and lone attackers. Israel captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war — lands the Palestinians want for a future state. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy in some areas. Over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship live in well over 100 settlements considered illegal by most of the international community. Turkish autopsy indicates American-Turkish activist killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank died from a gunshot wound to the head ANKARA, Turkey — Initial findings from an autopsy by Turkish authorities indicate that Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi who was killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank died from a gunshot wound to the head. The eight-page report, signed by four forensic doctors and a forensic technician, was made available to The Associated Press on Monday. It described details such as skull fractures caused by the gunshot and brain tissue damage, noting that a toxicology report and tissue sample analysis are still pending. The 26-year-old activist from Seattle, who held dual U.S. and Turkish citizenship, was killed on Sept. 6 during a demonstration against Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Her funeral and burial took place in the Turkish Aegean coastal town of Didim on Saturday. The Israeli military stated last week that Eygi was likely shot 'indirectly and unintentionally' by Israeli forces. Turkey is conducting its own investigation into her death. A United Nations agency says polio campaign in Gaza has reached 90% of the children targeted JERUSALEM — The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees says the first round of a polio vaccination campaign in Gaza ended successfully by reaching 90% of the children it targeted. UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said in a post on the social media platform X, that Israel and Palestinian militants had largely observed humanitarian pauses to allow the campaign to proceed. The vaccination drive showed that 'when there is a political will, assistance can be provided without disruption,' Lazzarini wrote on Monday. UNRWA is the main provider of humanitarian assistance in the coastal enclave. Health workers plan to administer a second dose of the vaccine at the end of this month. The campaign was launched after the detection of Gaza’s first polio case in 25 years and sought to reach some 640,000 children under the age of 10. Health workers faced a host of challenges, including damaged roads, gutted health facilities and ongoing fighting nearly a year into the Israel-Hamas war. Israeli defense minister says time is running out for agreement with Hezbollah to halt fighting along Israel-Lebanon border JERUSALEM — Israel’s defense minister has told his United States counterpart that time is running out for an agreement with Hezbollah to halt the fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border. Yoav Gallant told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that 'the possibility for an agreed framework in the northern arena is running out as Hezbollah continues to ‘tie itself’ to Hamas.' 'The trajectory is clear,' Gallant added, according to a statement released from his office on Monday. Hezbollah began firing rockets and drones into northern Israel after the outbreak of the war in Gaza, which was ignited by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. Both armed groups are allied with Iran, and Hezbollah says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has responded to the attacks with airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders. It has threatened a wider operation, raising fears of another all-out war. Hezbollah has said it will halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but months of talks brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled. Hamas has demanded a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza as part of any agreement to release the scores of hostages it still holds from the Oct. 7 attack. Gallant told Austin that 'in any possible scenario, Israel’s defense establishment will continue to operate with the aim of dismantling Hamas and ensuring the return of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza — by any means.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-hamas-war-latest-israeli-airstrikes-kill-16-in-gaza-including-4-children-palestinians-say/	2024-09-16T20:42:03-07:00	
US airs frustration with Israel's military about strikes in Gaza	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations on Monday accused Israel’s military of striking schools, humanitarian workers and civilians in Gaza in a sign of growing American frustration with its close ally as the war approaches its first anniversary. Israel has repeatedly said it targets Hamas militants, who often hide with civilians and use them as human shields, in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and launched the war in Gaza. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield was unusually outspoken against the Israeli military at a U.N. Security Council meeting, saying many of the strikes in recent weeks that injured or killed U.N. personnel and humanitarian workers 'were preventable.' Many council members cited last week’s Israeli strike on a former school turned civilian shelter run by the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, in which six UNRWA staffers were among at least 18 people killed, including women and children. Israel said it targeted a Hamas command-and-control center in the compound, and Israel’s U.N. ambassador, Danny Danon, asserted Monday that Hamas militants were killed in the strike. He named four, claiming to the council that they worked for UNRWA during the day and Hamas at night. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent investigation. Thomas-Greenfield told council members that the U.S. will keep raising the need for Israel to facilitate humanitarian operations in the Palestinian territory and protect humanitarian workers and facilities like the UNRWA shelter. She also reiterated U.S. 'outrage' at the death of Turkish American activist Aysenur Eygi, who was shot and killed during a protest in the West Bank last week. Israeli Defense Forces said it likely killed Eygi by mistake, and the government has begun a criminal investigation. 'The IDF is a professional military and knows well how to ensure that incidents such as these do not happen,' the U.S. envoy said. Thomas-Greenfield said the United States expects Israeli military leaders to implement 'fundamental changes' in their operations — including to their rules of engagement and procedures to ensure that military operations do not conflict with humanitarian activities and do not target schools and other civilian facilities. 'We have also been unequivocal in communicating to Israel that there is no basis — absolutely none — for its forces to be opening fire on clearly marked U.N. vehicles as recently occurred on numerous occasions,' Thomas-Greenfield said. At the same time, she said Hamas is also hiding in — and in some cases, taking over or using — civilian sites, which poses 'an ongoing threat.' She said it underscores the urgency of reaching a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. While the United States works with fellow mediators Egypt and Qatar to try to get both sides 'to agree that enough is enough,' she said, 'this is ultimately a question of political will' and difficult compromises. Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Egypt this week for talks partly about refining a proposal to present to Israel and Hamas. The United States urges 'all council members with influence over Hamas to join others in pressing its leaders to stop stalling, make these compromises, and accept the deal without delay,' Thomas-Greenfield. She spoke after the top U.N. humanitarian official in Gaza said the territory is 'hell on Earth' for its more than 2 million people, calling the lack of effective protection for civilians 'unconscionable.' Sigrid Kaag, the U.N. senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told council members and reporters that the war has turned the territory 'into the abyss.' Over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel’s offensive, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Humanitarian operations are being impeded by lawlessness, Israeli evacuation orders, fighting and difficult conditions for aid workers that include Israeli denials of access, delays, a lack of safety and security, and 'poor logistical infrastructure,' Kaag said. Danon insisted that Israel's humanitarian efforts 'are unparalleled' for a country forced to go to war and urged the Security Council and the U.N. 'to speak to the facts.' Over 1 million tons of aid have been delivered via more than 50,000 trucks and nearly 1 million land crossings, he said, adding that hardly a fraction have been stopped. When asked about Danon’s statement, Kaag pointed to recent strikes on humanitarian convoys and schools and health facilities where Israel had received prior notification. 'It’s not about trucks. It’s about what people need,' she said. 'We’re way, way off what people need, not only daily, but also what we would all consider a dignified human life.' ___ Find more AP coverage of the war at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-us-airs-frustration-with-israels-military-about-strikes-in-gaza/	2024-09-16T18:52:37-07:00	
Putin orders military to boost troop numbers by 180,000 to 1.5 mi...	MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday ordered the country’s military to increase its number of troops by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million, as Moscow’s military action in Ukraine drags on for more than 2 ½ years. Putin’s decree, published on the official government website, will take effect Dec. 1. It sets the overall number of Russian military personnel at nearly 2.4 million, including 1.5 million troops, and orders the government to provide the necessary funding. The previous increase in Russian troop numbers came last December, when a decree by Putin set the total number of Russian military personnel at about 2.2 million, including 1.32 million troops. The most capable Russian troops have been pressing an offensive in eastern Ukraine, where they have made incremental but steady gains in the past few months. In June, Putin put the number of troops involved in what the Kremlin calls the 'special military operation' in Ukraine at nearly 700,000. After calling up 300,000 reservists in the face of Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the fall of 2022, Russian authorities have switched to filling the ranks of troops fighting in Ukraine with volunteer soldiers, who have been attracted by relatively high wages. Many commentators have noted that the Kremlin has been reluctant to call more reservists, fearing domestic destabilization like what happened in 2022 when hundreds of thousands fled Russia to avoid being sent to combat. The shortage of military personnel has been widely cited as a key reason behind the success of Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region launched Aug. 6. The Kremlin has sought to avoid the redeployment of troops from eastern Ukraine and relied on reinforcements from other areas to stem the Ukrainian incursion. The Russian Defense Ministry on Monday reported reclaiming control of two more villages in the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-putin-orders-military-to-boost-troop-numbers-by-180000-to-1-5-million-as-ukraine-fighting-continues/	2024-09-16T05:47:49-07:00	
2 people die in Ukraine's Odesa after Moscow and Kyiv exchange dr...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Two people died in a missile attack on the Ukrainian Black Sea port city of Odesa, local officials said, as Moscow and Kyiv exchanged drone and missile attacks. The Ukrainian air force said Sunday it shot down 10 of the 14 drones and one of the three missiles Russia launched overnight. Oleh Kiper, Odesa's regional governor, said the two who died in the suburbs of Odesa on Saturday night were a married couple, and that another person was wounded in the attack. At least 41 people were wounded Sunday afternoon when a Russian aerial bomb struck a multistory residential building in Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said, adding that the guided bomb hit the 10th floor of the building, with the fire spreading across four stories. Twelve other buildings were also damaged, he said. Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry said that it downed 29 Ukrainian drones overnight into Sunday over western and southwestern regions, with no damage caused by the falling debris. It also said another Ukrainian drone was shot down Sunday morning over the western Ryazan region. While Ukraine and Russia regularly launch overnight drone raids on each other’s territory, Ukrainian officials generally don't confirm or deny attacks within Russia’s borders. The latest attacks came after Ukraine made a new call Saturday on the West to allow it to use the long-range missiles they have provided to strike targets deep inside Russia, as Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. So far, the U.S. has allowed Kyiv to use American-provided weapons only in a limited area inside Russia’s border with Ukraine. Kyiv officials argue the weapons are vital to weaken Russia’s ability to strike Ukraine and force it to move its strike capabilities further from the border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took to social media on Sunday to again appeal for a shift in the West's policy on the use of long-range weapons, noting that Russia had launched 'around 30 missiles of various types, more than 800 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 300 strike drones against Ukraine' this week. 'Ukraine needs strong support from our partners to defend lives against Russian terror — air defense, long-range capabilities, support for our warriors. Everything that will help force Russia to end this war,' Zelenskyy posted on X. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-two-people-die-in-ukraines-odesa-after-moscow-and-kyiv-exchange-drone-and-missile-attacks/	2024-09-15T09:59:08-07:00	
Ukraine renews calls on the West to approve long-range strikes on...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine made a new call Saturday on the West to allow it to strike deeper into Russia after a meeting between U.S. and British leaders a day earlier produced no visible shift in their policy on the use of long-range weapons. The renewed appeal came as Kyiv said Russia launched more drone and artillery attacks into Ukraine overnight. 'Russian terror begins at weapons depots, airfields and military bases inside the Russian Federation,' Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak said Saturday. 'Permission to strike deep into Russia will speed up the solution.' Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called on allies to greenlight the use of Western-provided long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory. So far, the U.S. has allowed Kyiv to use American-provided weapons only in a limited area inside Russia’s border with Ukraine. Discussions on allowing long-range strikes were believed to be on the table when U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met in Washington on Friday but no decision was announced immediately. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pressing the U.S. and other allies to allow his forces to use Western weapons to target air bases and launch sites farther afield as Russia has stepped up assaults on Ukraine’s electricity grid and utilities before winter. He did not directly comment on the meeting Saturday morning, but said that more than 70 Russian drones had been launched into Ukraine overnight. The Ukrainian air force later said that 76 Russian drones had been sighted, of which 72 were shot down. 'We need to boost our air defense and long-range capabilities to protect our people,' Zelenskyy wrote on social media. 'We are working on this with all of Ukraine’s partners.' Other overnight attacks saw one person killed by Russian artillery fire as energy infrastructure was targeted in Ukraine’s Sumy region. A 54-year-old driver was killed and seven more people were hospitalized, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said. Another three people died Saturday in a Russian strike on an agricultural enterprise in the front-line town of Huliaipole in the Zaporizhzhia region, Gov. Ivan Fedorov said. Moscow warns Western nations Meanwhile, officials in Moscow have continued to make public statements warning that long-range strikes would provoke further escalation between Russia and the West. The remarks are in line with the narrative the Kremlin has promoted since early in the war, accusing NATO countries of de-facto participation in the conflict and threatening a response. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told state news agency Tass on Saturday that the U.S. and British governments were pushing the conflict, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, toward 'poorly controlled escalation.' Biden on Friday brushed off similar comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said on Thursday that allowing long-range strikes 'would mean that NATO countries, the United States and European countries, are at war with Russia.' Asked what he thought about Putin’s threat, Biden answered, 'I don’t think much about Vladimir Putin.' POWs exchanged Russian and Ukrainian officials also announced on Saturday a prisoner swap brokered by the United Arab Emirates. It included 206 prisoners on both sides, including Russians captured in Ukraine’s incursion in the Kursk region. The swap is the eighth of its kind since the beginning of 2024, and puts the total number of POWs exchanged at 1,994. Previous exchanges were also brokered by the UAE. Both sides released images of soldiers traveling to meet friends and family, with Zelenskyy commenting, 'Our people are home.' Elsewhere, Russia’s Defense Ministry said that 19 Ukrainian drones had been shot down over the country’s Kursk and Belgorod regions. A woman also died Saturday after a Ukrainian shell hit her home in the border village of Bezlyudovka, Belgorod regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraine-renews-calls-on-the-west-to-approve-long-range-strikes-on-russian-territory/	2024-09-14T09:57:35-07:00	
Biden meets with British leader and brushes off Putin's threats a...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden brushed off a threat from Russian leader Vladimir Putin about war against the West if Ukraine’s allies allow it to use weapons deeper inside Russia. It's a shift that Kyiv has pleaded for, but no decision was immediately announced following a meeting Friday between Biden and Britain’s prime minister. Ukraine and many of its supporters in the U.S. and Europe want Biden to lift restrictions on Western-provided long-range weapons, and there are signs Biden might shift the administration's policy. The U.S., concerned about any step that could lead Russia to escalate the conflict, has moved cautiously before granting a series of earlier requests from Ukraine for specific arms, including advanced tanks, missiles and rocket systems, and F-16 fighter jets. Russian officials have issued similar threats before many of those past decisions. Ukraine was a key topic for Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer after this week’s visit to Kyiv by their top diplomats, who came under fresh pressure to loosen weapons restrictions. So far, the U.S. has allowed Ukraine to use American-provided weapons only in a limited area inside Russia’s border with Ukraine. Two U.S. officials familiar with discussions said they believed Starmer was seeking Biden’s approval to allow Ukraine to use British Storm Shadow missiles for expanded strikes in Russia. Biden's approval may be needed because Storm Shadow components are made in the U.S. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to share the status of private conversations, said they believed Biden would be amenable. Starmer said talks would continue when global leaders convene for the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering this month. 'This was a really important invitation from the president to have this level of discussion about those critical issues,'' he told reporters after the White House meeting. He added, 'Ukraine has a right to self-defense, and we’ve stood united.' Putin said a day earlier that allowing long-range strikes 'would mean that NATO countries, the United States and European countries, are at war with Russia.' His remarks were in line with the narrative the Kremlin has promoted since early in the war, accusing NATO countries of de-facto participation in the conflict and threatening a response. Speaking to journalists before the private talks with Starmer, Biden said he wanted to make 'clear that Putin will not prevail in this war.' Asked what he thought about Putin’s threat, Biden answered, 'I don’t think much about Vladimir Putin.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pressing the U.S. and other allies to allow his forces to use Western weapons to target Russian air bases and launch sites far from the border as Russia has stepped up assaults on Ukraine’s electricity grid and utilities before winter. 'The war must become more difficult for Russia — that is the only way to make them realize it must end,' he posted Friday on social media. Zelenskyy's appeal has garnered support in U.S. and European security and diplomatic circles, including from some former U.S. generals and diplomats, lawmakers and security analysts. They argue that Russia's previous threats of escalation against the West have proven hollow and that the U.S. restrictions on weapons are making it impossible for Ukraine to gain the battlefield momentum it needs. Even a few Ukrainian strikes with heavier weapons on military targets deeper into Russia would put more strain on Russian logistics, troops and other resources, said George Barros, a security analyst for the Institute for the Study of War. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stressed Friday that decisions on what military support to provide Ukraine were complex, saying, 'There is no silver bullet when it comes to things like this.' He noted last week that Ukraine has already been able to strike inside Russia with its own internally produced systems, including drones. Zelenskyy wants more long-range weaponry from Washington, including the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, for strikes in Russia. Lt. Col. Charlie Dietz, a Pentagon spokesperson, said ATACMS would not be the answer to the main threat Ukraine faces from long-range Russian glide bombs, which are being fired from more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) away, beyond the reach of ATACMS. American officials also do not believe they have enough of the weapon systems available to provide Ukraine with the number to make a substantive difference on the ground, a U.S. official said. Biden, however, has hinted that a change could be afoot. In an exchange with reporters this week about whether he was ready to ease weapons restrictions on Ukraine, he responded, 'We’re working that out now.' Some American supporters of Ukraine have criticized the Biden administration for telegraphing earlier decisions on beefing up weapons to Kyiv well in advance, saying the U.S. was giving Russia ample time to update its tactics accordingly. Biden and Starmer, meeting for the second time since his center-left government was elected in July, also were set to compare notes on languishing efforts to get a cease-fire deal in Gaza, mutual concerns in the Indo-Pacific and other issues. Russia accused six British diplomats of spying Friday and said it would expel them. Starmer’s government called the accusation baseless and linked it to Britain’s expulsion of Moscow’s defense attache in London over spying allegations in May. The White House also has tried in recent days to put a greater emphasis on the nexus between the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East that was sparked after Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza attacked Israel on Oct. 7. The Biden administration said this week that Iran recently delivered short-range ballistic weapons to Russia to use against Ukraine, a transfer that White House officials worry will allow Russia to use more of its arsenal for targets far beyond the Ukrainian front line while employing Iranian warheads for closer-range targets. 'It certainly speaks to the manner in which this partnership threatens European security and how it illustrates Iran’s destabilizing influence now reaches well beyond the Middle East,' White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London, Dasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, and Zeke Miller and Tara Copp in Washington contributed.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-the-us-and-british-leaders-will-talk-about-ukraines-push-to-ease-weapons-restrictions/	2024-09-13T16:12:20-07:00
