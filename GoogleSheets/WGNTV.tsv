Israeli strikes across Gaza hit multiple homes, killing at least ...	DEIR-AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes killed at least 85 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Thursday, according to local health officials. Hours later, Hamas fired three rockets at Israel without causing casualties, in the first such attack since Israel ended their ceasefire with a surprise bombardment of Gaza on Tuesday. The Israeli military meanwhile restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war. It warned residents against using the main highway to enter or leave the north and said only passage to the south would be allowed on the coastal road. It also announced an additional ground operation in northern Gaza near the already largely destroyed town of Beit Lahiya, where strikes have killed dozens over the past 24 hours. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January. Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. Israel blamed the renewed fighting on Hamas because the militant group rejected a new proposal that departed from their signed agreement. The Trump administration, which took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire, has voiced full support for Israel. More than 400 Palestinians were killed on Tuesday alone, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The military said three rockets were fired out of Gaza on Thursday, with one intercepted and two falling in open areas. Hamas claimed the attack and said it had targeted Tel Aviv. Earlier, the military said it intercepted a missile launched by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels overnight before it reached Israeli airspace, as air raid sirens and exploding interceptors were heard in Jerusalem. No injuries were reported. It was the second such attack since the United States began a new campaign of airstrikes against the rebels earlier this week. One of the strikes on Gaza early Thursday hit the Abu Daqa family’s home in Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel. It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza. The strike killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead. Those killed included a father and his seven children, as well as the parents and brother of a month-old baby who survived along with her grandparents. 'Another tough night,' said Hani Awad, who was helping rescuers search for more survivors in the rubble. 'The house collapsed over the people’s heads.' The Israeli military said it had struck dozens of militant targets across Gaza, hitting dozens of fighters as well as military structures. Israeli ground troops advance On Wednesday, Israeli ground troops advanced in Gaza for the first time since the ceasefire took hold in January, seizing part of a corridor separating the northern third of the territory from the south. The announcement about passage to the south indicated troops will soon retake full control over what is known as the Netzarim corridor, stretching from the border to the Mediterranean Sea. Israel, which has also cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians, has vowed to intensify its operations until Hamas releases the 59 hostages it holds — 35 of whom are believed dead — and gives up control of the territory. The Trump administration, which took credit for brokering the ceasefire, says it fully supports Israel. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as called for in the ceasefire agreement they reached in January after more than a year of mediation by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. Hamas, which does not accept Israel's existence, says it is willing to hand over power to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority or a committee of political independents but will not lay down its arms until Israel ends its decades-long occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state. A ‘bloody night’ for hard-hit northern town Gaza’s Health Ministry said the overnight strikes killed at least 85 people, mostly women and children. Zaher al-Waheidi, the official in charge of records for the ministry, said a total of 592 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Tuesday. The Indonesian Hospital said it had received 19 bodies after strikes in Beit Lahiya, near the border. 'It was a bloody night for the people of Beit Lahiya,' said Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry’s emergency service in northern Gaza, adding that rescuers were still searching the rubble from homes that were hit. 'The situation is catastrophic.' Beit Lahiya was heavily destroyed and largely depopulated during the first phase of the war before January’s ceasefire. On Wednesday, an Israeli strike on a gathering of mourners killed 17 people there, according to health officials. No end in sight to the 17-month war The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more. Israel's retaliatory offensive, among the deadliest and most destructive in recent history, has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war at its height displaced around 90% of Gaza's population and has caused vast destruction across the territory. Hundreds of thousands of people returned to their homes during the ceasefire, but many found only fields of rubble and the bombed-out shells of buildings. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israeli-strikes-on-gaza-hit-houses-and-kill-dozens/	2025-03-20T04:46:15-07:00	
Military leaders to discuss Ukraine peacekeeping force as partial...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Senior officers from countries across Europe and beyond will meet Thursday at a military headquarters on the outskirts of London to flesh out plans for an international peacekeeping force for Ukraine as details of a partial ceasefire are worked out. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the 'coalition of the willing' plan, led by Britain and France, is moving into an 'operational phase.' But it’s unclear how many countries are willing to send troops, or whether there will be any ceasefire to protect. Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after President Donald Trump spoke with the countries’ leaders this week, though it remained to be seen when it might take effect and what possible targets would be off limits to attack. The tentative deal to partially rein in the three-year war came after Russian President Vladimir Putin rebuffed Trump’s push for a full 30-day ceasefire. The difficulty in getting the combatants to agree not to target one another’s energy infrastructure highlights the challenges Trump will face in trying to fulfill his campaign pledge to quickly end to the war. Despite the negotiations, hundreds of drone attacks were launched overnight by both sides, injuring several people and damaging buildings. Ukraine said Russia had launched 171 long-range drones and it shot down 75 while another 63 decoy drones disappeared from radar after likely being jammed. Russia said it destroyed 132 Ukrainian drones in six Russian regions and the annexed Crimea. Kropyvnytskyi, a city in central Ukraine, faced its biggest attack of the war as about four dozen drones injured 14 people, including a couple with serious burns, and damaged houses and apartments. 'In a cruel twist, enemy drones hit Myru Street (‘Peace Street’ in English),' Andrii Raikovych, head of the regional administration, said. More than 50 drones were intercepted in Russia's Saratov region — the largest attack of its kind in the area — shattering windows in a hospital and damaging two kindergartens, a school and about 30 homes, Gov. Roman Busargin said. The attacks were focused on Engels, an industrial city near Russia's main base for nuclear-capable strategic bombers. If peace comes to Ukraine, the number of troops that would help enforce it is vague. Officials have cited figures of between 10,000 and 30,000 troops. Only Britain and France have said they are willing to send troops, though countries including Australia, Canada, France and Finland say they are open to being involved in some way. Around 30 leaders were involved in a video meeting on Saturday including Macron, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, leaders from Australia, Canada and New Zealand and officials from NATO and the European Union. Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil. And Trump has given no sign the U.S. will guarantee reserve firepower in case of any breaches of a truce. Starmer says the plan won’t work without that U.S. 'backstop.' In addition to the meeting in England, EU leaders in Brussels planned to discuss Ukraine’s security needs with Zelenskyy during a meeting about ramping up defense spending after the Trump administration signaled Europe must take care of its own security. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it’s 'central' that Ukraine must remain an independent democratic nation, that it can continue its journey toward EU membership and 'that it also has a strong army of its own after a peace agreement.' The German parliament’s budget committee is expected to decide Friday to clear up to 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in extra funding for German military aid to Ukraine this year. That comes after parliament voted to loosen Germany’s debt rules for military and security spending. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said European plans for raising military spending conflicted with Putin and Trump's efforts to reach a peace deal. 'Europe has engaged in militarization and has turned into a party of war,' Peskov said. ___ Lawless reported from London.

Middle East latest: Gaza strike kills an international UN staffer...	The United Nations says an international staffer was killed and five others wounded in a strike in the Gaza Strip. Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the U.N. Office for Project Services, said the cause of Wednesday’s blast remains unclear but that an explosive ordnance was 'dropped or fired.' He did not provide the nationalities of those killed and wounded. The attack came a day after Israel carried out a wave of heavy strikes that killed over 400 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, shattering the ceasefire with Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said the wave of strikes Tuesday was 'only the beginning' and that Israel would press ahead until it achieves all of its war aims — destroying Hamas and freeing all hostages held by the militant group since its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel ignited the fighting. Gaza’s Health Ministry said at least 436 people, including 183 children and 94 women, have been killed since Israel launched airstrikes Tuesday. Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the ministry’s records department, described it as the deadliest day in Gaza since the start of the war. Its records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Here's the latest: Lebanese army deploys in northeast border town after dayslong clashes The clashes along the Lebanon-Syria border, where smuggling is widespread, was the worst fighting there since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government in December. The fighting happened after Syria’s interim government accused militants from Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group of crossing into Syria on Saturday, abducting and killing three soldiers. Hezbollah denied involvement and some other reports pointed to local clans in the border region that are not directly affiliated with Hezbollah but have been involved in cross-border smuggling. The Lebanese government said the three Syrians killed were smugglers. The Lebanese Health Ministry said seven people in Lebanon were killed in the fighting, and 52 others were wounded. Four Syrian journalists embedded with the Syrian army were lightly wounded after an artillery shell fired from the Lebanese side of the border hit their position. UN says an international staffer was killed and 5 others wounded by a strike in the Gaza Strip An international United Nations staffer was killed and five others were wounded in a strike on a U.N. guesthouse in the Gaza Strip, a U.N. official said Wednesday. Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the U.N. Office for Project Services, declined to say who carried out the strike but said the explosive ordnance was 'dropped or fired' and the blast was not accidental or related to demining activity. UNOPS operates the mechanism tracking aid trucks into Gaza, does demining and helps bring fuel in. He did not provide the nationalities of those killed and wounded. The Israeli military, which has carried out a heavy wave of airstrikes since early Tuesday, denied earlier reports that it had targeted the U.N. compound. But Moreira da Silva said strikes had hit near the compound on Monday and struck it directly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, when the staffer was killed. He said the agency had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike and confirmed that it was aware of the facility’s location. 'Israel knew this was a U.N. premise, that people were living, staying and working there,' he said. At least 436 dead in airstrikes, Gaza Health Ministry says The Gaza Health Ministry says at least 436 people, mostly women and children, have been killed since Israel launched a wave of heavy airstrikes early Tuesday. The ministry said another 678 people have been wounded in the strikes, which continued into Wednesday but at a lower intensity. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas. The ministry said at least 183 children and 94 women have been killed since the strikes began early Tuesday. Its records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israeli military denies striking UN compound in Gaza The Israeli military has denied striking a United Nations compound in central Gaza. Gaza’s Health Ministry said an Israeli strike on a U.N. building in Gaza on Wednesday wounded five international staffers. There was no immediate comment from U.N. officials. 'Contrary to reports, the (Israeli military) did not strike a U.N. compound' in the central city of Deir al-Balah, the army said in a statement. Macron calls Israeli strikes in Gaza ‘tragic step backwards’ French President Emmanuel Macron said Israel’s airstrikes are 'tragic step backwards' for the Palestinian people and for Gaza, and for Israeli hostages and their families. Macron, speaking alongside Jordan’s King Abdullah II on a visit to France, called for an immediate end to hostilities and resumption of negotiations including with the U.S. administration toward a permanent ceasefire and the release of all hostages. The two leaders were also expected to discuss the need to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza and restoring access to water and electricity in the Palestinian territory, Macron’s office said. Malaysia will accept 15 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons Malaysia said it will accept 15 Palestinians who were released from Israeli jails and exiled as part of the January ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan said in remarks published Wednesday in The Star newspaper that the move was a small contribution from Malaysia, a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, to ensure peace in Gaza. Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil told local media that security agencies would strictly monitor the Palestinians’ movement once they arrive. A UN peacekeeper wounded in a mine explosion in southern Lebanon Lebanon’s state news agency said a U.N. peacekeeper was wounded when a mine exploded in the country's south. National News Agency did not give further details about the blast between the villages of Zibqine and Yater, near the border with Israel. Andrea Tenenti, a spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL, confirmed that a peacekeeper was wounded during an operational activity and was taken to a Beirut hospital for surgery. An Israeli strike wounds 5 UN workers, Gaza medics say The Gaza Health Ministry says an Israeli strike has wounded five international U.N. workers. It says they were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Hospital in central Gaza after their headquarters was struck on Wednesday. It was not clear which U.N. body they were affiliated with. There was no immediate comment from U.N. spokespeople or the Israeli military. Israel launched a wave of airstrike across Gaza on Tuesday, killing over 400 Palestinians, according to the ministry. Israel says it targeted Hamas militants. Thousands in Jerusalem protest the resumption of war Thousands of Israelis marched in Jerusalem on Wednesday to protest a resumption of the war in the Gaza Strip, fearing it could further endanger some two dozen hostages held by Hamas. A sea of Israeli flags could be seen outside the Israeli parliament a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shattered a fragile ceasefire by launching heavy strikes on Gaza. Families and supporters of the hostages fear renewed fighting could be a death sentence for their loved ones in captivity. The hostages 'are waiting for us to take them out and to bring them home, but war will not do it. Only negotiations will do it,' protester Alon Shirizly said. Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, including 24 who are believed to be alive. The demonstrators are also protesting Netanyahu’s plan to fire the head of Israel’s internal security agency, the latest in a series of moves that his critics view as an assault on Israeli democracy. Ben-Gvir returns to Netanyahu's government A government statement on Wednesday said Itamar Ben-Gvir, leader of the ultranationalist Jewish Power party, regained his portfolio as national security minister. He had left the coalition in January to protest the ceasefire with Hamas. His return strengthens Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition ahead of a crucial budget vote this month and improves its chances of surviving until the next scheduled elections in October 2026. Ben-Gvir supports the full resumption of the war with the aim of annihilating Hamas, depopulating Gaza through what he refers to as the voluntary migration of Palestinians and rebuilding Jewish settlements there.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-far-right-party-leader-returns-to-netanyahus-cabinet-after-strikes-pummel-gaza/	2025-03-19T06:45:16-07:00	
Zelenskyy says Putin’s vow not to hit Ukraine's energy infrastruc...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that a vow by Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin not to attack energy infrastructure was 'very much at odds with reality' following an overnight barrage of drone strikes across the country. Zelenskyy said that he would speak with U.S. President Donald Trump later in the day and expected to hear more about the American leader's phone call with Putin about a ceasefire and to discuss the next steps to be taken. 'Even last night, after Putin’s conversation with ... Trump, when Putin said that he was allegedly giving orders to stop strikes on Ukrainian energy, there were 150 drones launched overnight, including on energy facilities,' Zelenskyy said at a news conference in Helsinki with Finnish President Alexander Stubb. Kremlin says Ukraine not keeping its end of the bargain Russia responded by saying it had halted its targeting of Ukraine's energy facilities and accused Kyiv of attacking equipment near one of its pipelines. 'Unfortunately, we see that for now there is no reciprocity on the part of the Kyiv regime,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Russian strikes on civilian areas followed Putin's refusal to back a full 30-day ceasefire during discussions with Trump. The White House described the call between Trump and Putin as the first step in a 'movement to peace' that Washington hopes will include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and eventually a full and lasting end to the fighting. But there was no indication that Putin backed away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv. Russia holding ceasefire proposal ‘hostage’ The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said that Putin’s demands during the call with Trump would amount to 'Ukrainian capitulation.' 'Putin is attempting to hold the temporary ceasefire proposal hostage in order to extract preemptive concessions ahead of formal negotiations to end the war,' the ISW said in an analysis of readouts from the calls. Stubb called the discussions between Putin and Trump a step in the right direction, but Finland's president said that Russia needs to end its aggression. 'There are only two ways to respond to the proposal of the president of the United States: it’s a yes or a no — no buts, no conditions,' Stubb said. 'Ukraine accepted a ceasefire without any forms of conditions. If Russia refuses to agree, we need to increase our efforts to strengthen Ukraine and ratchet up pressure on Russia to convince them to come to the negotiating table.' Ukraine and Russia trade accusations on attacks Shortly after the lengthy phone call between Trump and Putin on Tuesday, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter. Despite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including two hospitals, a railway and more than 20 houses, Zelenskyy said. Russian drones were reported over Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions. The Russian Defense Ministry said that the military complied with Putin’s order to halt energy infrastructure strikes and downed seven drones its forces fired before the order at power facilities related to the military-industrial complex in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region. Moscow accused Ukraine of targeting its energy facility in the Krasnodar region bordering the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, several hours after the Putin and Trump talks. The ministry said that three drones targeted oil transfer equipment that feeds the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, causing a fire and leading one oil tank to lose pressure. 'It is absolutely clear that we are talking about yet another provocation deliberately concocted by the Kyiv regime, aimed at derailing the peace initiatives of the U.S. president,' the ministry said. Russia said that its air defenses intercepted 57 Ukrainian drones over the Azov Sea and several Russian regions — the border provinces of Kursk and Bryansk and the nearby regions of Oryol and Tula. Zelenskyy said that 'words of a ceasefire' weren't enough. 'If the Russians don’t hit our facilities, we definitely won’t hit theirs,' Zelenskyy said. Ukraine's red line Zelenskyy rejected Putin’s key condition that Western allies stop providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine. He said that doing so would endanger lives if citizens were blind to incoming air raids, and lead to the continuation of the war. 'I don’t think anybody should make any concessions in terms of helping Ukraine, but rather, assistance to Ukraine should be increased,' Zelenskyy said. 'This will be a signal that Ukraine is ready for any surprises from the Russians.' Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that it was 'completely unsurprising' that Putin rejected the ceasefire, adding that it’s 'imprudent for him to tell President Trump that directly, since Trump has made ending the war a very, very high priority.' 'What we have now, in effect, is a competition or rivalry between Kyiv and Moscow to persuade Trump that it’s the other side that is responsible for preventing Trump from achieving his goal of ending the war,' Gould-Davies said. Zelenskyy said that one of the most difficult issues in future negotiations would be the issue of territorial concessions. 'For us, the red line is the recognition of the Ukrainian temporarily occupied territories as Russian,' he said. 'We will not go for it.' ___ Yehor Konovalov in Kyiv, Dasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, Geir Moulson in Berlin, and Brian Melley in London, contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russian-drones-strike-ukraine-after-putins-ceasefire-talks-with-trump/	2025-03-19T06:42:23-07:00	
Trump and Putin agree to an immediate ceasefire for energy and in...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a lengthy call Tuesday to an immediate pause in strikes against energy and infrastructure targets in the Ukraine war, but the Russian leader stopped short of backing a broader 30-day pause in fighting that the U.S. administration is pressing for. The White House described it as the first step in a 'movement to peace' it hopes will eventually include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and a full and lasting end to the fighting. The White House added negotiations would 'begin immediately' in the Middle East on those steps. Shortly after the call between Trump and Putin, air raid alerts sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions in the city. Local officials urged people to seek shelter. It was not immediately clear whether Ukraine is on board with the limited ceasefire plan. Ukrainian officials had proposed a ceasefire covering the Black Sea and long-range missile strikes and the release of prisoners at their meeting with the U.S delegation in Saudi Arabia earlier this month. 'We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine,' Trump posted on social media following his call. The Kremlin said Putin welcomed Trump's calls for the maritime ceasefire and 'agreed to begin negotiations to further work out specific details of such an agreement.' Putin also told Trump that Russia and Ukraine are set to exchange 175 prisoners of war each on Wednesday, and Russia will also hand over to Ukraine 23 badly wounded soldiers, the Kremlin said. Putin also called on Trump to end foreign military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine as the U.S. looks to bring an end to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to the Kremlin. The move comes as the White House pushes for Russia to sign off on its 30-day ceasefire proposal aimed at ending the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian officials last week agreed to the 30-day ceasefire proposal during talks in Saudi Arabia led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, remains skeptical that Putin is ready for peace as Russian forces continue to pound Ukraine. The engagement is just the latest turn in dramatically shifting U.S.-Russia relations as Trump made quickly ending the conflict a top priority — even at the expense of straining ties with longtime American allies who want Putin to pay a price for the invasion. In preparation for the Trump-Putin call, White House special envoy Steve Witkoff met last week with Putin in Moscow to discuss the proposal. Rubio had persuaded senior Ukrainian officials during talks in Saudi Arabia to agree to the ceasefire framework. Putin last week said he agreed in principle with the U.S. proposal, but emphasized that Russia would seek guarantees that Ukraine would not use a break in hostilities to rearm and continue mobilization. The Russian president has also demanded that Ukraine renounce joining the NATO military alliance, sharply cut its army, and protect Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow’s orbit. The U.S. president said this week that Washington and Moscow have already begun discussing 'dividing up certain assets' between Ukraine and Russia as part of a deal to end the conflict. Trump, who during his campaign pledged to end the war quickly, has at moments boasted of his relationship with Putin and blamed Ukraine for Russia’s unprovoked invasion, all while accusing Zelenskyy of unnecessarily prolonging the biggest land war in Europe since World War II. Trump had said before the call that control of land and power plants would be part of the conversation, which came on the anniversary of Russia annexing Ukraine's Crimean peninsula 11 years ago. That bold land grab by Russia set the stage for Russia to invade its neighbor in 2022. Witkoff suggested that U.S. and Russian officials have discussed the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — Europe's largest — in southern Ukraine. The plant has been caught in the crossfire since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022 and seized the facility shortly after. The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly expressed alarm about it, fueling fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe. The plant is a significant asset, producing nearly a quarter of Ukraine’s electricity in the year before the war. After a disastrous Feb. 28 White House meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump temporarily cut off some military intelligence-sharing and aid to Ukraine. It was restored after the Ukrainians last week signed off on the Trump administration's 30-day ceasefire proposal. Zelenskyy in his nightly video address on Monday made clear he remains doubtful that Putin is ready for peace. 'Now, almost a week later, it’s clear to everyone in the world — even to those who refused to acknowledge the truth for the past three years — that it is Putin who continues to drag out this war,' Zelenskyy said. In his dealings with Zelenskyy and Putin, Trump has frequently focused on who has the leverage. Putin has 'the cards' and Zelenskyy does not, Trump has said repeatedly. Trump, who has long shown admiration for Putin, has also made clear he'd like to see the U.S.-Russia relationship return to a more normal footing. The president during his recent contentious meeting with Zelenskyy grumbled that 'Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,' a reference to the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in which he beat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump on Monday again underscored his view that Ukraine is not in a strong negotiating position. He said Russian forces have 'surrounded' Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk region — amplifying an assertion made by Russian officials that's been disputed by Zelenskyy. Ukraine’s army stunned Russia in August last year by attacking across the border and taking control of an estimated 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of land. But Ukraine’s forces are now in retreat and it has all but lost a valuable bargaining chip, as momentum builds for a ceasefire with Russia. Zelenskyy has acknowledged that the Ukrainians are on their back foot while disputing Russian claims that his troops are encircled in Kursk. Trump suggested that he's taken unspecified action that has kept Russia from slaughtering Ukrainian troops in Kursk. 'They’re surrounded by Russian soldiers, and I believe if it wasn’t for me they wouldn’t be here any longer,' Trump said. The White House said the leaders also discussed the situation in the Middle East and agreed 'Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel.' U.S. officials have previously said that Iran has provided Russia with short-range ballistic missiles and attack drones for the war in Ukraine. The U.S. has also said that Iran has assisted the Kremlin with building a drone-manufacturing factory. ___ Isachenkov reported from Moscow.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-trump-and-putin-to-hold-call-on-ceasefire-but-zelenskyy-is-skeptical-that-russia-is-ready-for-peace/	2025-03-18T12:09:36-07:00	
Families of hostages in Gaza are terrified they won't return afte...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — When a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began two months ago, Herut Nimrodi knew it would take time before her son was released from captivity in Gaza. The 20-year-old soldier was meant to be part of the second phase of the deal winding down the war. But with Israel's surprise bombardment of Gaza, she fears he might not come home at all. 'I really wanted to believe that there is still a chance to reach a second stage without renewing this war. But it feels like my building of hope has collapsed, and I have no idea what to do next,' Nimrodi said Tuesday. Nearly 60 families have relatives still held in Gaza. About two dozen hostages are believed to be alive. During the ceasefire's first phase, which began in January, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. But since that phase ended early this month, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward. Israel's renewed airstrikes threaten to end the fragile deal. Nimrodi's son, Tamir, was abducted from his army base when Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage. She's had no sign of life. He hasn't been declared dead by Israel. 'It’s so sad that this is the only solution that they could find,' she said, lamenting the government's decision. The strikes early Tuesday killed more than 400 people and shattered a relative calm — along with hopes of ending the war that has killed over 48,000 Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he ordered the airstrikes because of lack of progress in talks to extend the ceasefire. Officials called the operation open-ended. The return to fighting could deepen the painful debate in Israel over the fate of the remaining hostages. Netanyahu and his hardline governing partners believe renewing the war will put pressure on Hamas to free them and move Israel closer to its goal of destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities. But most hostage families, and large parts of the Israeli public, believe such goals are unrealistic. They say time is running out, particularly after the recent releases of emaciated-looking hostages who later described harsh conditions in captivity. Hamas accused Netanyahu of upending the ceasefire and exposing the hostages 'to an unknown fate.' Families of hostages called on supporters to protest with them outside Israel’s parliament Tuesday. Some families who already know their relatives in Gaza are dead called the government’s decision unacceptable. 'This is not only a disaster in every way, shape or form on how the hostages keep suffering, being chained to walls, starved, abused, but also the death toll that keeps rising on the Gazan side,' Udi Goren said. His cousin Tal Haimi was killed on Oct. 7 and his body was taken into Gaza. Goren said the international community must pressure Hamas, Israel and the mediators — the United States, Egypt and Qatar — to end the war. 'Returning to fighting? Did you listen to a word of what we, the returnees released in the last deal, have been saying to you?' former hostage Omer Wenkert wrote on Instagram. Romi Gonen, among the first hostages to be freed in the ceasefire's first phase, said she would never forget what it felt like in captivity to hear the bombs after previous ceasefire talks collapsed and realize she wouldn't be freed any time soon. 'I beg you, the people of Israel, we must continue to fight for them,' she said on Instagram. Sylvia Cunio, whose two sons are held hostage, accused Israel's leaders of not having a heart. 'It isn’t right to continue the fighting. I want my children back home already. If he wants to kill me, the prime minister, let him do that already because I won’t get through this,' she said on local radio. Nimrodi said she’s worried the airstrikes might not only harm her son and the other hostages but also make their living conditions worse. The last time she saw Tamir, he was a funny teenager who rode horses and loved learning about geology and astronomy, she said. The two had a similar humor and used to talk about everything. While she's terrified of what's to come, she said she won't stop fighting to see him again. 'Please, keep strong, survive,' she said, addressing him.

Putin backs limited 30-day ceasefire in call with Trump	Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to temporarily halt strikes on Ukrainian energy and infrastructure in a call with President Trump on Tuesday, but rejected a broader ceasefire proposed by the U.S. It's unclear if Ukraine will agree to the more limited ceasefire, after agreeing to an unconditional 30-day cessation in the war during talks with U.S. officials last week. Trump and Putin spoke for nearly three hours on Tuesday amid the U.S. push to end the war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year. 'The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace,' the White House said in a readout. 'These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.' Trump has previously said he plans to visit Saudi Arabia to meet with Putin to further discuss the ceasefire, but the precise timing of that meeting is yet to be determined by the White House. Russian state media reported that Trump proposed a 30-day pause on attacks on energy infrastructure, and that Putin 'responded positively.' Putin immediately gave the Russian military the corresponding command, the Kremlin said in a readout of the call, and committed to talks about halting fighting in the Black Sea. But among Putin’s demands in the call included 'the need to stop' Ukraine from mobilizing troops and rearming its army. The Russian leader also said a resolution of the war should include 'complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv.' Putin told Trump that a prisoner exchange with Ukraine will be carried out Wednesday, with the transfer of 175 people on each side. The Kremlin said Russia will transfer 23 seriously wounded Ukrainian soldiers being treated in Russian hospitals. Trump and Putin also notably spoke 'broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts,' the White House said. And they discussed efforts to stop the spread of 'strategic weapons'; Trump has previously spoken about a desire to end nuclear proliferation. The White House readout of the call made no mention about territorial concessions, which had been a key point of contention ahead of peace talks. Ukraine's backers have argued Kyiv should not have to relinquish its territory to Russia. Tuesday’s call came as the White House has intensified its efforts to stop the fighting in Ukraine. Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after amassing troops near the border. Russia in 2014 annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Putin had held back endorsing the U.S.-led ceasefire following meetings in Moscow late last week with Trump’s special envoy for Middle East affairs, Steve Witkoff. Ukraine accepted the terms of the ceasefire during high-stakes talks with Trump administration officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11.

Israeli strikes across Gaza kill more than 400 Palestinians and s...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, killing at least 400 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health officials. The surprise bombardment, the deadliest in Gaza since the start of the 17-month war, shattered a ceasefire in place since January. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the strikes after Hamas refused Israeli demands to change the ceasefire agreement. Officials said the operation was open-ended and was expected to expand. The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel's actions. The Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza, including much of the northern town of Beit Hanoun and other communities further south, and head toward the center of the territory, indicating that Israel could soon launch renewed ground operations. 'Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,' Netanyahu’s office said. The attack during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan could signal the full resumption of a war that has already killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised concerns about the fate of the roughly two dozen Israeli hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive. The renewal of the campaign against Hamas, which is supported by Iran, came as the U.S. and Israel stepped up attacks this week across the region. The U.S. launched deadly strikes against Iran-allied rebels in Yemen, while Israel has targeted Iran-backed militants in Lebanon and Syria. A senior Hamas official said Netanyahu’s decision to return to war amounts to a 'death sentence' for the remaining hostages. Izzat al-Risheq accused Netanyahu of launching the strikes to try and save his far-right governing coalition and called on mediators to 'reveal facts' on who broke the truce. Hamas said at least four senior officials were killed in Tuesday's strikes. There were no reports of any attacks by Hamas several hours after the bombardment, indicating it still hoped to restore the truce. The strikes came as Netanyahu comes under mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests planned over his handling of the hostage crisis and his decision to fire the head of Israel's internal security agency. His latest testimony in a long-running corruption trial was canceled after the strikes. The strikes appeared to give Netanyahu a political boost, with a far-right party that had bolted the government over the ceasefire announcing Tuesday that it was rejoining. The main group representing families of the captives accused the government of backing out of the ceasefire, saying it 'chose to give up on the hostages.' 'We are shocked, angry and terrified by the deliberate dismantling of the process to return our loved ones from the terrible captivity of Hamas,' the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. Wounded stream into Gaza hospitals A strike on a home in the southern city of Rafah killed 17 members of one family, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included five children, their parents, and another father and his three children. In the southern city of Khan Younis, Associated Press reporters saw explosions and plumes of smoke. Ambulances brought wounded people to Nasser Hospital, where patients lay on the floor, some screaming. A young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged. Many Palestinians said they had expected a return to all-out war when talks over the second phase of the ceasefire did not begin as scheduled in early February. The second phase was broadly outlined in the original agreement, but the details had been expected to be hammered out in those talks. Israel instead embraced an alternative proposal and cut off all shipments of food, fuel and other aid to the territory's 2 million Palestinians to try to pressure Hamas to accept it. 'Nobody wants to fight,' Palestinian resident Nidal Alzaanin told the AP by phone from Gaza City. 'Everyone is still suffering from the previous months,' he said. Gaza's Health Ministry said at least 404 people were killed in the strikes and more than 560 were wounded after earlier saying that 413 were dead and 660 wounded. Rescuers were still searching the rubble for dead and wounded as the strikes continued. Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the records department in the ministry, said at least 263 of those killed were women or children 18 and under. He described it as the deadliest day in Gaza since the start of the war. The war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s population. The Health Ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead have been women and children. The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals, with Israeli forces rescuing only eight and recovering dozens of bodies. Israel responded with one of the most destructive military offensives in recent memory. The ceasefire brought some relief to Gaza and allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to what remained of their homes. US backs Israel and blames Hamas The White House sought to blame Hamas for the renewed fighting. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the militant group 'could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war.' An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas' military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks. The official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks. Hamas militants and security forces quickly returned to the streets in recent weeks after the ceasefire went into effect. Talks on a second phase of the ceasefire had stalled The strikes came two months after a ceasefire was reached to pause the war. Over six weeks, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for more than 1,700 Palestinian prisoners as agreed in the first phase. But since that phase ended two weeks ago, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward with a second phase that was meant to free the 24 living hostages still in captivity and bring about an end to the war. Israel says Hamas also holds the remains of 35 captives. Hamas has demanded an end to the war and full withdrawal of Israeli troops in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages. Israel says it will not end the war until it destroys Hamas' governing and military capabilities and frees all hostages — two goals that could be incompatible. Now Israel has demanded Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to follow the original ceasefire deal reached by the two sides. Though Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military says approached its troops or entered unauthorized areas since the ceasefire began, the deal has largely held. Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate the next steps. A full resumption of the war would allow Netanyahu to avoid the tough trade-offs called for in the second phase of the agreement and the thorny question of who would govern Gaza. It would also shore up his coalition, which depends on far-right lawmakers who want to depopulate Gaza and rebuild Jewish settlements there. That was already in motion with the return of far-right Itamar Ben-Gvir and his party to Netanyahu’s government Tuesday. Netanyahu faces mounting criticism The released hostages, some of whom were emaciated, have repeatedly implored the government to press ahead with the ceasefire to return all remaining captives. Tens of thousands of Israelis have taken part in mass protests calling for a ceasefire and return of all hostages. Mass demonstrations are planned later Tuesday and Wednesday following Netanyahu's announcement this week that he wants to fire the head of Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency. Critics have lambasted the move as an attempt by Netanyahu to divert blame for his government's failures in the Oct. 7 attack and handling of the war. ___ Federman reported from Jerusalem and Magdy from Cairo.

Trump and Putin to hold call about Ukraine	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) - A phone call is set for Tuesday between Presidents Trump and Putin as the U.S. tries to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Trump administration officials have been meeting with both sides to lay the groundwork for this call, but Ukraine and its European allies worry this could all just be talk. 'We're going to have a very important call,' said Trump. President Donald Trump plans to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone Tuesday to try to get Russia to accept the 30-day ceasefire agreement Ukraine already supports. 'I've got to get the deal signed,' said Trump. President Trump would not say whether that could happen Tuesday, but the White House is optimistic. 'We've never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment,' said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy remains skeptical warning Putin is all talk when it comes to peace. 'Ukraine wants it. I know they want it. Everybody wants it,' said Trump. President Trump says he and Putin will discuss swaps of Ukrainian land and a nuclear power plant. 'It's a tough, imperfect, nuanced and complicated process,' said Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell. Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell says both sides will have to make concessions to end Russia's war. 'The release of hostages, when you're talking about potential ceasefire agreements, when you're talking about territory,' said Parnell. The White House did not rule out additional sanctions against Russia to pressure Putin to accept the terms of the ceasefire agreement.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/trump-and-putin-to-hold-call-about-ukraine/	2025-03-18T05:02:44-07:00	
Israel launches deadly wave of airstrikes across Gaza after cease...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel launched a wave of airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, saying it was striking dozens of Hamas targets in its heaviest assault in the territory since a ceasefire took effect in January. Palestinian officials reported at least 69 deaths. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he ordered the strikes because of a lack of progress in talks to extend the ceasefire. Officials said the operation was open-ended and was expected to expand. 'Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,' Netanyahu’s office said. The surprise attack shattered a period of relative calm during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and raised the prospect of a full return to fighting in a 17-month war that has killed over 48,000 Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised questions about the fate of the roughly two dozen Israeli hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive. In a statement, Hamas condemned what it called Israel's 'unprovoked escalation' and said it had put the fate of the hostages in jeopardy. There was no immediate U.S. reaction. But over the weekend, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been leading mediation efforts along with Egypt and Qatar, warned that Hamas must release living hostages immediately 'or pay a severe price.' An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas' military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks. The official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks. Hamas militants and security forces quickly returned to the streets in recent weeks after the ceasefire went into effect. Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, said the 'gates of hell will open in Gaza' if the hostages aren't released. 'We will not stop fighting until all of our hostages are home and we have achieved all of the war goals,' he said. Explosions could be heard throughout Gaza, and at least 69 people were killed in the morning airstrikes, according to four hospitals that received the bodies. The territory's civil defense agency said its crews were having a difficult time carrying out rescue efforts because various areas were being targeted simultaneously. Talks on a second phase of the ceasefire had stalled The strikes came two months after a ceasefire was reached to pause the war. Over six weeks, Hamas released roughly three dozen hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in a first phase of the ceasefire. But since that ceasefire ended two weeks ago, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward with a second phase aimed at releasing the nearly 60 remaining hostages and ending the war altogether. Hamas has demanded an end to the war and full withdrawal of Israeli troops in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages. Israel says it will not end the war until it destroys Hamas governing and military capabilities and frees all hostages. Netanyahu has repeatedly threatened to resume the war, and early this month cut off the entry of all food and aid deliveries into the besieged territory to put pressure on Hamas. 'This comes after Hamas repeatedly refused to release our hostages and rejected all offers it received from the U.S. presidential envoy, Steve Witkoff, and from the mediators,' Netanyahu's office said early Tuesday. Taher Nunu, a Hamas official, criticized the Israeli attacks. 'The international community faces a moral test: either it allows the return of the crimes committed by the occupation army or it enforces a commitment to ending the aggression and war against innocent people in Gaza,' he said. Gaza already was in a humanitarian crisis The war erupted with Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, cross-border attack, which killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a military offensive that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population. The territory's Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead have been women and children. The ceasefire had brought some relief to Gaza and allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to resume to what remained of their homes. But the territory is coping with vast destruction, with no immediate plans to rebuild. A resumption of the war threatens to reverse any progress made in recent weeks toward halting Gaza's humanitarian crisis. A renewed Israeli ground offensive could also be especially deadly now that so many Palestinian civilians have returned home. Before the ceasefire, civilians were largely concentrated in tent camps meant to provide relative safety from the fighting. The return to fighting could also worsen deep internal fissures inside Israel over the fate of the remaining hostages. Many of the hostages released by Hamas returned emaciated and malnourished and described harsh conditions in captivity, putting heavy pressure on the government to extend the ceasefire. The released hostages have repeatedly implored the government to press ahead with the ceasefire to return all remaining hostages, and tens of thousands of Israelis have taken part in mass demonstrations in recent weeks calling for a ceasefire and return of all hostages. Mass demonstrations are planned later Tuesday and Wednesday following Netanyahu's announcement this week that he wants to fire the head of Israel's internal security agency, the Shin Bet. Critics have lambasted the move, saying it is an attempt by Netanyahu to divert blame for his government's failures in the Oct. 7 attack and handling of the war. Since the ceasefire in Gaza began in mid-January, Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military says approached its troops or entered unauthorized areas. Still, the deal has tenuously held without an outbreak of wide violence. The ceasefire’s first phase saw an exchange of some hostages held by Hamas in return for the freeing of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate the next steps in the ceasefire. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to follow the ceasefire deal reached by the two sides, which calls for negotiations to begin on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, in which the remaining hostages would be released and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. ___ Mednick reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Middle East latest: Hamas says it will free a US-Israeli hostage ...	Hamas said on Friday it has accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual nationals who died in captivity in Gaza. The Palestinian militant group's offer appears aimed at keeping up momentum on negotiations over the future of the Gaza ceasefire and the release of all Israeli hostages, living and dead. Talks are continuing in Qatar, but there are no signs of a breakthrough. The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has been paused for almost a month by the fragile ceasefire, although Israel has cut off all food, medicine and electricity for Gaza as a pressure tactic against Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office cast doubt on Hamas’ latest offer, accusing it of trying to manipulate the negotiations. Here's the latest: UN condemns widespread violence against civilians in Syria that especially targeted the minority Alawite sect The U.N. Security Council statement, co-sponsored by the United States and Russia, calls for an immediate halt to the recent violence, mass killings and 'inflammatory activities' in Syria. Member nations expressed 'grave concern' at the impact on escalating tensions among Syria’s disparate communities and called on interim authorities 'to protect all Syrians, regardless of ethnicity or religion.' A war monitor said nearly 1,500 civilians were killed in the sectarian violence, most of them Alawites from the same minority as ousted President Bashar Assad. The council's presidential statement on Friday welcomed Syrian authorities' public condemnation of the violence and called for further measures to prevent its recurrence. It noted the establishment of an independent committee to investigate the violence and called on Syrian authorities to ensure transparent and impartial probes, and to bring all perpetrators to justice. The Security Council also expressed grave concern at the 'acute threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters' and urged Syria to take decisive measures to address the threat. There’s strong opposition to Trump and Netanyahu’s vision for moving Palestinians to Africa The idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once considered a fantasy of Israel’s ultranationalist fringe. Palestinians in Gaza have rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab countries have expressed vehement opposition and offered an alternative reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place. Rights groups say forcing or pressuring the Palestinians to leave their homeland could be a potential war crime. Human Rights Watch and others have said it would amount to 'ethnic cleansing,' the forcible displacement of the civilian population of a national group from a geographic area. The White House declined to comment on the African outreach efforts, but has said Trump 'stands by his vision' presented last month at a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has hailed it as a ' bold vision.' AP Exclusive: US and Israel look to Africa for moving Palestinians uprooted from Gaza The U.S. and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for moving 2 million Palestinians uprooted from the Gaza Strip under President Donald Trump’s postwar plan, American and Israeli officials told The Associated Press. The contacts with Sudan, Somalia and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland reflect the determination by the U.S. and Israel to press ahead with a plan that has been widely condemned and raised serious legal and moral issues. Because all three places are poor, and in some cases wracked by violence, the proposal casts doubt on Trump’s stated goal of resettling Gaza’s Palestinians in a 'beautiful area.' The U.S. and Israeli officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative. Officials from Sudan said they have rejected overtures from the U.S., while officials from Somalia and Somaliland told the AP that they were not aware of any contacts. By Josef Federman, Matthew Lee and Samy Magdy ▶ Read more about the U.S. and Israel’s efforts to send Palestinians to Africa Palestinians make an arduous journey to pray in Jerusalem during Ramadan In Jerusalem, some 80,000 Muslim worshippers prayed Friday at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound for the second week of Ramadan, flanked by the iconic Dome of the Rock. That estimate comes from the Islamic Trust, which monitors the site. Israel is tightly controlling access for the prayers, allowing only men over 55 and women over 50 to enter from the occupied West Bank. 'The conditions are extremely difficult,' said Yousef Badeen, a Palestinian who had left the southern West Bank city of Hebron at dawn to make it to Jerusalem, said. 'We wish they will open it for good.' Hamas accused Israel of escalating a 'religious war' against Palestinians with what it called the 'systematic targeting of Muslim religious practices' through its restrictions at Al-Aqsa mosque. Israeli authorities did not immediately comment on the accusation. Hezbollah hints it won't disarm if Israel still occupies southern Lebanon A senior Hezbollah official has hinted that the Lebanese militant group will not lay down its weapons as long as Israel is occupying parts of the country. Mohammed Daamoush made his comments in Beirut during a sermon for Friday prayers adding that Israel’s occupation of five strategic hilltops and what he said were daily violations of a ceasefire aim to pressure Lebanon to normalize relations with Israel. Daamoush says the state now controls the border with Israel and Lebanon's new government is backed by the international community and has weapons, so 'what have you done to face daily Israeli violations and aggression?' He called on authorities to convince the public about why weapons should only be held by the state, adding, 'When there is occupation and a continuing aggression weapons should be in the hands of men and everyone should repel this occupation.' UN's envoy to Syria urges a ‘credible and inclusive’ interim government The U.N. special envoy for Syria said now is the time to create 'a genuinely credible and inclusive' interim government and legislative body in the war-torn country. Geir Pedersen called in a statement Friday, marking 14 years since the civil war began, for an immediate end to all violence and for protection of civilians in accordance with international law. Many of Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities are concerned about how they'll be treated by the country's new Islamist rulers, who overthrew the government late last year. Pedersen called for a credible independent investigation into the recent sectarian massacres and violence in Syria’s coastal region, and for the full cooperation of Syrian authorities with the United Nations in this regard. The statement came a day after Syria’s interim president signed a temporary constitution that leaves the country under Islamist rule while promising to protect the rights of all Syrians for five years during a transitional phase. Israel expresses immediate doubt about Hamas' hostage release offer The United States, led by the Trump administration’s hostage envoy Steve Witkoff, has been pushing for a proposal that would extend the truce and see a limited number of hostage for prisoner exchanges. Following the Hamas statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel had 'accepted the Witkoff outline and showed flexibility,' but said that 'Hamas is refusing and will not budge from its positions.' 'At the same time, it continues to use manipulation and psychological warfare — the reports about Hamas’ willingness to release American hostages are intended to sabotage the negotiations,' the prime minister’s office said. It added that Netanyahu would convene his ministerial team on Saturday night to receive a detailed report from the negotiation team and 'decide on the next steps for the release of hostages.' Hamas says it accepts a proposal to release an American-Israeli hostage and 4 hostage bodies The Palestinian militant group said in a statement Friday it has accepted a new proposal by mediators of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, agreeing to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four other hostage dual nationals who died in captivity. There was no immediate confirmation from other mediating countries. Hamas did not specify when the release would occur. It said it would release alive soldier Edan Alexander, a soldier taken from his base on the Gaza border during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023. It comes as negotiators have been in Doha, trying to salvage the fragile ceasefire nearly two weeks after the end of the truce's first phase. Israel and the United States have been pushing for a proposal to extend the truce through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Buses carrying Druze from Syria cross into Israeli-controlled area of the Golan Heights It marked a historic visit by the embattled minority to visit a religious shrine located on the Israeli side of the border. A group of Druze from the Israeli-controlled Golan heights welcomed the Syrian Druze at the crossing point, carrying Druze flags and chanting in Arabic, 'It is written on our doors, welcome to our beloved ones.' The visit comes as Israel says it is supporting the minority in a country now ruled by Islamists. But many Druze have rejected its overtures, and critics accuse Israel trying to weaken and divide Syria following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. 'This is a legitimate right for us as a Druze community; to go to Syria to visit our families, and they come here to visit their families and visit the holy sites,' said Jawlan Abu Zed, a resident of the predominantly-Druze village of Majdal Shams, on the Israeli side of the border. The Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981. Netanyahu accuses former head of Israeli security services of blackmail The police complaint escalates a growing feud between the government and the intelligence agency. The filing on Friday comes after the former head of the Shin Bet security agency, Nadav Argaman, said Thursday on Israel’s Channel 12 that he was sitting on information about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — and would make it public if it is found that Netanyahu has broken the law. In the police complaint, Netanyahu demands an investigation into Argaman’s conduct. He also lashed out at current Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar on Thursday in a post to X, accusing him of a 'campaign of extortion with threats by means of briefings to the media in the last few days.' The dispute comes as the Shin Bet has launched an investigation into ties between close Netanyahu aides and the Qatari government. Netanyahu and the current and former security chiefs have also been locked in a dispute over where blame falls for the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Netanyahu has brushed off calls for a state commission of inquiry to investigate his government’s role in the security failure that day. UN-backed experts accuse Israel of sexual and gender-based violence in Gaza A United Nations-backed group of human rights experts accused Israel on Thursday of 'disproportionate violence against women and children' during the war against Hamas in Gaza, and accused Israeli security forces of rape and sexual violence against Palestinian detainees. Israel is committing 'genocidal acts' by systematically destroying Gaza’s reproductive health care facilities, the experts concluded, although they stopped short of accusing Israel of genocide. Israel has refused to cooperate with the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council that commissioned the team of independent experts, accusing it of anti-Israel bias. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. A U.N. envoy last year said there were 'reasonable grounds' to believe Hamas committed rape and sexual violence in the attack. Israel’s retaliatory war in Gaza has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-hamas-says-it-will-free-a-us-israeli-hostage-to-keep-ceasefire-talks-rolling/	2025-03-14T09:56:29-07:00	
Hamas agrees to release a US-Israeli hostage and the bodies of 4 ...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Hamas said on Friday it has accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual-nationals, hostages who had died in captivity. The announcement came as talks continue in Qatar to try to broker the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. The militant group in the Gaza Strip did not immediately specify when the release of soldier Edan Alexander and the four bodies would occur, and other countries party to the agreement did not immediately confirm the Hamas statement. Alexander was 19 when he was taken from his base on the border with Gaza in southern Israel during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023 that sparked the war. It was not clear which parties had participated in negotiating the deal. The United States, led by the Trump administration's hostage envoy Steve Witkoff, has been pushing for a proposal that would extend the truce and see a limited number of hostage for prisoner exchanges. Following the Hamas statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu huddled with top advisers in security consultations, according to an Israeli official who was not authorized to speak on the record about the matter. The first phase of the ceasefire ended two weeks ago. The White House last week made a surprise announcement, saying that American officials had engaged in 'ongoing talks and discussions' with Hamas officials, stepping away from a long-held U.S. policy of not directly engaging with the militant group. That prompted a terse response from Netanyahu’s office. It was not immediately clear whether those talks were at all linked to Hamas’ Friday announcement about the release of the American hostage. In a separate statement, Hamas official Husam Badran reaffirmed what he said was Hamas’ commitment to fully implementing the ceasefire agreement in all its phases, warning that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one. The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza for the first time since early in the war, and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies. Israel has been pressing Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for an extension of the first phase, and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. Two weeks ago, Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza and its more than 2 million people as it pressed Hamas to agree. The militant group has said that the move would affect the remaining hostages as well. Hamas wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. The militant group said with support cut off to Gaza, some 80% of the population has now lost access to food sources, with aid distribution halted and markets running out of supplies, while 90% are unable to access clean drinking water. In Jerusalem, some 80,000 Muslim worshippers prayed on Friday at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound for the second week of Ramadan, according to the Islamic Trust, which monitors the site. Israel is tightly controlling access, allowing only men over 55 and women over 50 to enter from the occupied territory for the prayers. 'The conditions are extremely difficult,' said Yousef Badeen, a Palestinian who had left the southern West Bank city of Hebron at dawn to make it to Jerusalem, said. 'We wish they will open it for good.' Hamas accused Israel of escalating a 'religious war' against Palestinians with what it called the 'systematic targeting of Muslim religious practices' through its restrictions at Al-Aqsa mosque. ___ Associated Press writer David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hamas-agrees-to-release-a-us-israeli-hostage-and-the-bodies-of-4-other-dual-nationals/	2025-03-14T05:33:54-07:00	
US envoy is taking Putin's comments on Ukraine ceasefire proposal...	Russian President Vladimir Putin met with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss details of the American proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Ukraine, asking him to convey Moscow's thoughts to Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday. Putin asked Witkoff late Thursday to give additional messages to U.S. President Donald Trump, Peskov told reporters, after the Russian leader said at a news conference that he supported a truce in principle but set out a host of details that need to be clarified before it is agreed. Ukraine, under severe military pressure on parts of the front line three years after Russia’s full-scale invasion, has already endorsed the proposal. Russia’s army has gained battlefield momentum, and analysts say Putin likely will be reluctant to rush into a ceasefire while he feels he has an advantage. The Russian army, backed by North Korean troops, are now close to completely driving Ukrainian forces from their foothold in Russia's Kursk border region in what would be a major setback for Kyiv. A possible phone call between Putin and Trump to settle outstanding ceasefire issues could be arranged after Witkoff delivers the messages in Washington, Peskov said. 'There is an understanding on both sides that such a call is needed,' Peskov said. 'There are certainly some grounds for cautious optimism,' Peskov said of the ceasefire proposal. 'A lot still needs to be done, but the president has shown solidarity with President Trump’s position.' U.S. officials have said Washington was set to discuss technical issues related to a possible ceasefire next week. Given the range of issues on the table, and the sharp differences between what Moscow and Kyiv want, it could potentially take weeks or months for the guns to fall silent. Trump vowed during his election campaign to settle the war in 24 hours, but in January he changed that timeframe, voicing hope that peace could be negotiated in six months. Putin’s apparently amicable tone toward the White House reflects the remarkable shift in U.S. relations with Russia and Ukraine since Trump returned to office in January. Former President Joe Biden had sought to isolate Putin. Trump has threatened both Russia and Ukraine with punitive measures if they don’t engage with his peace efforts. Trump briefly cut off critical military aid and intelligence sharing in an apparent effort to push Kyiv to enter talks on ending the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a tense meeting at the White House on Feb. 28 in which Trump questioned whether Ukraine wanted to halt the war. Trump has raised the possibility of tightening sanctions on Russia, though his administration has also repeatedly embraced Kremlin positions on the conflict, including indicating that Ukraine’s hopes of joining NATO are unlikely to be realized and that it probably will not get back the land that Russia’s army occupies, which amounts to nearly 20% of the country. Meanwhile, Russian air defenses downed four Ukrainian drones attacking the Russian capital early Friday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. One damaged the roof of an apartment building a few kilometers (miles) from the Kremlin. Several other buildings were lightly damaged by drone fragments, but there were no injuries, according to emergency officials. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-envoy-is-taking-putins-comments-on-ukraine-ceasefire-proposal-to-trump-kremlin-official-says/	2025-03-14T04:05:22-07:00	
AP Exclusive: US and Israel look to Africa for resettling Palesti...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The U.S. and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for resettling Palestinians uprooted from the Gaza Strip under President Donald Trump's proposed postwar plan, American and Israeli officials told The Associated Press. The contacts with Sudan, Somalia and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland reflect the determination by the U.S. and Israel to press ahead with a plan that has been widely condemned and raised serious legal and moral issues. Because all three places are poor, and in some cases wracked by violence, the proposal also casts doubt on Trump’s stated goal of resettling Gaza’s Palestinians in a 'beautiful area.' Officials from Sudan said they have rejected overtures from the U.S., while officials from Somalia and Somaliland told The Associated Press that they were not aware of any contacts. Under Trump’s plan, Gaza’s more than 2 million people would be permanently sent elsewhere. He has proposed the U.S. would take ownership of the territory, oversee a lengthy cleanup process and develop it as a real estate project. The idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once considered a fantasy of Israel’s ultranationalist fringe. But since Trump presented the idea at a White House meeting last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed it as a ' bold vision.' Palestinians in Gaza have rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab nations have expressed vehement opposition and offered an alternative reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place. Rights groups have said forcing or pressuring the Palestinians to leave could be a potential war crime. Still, the White House says Trump 'stands by his vision.' Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative, U.S. and Israeli officials confirmed the contacts with Somalia and Somaliland, while the Americans confirmed Sudan as well. They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place. Separate outreach from the U.S. and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan alongside Netanyahu, according to the U.S. officials, who said that Israel was taking the lead in the discussions. Israel and the U.S. have a variety of incentives — financial, diplomatic and security — to offer these potential partners. It is a formula that Trump used five years ago when he brokered the Abraham Accords — a series of mutually beneficial diplomatic accords between Israel and four Arab countries. The White House declined to comment on the outreach efforts. The offices of Netanyahu and Ron Dermer, the Israeli Cabinet minister and Netanyahu confidant who has been leading Israel’s postwar planning, also had no comment. But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a longtime advocate of what he calls 'voluntary' emigration of Palestinians, said this week that Israel is working to identify countries to take in Palestinians. He also said Israel is preparing a 'very large emigration department' within its Defense Ministry. Here is a closer look at the places the officials say have been approached. Sudan The North African country was among the four Abraham Accord nations that agreed to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020. As part of the deal, the U.S. removed Sudan from its list of state supporters of terrorism, a move that gave the country access to international loans and global legitimacy. But relations with Israel never took off as Sudan plunged into civil war between government forces and the RSF paramilitary group. The conflict has been marked by atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the U.N. and rights groups. The International Criminal Court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, and then-President Joe Biden's administration in January said the RSF and its proxies were committing genocide. The U.S. and Israel would be hard-pressed to persuade Palestinians to leave Gaza, particularly to such a troubled country. But they could offer incentives to the Khartoum government, including debt relief, weapons, technology and diplomatic support. Two Sudanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic matter, confirmed that the Trump administration has approached the military-led government about accepting Palestinians. One of them said the contacts began even before Trump's inauguration with offers of military assistance against the RSF, assistance with postwar reconstruction and other incentives. Both officials said the Sudanese government rejected the idea. 'This suggestion was immediately rebuffed,' said one official. 'No one opened this matter again.' Military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan told an Arab leaders’ summit last week in Cairo that his country 'categorically rejects' any plan that aims to transfer 'the brotherly Palestinians from their land under whatever justification or name.' Somaliland Somaliland, a territory of over 3 million people in the Horn of Africa, seceded from Somalia over 30 years ago, but it is not internationally recognized as an independent state. Somalia considers Somaliland part of its territory. Somaliland’s new president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, has made international recognition a priority. An American official involved in the efforts confirmed that the U.S. was 'having a quiet conversation with Somaliland about a range of areas where they can be helpful to the U.S. in exchange for recognition.' The possibility of U.S. recognition could provide an incentive for Abdullahi to back away from the territory’s solidarity with the Palestinians. The United Arab Emirates, another Abraham Accord country that has developed strong ties with Israel, once had a military base in Somaliland and maintains commercial interests there, including a port. The territory's strategic location, in the Gulf of Aden waterway near Yemen, home to the Houthi rebel group, could also make it a valuable ally. Over the years, Somaliland has been lauded for its relatively stable political environment, contrasting sharply with Somalia’s ongoing struggles amid deadly attacks by al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab. Since 1991, Somaliland has maintained its own government, currency and security structures. Still, it has one of the lowest income levels in the world. An official in Somaliland, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said his government has not been approached and is not in talks about taking in Palestinians. Somalia Somalia has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians, often hosting peaceful protests on its streets in support of them. The country joined the recent Arab summit that rejected Trump’s plan and seems like an unlikely destination for Palestinians, even if they did agree to move. Sambu Chepkorir, a lawyer and conflict researcher in Nairobi, Kenya, said it is difficult to understand why Somalia would want to host Palestinians given the country’s strong support for Palestinian self-rule. 'The realignments keep changing, and so maybe there is a hidden agenda,' Chepkorir said. A Somali official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the country had not been approached about taking in Palestinians from Gaza and there had been no discussions about it. ___ Lee reported from Washington, and Magdy reported from Cairo.

Putin says he agrees in principle with US proposal for 30-day cea...	Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he agrees in principle with a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but the terms need to be worked out, and he emphasized that it should pave the way to lasting peace. 'So the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,' Putin told a news conference in Moscow. 'But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.' He noted the need to develop a mechanism to control possible breaches of the truce. Another issue, he said, is whether Ukraine could use the 30-day ceasefire to continue mobilization and rearmament. 'We agree with the proposals to halt the fighting, but we proceed from the assumption that the ceasefire should lead to lasting peace and remove the root causes of the crisis,' Putin said. Putin noted that while it appeared that the U.S. persuaded Ukraine to accept a ceasefire, Ukraine is interested in that because of the battlefield situation, noting that Ukrainian troops that launched an incursion into Russia’s Kursk region would be fully blocked in the coming days. 'In these conditions, I believe it would be good for the Ukrainian side to secure a ceasefire for at least 30 days,' he said. Referring to the Ukrainian troops in Kursk, he said: 'Will all those who are there come out without a fight?' Putin thanked U.S. President Donald Trump 'for paying so much attention to the settlement in Ukraine.' He also thanked the leaders of China, India, Brazil and South Africa for their 'noble mission to end the fighting to casualties,' a statement that signaled those countries' potential involvement in a ceasefire deal. Russia has said it will not accept peacekeepers from any NATO members to monitor a prospective truce. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. An envoy of U.S. President Donald Trump arrived Thursday in Moscow for talks on an American-proposed 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine has accepted, but a senior Russian official said the truce would only help Kyiv by giving its weary and shorthanded military a break. The diplomatic effort coincided with a Russian claim that its troops have driven the Ukrainian army out of a key town in Russia's Kursk border region, where Moscow has been trying for seven months to dislodge Ukrainian troops from their foothold. A U.S. official confirmed the arrival of Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the matter. The Russian Defense Ministry’s claim that it recaptured the town of Sudzha, a Ukrainian operational hub in Kursk, came hours after President Vladimir Putin visited his commanders in Kursk. The claim could not be independently verified. Ukrainian officials made no immediate comment. The renewed Russian military push and Putin's high-profile visit to his troops unfolded as Trump seeks a diplomatic end to the war, which began more than three years ago with Russia’s full-scale invasion. The U.S. on Tuesday lifted its March 3 suspension of military aid for Kyiv after senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials reported making progress on how to stop the fighting during talks in Saudi Arabia. Trump said Wednesday that 'it’s up to Russia now' as his administration presses Moscow to agree to the ceasefire. The U.S. president has made veiled threats to hit Russia with new sanctions if it does not engage with peace efforts. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov would not comment on Moscow’s view of the ceasefire proposal. 'Before the talks start, and they haven’t started yet, it would be wrong to talk about it in public,' he told reporters. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Thursday that Trump is 'willing to apply maximum pressure on both sides,' including sanctions that reach the highest scale on Russia. Senior U.S. officials have said they hope to see Russia stop attacks on Ukraine within the next few days. Russia complains about ceasefire proposal Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser, complained in televised remarks Thursday that a ceasefire would grant a 'temporary break for the Ukrainian military.' Speaking later to reporters in the Kremlin, Putin’s foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, reaffirmed that the proposed ceasefire would 'give us nothing,' adding that it would 'only give the Ukrainians a chance to regroup, consolidate their forces and keep doing the same in the future.' Ushakov would not comment on Witkoff’s talks in Moscow, saying that the parties agreed to keep them confidential. He said Russia wants a 'long-term peaceful settlement that takes into account Moscow’s interests and concerns.' His comments echoed statements from Putin, who has repeatedly said a temporary ceasefire would benefit Ukraine and its Western allies. Ukraine has leveled accusations similar to Ushakov's, claiming Russia would use a truce to regroup and rearm. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy chided Russia on the Telegram messaging app Thursday for what he said was its slow response to the ceasefire proposal, accusing Moscow of trying to delay any peace deal. He said that Ukraine is 'determined to move quickly toward peace' and hoped U.S. pressure would compel Russia to stop fighting. The U.S. still has about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding for future arms shipments to Ukraine, but the Trump administration has shown no interest so far in using that authority to send additional weapons as it awaits the outcome of peace overtures. By signaling its openness to a ceasefire at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war, Ukraine has presented the Kremlin with a dilemma — whether to accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington. The Ukrainian army’s foothold inside Russia has been under intense pressure for months from the renewed effort by Russian forces, backed by North Korean troops. Ukraine's daring incursion last August led to the first occupation of Russian soil by foreign troops since World War II and embarrassed the Kremlin. Putin visits Russian military commanders Speaking to commanders Wednesday, Putin said that he expected the military 'to completely free the Kursk region from the enemy in the nearest future.' Wearing military fatigues, Putin added that 'it’s necessary to think about creating a security zone alongside the state border,' in a signal that Moscow could try to expand its territorial gains by capturing parts of Ukraine’s neighboring Sumy region. That idea could complicate a ceasefire deal. Ukraine launched the raid in a bid to counter the unceasingly grim news from the front line, as well as to draw Russian troops away from the battlefield inside Ukraine and to gain a bargaining chip in any peace talks. But the incursion did not significantly change the dynamic of the war. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, assessed late Wednesday that Russian forces were in control of Sudzha, a town close to the border that previously was home to about 5,000 people. Ukraine’s top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Russian aircraft had carried out an unprecedented number of strikes on Kursk and that as a result Sudzha had been almost completely destroyed. He did not comment on whether Ukraine still controlled the settlement but said his country was 'maneuvering (troops) to more advantageous lines.' Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Dmytro Krasylnykov, commander of Ukraine’s Northern Operational Command, which includes the Kursk region, was dismissed from his post, he told Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne on Wednesday. He told the outlet that he was not given a reason for his dismissal, saying 'I’m guessing, but I don’t want to talk about it yet.' ___ Associated Press Writer Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at ___ This story has been corrected to show that Suzha is a key Ukrainian military hub, not Kursk’s biggest town.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-says-it-has-retaken-sudzha-the-biggest-town-in-the-kursk-region-controlled-by-ukraine/	2025-03-13T09:37:29-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli airstrike targets residential buildin...	Israel's military carried out an airstrike on the outskirts of Syria's capital Thursday targeting a residential building that Israel said was a command center of the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. A member of the group at the scene told The Associated Press the strike hit a home of the group’s leader which has been empty for years. Local paramedics said three people were wounded. Also Thursday, United Nations-backed experts accused Israel of 'the systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence' in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel has refused to cooperate with the commission, accusing it and the council of being biased against it. The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza was paused by a fragile ceasefire in January. Negotiations over the future of the truce and the release of Israeli hostages are continuing in Qatar, but there are no signs of a breakthrough. Here's the latest: Trump's apparent backtrack on Gaza plan is welcomed by Arab countries Arab countries welcomed an extremely brief remark from President Donald Trump indicating he has backed away from his plan to depopulate Gaza. Trump responded 'Nobody’s expelling any Palestinians,' to a reporter Wednesday before asking her where she worked and implying it was a dumb question. U.S. allies Egypt and Jordan seized on those four words and released statements welcoming the remarks. Both had rejected Trump’s earlier suggestion that they accept large numbers of Palestinian refugees. Hamas issued a statement welcoming Trump’s 'apparent retreat from his proposed plan to displace our people from Gaza.' Last month, Trump proposed that Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries so the U.S. could take ownership of Gaza and develop it as a beach destination for others. Human rights experts said it would likely violate international law. 25,000 Palestinian patients need medical evacuation from Gaza, global aid group says Around 50 patients are being evacuated each day from Gaza by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies alongside its local partners. 'Yesterday, we saved 39 lives,' Kate Forbes, the federation's president, told The Associated Press on Thursday. These 25,000 patients include chronically ill people with cancer, heart disease or hemophilia whose regular treatment has been interrupted due to Gaza's destroyed healthcare infrastructure. The trickle of medical evacuations is still taking place during Israel's renewed blockade of humanitarian aid and electricity into Gaza. In Cairo this week, Forbes met with some of the medical evacuees and the children accompanying them. The kids she met are deeply affected by the trauma they've witnessed, she said, leaving many of them mute upon arrival. 3 people were wounded by the Israeli strike in Syria, medics say The Syrian Civil Defense group, also known as the White Helmets, said a woman was seriously wounded and two men were lightly injured. The group said no one was killed. The paramedic group said the strike destroyed the targeted building in a Damascus suburb and damaged two nearby buildings. Syrian building targeted by Israeli strike ‘was home of militant group leader' A Palestinian Islamic Jihad member at the scene of the airstrike in Syria told The Associated Press that the apartment that was targeted was the home of the group’s leader Ziad Nakhaleh. Ismail Sindak said the apartment had been empty for years, adding that Nakhaleh is not in Syria. Asked whether anyone was killed in the strike, Sindak said 'the house was empty.' It was not immediately clear where Nakhaleh is but he is believed to spend his time between Lebanon, Iran and Syria. The Israeli military said its air force conducted an intelligence-based strike on a command center belonging to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Damascus. It added that command center was used to plan and direct 'terrorist activities' by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad against Israel. 1 reported killed after Israeli airstrike hits residential building in Syria Syria’s state news agency says an Israeli airstrike has struck a residential building on the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus. The agency did not give further details about Thursday’s strike. Israel’s defense minister confirms the airstrike in Damascus Israel’s military said that the strike targeted a command center of the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It said that the center has been used to direct attacks against Israel and vowed to 'respond forcefully' to the presence of Palestinian militant groups inside Syria. Defense Minister Israel Katz warned in a statement that 'whenever terrorist activity is organized against Israel,' Syria’s new President Ahmad al-Sharaa 'will find air force planes circling above him and attacking terrorist targets.' The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said the building targeted is located in the suburb of Dummar, northwest of the capital and was inhabited by Palestinians. It said one person was killed. Israel sends food aid to Druze minority group in Syria Israel says it has sent 10,000 packages of food aid to Syria’s Druze, as it seeks to forge ties with the minority to shape the country’s troubled transition from civil war. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the operation was conducted in recent weeks in coordination with local Druze leaders, with most of the aid delivered to the overwhelmingly Druze southern region of Sweida. Israel says it is supporting an embattled minority in a country now ruled by Islamists. But many Druze have rejected its overtures, and critics accuse Israel trying to weaken and divide Syria following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. Israel seized a buffer zone in southern Syria shortly after Assad’s overthrow and has carried out waves of airstrikes to destroy Syria’s military. It has ordered the new security forces not to operate south of the capital, Damascus. Israel says it is acting in Syria to protect its citizens from Iran-backed groups that were allied with Assad as well as the new government, led by a former senior al-Qaida leader who cut ties with the group several years ago. Report says Israel used sexual and reproductive violence in Gaza United Nations-backed experts on Thursday accused Israel of 'the systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence' in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel’s mission to the U.N. in Geneva rejected the allegations and accused the The Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which was created by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, of relying on 'second-hand, single, uncorroborated sources.' Israel has refused to cooperate with the commission, accusing it and the council of being biased against it. In its report released Thursday, the commission examined the widespread destruction of Gaza, the use of heavy explosives in civilian areas and Israeli attacks on hospitals and health facilities. It said all three led to 'disproportionate violence against women and children.' Israel says it took extraordinary measures to avoid harming civilians in the 15-month war, which has been paused by a fragile ceasefire. It blames civilian deaths and destruction on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas. The commission also accused Israeli security forces of rape and sexual violence against Palestinian detainees. Israel denies any systematic abuse of prisoners and says it takes action when there are violations. The commission is led by former U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay. Its findings can be used as evidence for the International Criminal Court or other bodies that seek to prosecute war crimes. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. A U.N. envoy last year said there were 'reasonable grounds' to believe Hamas committed rape and sexual violence in the attack. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-un-backed-experts-accuse-israel-of-sexual-and-gender-based-violence-in-gaza/	2025-03-13T07:33:31-07:00	
UN report accuses Israel of sexual violence against Palestinians....	GENEVA (AP) — United Nations-backed human rights experts on Thursday accused Israel of 'the systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence' in its war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The allegations came in one of the most extensive reports of its kind on the issue since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel ignited the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the Human Rights Council, a U.N.-backed body that commissioned the team of independent experts, as an 'anti-Israel circus' that 'has long been exposed as an antisemitic, rotten, terrorist-supporting, and irrelevant body.' His statement did not address the findings themselves. The findings by the Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which seeks to document in minute detail the allegations and evidence of crimes to bolster accountability for perpetrators, could be used by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court or in other jurisdictions to try to bring justice to victims and their relatives. In its report released Thursday, the commission examined the widespread destruction of Gaza, the use of heavy explosives in civilian areas and Israeli attacks on hospitals and health facilities. It said all three led to 'disproportionate violence against women and children.' The commission documented a range of violations perpetrated against Palestinian women, men, girls and boys and accused Israeli security forces of rape and sexual violence against Palestinian detainees. Israel denies any systematic abuse of prisoners and says it takes action when there are violations. 'Our report finds that Israel has increasingly employed sexual, reproductive, and other forms of gender-based violence against Palestinians as part of a broader effort to undermine their right to self-determination,' Chris Sidoti, a member of the commission, told reporters in Geneva. Israel’s mission in Geneva rejected the allegations and accused the commission of relying on 'second-hand, single, uncorroborated sources.' Since the commission was set up in 2021 — long before the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel — Israel has refused to cooperate with it, accusing the investigative team and the council of bias. Commission member Sidoti said the report 'also concludes that Israel has carried out genocidal acts through the systematic destruction of sexual and reproductive health care facilities.' The commission stopped short of accusing Israel of genocide, as some advocacy groups and other rights experts have. Israel, which was established in the wake of the Nazi Holocaust and is home to many survivors and their families, has vigorously denied such allegations. Israel says it took extraordinary measures to avoid harming civilians in the 15-month war, which has been paused by a fragile ceasefire. It blames civilian deaths and destruction on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas. Israeli forces carried out a number of raids on hospitals, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Israeli authorities, citing eyewitness accounts and other evidence, have accused Hamas-led militants of widespread rape and sexual violence. Israeli experts who have treated former hostages say some were subjected to physical and sexual abuse in captivity. A U.N. envoy last year reported 'reasonable grounds' to believe such allegations. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the commission held public hearings with victims, lawyers, advocacy groups and others whose accounts were included in the report. The commission was not considering allegations of sexual, gender-based and other violence committed against Israelis during the Oct. 7 attack or against hostages in Gaza, but reported on the issue last year. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-un-report-accuses-israel-of-sexual-violence-against-palestinians-netanyahu-claims-anti-israel-bias/	2025-03-13T05:27:10-07:00	
U.S. resumes intelligence sharing with Ukraine	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR)-- U.S. military deliveries and intelligence sharing were back on Wednesday for Ukrainian troops. President Donald Trump lifted his ban on that assistance in response to Ukraine supporting a 30-day ceasefire proposal Tuesday. Now, the pressure is ramping up on Russia to agree to stop the fighting within the next few days. 'The ball is truly in their court,' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. 'If their response is no, it would be highly unfortunate, and it would make their intentions clear.' President Trump's Middle East envoy could meet with President Vladimir Putin in Russia this week and for now, President Trump said financial penalties are off the table. 'It would be devastating for Russia, but I don't want to do that because I want to see peace,' the president said in the Oval Office Wednesday. A Putin spokesperson said Moscow is waiting on more information about the ceasefire proposal from the U.S. before taking a position. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine's allies also have to be ready to monitor the ceasefire. 'This is very important,' Zelenskyy said. Democrats and Republicans in Congress are calling for continued support for Ukraine as the Trump administration has gone back and forth in sharing military aid and intelligence. 'We must not pressure Ukraine to silence their guns unless Russia commits to do the same,' said U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) Bennet and U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) have both traveled to war-torn Ukraine. 'We can't let Putin have a win in Ukraine, ladies and gentlemen,' Tillis said. Tillis argues that would embolden Russia to take over more of Europe and other adversaries, like China, North Korea and Iran, to focus on the U.S. 'Vladimir Putin has a plan, and we could play right into it,' Tillis said. To pressure Putin to accept the ceasefire proposal, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) plans to introduce legislation Thursday that would impose 'bone-breaking' sanctions against Russia and tariffs on any country that buys Russian oil, gas, uranium or other products. 'So you have to pick between our economy and the Russian economy,' Graham said. 'It's now time for Russia to pay a heavier price than they've paid in the past if they continue this war.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/u-s-resumes-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine/	2025-03-12T13:33:34-07:00	
Pressed to accept a ceasefire in Ukraine, Putin seems likely to s...	By signaling its openness to a ceasefire, Ukraine has handed the Kremlin a difficult challenge at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war: Should Moscow accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or should it reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington? Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly ruled out a temporary break in hostilities, saying it would only benefit Ukraine and its Western allies by letting them replenish their arsenals. He has insisted Moscow wants a comprehensive agreement that would ensure a lasting settlement. The Kremlin responded cautiously to the news of Ukraine accepting the U.S.-proposed truce during Tuesday’s talks in Saudi Arabia, saying that it needs to know details of the discussions before expressing its view. The careful approach reflects Putin’s awareness of the risk that a blunt rejection of the offer could upset tentative efforts to normalize Russia-U.S. ties. Observers say that instead of an outright rejection, Putin will likely propose linking the truce to certain conditions that would protect Moscow’s interests. Why would the Kremlin oppose a ceasefire? The Russian military held the battlefield initiative last year, making slow but steady gains along several sections of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. The tempo of Russian advances accelerated in the fall, when Moscow’s forces captured the most territory since the start of the war. Ukraine has sought to retake the initiative with a surprise foray into Russia’s Kursk region that began in August, seeking to distract Moscow’s forces from their offensive in eastern Ukraine and make gains that potentially could be exchanged for Russia-occupied areas in peace talks. The incursion, however, has diverted Ukrainian resources from defending the Donetsk region in the east and it failed to stem Russian advances there. Now Ukrainian forces are on the verge of losing their last remaining bridgehead in Kursk under the brunt of a swift Russian counteroffensive. Moscow also ravaged Ukrainian energy infrastructure with waves of missiles and drones, destroying much of its power-generating capacity. Putin has repeatedly said a temporary halt to hostilities at a time when Russian forces firmly hold the initiative would only allow exhausted Ukrainian troops a break to rest and rearm. 'As for the settlement of the situation, I would like to emphasize that it shouldn’t be aimed at a brief truce — some sort of a break for regrouping troops and rearmament in order to continue the conflict — but a long-term peace,' Putin has said. Moscow has made it clear it wouldn’t accept any troops from NATO members as monitors under a prospective peace deal. What does Putin want? Putin key goals remain what he declared when he launched the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022: Ukraine renounce joining NATO, sharply cut its army, and protect Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow’s orbit. On top of that, he now wants Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow has seized but doesn’t fully control. Russian officials also have said that any prospective peace deal should involve unfreezing Russian assets in the West and lifting other U.S. and European Union sanctions. The Trump administration has put a potential sanctions relief on the table. Along with that, Putin has repeatedly emphasized the need to 'remove the root causes of the crisis,' a reference to the Kremlin’s demand to roll back a NATO military buildup near Russian borders it describes as a major threat to its security. The Kremlin leader has argued that Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose term expired last year, lacks the legitimacy to sign a peace deal. Kyiv maintains that elections are impossible to hold amid a war. U.S. President Donald Trump has spoken of the need for Ukraine to hold an election in comments that echoed Moscow’s view. What more could Moscow demand? Some observers noted that instead of an outright rejection of the proposed truce, Putin could put forward several conditions. Pro-Kremlin commentator Sergei Markov suggested Moscow could agree to a truce if Ukraine's allies halt arms supplies to Kyiv. The U.S. said it resumed weapons shipments and intelligence sharing with Kyiv after it agreed to a truce Tuesday in Saudi Arabia. 'Russia could say ‘yes, but’ to a ceasefire offer, accepting a 30-day truce on condition that an embargo is imposed on arms supplies to Ukraine,' Markov wrote. Another Moscow wish is a presidential election in Ukraine, which would be possible after Ukraine lifts martial law. 'Peace would allow Russia to influence Ukrainian politics and use peaceful means to ensure friendly relations,' Markov said. Moscow-based foreign policy expert Alexei Naumov also predicted that Russia would likely accept the ceasefire offer if it leads to an election in Ukraine. 'There is a paradox in these talks and peace initiatives – Ukraine and Russia are both vying for Donald Trump’s attention and seeking to improve their positions with his help,' Naumov said in a commentary. Sam Greene of the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis said it would be hard to imagine Putin saying a categoric 'no' to the ceasefire proposal, adding that the Kremlin leader 'has already achieved in some ways more through this negotiation process … then he achieved in a long time on the battlefield,' describing a brief halt in the U.S. military assistance to Ukraine and the talk about rolling back sanctions as 'big wins' for Russia. Putin’s statements against a temporary truce mean simply that Russia is 'not likely to agree to a ceasefire without extracting various things along the way,' Greene said. 'The sort of ceasefire that it might be interested in is quite clearly not the kind of ceasefire that the Ukrainians or the Europeans might be interested in, although the Americans may be more malleable on that,' he added. 'Moscow has every reason to believe that … if this process lands anywhere, it will land in a place that is more or less on Russia’s terms, as long as the process is being driven by Washington,' Greene said.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-pressed-to-accept-a-ceasefire-in-ukraine-putin-seems-likely-to-seek-his-own-conditions/	2025-03-12T11:26:07-07:00	
US arms flow to Ukraine again as the Kremlin mulls a ceasefire pr...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. arms deliveries to Ukraine resumed Wednesday, officials said, a day after the Trump administration lifted its suspension of military aid for Kyiv in its fight against Russia's invasion, and Ukrainian officials signaled that they were open to a 30-day ceasefire backed by Washington. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that it’s important not to 'get ahead' of the question of responding to the ceasefire proposal. He told reporters that Moscow is awaiting 'detailed information' about it from the U.S. and suggested that Russia must get that first before it can take a position. Arms deliveries to Ukraine have already resumed through a Polish logistics center, the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Poland announced Wednesday. The deliveries go through a NATO and U.S. hub in the eastern Polish city of Rzeszow that’s has been used to ferry Western weapons into neighboring Ukraine about 70 kilometers (45 miles) away. The American military help is vital for Ukraine’s shorthanded and weary army, which is having a tough time keeping Russia’s bigger military force at bay. But for Moscow, more American aid spells potentially more difficulty in achieving its war aims and likely will be a tough sell in Moscow for Washington’s peace efforts. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that Washington will pursue 'multiple points of contacts' with Russia to see if President Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate an end to the war. He declined to give details. 'The ball is truly in their court,' Rubio said at a refueling stopover in Shannon, Ireland on his way to talks in Canada with other Group of Seven leading industrialized nations. Rubio said he hoped to see Russia stop attacks on Ukraine within the next few days as a first step. 'We don’t think it’s constructive to stand here today and say what we’re going to do if Russia says no,' Rubio said, adding he wanted to avoid statements about Russia that 'are abrasive in any way.' Escalation of conflict amid ceasefire talks His comments came amid intensifying Russian effort to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk region that has yielded breakthroughs in recent days, Ukrainian soldiers told The Associated Press. The fighting has escalated as ceasefire talks come to a head, with Moscow intent on taking back its territory and Kyiv determined to hold onto it as a bargaining chip in any negotiations. Ukrainian forces made a daring raid into the Russian region last August in the first foreign occupation of Russian territory since World War II. They have held on despite intense pressure from tens of thousands of Russian and North Korean troops. Recent fighting reportedly has focused on the Kursk town of Sudzha, which is a key Ukrainian supply hub and operational base. Ukrainian soldiers said the situation is dynamic and fighting continues in and around the town, but three of them conceded Russian forces were making headway. Russian state news agencies RIA Novosti and Tass reported Wednesday that the Russian military have entered Sudzha. It wasn't possible to independently verify either side's claims. Inside Ukraine, Russian ballistic missiles killed at least five civilians, officials said Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump wants to end the three-year war and pressured Zelenskyy to enter talks. The suspension of U.S. assistance came days after Zelenskyy and Trump argued about the conflict in a tense White House meeting. Rubio, who led the American delegation to Tuesday's talks in Saudi Arabia, said Washington would present the ceasefire offer to the Kremlin, which has so far opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict and hasn't accepted any concessions. 'We’re going to tell (the Russians) this is what’s on the table. Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking. And now it’ll be up to them to say yes or no,' Rubio told reporters after the talks. 'If they say no, then we’ll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here.' Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel this week to Moscow, where he could meet with Putin, according to a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. The person cautioned that scheduling could change. Russian officials are wary about the U.S.-Ukraine talks Russian lawmakers signaled wariness about the prospect of a ceasefire. 'Russia is advancing (on the battlefield), so it will be different with Russia,' senior Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev noted in a post on the messaging app Telegram. 'Any agreements (with the understanding of the need for compromise) should be on our terms, not American,' Kosachev wrote. Lawmaker Mikhail Sheremet told the state news agency Tass that 'Russia is not interested in continuing' the war but at the same time Moscow 'will not tolerate being strung along.' The outcome of the Saudi Arabia talks 'places the onus on Washington to persuade Moscow to accept and implement the ceasefire,' said John Hardie, a defense analyst and deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute. 'Moscow will present itself as cooperative, but may push for agreement on basic principles for a final peace deal before agreeing to a ceasefire,' he said. 'Russia may also insist on barring Western military aid to Ukraine during the ceasefire and on Ukraine holding elections ahead of a long-term peace agreement.' Russia’s foreign intelligence service, known as the SVR, reported Wednesday morning that the service’s chief, Sergei Naryshkin, spoke on the phone with CIA Director John Ratcliffe on Tuesday. The two discussed cooperation 'in areas of common interest and the resolution of crisis situations,' according to a statement by the SVR. ___ Stefanie Dazio in Berlin, and Sylvie Corbet in Paris, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russian-missiles-kill-5-in-ukraine-as-kremlin-mulls-ceasefire-prospects/	2025-03-12T05:44:47-07:00	
US lifts military freeze on Ukraine in push for 30-day ceasefire	The U.S. will immediately restore military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine following bilateral talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, with Ukraine expressing 'readiness' to accept a 30-day ceasefire proposal. 'Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation,' said a joint statement after the talks. 'The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace,' it added. 'The United States will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.' The talks came less than two weeks after a contentious Oval Office meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky late last month. The outcome Tuesday marks a major reprieve for Ukraine after Trump and Vice President Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for U.S. support, and holding 'no cards' in negotiations to end the war. Trump had remained vague on what exactly Ukraine needed to do to restore US military and intelligence support, which Trump halted in the wake of Zelensky's explosive White House visit. 'I want them to want peace... They haven't shown it to extent they should,' Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. The bilateral talks in Jeddah signaled a rapprochement. Among the restored military aid included $4 billion in the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), a fund that allows the U.S. to send Ukraine military materials directly from Department of Defense stocks. In the joint U.S.-Ukraine statement, the Ukrainians 'reiterated the Ukrainian people’s strong gratitude to President Trump, the U.S. Congress, and the people of the United States for making possible meaningful progress toward peace.' The statement also noted that the U.S. and Ukraine agreed to name their negotiating teams and immediately begin talks toward an 'enduring peace that provides for Ukraine’s long-term security.' The U.S. 'committed to discussing these specific proposals' with Russia, and the Ukrainian delegation 'reiterated that European partners shall be involved in the peace process.' The joint statement also referenced a minerals deal between Ukraine and the U.S., though negotiators said it was not a focus of Tuesday's meeting. 'Both countries’ presidents agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine’s critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine’s economy and guarantee Ukraine’s long-term prosperity and security,' the statement read. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz led the U.S. delegation. The Ukrainian delegation included Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Zelensky, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. Yermak and Sybiha wore suits, in contrast to Zelensky, who was criticized by Trump allies over his attire in the Oval Office, wearing war-time shirt and pants. Waltz said after the meeting that the Ukrainians are 'ready for peace.' Rubio said the U.S. would communicate the ceasefire deal to the Russians and warned that if they refuse, they’ll be viewed as the impediment to peace. 'Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking, and now it'll be up to them [Russia] to say yes or no,' Rubio said. 'I hope they're going to say yes, and if they do, then I think we've made great progress. If they say no, then we'll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is.' Noticeably absent from the meeting was Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s point man on talks with Moscow and one of his closest confidantes. Witkoff, also the president’s special envoy for the Middle East, reportedly traveled to Qatar for ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas at the time of the Jeddah meeting. He is expected to travel to Moscow later this week, a source familiar told NewsNation, but cautioned the envoy’s schedule is fluid.

Middle East latest: Israeli fire kills 8 Palestinians in Gaza Str...	Israeli fire has killed eight people in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, Palestinian officials said, even as a fragile ceasefire with Hamas has largely held. Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians who the army says had approached its troops or entered unauthorized areas in violation of the January truce. Israel last week suspended supplies of goods and electricity to the territory of more than 2 million Palestinians as it tries to pressure the militant group to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. That phase ended March 1. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. Here's the latest: US cautious about peace prospects in Syria The White House is circumspect about the prospects for a peaceful Syria after clashes erupted last week that left hundreds dead. Monitoring groups said hundreds of civilians were killed in the clashes that broke out last week. Revenge attacks primarily targeted members of the Alawite religious minority to which ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad belongs. White House National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt said Tuesday that the attacks on religious minorities have raised concerns in the administration 'about whether Syria’s interim governing authorities are ready to include a religiously and ethnically diverse population, and whether the interim authorities even have the legitimacy to do so.' Syria’s interim government signed a deal Monday with the Kurdish-led authority that controls the country’s northeast, including a ceasefire and the merging of the main U.S.-backed force there into the Syrian army. 'Achieving a resolution at the negotiating table is preferable to achieving it on the battlefield and the United States will continue to watch Syria and the decisions its leaders make,' Hewitt added. An Israeli airstrike kills 4 in Gaza Palestinian first responders say an Israeli airstrike killed four people, including two brothers, in the Gaza Strip. The Civil Defense, which operates under the Hamas-run government, said Tuesday’s strike was carried out near the Netzarim corridor, where Israeli forces had carved out a military zone bisecting the territory before withdrawing from the area as part of a fragile ceasefire. The Israeli military said it carried out an airstrike against a group of militants 'engaged in suspicious activity.' The fragile ceasefire has held since it began on Jan. 19, even as Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians. Israel says it has struck Palestinians who approached its troops, entered unauthorized areas or otherwise violated the terms of the truce. Palestinians say settlers attacked a garage in West Bank Palestinians say settlers attacked a garage in the occupied West Bank overnight, torching three cars. Rafaat Sabah, the owner of the garage, said the attack overnight was not the first. He said settlers had broken into his garage previously and stolen oil, tools and other things. This time they set fire to cars belonging to his customers, he said. The Israeli military said it was investigating the incident. Marwan Sabah, head of the Umm Safa village council, said settlers have recently brought livestock to graze on village lands with the aim of eventually taking them over. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence, including settler attacks on Palestinians, since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip ignited the war there. Over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship live in well over 100 settlements across the West Bank, ranging from hilltop outposts to fully-developed suburbs. The territory’s 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority administering cities and towns. Funeral held for a Palestinian struck by an Israeli military vehicle Palestinians held a funeral on Tuesday for a 32-year-old man who died after being struck by an Israeli military vehicle in the volatile West Bank city of Jenin. The military described Monday’s incident as an accident, saying the man rode a motorcycle into an intersection where it collided with the military vehicle. Israel has been carrying out a major military operation in Jenin in recent weeks that it says is aimed at rooting out militants. Palestinians view such operations as a way of cementing Israeli control over the territory, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Israeli official says violence in Syria amounts to ‘ethnic cleansing’ Israel’s deputy foreign minister said Tuesday that deadly sectarian violence in neighboring Syria amounted to 'ethnic cleansing' and said Israel was working to prevent a threat along its border from Syria’s new 'jihadi regime.' 'Israel is committed to preventing what we saw in Syria this weekend from happening on our border,' Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel said at a news conference in Jerusalem. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said 1,130 people were killed in the clashes, including 830 civilians, most of them from ousted leader Bashar Assad's Alawite community. The Associated Press could not independently verify these numbers. Since Islamist-led insurgents ousted Assad in December, Israel has voiced concern that the group could seize Syrian military assets and use them against it, or that instability could spill over into its territory. Israel has deployed troops inside a buffer zone and vowed to prevent the new Syrian forces from entering the area south of Damascus. On Tuesday, the Israeli military said its fighter jets struck military targets in southern Syria, including radars and equipment. 3 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank The Palestinian Health Ministry says three Palestinians, including a 58-year-old woman, were killed by Israeli fire in the volatile West Bank city of Jenin on Tuesday. The Israeli military said troops killed two militants in an exchange of fire in Jenin and arrested 10 others. It said its forces eliminated a third militant who had fired at them during the operation and destroyed two vehicles loaded with weapons. Israel launched a large-scale military operation centered on Jenin shortly after reaching a fragile ceasefire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip in January. Troops have destroyed homes and infrastructure, and tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled their homes across the northern West Bank. 4 killed in Gaza in the past 24 hours, Palestinian officials say The Gaza Health Ministry says four people have been killed by Israeli fire and another 14 wounded over the past 24 hours. The ministry said Tuesday that rescuers had also retrieved 32 bodies from under the rubble. The four killed included three brothers hit by a drone strike in central Gaza on Monday and a woman killed by a drone strike Tuesday in the southern city of Rafah, the ministry said. The latest deaths brought the overall Palestinian death toll from the war to 48,503. More than 110,000 people have been wounded, according to the ministry. The ministry says women and children make up most of the dead but does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its toll. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 people.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-fire-kills-4-palestinians-in-gaza-strip-3-in-the-occupied-west-bank/	2025-03-11T06:17:31-07:00	
Ukraine-US talks on ending war with Russia start in Saudi Arabia ...	JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Senior officials from Ukraine and the United States opened talks Tuesday on how to end Moscow’s three-year war against Kyiv, hours after Russian air defenses shot down 343 Ukrainian drones in the biggest such attack since the Kremlin ordered the full-scale invasion of its neighbor. Three people were killed and 18 were injured, including three children, in the massive drone attack that spanned 10 Russian regions, officials said. Russia, meanwhile, launched 126 Shahed and other drones and a ballistic missile at Ukraine on Tuesday, the Ukrainian air force said, as part of Moscow's relentless pounding of civilian areas during the war. In the Red Sea port city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, journalists briefly entered a room where a senior Ukrainian delegation met with America’s top diplomat for talks on ending Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio smiled for the cameras and when asked what his expectations for the meeting were, he gave a thumbs up and replied, 'Good.' Across the table, Ukrainian officials, including the country's top diplomat and defense chief, sat without any facial expressions as the meeting got underway at a luxury hotel. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian or U.S. officials on the drone attack. However, Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak, who was also taking part in the talks, told reporters that the most important thing was 'how to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.' He said security guarantees were important to prevent Russia from invading again in the future. In 2014, Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine and threw its weight behind pro-Kremlin militias in eastern Ukraine. They seized large swaths of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and fought against Kyiv’s forces for the following eight years. Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister was also on hand as American, Saudi and Ukrainian flags stood in the background. Officials did not answer any of the shouted questions. The delegations met for about three hours in the morning before taking a break, and officials said the talks would continue in the afternoon. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the United States will inform Russia about the results of the Jeddah talks, which he described as 'normal practice.' Talks bring a chance to mend US-Ukraine relations The meeting in Jeddah offered an opportunity for Kyiv officials to repair Ukraine’s relationship with the Trump administration after an unprecedented argument erupted during President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s Feb. 28 visit to the White House. Critically, Ukraine needs to persuade Washington to end the U.S. suspension of military aid and some intelligence sharing after the Oval Office blowout. U.S. officials have said that positive talks in Jeddah could mean it may be only a short suspension. Ukrainian officials told The Associated Press on Monday that they will propose a ceasefire covering the Black Sea, which would bring safer shipping, as well as long-range missile strikes that have hit civilians in Ukraine, and the release of prisoners. The two senior officials said Kyiv is also ready to sign an agreement with the United States on access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals — a deal that U.S. President Donald Trump is keen to secure. While traveling to Jeddah, Rubio said the U.S. delegation would not be proposing any specific measures to secure an end to the conflict but rather wanted to hear from Ukraine about what they would be willing to consider. 'I’m not going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do,' Rubio told reporters accompanying him. 'I think we want to listen to see how far they’re willing to go and then compare that to what the Russians want and see how far apart we truly are.' Rubio said the rare earths and critical minerals deal could be signed during the meeting but stressed it was not a precondition for the United States to move ahead with discussions with either Ukraine or the Russians. He said it may make more sense to take some time to negotiate the precise details of the agreement, which is now a broad memorandum of understanding that leaves out many specifics. The Kremlin is sticking to its conditions for peace The Kremlin has not publicly offered any concessions. Russia has said it’s ready to cease hostilities on condition that Ukraine drops its bid to join NATO and recognizes regions that Moscow occupies as Russian. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine's territory since the war began. Russian forces have held the battlefield momentum for more than a year, though at a high cost in infantry and armor, and are pushing at selected points along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region, against Ukraine's understrength and weary army. Ukraine has invested heavily in developing its arms industry, especially high-tech drones that have reached deep into Russia. Most of the Ukrainian drones fired overnight — 126 of them — were shot down over the Kursk region across the border from Ukraine, parts of which Kyiv’s forces control, and 91 were shot down over the Moscow region, according to a statement by Russia's Defense Ministry. Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said over 70 drones targeted the Russian capital and were shot down as they were flying toward it — the biggest single attack on Moscow so far in the war. The governor of the Moscow region surrounding the capital, Andrei Vorobyov, said the attack damaged several residential buildings and a number of cars. Flights were temporarily restricted in and out of six airports, including Domodedovo, Vnukovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovsky just outside Moscow, and airports in the Yaroslavl and Nizhny Novgorod regions. ___ Associated Press writer Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-at-least-60-ukrainian-drones-shot-down-over-moscow-in-a-massive-attack-citys-mayor-says/	2025-03-11T05:56:17-07:00	
Ukraine will propose a limited ceasefire during talks with the US...	JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — A Ukrainian delegation set to meet with America’s top diplomat in Saudi Arabia about ending the 3-year war with Russia will propose a ceasefire covering the Black Sea and long-range missile strikes, as well as the release of prisoners, two senior Ukrainian officials said Monday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about Tuesday’s meeting, also told The Associated Press that the Ukrainian delegation is ready during the talks to sign an agreement with the United States on access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals — a deal that U.S. President Donald Trump is keen to secure. The officials discussed the confidence-building measures, with no further details, ahead of the Ukrainian negotiating team's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jeddah. Kyiv is trying to repair the damage done when Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Feb. 28 visit to Washington descended into an Oval Office argument with Trump and Vice President JD Vance. At stake is the military aid and intelligence previously offered by the United States that had helped Ukraine in the war but is now paused as Washington pushes for a peace agreement. Rubio and Zelenskyy landed a few hours apart Monday in Saudi Arabia, but did not meet. Zelenskyy met with the kingdom’s powerful crown prince Monday evening, with the president saying they 'had a detailed discussion on the steps and conditions needed to end the war and secure a reliable and lasting peace.' 'Saudi Arabia provides a crucial platform for diplomacy, and we appreciate this,' Zelenskyy said online. Rubio also met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, thanking him for hosting the talks and also discussing Yemen's Houthi rebels, who are threatening to restart their attacks in the Red Sea. Speaking to reporters aboard his plane before arriving, Rubio said he and national security adviser Mike Waltz would take stock of Ukraine’s responses in Saudi Arabia. If Ukraine and the U.S. reach an understanding acceptable to Trump, that could accelerate his administration’s push to peace talks. 'What we want to know is, are they interested entering some sort of peace conversation and general outlines of the kinds of things they could consider, recognizing that it has been a costly and bloody war for the Ukrainians. They have suffered greatly and their people have suffered greatly,' Rubio said. 'And it’s hard in the aftermath of something like that to even talk about concessions, but that’s the only way this is going to end and prevent more suffering.' He added: 'I’m not going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do. I think we want to listen to see how far they’re willing to go and then compare that to what the Russians want and see how far apart we truly are.' Zelenskyy has said his team meeting Rubio will include his chief of staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. Rubio will lead the U.S. team. The rest of Europe remains skeptical about the talks as it has been sidelined by Washington. The European Union last week agreed to boost the continent’s defenses and to free up hundreds of billions of euros for security in response to the Trump administration's shift in stance on Ukraine. White House special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News on Monday that the pause of U.S. intelligence-sharing with Ukraine has not limited defense intelligence-sharing. 'We never shut off intelligence for ... anything defensive that the Ukrainians need,' Witkoff said. A pause on sharing U.S. intelligence that can be used for offensive purposes by Ukrainian forces remains in effect, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official suggested that progress could be made toward reinstating intelligence-sharing with Ukraine during the Saudi talks. ___ Arhirova reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Israel cuts off electricity supply to Gaza, affecting a desalinat...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, officials said Sunday, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory. Hamas called it part of Israel's 'starvation policy.' Israel last week suspended supplies of goods to the territory of more than 2 million Palestinians, an echo of the siege it imposed in the earliest days of the war. Israel is pressing the militant group to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. That phase ended last weekend. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. The militant group — which has warned that discontinuing supplies would affect the hostages — said Sunday that it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position. Israel has said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday in an effort to 'advance' the negotiations. Israel had warned when it stopped all supplies that water and electricity could be next. The letter from Israel's energy minister to the Israel Electric Corporation tells it to stop selling power to Gaza. The territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated, and most facilities, including hospitals, now use generators. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam said that Israel has 'practically' cut off electricity since the war began and called the latest decision part of Israel's 'starvation policy, in clear disregard for all international laws and norms.' The desalination plant was providing 18,000 cubic meters of water per day for central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah area, according to Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement. Executive director Tania Hary said that it's expected to run on generators and produce around 2,500 cubic meters per day, about the amount in an Olympic swimming pool. Israel’s restrictions on fuel entering Gaza have a larger impact, Hary said, and water shortages are a looming issue, because fuel is needed for distribution trucks. Israel has faced sharp criticism over suspending supplies. 'Any denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,' the U.N. human rights office said Friday. The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used 'starvation as a method of warfare' when it issued an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. The allegation is central to South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide. Israel has denied the accusations, saying it has allowed in enough aid and blaming shortages on what it called the United Nations' inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid. The leader of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels off Yemen would resume within four days if aid doesn't resume to Gaza. The Houthis described their earlier attacks as solidarity with Palestinians there. The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies. US envoy describes talks with Hamas The White House on Wednesday made the surprise confirmation of direct U.S. talks with Hamas. On Sunday, envoy Adam Boehler told Israeli broadcaster Kan that Hamas has suggested a truce of five to 10 years while it would disarm. The militant group has previously called disarming unacceptable. A senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss contacts with the U.S., said that the group had expressed its longstanding position that it would lay down its arms in return for a 'fair and just solution' that includes an independent Palestinian state. Boehler also told CNN that 'I think you could see something like a long-term truce, where we forgive prisoners, where Hamas lays down their arms, where they agree they’re not part of the political party going forward. I think that’s a reality. It’s real close.' When asked if he would speak with the militant group again, Boehler replied, 'You never know.' He added: 'I think something could come together within weeks,' and expressed hope for a deal that would see all hostages released, not only American ones. Boehler has said four of the five American hostages in Gaza are dead, with Edan Alexander alive. Hamas on Sunday didn't mention the talks, but reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections. Hamas’ attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Many Israelis are pressing for a deal to bring everyone home. 'We are here to send a clear message to the Israeli government: stop stalling,' Zahiro Shahar Mor, nephew of slain hostage Avraham Munder, said in front of tents set up outside Israel’s defense ministry in one demonstration. Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t say how many of the dead were militants. With the cutoff of supplies to Gaza, Palestinians are reporting sharp price increases for dwindling items during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 'Since the ceasefire began, the situation has improved a little. But before that, the situation was very bad,' said Fares al-Qeisi in the southern city of Khan Younis. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Follow developments at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-says-it-is-cutting-off-its-electricity-supply-to-gaza/	2025-03-09T17:28:44-07:00	
Russian forces walked inside a gas pipeline to strike Ukrainian t...	LONDON (AP) — Russian special forces walked inside a gas pipeline to strike Ukrainian units from the rear in the Kursk region, Ukraine’s military and Russian war bloggers reported, as Moscow claimed fresh gains in its push to recapture parts of the border province that Kyiv seized in a shock offensive. Ukraine launched a daring cross-border incursion into Kursk in August, marking the largest attack on Russian territory since World War II. Within days, Ukrainian units had captured 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of territory, including the strategic border town of Sudzha, and taken hundreds of Russian prisoners of war. According to Kyiv, the operation aimed to gain a bargaining chip in future peace talks and to force Russia to divert troops away from its grinding offensive in eastern Ukraine. But months after Ukraine’s thunder run, its soldiers in Kursk are weary and bloodied by relentless assaults of more than 50,000 troops, including some from Russian ally North Korea. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers are at risk of being encircled, open-source maps of the battlefield show. According to Telegram posts late Saturday by a Ukrainian-born, pro-Kremlin blogger, Russian operatives walked about 15 kilometers (9 miles) inside the pipeline, which Moscow had until recently used to send gas to Europe. Some Russian troops spent several days in the pipe before striking Ukrainian units from the rear near Sudzha, blogger Yuri Podolyaka claimed. The town had some 5,000 residents before the full-scale February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and it houses major gas transfer and measuring stations along the pipeline, which was once a major outlet for Russian natural gas exports through Ukrainian territory. Another war blogger, who uses the alias Two Majors, said fierce fighting was underway for Sudzha, and that Russian forces managed to enter the town through a gas pipeline. Russian Telegram channels showed photos of what they said were special forces operatives, wearing gas masks and moving along what looked like the inside of a large pipe. Ukraine’s General Staff confirmed Saturday evening that Russian 'sabotage and assault groups' used the pipeline in a bid to gain a foothold outside Sudzha. In a Telegram post, it said Russian troops were 'detected in a timely manner' and that Ukraine responded with rockets and artillery. 'At present, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. The enemy’s losses in Sudzha are very high,' the General Staff reported. A third Russian war blogger argued that the attacking force lacked the logistical backup to succeed. 'Food, water, ammunition, communications, charging electrical devices, power banks, the approach of the main forces, evacuating the wounded … Two or three groups in the rear without all this — that’s a disaster,' the blogger, who describes himself as a soldier with the call sign Thirteenth, wrote on Telegram. The Associated Press could not independently verify the accounts. The Russian Defense Ministry reported Sunday that its troops had taken four villages north and northwest of Sudzha, with the closest lying some 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from the center of the town. The claim came a day after the ministry reported the capture of three more villages near Sudzha. Ukraine did not immediately comment on the Russian claims. Trump questions Ukraine's survival, while France announces new aid package Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday that Ukraine 'may not survive' as he continued to withhold American arms and intelligence in an effort to force Kyiv into peace negotiations with its invader. In an interview with Fox News Channel’s 'Sunday Morning Futures,' Trump was asked about a warning from Polish President Andrzej Duda 'that without American support, Ukraine will not survive' and whether he was 'comfortable' with that outcome. He replied, 'Well, it may not survive anyway.' He added, 'But we have some weaknesses with Russia. You know, it takes two.' In other developments, French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu said Sunday that France will use profits from frozen Russian assets to finance an additional 195 million euros ($211 million) in arms for Ukraine, the latest in a series of military aid deliveries funded through the assets. In an interview with the La Tribune Dimanche newspaper, Lecornu said Paris will send new 155 mm artillery shells and glide bombs for Mirage 2000 fighter jets it previously gave to Ukraine. Ukrainian drones said to target Russian oil infrastructure Elsewhere, Russian officials and Telegram channels reported that Ukrainian drones targeted oil infrastructure in southern and central Russia overnight into early Sunday. One drone struck an oil depot in Cheboksary, a Russian city on the Volga River about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the border, the local governor reported. According to Oleg Nikolaev, nobody was hurt, but the depot needed reconstruction work. Footage circulated on Russian Telegram channels of what appeared to be a fire at or near one of Russia's largest oil refineries, in the southern city of Ryazan. Shot, a news channel on Telegram, cited local residents as saying they heard several nighttime blasts near the refinery. The local governor, Pavel Malkov, said Ukrainian drones had been shot down nearby. He claimed there had been no casualties or damage. Ukraine did not immediately comment on either incident. Satellite internet fuels sharp social media exchange Concerns that Elon Musk could turn off Starlink satellite internet service to Ukraine prompted a sharp exchange Sunday on X involving Musk, the Polish foreign minister and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski wrote that if Musk's rocket company SpaceX, which runs Starlink, 'proves to be an unreliable provider,' Poland 'will be forced to look for other suppliers.' Musk told Sikorski: 'Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink.' Rubio told Sikorski: 'No one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink. And say thank you because without Starlink, Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now.' In fact, Russians are already on the border with Poland because the Russian region of Kaliningrad lies on Poland’s northern border. The back-and-forth between the three concluded with Sikorski thanking Rubio: 'Thank you, Marco, for confirming that the brave soldiers of Ukraine can count on the vital internet service provided jointly by the U.S and Poland. Together, Europe and the United States can help Ukraine to achieve a just peace.' ___ Associated Press writers Sylvie Corbet in Paris and Zeke Miller in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-uses-a-gas-pipeline-to-strike-at-ukrainian-troops-from-the-rear-in-kursk/	2025-03-09T12:27:38-07:00	
State Dept using AI to ban visas over perceived pro-Hamas posts	(NewsNation) — The State Department will launch a program using artificial intelligence that will revoke visas of foreign students the technology perceives as supporters of Hamas or other U.S.-designated terror groups. Axios reported the plan Thursday, citing State Department officials. The 'Catch and Revoke' initiative, started under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, will use AI to scan and review tens of thousands of student visa holders’ social media accounts, the outlet reported. Aid operations in Gaza imperiled as millions of promised USAID dollars do not arrive The technology will look for any posts or documentation that shows support for Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel but also anything that shows participation in anti-war or pro-Palestinan demonstrations. Axios reported that the department is also checking news reports of anti-Israel demonstrations and Jewish students' lawsuits that highlight foreign nationals allegedly engaged in antisemitic activity without consequence. The State Department is working with the departments of Justice and Homeland Security in a 'whole of government and whole of authority approach,' according to the outlet. Several civil and constitutional rights groups have called out the plan, citing free speech concerns. 'AI tools are emerging technologies, not trusted experts on the limits of protected speech under the First Amendment. They cannot be relied on to parse the nuances of expression about complex and contested matters like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,' the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression said in a statement. A charity kitchen brings hope to displaced Palestinians in the West Bank during Ramadan The group adds that the plan will 'undoubtedly encourage self-censorship on our nation’s campuses.' Abed Ayoub, head of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, also sounded the alarm, saying, 'This should concern all Americans. This is a First Amendment and freedom of speech issue, and the administration will overplay its hand… Americans won't like this. They'll view this as capitulating free speech rights for a foreign nation,' he told Axios. The move appears to fall in line with President Donald Trump’s pledge to deport non-citizen college students and others who took part in pro-Palestinian protests. 'Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or arrested,' Trump said Tuesday. The Trump administration announced Friday that he would immediately pull about $400 million in federal grants and contracts from Columbia University, citing the school's alleged 'continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.' The university had been at the center of college protests in which demonstrators demanded an end to U.S. support for Israel due to the civilian deaths and humanitarian crisis caused by Israel's assault on Gaza. There were allegations of antisemitism and Islamophobia in protests and counterprotests.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/state-dept-using-ai-to-ban-visas-over-perceived-pro-hamas-posts/	2025-03-07T15:14:57-08:00	
The Latest: Trump considering pressure on Russia and seeking deal...	President Donald Trump said he’s 'strongly considering' sanctions and tariffs on Russia in hopes of forcing a settlement to the war in Ukraine. Trump also sent a letter to Iran’s leaders seeking to negotiate a nuclear deal. In economic news, uncertainty in world markets continues after Trump declared a weeks-long delay of tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada. And as Trump's dismantling of the federal government continues, billionaire Elon Musk is telling Republicans he’s not to blame for the firings of thousands of workers. Meanwhile, the Pentagon’s diversity purge includes removing 26,000 images including photos of the Enola Gay aircraft that hastened the end of World War II by bombing Japan. Here's the latest: Trump’s interior and energy secretaries cheer natural gas exports Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright held a pep rally for expansion plans at a massive liquefied natural gas facility in Louisiana. Venture Global estimated that its $18 billion LNG expansion would enable exports of up to 20 million tons a year to Asia and Europe and generate 8.5 million tons of planet-warming emissions. There’s strong local opposition. Watchdogs say Venture Global violated its permits thousands of times by flaring gas and releasing chemicals. Former Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm warned that 'unfettered exports' could drive up gas prices for U.S. consumers. But Burgum told reporters Thursday: 'We can absolutely do both — we can sell energy to our friends and allies, we can lower the cost at home.' ▶ Read more about Trump’s energy policy Why should America worry about Trump? Try the price of eggs, say some Democrats As their party struggles to navigate the early days of Donald Trump’s second presidency, some Democrats are convinced their road to recovery lies in blaming Trump for the price of eggs, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture expects to rise 41% this year. Democratic officials shared new internal data showing voters are most worried about inflation and the cost of living. Democracy itself, by contrast, ranked No. 12. The party establishment’s focus on blaming Trump for inflation is a break with activists trying to mobilize against what they see as an existential threat — that Trump is a budding dictator has no regard for the Constitution. Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, who helped coordinate nationwide protests that put House Republicans on defense, said 'bored, tired talking points' won’t stop authoritarianism: 'It’s 2025 — this isn’t how politics works anymore.' ▶ Read more about the Democratic Party’s messaging Homeland Security ends collective bargaining agreement with TSA staffers In a major attack on worker rights, the Department of Homeland Security says it’s ending the collective bargaining agreement with the tens of thousands of frontline employees at the Transportation Security Administration who are responsible for keeping weapons and explosives off airplanes and protecting air travel. The department’s announcement Friday says poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job, and that the contract was hindering the ability of the organization 'to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe.' ▶ Read more on developments with the TSA and its union White House economist praises job numbers, noting that mass firings aren’t yet counted The director of the White House National Economic Council is cheering Friday’s report: U.S. employers added solid 151,000 jobs last month. Kevin Hassett said that’s 'really, really impressive' while noting that the mass federal firings Trump has championed likely won’t be reflected in jobs figures until next month or later. Hassett acknowledged that the Biden administration had 'some strong jobs numbers' too, but asserted that they were based on government employment, while Trump has promoted manufacturing and the private sector. The report came in below the 160,000 jobs economists had expected for last month. Unemployment also rose slightly, to 4.1%. Federal judge in DC won’t block DOGE from Treasury systems A separate court order out of New York still puts limits on what Elon Musk ’s team can do inside the Treasury Department’s systems, however. In Washington, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly previously restricted DOGE to two employees with read-only access. She declined Friday to grant a longer-term block, however. Her decision comes in a lawsuit filed by retirees and unions who fear DOGE’s activities could expose sensitive information. Kollar-Kotelly found that concerns about DOGE are 'understandable and no doubt widely shared,' but she hasn’t yet seen evidence of serious legal harm that would justify barring the team. She invited plaintiffs to return if more immediate risks emerge. Immigration judges quit, straining system backlogged with 3.7 million cases A labor union says 85 immigration courts employees have accepted Trump’s financial incentives to resign. They include 18 judges, one assistant chief immigration judge and 66 support staff in a court system that typically takes years to decide each asylum claim. Shortly after Trump took office in January, the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review fired 20 judges without explanation, according to the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers. 'This makes no sense,' said Matt Biggs, the union president. 'Immigration judges are hard to replace given their specialized knowledge and legal experience. It takes at least a year to recruit, hire, train and conduct a background check on a new judge.' Trump raises possibility of pressuring Russia Trump said he is 'strongly considering' sanctions and tariffs on Russia in hopes of forcing a settlement to the war in Ukraine. He said in a post on Truth Social that they could remain in place 'until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED.' The post came as Trump faces criticism for increasing pressure on Ukraine to reach a deal while downplaying or even denying Russia’s responsibility for starting the war with its invasion three years ago. 'To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late,' Trump added. Thrust into unemployment, axed federal workers face relatives who celebrate their firing Scrambling to replace their health insurance and to find new work, some laid-off federal workers are running into another unexpected unpleasantry: Relatives cheering their firing. The country’s bitterly tribal politics are spilling into text chains, social media posts and heated conversations as Americans absorb the reality of the government’s cost-cutting measures. Expecting sympathy, some axed workers are finding family and friends who instead are steadfast in their support of what they see as a bloated government’s waste. 'I’ve been treated as a public enemy by the government and now it’s bleeding into my own family,' says 24-year-old Luke Tobin, who was fired last month from his job as a technician with the U.S. Forest Service in Idaho’s Nez Perce National Forest. ▶ Read more about the DOGE cuts’ effects on families Trump says he’s sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader over its advancing nuclear program Trump’s comments about the letter to Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei were not immediately confirmed by the supreme leader. Trump made the comments in an interview aired Friday by Fox Business News. The White House confirmed Trump’s comments, saying he sent a letter to Iran’s leaders seeking to negotiate a nuclear deal. Trump made the comments in an interview that will air fully Sunday. Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported on Trump’s comments, citing the broadcast. However, there was no immediate word from the office of the 85-year-old Khamenei, who has final say over all matters of state. ▶ Read more about Trump and Iran European leaders downplay skepticism from Trump about NATO solidarity After European leaders committed Thursday to freeing up hundreds of billions of euros for security, Trump said he was 'not so sure' that the military alliance would come to the United States’ defense if the country were attacked. Here’s a look at how some EU leaders responded: 1. 'We are loyal and faithful allies,' French President Emmanuel Macron said late Thursday, expressing 'respect and friendship' toward U.S. leaders and adding that France was 'entitled to expect the same.' 2. Māris Riekstins, Latvia’s ambassador to NATO, stressed the military alliance remained the most important platform for addressing transatlantic security issues. He emphasized the commitment from his country — which shares a nearly 300-kilometer (186-mile) border with Russia — to defense spending. 3. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country would raise defense spending to reach NATO’s target faster than previously committed. But he did not specify when the eurozone’s fourth-largest economy — and NATO laggard — would hit the 2% of GDP military spending target. ▶ Read more about how EU leaders discussed NATO World Trade Organization chief says US concerns on tariffs need to be heard WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said it’s important for U.S. trade partners not to panic and engage in tit-for-tat measures but to embrace dialogue in reaction to Trump’s threats in recent days to impose tariffs. Okonjo-Iweala preferred to describe the threats and reversals as 'disruptions.' 'I think we need to listen to the United States and listen to what their concerns are, and say, ‘how can we also help them deal with their concerns,’' she said, speaking during a discussion alongside former German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the WTO headquarters in Geneva. ▶ Read more about the latest comments from the WTO Wall Street clings to early gains ahead of new US employment numbers Wall Street is poised to open with gains Friday after another U.S. pivot on tariffs kicked off the third market sell-off in four days.

However, the high growth, tech heavy Nasdaq tumbled 4% into correction territory this week. The S&P shed. 3.6% over the last four days and closed at its lowest point since early November on Thursday.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Canada’s initial $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) worth of retaliatory tariffs have been applied on items like American orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, appliances, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles and certain pulp and paper products. ▶ Read more on Canada’s tariffs War heroes and military firsts are among 26,000 images flagged for removal in Pentagon’s DEI purge References to a World War II Medal of Honor recipient, the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan and the first women to pass Marine infantry training are among the tens of thousands of photos and online posts marked for deletion as the Defense Department works to purge diversity, equity and inclusion content, according to a database obtained by The Associated Press. The database, which was confirmed by U.S. officials and published by AP, includes more than 26,000 images that have been flagged for removal across every military branch. But the eventual total could be much higher. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given the military until Wednesday to remove content that highlights diversity efforts in its ranks. ▶ Read more about the Pentagon’s DEI purge Elon Musk tells Republican lawmakers he’s not to blame for federal firings Billionaire Elon Musk is telling Republican lawmakers that he is not to blame for the firings of thousands of federal workers, including veterans, as pushes to downsize the government. Instead, he said in private talks this week that those decisions are left to the various federal agencies. The message from one of Trump’s most influential advisers came as Republicans publicly support Musk’s work at the Department of Government Efficiency digging up waste, fraud and abuse, but are privately raising questions as personnel cuts ripple through communities across the nation. It’s a remarkable shift of emphasis away from the chainsaw-wielding tech entrepreneur whose vast power has made him an admired, revered and deeply feared figure in the second Trump administration. ▶ Read more about the latest on Elon Musk’s influence EU leaders commit to working together after Trump signals that Europe must defend itself European Union leaders on Thursday committed to bolstering the continent’s defenses and to free up hundreds of billions of euros for security after Trump’s repeated warnings that he would cut them adrift to face the threat of Russia alone. With the growing conviction that they will now have to fend for themselves, countries that have faltered on defense spending for decades held emergency talks in Brussels to explore new ways to beef up their security and ensure future protection for Ukraine. The resulting pledge underscored a sea change in geopolitics spurred on by Trump, who has undermined 80 years of cooperation based on the understanding that the U.S. would help protect European nations following World War II. ▶ Read more about the EU summit on defense Judge orders Trump administration to speed payment of USAID and State Dept. debts The order, issued Thursday, impacts nearly $2 billion in debts to partners of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department, giving the Trump administration a Monday deadline to repay the nonprofit groups and businesses in a lawsuit over the administration’s abrupt shutdown of foreign assistance funding. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali described the partial payment as a 'concrete' first step he wanted to see from the administration, which is fighting multiple lawsuits seeking to roll back the administration’s dismantling of USAID and a six-week freeze on USAID funding. The ruling came a day after a divided Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration’s bid to freeze funding that flowed through USAID. The high court instructed Ali to clarify what the government must do to comply with his earlier order requiring the quick release of funds for work that had already been done. Ali’s line of questioning in a four-hour hearing Thursday suggested skepticism of the Trump administration’s argument that presidents have wide authority to override congressional decisions on spending when it comes to foreign policy. ▶ Read more about the court hearing over State Department debts Trump delayed some tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but says ‘reciprocal’ tariffs will start April 2 President Donald Trump on Thursday postponed 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war. The White House insists its tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl, but the taxes proposed by Trump have caused a gaping wound in the decades-old North American trade partnership. Trump’s tariff plans have also caused the stock market to sink and alarmed U.S. consumers. In addition to his claims about fentanyl, Trump has insisted that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit. He emphasized while speaking in the Oval Office that he still plans to impose 'reciprocal' tariffs starting on April 2. 'Most of the tariffs go on April the second,' Trump said before signing the orders. 'Right now, we have some temporary ones and small ones, relatively small, although it’s a lot of money having to do with Mexico and Canada.' ▶ Read more about the latest on tariffs	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-the-latest-trump-changes-course-and-delays-some-tariffs-on-mexico-and-canada/	2025-03-07T08:35:53-08:00	
Russia bombards Ukraine's energy grid after Zelenskyy says his te...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in a large-scale missile and drone bombardment during the night, officials said Friday, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that talks with the U.S. on ending the three-year war will take place next week. Ukraine came under a 'massive missile and drone' attack, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. At least 10 people, including a child, were wounded, authorities said. 'Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians by striking energy and gas production facilities, without abandoning its goal of leaving us without light and heat, and causing the greatest harm to ordinary citizens,' Halushchenko wrote. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s power grid during the war. The attacks have depleted electricity generation capacity and disrupted critical heating and water supplies. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of 'weaponizing winter' in an effort to erode civilian morale. Zelenskyy on Friday won the support of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for Ukraine's proposals to take some first steps toward stopping the war, including a halt on firing missiles, drones and bombs at energy and other civilian infrastructure. Zelenskyy has also proposed ceasing combat operations in the Black Sea to allow safe shipping. Erdogan said that he also wants the shooting to stop without delay. 'We support the idea of an immediate ceasefire and the cessation of attacks in the air and at sea as a confidence-building measure between the parties,' he said in a video call with European leaders. Zelenskyy first suggested those initial steps in a post on X on Tuesday, when he said that he was ready to work under U.S. President Donald Trump’s 'strong leadership' to get a lasting peace, and has put them to Ukraine's European allies. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that the energy supply is a legitimate target in the war, because it's 'linked with Ukraine’s military industrial complex and weapons production.' Russian air defenses downed 39 Ukrainian drones overnight, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Ukraine’s largest private gas producer, DTEK, said that the overnight bombardment in the Odesa region was Russia’s sixth attack in the past two and a half weeks on its facilities. Russia fired 67 missiles from air, land and sea, and launched 194 strike and decoy drones, Ukraine’s air force said. Their primary target was Ukraine’s natural gas extraction facilities, it said. For the first time, Ukraine deployed French Mirage-2000 warplanes delivered a month ago to help repel the attack, according to the air force. Ukraine also has Western-supplied F-16 fighter jets to shoot down Russian missiles. Ukrainian defenses downed 34 missiles and 100 drones, the air force said, while up to 10 missiles didn’t reach their targets and 86 drones were lost from radars, presumably jammed by electronic warfare. Western-supplied air defense systems are crucial for Ukraine’s fight, but further U.S. help is uncertain under Trump, who says he's determined to end the war and has paused American military aid for Kyiv as a way of pressuring Zelenskyy to negotiate. In his nightly address, Zelenskyy said Thursday that he would travel to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet with the country’s crown prince, and his team would stay on to hold talks with U.S. officials. Zelenskyy welcomed a European Union plan to bolster the continent’s defenses. He expressed hope that some of the new spending could be used to strengthen Ukraine’s own defense industry. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-bombards-ukraines-energy-grid-after-zelenskyy-says-hell-hold-talks-with-us/	2025-03-07T04:41:45-08:00	
Aid efforts in Gaza slow as millions of promised USAID dollars do...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Trump administration’s cuts to USAID have frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in contractual payments to aid groups, leaving them paying out of pocket to preserve a fragile ceasefire, according to officials from the U.S. humanitarian agency. The cutbacks threaten to halt the small gains aid workers have made combatting Gaza’s humanitarian crisis during the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. They also could endanger the tenuous truce, which the Trump administration helped cement. USAID was supposed to fund much of the aid to Gaza as the ceasefire progressed, and the Trump administration approved over $383 million on Jan. 31 to that end, according to three USAID officials. But since then, there have been no confirmed payments to any partners in the Middle East, they said. The officials, who have survived multiple rounds of furloughs, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Two senior officials at aid organizations confirmed they have not received any of the promised funds, after spending millions of dollars on supplies and services. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the issue and of their work in Gaza, said they could not afford to continue aid operations indefinitely. Some organizations have already reported laying off workers and scaling down operations, according to internal USAID information shared with The Associated Press. That could imperil the ceasefire, under which Hamas is supposed to release hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners and ramping up the entry of humanitarian assistance. 'The U.S. established very specific, concrete commitments for aid delivery under the ceasefire, and there is no way ... to fulfill those as long as the funding freeze is in place,' said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International and a former USAID official. USAID has been one of the biggest targets of a broad campaign by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to slash the size of the federal government. USAID payments frozen, some NGOs scale down Gaza response Before Trump took office, USAID had roughly $446 million to disburse to partner organizations in Gaza in 2025, the USAID officials said. But after Trump froze global foreign assistance, USAID’s Gaza team had to submit a waiver to ensure the funds for Gaza aid could continue to flow. They received approval Jan. 31 to secure over $383 million in funding, less than two weeks after the U.S.-brokered ceasefire was reached. Some $40 million was subsequently cut under a measure that no money be provided for aid in the form of direct cash assistance. USAID then signed contracts with eight partner organizations, including prominent NGOs and U.N. agencies, awarding them money to flood supplies and services into Gaza. Then, the officials said, they began hearing that organizations were not receiving the promised payments — even as they had already spent millions, expecting USAID reimbursement. Some of those organizations are now spending less and scaling back programs. The International Medical Corps, a global nonprofit that partners with the World Health Organization and provides medical and development assistance, was awarded $12 million to continue operations at two hospitals in Gaza. These include the largest field hospital in Gaza, whose construction was funded by USAID at the request of the Israeli government, according to internal USAID information. The freeze has forced the organization to lay off some 700 staff members and offer only basic services at the hospitals, with a skeletal crew, said one USAID official. A former IMC staffer, who quit citing lack of stability, said the program providing life-saving treatment for malnutrition was significantly scaled down for lack of funds. The former staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the organization’s details, said the current nutrition services were at a minimum level. Another former IMC staffer, who also left recently and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss information not meant to be shared with media, said the USAID cuts have reduced the amount of medical supplies brought into Gaza and led the majority of IMC’s partners to reduce their programming. They said that some organizations have already purchased stocks of medical supplies, food to treat acute malnutrition, lab and medical equipment ready to enter Gaza, but because of the shortfall they have not been able to afford movement of those goods. Meanwhile, termination letters severing the contracts between USAID and Gaza partners were also sent out to organizations that were major providers of shelter, child protection and logistical support in the Gaza aid operation, a USAID official said. Some of the termination letters seen by the AP were signed by new USAID deputy chief Peter Marocco — a returning political appointee from Trump’s first term. They instruct organizations to 'immediately cease' all activities and 'avoid additional spending chargeable to the award,' citing a directive from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. USAID Gaza response in crisis as truce is tenuous In addition to the spending freeze, officials say USAID has been wracked by internal chaos and the introduction of new regulations since the new administration took office. During the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire, Israel had to allow at least 600 trucks of aid into Gaza a day, as well as 60,000 temporary homes and 200,000 tents. Two USAID officials said the agency was originally supposed to buy 400 temporary homes that would make it into Gaza by the end of Phase 1, and over 5,200 more during the next phase. That figure has since been slashed to just over 1,000. USAID was never able to purchase the mobile homes because of newly imposed policies requiring extra approvals for procurements. On Feb. 2, some 40% of the Gaza team was locked out of their email accounts and software necessary to track awards, move payments and communicate with the organizations. An email sent immediately following the lockout came from Gavin Kliger, a DOGE staffer. Access to the servers has now been restored, the officials said, but the team is smaller after waves of layoffs. From an original team of about 30 people, only six or seven remain. Very few mobile homes entered Gaza during Phase 1 of the ceasefire, which ended last week, prompting Hamas to accuse Israel of violating the truce. Since the end of Phase 1, Israel has cut off all aid shipments into Gaza in a bid to pressure Hamas to accept an extension of the ceasefire. That has sent aid groups scrambling to distribute reserves of food and shelter to the most needy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is considering cutting off electricity to raise the pressure on Hamas. With USAID in flux, the U.S. risks losing its influence, said Dave Harden, the former USAID assistant administrator of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Aid and a longtime director of the agency’s work in the Palestinian territories. 'U.S. aid assistance to Palestinians ... never, ever equated to U.S. assistance to Israel, never quite balanced, but always gave us a seat at the table, always helped us to have real discussions with both the Palestinians and the Israelis about what the future might hold,' Harden said. Now, he said, 'We’re just simply not at the table in a meaningful way, and so I think the ceasefire is fragile.' ___ AP correspondents Josef Federman in Jerusalem, Sarah El Deeb in Cairo and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed reporting.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-aid-operations-in-gaza-imperiled-as-millions-of-promised-usaid-dollars-do-not-arrive/	2025-03-07T04:38:45-08:00	
Paying with people's lives': Ukrainian refugees in Chicago face ...	CHICAGO — Former Homeland Security Director Alejandro Majorkas designated Ukraine for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) back in 2022 and more than a quarter of a million Ukrainian refugees came to the United States. Now, they are worried about their future. For 20 days, Ukrainian refugee Angela Savenko and her young boys lived in an underground bunker in Kyiv. 'The missiles came every night, so you have only two minutes just to grab your kids and go to bomb shelter,' Savenko said.

'I don’t want to watch the news I dread watching the news in the morning. It's because of not knowing what could happen, what could be the announcement,' Self Reliance Association Program Director Olena Levko-Sandeha said. According to Routers, on Thursday, a senior Trump official reported that the president was potentially planning to revoke temporary legal status for 240,000 Ukrainian refugees, meaning they could face deportation as soon as April. The rollback of protections is part of a broader effort to strip nearly two million migrants of their legal status under former President Biden’s humanitarian parole programs. Ukrainian refugees had hoped this month to file for an extension that would allow them to stay in the US until at least October of 2026.

Ukraine will struggle to strike targets inside Russia without US ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. decision to stop sharing military intelligence with Ukraine hobbles its ability to strike and defend against the Russian army, and increases the pressure on it to accept a peace deal being pushed by the Trump administration. Earlier in the week, the U.S. suspended weapons shipments – a severe blow, but one that experts said Ukraine could withstand for at least a few months. The suspension of intelligence has a more immediate impact by disrupting Ukraine’s ability to track and target Russian troops, tanks and ships; its other allies lack the same resources to fill the gap. Here are things to know about the U.S. decision and its likely effects: Why did the U.S. stop sharing intelligence with Ukraine? The decision to withhold intelligence – and military aid – came on the heels of a tempestuous White House visit last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance want Zelenskyy to quickly accept a truce with Russia – which now controls one-fifth of his country – and to give up significant mineral rights to the U.S. to help fund any future support for Ukraine. The Trump administration says Ukraine hasn’t demonstrated sufficient willingness to seek peace with Russia, with whom the U.S. has held separate talks to try to bring an end to the war. U.S. officials suggested Wednesday that the withdrawal of intelligence-sharing might only be a temporary measure to expedite truce negotiations, citing more positive talks since the White House blowup. 'We have taken a step back and are pausing and reviewing all aspects of this relationship,' U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz said Wednesday. CIA Director John Ratcliffe called the suspension a 'pause.' Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he is ready to discuss peace, but that any deal must offer his country sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. He has also publicly stated his regrets about the contentious, and televised, White House meeting. Trump administration officials have said the deal for mineral rights would more closely bind the U.S. and Ukraine, giving Russian President Vladimir Putin pause before considering future malign action against Ukraine. How will the lack of U.S. intelligence affect Ukraine? The White House hasn’t specified what aspects of intelligence-sharing have been suspended. But without help from the U.S. – which includes vital data captured by Elon Musk's Starlink satellites – Ukraine’s ability to strike weapons and other targets inside Russia will be severely degraded. Its attacks inside Russian territory – which rely on U.S.-provided longer-range weapons -- have been key in deterring Russia's capabilities and advances. Ukraine relies on U.S. intelligence when operating U.S.-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, and the U.S. Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS. Ukraine also relies on U.S. intelligence as an early warning system to help it defend against Russian long-range missiles and drone strikes. Such intelligence in the war’s early days allowed Ukraine to thwart Putin’s hopes for a quick victory. Before the recent restrictions imposed by the U.S., a rising tempo of Ukrainian strikes inside Russia – such as those targeting stores of ammunition -- relieved pressure on Ukrainian troops on the front lines. It is one of the reasons Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine have slowed in recent weeks, analysts say. Will the U.S. ever share intelligence again with Ukraine? Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said in a Fox News television interview that the suspension of intelligence-sharing could be reversed once Zelenskyy demonstrates to President Trump that he is sufficiently willing to discuss peace with Russia on Trump’s terms. Zelenskyy has said he would like to 'make things right' with Trump, but that does not yet appear to have assuaged the U.S. -- Ukraine’s biggest military backer since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Officials from Ukraine and the U.S. will hold talks next week in Saudi Arabia next week, Zelenskyy said late Thursday. In the meantime, Zelenskyy has been leaning into support from Europe, most of whose leaders are dismayed by the Trump administration’s decision to deprive a key American ally of assistance needed to fight Russia. On Thursday, European Union leaders launched a day of emergency talks to beef up their own security and ensure that Ukraine will still be protected. It’s unclear whether the American suspension affects the intelligence-sharing ties between Ukraine and other Western powers, including four of the Five Eyes, an intelligence sharing coalition of the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia and New Zealand. French defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said in a radio interview Thursday that his country would continue providing military intelligence to Ukraine. And French President Emmanuel Macron said he would talk with EU leaders about the possibility of using France’s nuclear deterrent to protect the continent from Russian threats.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-without-us-intelligence-ukraine-will-struggle-to-strike-targets-inside-russia/	2025-03-06T12:59:12-08:00	
Trump envoy says Ukrainians 'brought it on themselves' after US p...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukraine was given 'fair warning' by the White House before President Donald Trump this week ordered a pause on U.S. military assistance and intelligence sharing with Kyiv, a senior administration official said Thursday. The Republican administration announced the pauses this week after Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy'sOval Office meeting devolved into a shouting match, with the U.S. president and Vice President JD Vance excoriating the Ukrainian leader for being insufficiently grateful for the tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance sent to Ukraine since Russia invaded three years ago. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said the pause is already having an impact on Kyiv, adding that the Ukrainians 'brought it on themselves.' 'The best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,' Kellogg said at an event Thursday at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'You got their attention.' Kellogg said it was made clear to the Ukrainians before last week’s Oval Office meeting that the talks would focus on signing a critical minerals deal. The agreement, which the two sides still have not signed, would give the U.S. access to Ukraine's rare earth deposits and could be of value to U.S. aerospace, electric vehicle and medical manufacturing. Trump administration officials have said the economic pact would bind the U.S. and Ukraine closer together and would give Russian President Vladimir Putin pause before considering malign action against Ukraine in the future. Zelenskyy had been pressing the White House for explicit security guarantees, to no avail. Kellogg said last week's talks went sideways because Zelenskyy pressed Trump — who is trying to play the role of intermediary to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia — to side with Kyiv. Zelenskyy later called the heated words 'regrettable' and said he’s ready to sign an agreement. He told European leaders gathered in Brussels on Thursday he was grateful for their support and said the teams from the U.S. and Ukraine had resumed their work and hoped to have 'a meaningful meeting' next week. 'Ukraine has been seeking peace since the very first second of the war, and we have always said that the only reason why the war continues is because of Russia,' Zelenskyy said in his speech, which was published on the Ukrainian president’s website. But Kellogg said he couldn’t guarantee a resumption of weapons deliveries even if Zelenskyy accepts the deal. 'That’s up to the president,' Kellogg said. He added, 'You don’t negotiate peace discussions in public. You don’t try to challenge the president of the United States in the Oval Office.' Trump said in a speech before Congress on Tuesday that Zelenskyy had written to him to say he appreciates U.S. support for his country in its war with Russia. Trump said Zelenskyy told him that Ukraine is ready to negotiate a peace deal with Russia as soon as possible and would accept the minerals agreement with the U.S. to facilitate that. Although Trump said he 'appreciated' getting the letter, he did not say if it would affect his policy toward Ukraine. The suspension of U.S. intelligence sharing with Ukraine will damage Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against ongoing Russian attacks against military and civilian targets, according to an assessment by the Institute for the Study of War. The research group said suspension of all U.S. intelligence sharing with Ukraine would also allow Russian forces to intensify their drone and missile strikes against the Ukrainian rear, affecting millions of Ukrainian civilians and the growth of Ukraine’s defense industrial base. — AP writer Susie Blann in Kyiv contributed reporting.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-trump-envoy-says-ukrainians-brought-it-on-themselves-after-us-pauses-aid-and-intelligence-sharing/	2025-03-06T10:27:49-08:00	
Hamas brushes off Trump's threat and says it will only free hosta...	CAIRO (AP) — Hamas on Thursday brushed off President Donald Trump's latest threat and reiterated that it will only free the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The militant group accused Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to back out of the ceasefire agreement they reached in January. The agreement calls for negotiations over a second phase in which the hostages would be released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a permanent ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas spokesman Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua said the 'best path to free the remaining Israeli hostages' is through negotiations on that phase, which were supposed to begin in early February. Only limited preparatory talks have been held so far. On Wednesday, Trump issued what he said was a 'last warning' to Hamas after meeting with eight former hostages. The White House meanwhile confirmed it had held unprecedented direct talks with the militant group, which Israel and Western countries view as a terrorist organization. 'Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 'Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!' Both Israel and Hamas have a longstanding practice of holding onto the remains of their adversaries in order to trade them in hostage-prisoner deals. U.S. plan for the second phase Hamas is believed to still have 24 living hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, including Israeli-American Edan Alexander. It is also holding the bodies of 34 others who were either killed in the initial attack or in captivity, as well as the remains of a soldier killed in the 2014 war. Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire, which ended on Saturday. Israel supports what it says is a new U.S. plan for the second phase in which Hamas would release half the remaining hostages immediately and the rest when a permanent ceasefire is negotiated. Hamas has rejected the proposal and says it is sticking with the agreement signed in January. Israel has cut off the delivery of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians in an attempt to pressure Hamas into accepting the new arrangement. It has threatened 'additional consequences' if Hamas does not resume the release of hostages. It is unclear if the U.S.-Hamas talks made any progress. The Trump administration has pledged full support for Israel's main war goals of returning all the hostages and eradicating Hamas, which may be incompatible. Direct talks between the U.S. and Hamas could make it difficult for Israel to resume the war, according to Mkhaimar Abusada, a political science professor at Gaza’s Al-Azhar University who is currently in Egypt. 'The current U.S. administration is trying to avoid a return to war in Gaza in all possible ways,' he said. Gaza reconstruction plan Egypt said Thursday it will host an international conference to raise money for a Gaza reconstruction plan proposed this week at the Arab Summit in Cairo. A date was not announced. The conference, in cooperation with the United Nations, would secure financial pledges for the $53 billion five-year plan, Egyptian foreign ministry spokesperson Tamim Khallaf said. Egyptian and Arab officials also will tour key capitals, including Washington, to promote further details, Khallaf said, adding that Egypt believes it’s a 'workable and realistic plan' in the interest of all partners. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and took a total of 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more. Israel's military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas in Gaza and displaced most of its population. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in tents, schools-turned-shelters or war-damaged buildings, and the population relies on international aid. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hamas-brushes-off-trumps-threat-and-says-it-will-only-free-hostages-in-return-for-a-lasting-truce/	2025-03-06T07:26:48-08:00
