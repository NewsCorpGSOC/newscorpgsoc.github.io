Middle East latest: 3 die in overcrowding outside Gaza bakery ami...	Two children and a woman were crushed to death Friday as a crowd of Palestinians pushed to get bread at a bakery in the Gaza Strip amid a worsening food crisis in the war-ravaged territory, medical officials said. The children and the 50-year-old were taken to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where a doctor confirmed that they died from suffocation due to crowding at the al-Banna bakery. The flow of food allowed into Gaza by Israel has fallen to nearly its lowest level of almost 14-month-old war for the past two months, according to Israeli official figures. U.N. and aid officials say hunger and desperation are growing among Gaza’s population, almost all of which relies on humanitarian aid to survive. Some bakeries in Gaza were closed for several days last week due to a shortage of flour. AP footage taken last week after they reopened showed large crowds of people cramming together, screaming and pushing, at one bakery in Deir al-Balah. Palestinians across the Gaza Strip are heavily relying on bakeries and charitable kitchens, with many able to only secure one meal a day for their families. In Lebanon, thousands of displaced people began returning to their homes this week after a ceasefire was announced between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. Many found their homes reduced to rubble after intense Israeli airstrikes over the past two months leveled entire neighborhoods in eastern and southern Lebanon, as well as the southern suburbs of Beirut. Nearly 1.2 million people have been displaced. The truce was the first major sign of progress in the region since war began more than a year ago, triggered by Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. But it does not address the devastating war in Gaza. For Palestinians in Gaza and families of hostages held in the territory, the ceasefire marked another missed opportunity to end fighting that has stretched on for nearly 14 months. More than 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 wounded, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel has destroyed large parts of Gaza and displaced nearly all of its 2.3 million people.

The military said that the attacker, whose identity was not immediately clear, targeted the bus at a junction near the Israeli settlement of Ariel, before being shot by Israeli troops. Three of the injured were in critical condition. Attacks by Palestinian militants on Israelis in the volatile territory have grown more common since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, as Palestinian deaths have also spiked. Israeli fire has killed 796 Palestinians since Oct. 7, 2023, mostly in military raids on Palestinian cities and towns. Attacks by settlers on Palestinians and their property have also increased.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-3-die-in-overcrowding-outside-gaza-bakery-amid-food-shortage/	2024-11-29T04:45:59-08:00	
UK intelligence chief accuses Russia of 'staggeringly reckless' s...	PARIS (AP) — The head of Britain’s foreign intelligence service said Friday that Russia is conducting a 'staggeringly reckless' sabotage campaign against Ukraine's Western allies, and that his spies are working to stop the consequences from spiraling out of control. MI6 chief Richard Moore said his agency and its French counterpart were working together to prevent a dangerous escalation by 'calibrating the risk and informing the decisions of our respective governments' in response to President Vladimir Putin’s 'mix of bluster and aggression.' 'We have recently uncovered a staggeringly reckless campaign of Russian sabotage in Europe, even as Putin and his acolytes resort to nuclear saber-rattling, to sow fear about the consequences of aiding Ukraine,' Moore said during a speech to diplomats and intelligence officials in France. 'Such activity and rhetoric is dangerous and beyond irresponsible,' he said. Moore spoke alongside Nicolas Lerner, head of France’s external intelligence agency, the DGSE at an event marking 120 years of the Entente Cordiale, a pact between Britain and France that bound the age-old rivals together as military and diplomatic allies. Western security officials suspect that Russian intelligence is trying to destabilize Ukraine’s allies through disinformation, sabotage and arson. Moscow has been linked by Western officials to several planned attacks in Europe, including an alleged plot to burn down Ukrainian-owned businesses in London, and to incendiary devices in packages on cargo planes. In July one caught fire at a courier hub in Germany and another ignited in a warehouse in England. Lerner agreed that 'the collective security of the whole of Europe is at stake' in Ukraine. Her said Britain’s experience tackling Russia in the wake of recent attacks like the 2018 Salisbury Novichok poisoning, was invaluable to French intelligence seeking to defuse Russian actions. Britain and France have been among Ukrainian allies most willing to allow Kyiv to use weapons they supply – especially missiles known as Scalp in France and Storm Shadow in Britain – to hit targets inside Russia. The Biden administration recently eased its long-held opposition to U.S.-made missiles being used to strike Russia. Ukraine said last week it had used the American ATACM missiles to target Russia for the first time in the war. Since then, Russia has pounded Ukraine’s energy infrastructure with hundreds of missiles and drones, in what President Vladimir Putin said was a response to the firing of the American missiles against Russian soil. Russia also fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, called Oreshnik, and Putin threatened to use it against 'decision-making centers' in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. In a warning to allies wavering in support for Ukraine, Moore said that 'the cost of supporting Ukraine is well-known, but the cost of not doing so would be infinitely higher.' He said that if Russia wins, Iran and China — which so far support Moscow as 'a transaction' — would draw closer to Russia. 'If Putin succeeds, China would weigh the implications, North Korea would be emboldened and Iran would become yet more dangerous,' Moore said.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-uk-intelligence-chief-accuses-russia-of-staggeringly-reckless-sabotage-campaign/	2024-11-29T03:37:18-08:00	
Ukrainian energy workers carry out repairs despite Russia's pound...	On a bright winter day, workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant repair its heavily damaged equipment as drops of water from melted snow leak through gaping holes in its battered roof. Several weeks earlier, the facility was targeted by a Russian air attack that left scorch marks, shrapnel scars on the walls, and missile fragments scattered across the production floor. 'This is our life now. Workers at a thermal power plant that’s supposed to produce electricity are walking on frozen floors and using firewood to keep warm,' Oleksandr, 52, head of the Production Management Department, told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition that only his first name be used citing security concerns. Repeated Russian strikes on infrastructure have seriously impacted Ukraine's energy sector often resulting in rolling blackouts across the country. On Thursday, Moscow launched another large-scale air attack. Ukrainian authorities said nearly 200 drones and missiles targeted infrastructure, d isrupting power supply to more than a million people. The scale of the ongoing work to fix the sector is huge. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, th e G7 and other allied countries have allocated more than $4 billion in energy assistance to Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in September. Oleksandr, who works at the power plant operated by Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, says since the station was first attacked in November 2022, it has been unable to return to full capacity due to continuous strikes that have left critical equipment in ruins. The exact location of the plant visited by the AP, details on the damage and even workers’ last names cannot be disclosed for fear this information could help Russia coordinate future attacks. DTEK operated around 20% of Ukraine’s electricity production before the full-scale invasion, but this figure dropped to 12% since the war broke out. The company says its facilities have been attacked by Russia almost 200 times since 2022. They also say nearly 90% of the company’s infrastructure was destroyed or suffered damage and that was before Russia launched its large-scale attack on Nov 17. Oleksandr says he expects repairs at the station to continue through the winter into next year, and potentially far beyond. Repair efforts at the plant are further complicated by the fact that some critical equipment was manufactured in the Soviet Union and finding parts is now difficult. To mitigate this, some former Soviet countries who are now Ukraine’s allies have helped supply equipment. 'Potentially, Western countries could also help us with equipment, but their power grids have different characteristics,' Oleksandr said. Only half of DTEK’s generating capacities have been restored since the first attacks on its plants in November 2022 until the latest large-scale strike. Earlier this week, the European Commission and the U.S. government a nnounced a donation of $112 million in equipment and construction materials to help DTEK prepare for the winter. With the war in its third year, staff at DTEK’s plant have adapted to the grim reality of their day-to-day existence. They know the protocols by heart. Not everyone can take shelter during an air alert. A minimal crew must remain in the control room to oversee operations, putting themselves at risk of a direct strike. 'You have to sit and wait while monitoring the trajectories of whatever was fired, but the power units keep working so we cannot just leave, we stay in the control room,' said Dmytro, 41, a power unit operator at the plant. Despite the challenges, Dmytro and his colleagues press on, driven by a mission to keep the lights on in their town and region over the winter months. 'Who’ll do it, if not us? I also have family waiting for me at home, but if we all leave and the equipment breaks down, the responsibility will be on our shoulders, the entire city will lose electricity and heating,' he said. 'Some are risking (their lives) at the frontline, while we here have our own energy front.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukrainian-energy-workers-carry-out-repairs-despite-russias-pounding-of-the-countrys-power-grid/	2024-11-29T01:30:45-08:00	
Day 2 of the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire sees Israeli airstrike on...	BEIRUT (AP) — Israel on Thursday carried out its first airstrike on Lebanon since a truce with Hezbollah announced this week, saying it targeted the militant group's activity at a rocket storage facility in southern Lebanon that breached the ceasefire. Lebanese authorities reported scattered incidents of Israeli mortar attacks, strikes and shots fired that wounded two people trying to return to southern Lebanon. Lebanon's state-run media said the wounded were civilians, while the Israeli military described them as suspects who violated the terms of the truce that ended more than a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The bursts of violence — with no reports of serious casualties — reflected the uneasy nature of the ceasefire that otherwise appeared to hold Thursday as Lebanese troops began to deploy in parts of southern Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and the southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah has based its operations. The Lebanese military said it was setting up temporary checkpoints and detonating unexploded ordnance in hopes of helping displaced civilians return to their homes. Some 1.2 million people were displaced in Lebanon during the country's deadliest war in decades. Thousands of residents, their cars stacked high with mattresses and full of belongings, began to make the odyssey back to their war-ravaged towns on Wednesday, after the ceasefire took effect. But their movements remain constrained. The Lebanese and Israeli militaries have ordered civilians displaced from border communities to steer clear of areas where Israeli troops are still in position. On Thursday, the Israeli military said its troops opened fire at 'several suspects' who arrived in their vehicles to certain parts of southern Lebanon in violation of the truce. The statement did not give further details. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Israeli fire wounded two civilians in Markaba, a village close to the border that has been a scene of intense fighting over the past 14 months. It also reported Israeli tank fire hitting some villages and farms in the south, causing no casualties. Col. Avichay Adraee, an Arabic language spokesman for the Israeli military, announced that a nighttime curfew for Lebanese residents south of the Litani River remained in effect, banning movement from 5 p.m. Thursday until 7 a.m. Friday. The Lebanese army accused Israel of breaking the ceasefire several times on Thursday by conducting strikes on Lebanon with 'various weapons' and continuing to patrol and surveil Lebanese skies with warplanes and drones. The army said it was 'following up on these violations in coordination with the relevant authorities,' without elaborating. An Associated Press reporter in northern Israel heard Israeli drones buzzing and the sporadic crackle of machine-gun fire across the border in Lebanon. Hezbollah has not issued any public statements on the alleged Israeli ceasefire violations but Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah acknowledged the incidents. When asked by reporters how Hezbollah would respond, he was cautious. 'We don’t want to rush things,' he said, adding that Hezbollah 'has the right to self-defense.' The truce between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah, brokered by the United States and France, calls for an initial two-month ceasefire in which the militants are to withdraw north of the Litani River and Israeli forces are to return to their side of the border. Under the terms of the agreement, Lebanese troops will gradually deploy further the south as Israeli troops pull out, said a Lebanese military official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media. The buffer zone would be patrolled by U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops, which have not been a party to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Lebanon's military on Thursday shared photos showing troops clearing roads of destroyed vehicles, crushed houses and unexploded bombs. For many Lebanese, the pause in fighting brought relief — but also heartache. Displaced families returned home to sift through the bombed-out ruins of their shops and apartments. Drone footage of Qana in southern Lebanon, taken Thursday, shows ghostly, battered neighborhoods with smashed homes and giant craters gouged into the ground — the scale of destruction chilling in a town that has become synonymous with the killing of civilians in past wars. During Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah, an Israeli strike on a residential building killed 27 civilians, a third of them children, according to U.N. figures. During its 1996 offensive, Israeli artillery shelling on a United Nations compound housing hundreds of displaced people in Qana killed at least 100 civilians and wounded scores more people. 'We are a town of martyrs,' said Aref AbouKhalil, a 29-year-old taxi driver who checked on his ruined family home in Qana on Thursday. Those who lost family and friends in the Israeli bombardment of Qana over the past year, he said, felt the grief of 2006 and 1996 all over again. 'They're determined to destroy us, they keep trying, and now the town is destroyed,' he said of Israeli strikes. 'But we’ll build it again.' Israel says it plans to withdraw its forces, but only as it ensures Hezbollah observes the agreement. 'Any deviation from this agreement will be enforced with fire,' said Lt. Gen. Herzl Halevi, the Israeli military’s chief of staff. 'We are now moving toward new phase, where the same determination that brought us to this agreement will be applied in enforcement.' Of the 50,000 people who fled northern Israeli border communities because of constant Hezbollah attacks, Halevi said that ensuring their swift return was 'our duty to them, and our duty to ourselves.' A rare quiet, compared to recent months, fell over the border towns Thursday. There were air raid sirens warning of incoming Hezbollah rockets, no deafening explosions shaking the ground. But with the towns largely deserted and residents relocated, Halevi's remarks signaled the military was not encouraging Israelis to return just yet. In Menara, an Israeli community on the border with views into Lebanon, around three quarters of homes are damaged, some with collapsed roofs and burnt-out interiors. A few residents could be seen gathering their belongings there on Thursday before leaving again. Despite the smattering of attacks, the clearest sign of the truce Thursday was a reduction in the overall level of violence in Lebanon since the conflict began a day after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 assault out of Gaza, when Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group. Israel retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict steadily intensified before becoming an all-out war in mid-September. The war in Gaza is still raging with no end in sight. More than 3,760 people were killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon during the conflict, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel — over half of them civilians — as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon. ___ Frankel reported from Menara, Israel.

Israel moves forward with ceasefire talks	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) - Israel and the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon keep trading deadly airstrikes even as U.S. officials reported Monday a ceasefire deal is close. 'We're hopeful we can get one,' said U.S. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller. 'But we need both of the parties to get to yes.' Miller would not get into the specific sticking points, but recent incidents across the Middle East could thwart any progress. 'It was a monstruous act of terror that demands swift justice,' said Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. Danon confirmed a rabbi was kidnapped and murdered in the United Arab Emirates but did not say who was responsible. 'I trust that the UAE government will make sure that they will pay the price for that,' he said. The world's top war-crimes court also issued arrest warrants for top Israeli and Hamas leaders for the war in Gaza. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Robert Wood, condemned the charges against Israel. 'This decision does not make the pursuit of peace any easier,' Wood said during Monday's Security Council meeting. Officials confirm the U.S. is also still trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. Wood urged other countries to put the pressure on the terror group. 'The Security Council has an obligation to not let Hamas off the hook,' he said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/israel-moves-forward-with-ceasefire-talks/	2024-11-28T11:11:21-08:00	
Thousands of displaced Lebanese return from Syria as ceasefire wi...	QUSAIR, Syria (AP) — Thousands of people made the crossing back into Lebanon from Syria on the second day of a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, after nearly 14 months of fighting. At the Jousieh border crossing in the Qusair area of Syria’s Homs province, on Lebanon’s northeastern border, bumper-to-bumper cars lined up on Thursday waiting to be cleared for crossing. All four lanes were taken up by cars making their way into Lebanon, while those waiting to cross into Syria had to use an offroad. Of the six border crossings between Lebanon and Syria, two remain functional after Israeli airstrikes forced the others shut. The two countries share a border 375 kilometers (233 miles) long. Over 600,000 people fleeing Lebanon poured into Syria in the past year, most of them after the war between Israel and Hezbollah escalated in mid-September. The cross-border flow was a striking reversal in fortunes given that Lebanon is still hosting more than 1 million Syrian refugees who fled the war in their country that began in 2011. As the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah took hold early Wednesday, thousands of people began their return to Lebanon. Families packed into vehicles with suitcases, mattresses and blankets, while children clutched backpacks, some wrapped in blankets, as they made their way back to Lebanon Thursday. The mood was mixed with relief and sorrow as many returnees faced the grim reality of returning to their homes that might be destroyed. 'We have been in Syria since Sept. 23, we had to leave our jobs, our homes and our loved ones because of the war,' said Hasan Fliti, a 54-year-old dairy shop owner who is returning to Lebanon with his wife and two children. 'I am happy that there is a ceasefire and there is no more destruction. You are not afraid anymore of the airstrikes to hit.' On the first day of the ceasefire, more than 2,000 people crossed into Lebanon, a Syrian security official at the Jousieh border told The Associated Press. On Thursday, more than 4,000 crossed back into Lebanon and the number continues to rise. The hall at the border was filled with families waiting to get their passports or IDs stamped. Some smoked, others sat on their luggage, waiting for clearance as the flow of returnees steadily increased. Among them was 37-year-old Wafa Wehbe, who had sought refuge with her family in Syria for more than a month. 'My house is gone, but it is an indescribable feeling to go back,' she said. 'There’s a tragic sensation for the martyrs who had to die. The children are mourning.' Wehbe’s home in Khiyam, located in an area still under Israeli control, was destroyed, but she said she will now stay at her sister’s. 'I am also going back to mourn our martyrs. They died fighting at the frontlines.' Ghinwa Arzouni, who had sought refuge in Homs from southern Lebanon, said the journey home is both a relief and a challenge. 'We’re excited to go back, but I am afraid of the trip, it’s a long way back,' she said. 'Our house in the south is okay, it might have broken glass but will have to get there first to inspect for ourselves. We hope to return to Syria as tourists and not displaced.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-thousands-of-displaced-lebanese-return-from-syria-as-ceasefire-with-israel-holds/	2024-11-28T10:42:49-08:00	
Latest 'massive' Russian aerial attack cuts power to 1 million ho...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia conducted a 'massive' attack against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure on Thursday, firing nearly 200 missiles and drones and leaving more than a million households without power, Ukrainian officials said. Russia's second major aerial attack on Ukraine's power grid in less than two weeks amplified fears that the Kremlin aims to cripple the country's power generation capacity before winter. 'Attacks on energy facilities are happening all over Ukraine,' Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said in a post on Facebook. He added that emergency power outages were implemented nationwide. Russia in previous years has targeted Ukraine’s electricity generation, aiming to deny civilians critical heating and drinking water supplies during the bitter winter months and break Ukrainian spirits. The attacks also seek to hobble Ukraine’s defense industry that is now producing missiles, drones and armored vehicles, among other military assets. In some regions on Thursday, Kalibr cruise missiles with cluster munitions smashed into civilian targets, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, calling it 'an insidious escalation.' Cluster munitions release numerous small bombs over a wide area, making them dangerous to civilians both during and after an attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed his forces struck 17 Ukrainian targets Thursday, including military facilities and their 'support systems,' with 100 drones and 90 missiles. It was the 11th massive combined attack by Russia on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year. But the Ukrainian air force claimed to have shot down 76 cruise missiles and three other types of missile as well as 32 drones. It added that it lost track of 62 Russian drones, which most likely were jammed by electronic warfare. Neither side's claims could be independently verified. Ukrainian officials have warned recently that Russia was stockpiling cruise and ballistic missiles, presumably for another pre-winter aerial campaign against Ukraine’s power grid. Ukrainian officials have in the past accused Russia of 'weaponizing winter.' Such massive attacks have been a regular feature of the war. Around half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been destroyed during the almost three years of war with Russia, and rolling electricity blackouts are common. Kyiv's Western allies have sought to help Ukraine protect power generation with air defense systems and funds for rebuilding. Last March, the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants for two high-ranking Russian military officers on war crimes charges linked to attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure, including power plants and electricity sub-stations. The war has been going in Russia's favor in recent months as its bigger army uses its advantages in manpower and equipment to push Ukrainian forces backward in eastern areas, though its offensive has been slow and costly. Putin said that over the past two days Russia had fired 100 missiles and 466 drones at Ukraine, saying they were a response to Ukraine using American-made missiles to hit targets on Russian soil after gaining permission to do so from President Joe Biden. Speaking at a summit in Kazakhstan of a security alliance of former Soviet nations, Putin threatened to use a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, called Oreshnik, against 'decision-making centers' in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. The missile launched for the first time at Ukraine last week has six warheads and flies at 10 times the speed of sound, according to Putin, who declared that it can't be intercepted by any modern air defense systems. Oreshnik can penetrate underground bunkers and releases dozens of submunitions that 'turn everything to dust,' Putin said. The use of several Oreshnik missiles in one strike would be comparable in its devastating power to a nuclear weapon, he claimed. Explosions in Thursday's Russian attack were reported in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, Lutsk, and many other cities in central and western Ukraine. Zelenskyy urged Western countries to accelerate delivery of promised air defense weaponry. Ukrainian officials in the past have grumbled that military aid is slow to arrive. 'Each such attack proves that air defense systems are needed now in Ukraine, where they save lives, and not at storage bases,' Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging app. Russia uses large numbers of missiles and drones to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses and exploits weather conditions such as dense fog and cloud cover to make interceptions harder, the Ukrainian air force said. The head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andrii Yermak, said in a Telegram post that Russia had stockpiled missiles to strike Ukrainian infrastructure and wage war against civilians during the cold season. 'They were helped by their crazy allies, including from North Korea,' he wrote. Western governments and South Korea say North Korea in recent months has intensified its military support for Russia. The head of the Lviv region in western Ukraine, Maksym Kozytskyi, said the attack left more than half a million households without electricity. Over 280,000 households in the northwestern Rivne region were without electricity because of the attack, according to regional Gov. Oleksandr Koval. Running water supplies were also patchy in affected areas. Some schools in Rivne city switched to online classes. There were also strikes on the bordering Volyn region, where 215,000 households had no electricity, regional head Ivan Rudnytskyi said. All critical infrastructure that lost power was switched to generators. Energy infrastructure was also targeted in the western Ivano-Frankivsk region, local officials said. Air defenses were activated there, and emergency power outages were introduced. Local officials ordered the opening of 'points of invincibility' — shelter-type places where people can charge their phones and other electrical devices and get refreshments during blackouts. In Kyiv, where the air raid alert lasted over nine hours, missile debris fell in one neighborhood, local officials said. No casualties were reported. ___ Hatton reported from Lisbon, Portugal. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-strikes-cities-across-ukraine-targeting-the-countrys-energy-infrastructure/	2024-11-28T04:41:17-08:00	
White House pressing Ukraine to draft 18-year-olds so it has enou...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden's administration is urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and revamping its mobilization laws to allow for the conscription of those as young as 18. A senior Biden administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private consultations, said Wednesday that the outgoing Democratic administration wants Ukraine to lower the mobilization age to 18 from the current age of 25 to expand the pool of fighting-age men available to help a badly outnumbered Ukraine in its nearly three-year-old war with Russia. The official said 'the pure math' of Ukraine's situation now is that it needs more troops in the fight. Currently Ukraine is not mobilizing or training enough soldiers to replace its battlefield losses while keeping pace with Russia's growing military, the official added. The White House has pushed more than $56 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the start of Russia's February 2022 invasion and expects to send billions more to Kyiv before Biden leaves office in less than months. But with time running out, the Biden White House is also sharpening its viewpoint that Ukraine has the weaponry it needs and now must dramatically increase its troop levels if it's going to stay in the fight with Russia. White House National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett in a statement said the administration will continue sending Ukraine weaponry but believes 'manpower is the most vital need' Ukraine has at the moment. 'So, we’re also ready to ramp up our training capacity if they take appropriate steps to fill out their ranks,' Savett said. The Ukrainians have said they need about 160,000 additional troops to keep up with its battlefield needs, but the U.S. administration believes they probably will need more than that. More than 1 million Ukrainians are now in uniform, including the National Guard and other units. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been hearing concerns from allies in other Western capitals as well that Ukraine has a troop level problem and not an arms problem, according to European officials who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomatic conversations. The European allies have stressed that the lack of depth means that it may soon become untenable for Ukraine to continue to operate in Russia’s Kursk border region. The situation in Kursk has become further complicated by the arrival of thousands of North Korean troops, who have come to help Moscow try to claw back the land seized in a Ukrainian incursion this year. The stepped-up push on Ukraine to strengthen its fighting ranks comes as Ukraine braces for President-elect Donald Trump to take office on Jan. 20. The Republican said he would bring about a swift end to the war and has raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the vital U.S. military support for Ukraine. 'There are no easy answers to Ukraine’s serious manpower shortage, but lowering the draft age would help,' said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 'These are obviously difficult decisions for a government and society that has already endured so much due to Russia’s invasion.' Ukraine has taken steps to broaden the pool of draft-eligible men, but the efforts have only scratched the surface against a much larger Russian military. In April, Ukraine’s parliament passed a series of laws, including one lowering its draft-eligible age for men from 27 to 25, aimed at broadening the universe of men who could be called on to join the grinding war. Those laws also did away with some draft exemptions and created an online registry for recruits. They were expected to add about 50,000 troops, far short of what Zelenskyy said at the time was needed. Zelenskyy has consistently stated that he has no plans to lower the mobilization age. A senior Ukrainian official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ukraine does not have enough equipment to match the scale of its ongoing mobilization efforts. The official said Ukrainian officials see the push to the lower the draft age as part of an effort by some Western partners to deflect attention from their own delays in providing equipment or belated decisions. The official cited as an example the delay in giving Ukraine permission to use longer-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory. The Ukrainians do not see lowering the draft age to recruit more soldiers as a substitute for countering Russia’s advantage in equipment and weaponry, the official said. Conscription has been a sensitive matter in Ukraine throughout the war. Russia’s own problems with adequate troop levels and planning early in the war prevented Moscow from taking full advantage of its edge. But the tide has shifted and the U.S. says the Ukrainian shortage can no longer be overlooked. Some Ukrainians have expressed worry that further lowering the minimum conscription age and taking more young adults out of the workforce could backfire by further harming the war-ravaged economy. The senior Biden administration official added that the administration believes that Ukraine can also optimize its current force by more aggressively dealing with soldiers who desert or go absent without leave. ___ AP White House correspondent Zeke Miller and AP writer Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-white-house-pressing-ukraine-to-draft-18-year-old-men-to-help-fill-manpower-needs-to-battle-russia/	2024-11-27T15:52:49-08:00	
The Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire quiets one front but Gaza sees no ...	JERUSALEM (AP) — For many across the Middle East, the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire came as a relief: the first major sign of progress in the region since war began more than a year ago. But for Palestinians in Gaza and families of hostages held in the territory, the news appeared only to inaugurate a newer, grimmer period of the conflict there. For them, it marked yet another missed opportunity to end fighting that has stretched on for nearly 14 months. Palestinians had hoped that any ceasefire deal with Hezbollah would include a truce in Gaza as well. The families of people kidnapped when Hamas-led militants stormed southern Israel in October 2023, meanwhile, wanted part of the agreement to include returning their loved ones. Instead, the ceasefire was confined only to the fighting in Lebanon. 'We feel this is a missed opportunity to tie in the hostages in this agreement that was signed today,' said Ruby Chen, whose son, Itay Chen, was taken hostage from an Israeli military base and has been declared dead. As much as they were intertwined, the two wars have been very different. In Lebanon, Israel said its aim was to drive Hezbollah back from the countries’ shared border and end the militant group's barrages into northern Israel. The ceasefire that took effect Wednesday is intended to do that. In Gaza, Israel’s goals are more sweeping. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been resolute in insisting that Hamas must be completely destroyed and Israel must retain lasting control over parts of the territory. Months of talks have failed to get Netanyahu to back down from those demands — or to convince Hamas to release hostages under those terms. For Palestinians in Gaza, that means continuing misery under an Israeli campaign that has demolished much of the territory and driven almost the entire population from their homes. Hundreds of thousands are going hungry while living in squalid tent cities as the second winter of the war brings cold rains and flooding. 'They agree to a ceasefire in one place and not in the other? Have mercy on the children, the elderly and the women,' said Ahlam Abu Shalabi, living in tent in central Gaza. 'Now it is winter, and all the people are drowning.' Palestinians feel resigned to continued war The war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, 2023, when militants attacked Israel from Gaza, killing around 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has rained devastation on the Palestinian territory, killing over 44,000 people, according to local health officials. The officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and fighters in their count, say over half of the dead are women and children. Hezbollah began firing into Israel a day after Hamas' attack in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group. The two sides have exchanged near-daily barrages since. Moving thousands of troops to its northern border, Israel ramped up bombardment of southern Lebanon and launched a ground invasion there two months ago, killing many of Hezbollah’s leaders. Palestinians now fear Israel’s military can return its full focus to Gaza — a point that Netanyahu made as he announced the ceasefire in Lebanon on Tuesday. 'The pressure will be more on Gaza,' said Mamdouh Younis, a displaced man in a central Gaza tent camp. Netanyahu, he said, can now exploit the fact that 'Gaza has become alone, far from all the arenas that were supporting it, especially the Lebanon front.' Israeli troops are already engaged in fierce fighting in Gaza’s north, where a two-month offensive has cut off most aid and caused experts to warn a famine may be underway. Strikes all over the territory regularly kill dozens. In signing onto the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah reversed its long-held position that it wouldn’t stop its barrages across the border unless Israel ends the war in Gaza. 'This could have a psychological impact, as it will further entrench the understanding that Palestinians in Gaza are alone in resisting against their occupiers,' said Tariq Kenney Shawa, a U.S. policy fellow at Al-Shabaka, a Palestinian think tank. Hamas may dig its heels in It also leaves Hamas — its capabilities already severely damaged by Israel’s offensive — to fight alone. Hamas official Osama Hamdan appeared to accept Hezbollah’s new position in an interview Monday. 'Any announcement of a ceasefire is welcome. Hezbollah has stood by our people and made significant sacrifices,' Hamdan told the Lebanese broadcaster Al-Mayadeen, which is seen as politically allied with Hezbollah. Khalil Sayegh, a Palestinian analyst, said the ceasefire could make Hamas even less popular in Gaza, by proving the failure of its gambit that its attack on Israel would rally other militant groups to the fight. 'It’s a moment where we can see the Hamas messaging become weaker and weaker, as they struggle to justify their strategy to the public,' said Sayegh. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire could help force Hamas to the negotiating table because it would show the group that the 'cavalry is not on the way.' But Hamas experts predicted that it would only dig in both on the battlefield and in talks. Hamas has insisted it will only release all the hostages in return for a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. 'I expect Hamas will continue using guerrilla warfare to confront Israeli forces in Gaza as long as they remain,' said Shawa. Hostage families lose hope Dozens of Israelis thronged a major highway in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night, protesting for the return of the hostages as the country waited to hear if a ceasefire in Lebanon had been agreed. Around 100 people taken hostage are still held in Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the other hostages seized by Hamas were released during a ceasefire last year. Ricardo Grichener, the uncle of 23-year-old hostage Omer Wenkert, said the ceasefire with Hezbollah showed how the Israeli government was openly disregarding the hostages. Even though Israel has inflicted greater damage on Hamas in Gaza than on Hezbollah in Lebanon, he said 'the decision to postpone a deal in Gaza and release the hostages is not based on the same military success criteria.' The most recent effort to wind down the war stalled in October. U.S. President Joe Biden said Tuesday he would begin a renewed push, but his administration is now in its waning days after the reelection of former President Donald Trump. 'This ceasefire doesn’t concern our hostages. I believe that Netanyahu forgot about them, and he just wants to keep fighting in Gaza,' said Ifat Kalderon, clutching a photo of her cousin, Ofer Kalderon, who is a hostage and a father to four. 'Ofer yesterday had his 54th birthday. His second birthday in Gaza,' she said. 'It’s unbelievable that he’s still there.' ___ This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Ruby Chen's first name.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-the-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-quiets-one-front-but-gaza-faces-continuing-war/	2024-11-27T06:58:58-08:00	
Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire appears to hold as Lebanese stream sou...	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — A ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah that began Wednesday appeared to be holding, as residents in cars heaped with belongings streamed back toward southern Lebanon despite warnings from Israeli and Lebanese troops that they stay away from certain areas. If it holds, the ceasefire would bring an end to nearly 14 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which escalated in mid-September into all-out war and threatened to pull Hezbollah's patron, Iran, and Israel's closest ally, the United States, into a broader conflagration. The deal does not address the war in Gaza., where Israeli strikes overnight on two schools-turned-shelters in Gaza City killed 11 people, including four children, according to hospital officials. Israel said one of the strikes targeted a Hamas sniper and the other targeted militants hiding among civilians. The truce in Lebanon could give some reprieve to the 1.2 million Lebanese displaced by the fighting and the tens of thousands of Israelis who fled their homes along the border. 'They were a nasty and ugly 60 days,' said Mohammed Kaafarani, 59, who was displaced from the Lebanese village of Bidias. 'We reached a point where there was no place to hide.' The U.S.- and France-brokered deal, approved by Israel late Tuesday, calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. Thousands of additional Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor compliance. Israel says it reserves the right to strike Hezbollah should it violate the terms of the deal. Israel is still fighting Hamas militants in Gaza in response to the group’s cross-border raid into southern Israel in October 2023. But President Joe Biden on Tuesday said his administration would make another push in the coming days to try to renew efforts for a deal in the war-ravaged Palestinian enclave. Lebanese are streaming south despite warnings Hours after the ceasefire came into effect, thousands of people drove south from Beirut with their belongings and mattresses tied on top of their cars. Traffic was gridlocked at the northern entrance of the port city of Sidon. 'This is a moment of victory, pride and honor for us, the Shiite sect, and for all of Lebanon,' said Hussein Sweidan, a resident returning to the port city of Tyre. He said he saw the ceasefire as a victory for Hezbollah. The Shiite militant group has often faced criticism from members of Lebanon's other religious communities. Sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard at a main roundabout in the city, as drivers honked their horns and residents cheered. The Israeli military warned displaced Lebanese not to return to evacuated villages in southern Lebanon, where Israeli troops were still present following the ground invasion in early October. The Israeli military said forces opened fire to push back a number of vehicles that were entering a restricted area. An Israeli security official said Israeli forces remain in their positions hours after the ceasefire began and will only gradually withdraw. The official said the pace of the withdrawal and the scheduled return of Lebanese civilians would depend on whether the deal is implemented and enforced. The official was not authorized to discuss the deal and its implementation with the media, and so spoke on condition of anonymity. The Lebanese military asked displaced people returning to southern Lebanon to avoid frontline villages and towns until Israeli forces withdraw. Residents will return to vast destruction wrought by the Israeli military during its campaign, which flattened entire villages. The military said it found vast weapons caches and infrastructure it says was meant for Hezbollah to launch an Oct. 7-style attack on northern Israel. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon since the start of the conflict, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. Some Israelis are concerned the deal doesn't go far enough In Israel, the mood was far more subdued, with displaced Israelis concerned that the deal did not go far enough to rein in Hezbollah and that it did not address Gaza and the hostages still held there. 'I think it is still not safe to return to our homes because Hezbollah is still close to us,' said Eliyahu Maman, an Israeli displaced from the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona, which is not far from the border with Lebanon and was hit hard by the months of fighting. On Wednesday morning, Kiryat Shmona remained quiet on a cold, rainy day. A handful of people milled about, inspecting damage from earlier rocket attacks, including to the roof of a bus. The town’s shopping mall, which had been hit before, appeared to have new damage, and a rocket was seen stuck in the ground next to an apartment building. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel, more than half civilians, as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon. A significant return of the displaced to their communities, many of which have suffered extensive damage from rocket fire, could take months. Israel can claim major victories in the war, including the killing of Hezbollah’s top leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of its senior commanders, as well as the destruction of extensive militant infrastructure. A complex attack involving exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, widely attributed to Israel, appeared to show a remarkable degree of penetration of the secretive militant group. Hezbollah emerges from the war battered and bloodied, with the reputation it built by fighting Israel to a stalemate in the 2006 war tarnished. Yet its fighters still managed to put up heavy resistance on the ground, slowing Israel’s advance while continuing to fire scores of rockets, missiles and drones across the border each day. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

Middle East latest: Displaced people return to south Lebanon as c...	Long-displaced residents of south Lebanon started returning to their homes hours after a ceasefire between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group took effect early Wednesday morning. The ceasefire has brought relief across the Mediterranean nation, coming after days of some of the most intense airstrikes and clashes since the war began, though many wondered if the agreement to stop fighting would hold. Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the ceasefire agreement, which was announced Tuesday. Thousands of people made their way into southern Lebanon, defying a warning from the Israeli military to stay away from previously evacuated areas. At least 42 people were killed by Israeli strikes across Lebanon on Tuesday, according to local authorities. Hezbollah also fired rockets into Israel on Tuesday, triggering air raid sirens in the country’s north. The Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire marks the first major step toward ending the regionwide unrest triggered by Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but it does not address the devastating war in Gaza. Hezbollah began attacking Israel a day after Hamas’ attack. The fighting in Lebanon escalated into all-out war in September with massive Israeli airstrikes across the country and an Israeli ground invasion of the south. In Gaza, more than 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 wounded in the nearly 14-month war between Israel and Hamas, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. ___ Here's the Latest: Children among 11 killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza, officials say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes on two schools turned shelters in Gaza City killed 11 people, including four children, hospital officials said. One strike hit the Tabeen School, killing nine, and another targeted Al-Hureyah School, leaving two dead. Both were sheltering hundreds of displaced people. The Israeli military said it struck Mumin Al-Jabari, a senior fighter with Hamas’ sniper unit. It said he had operated in a room inside the Tabeen School, without providing evidence. The military had no immediate comment on claims that it struck the second school. The military said Al-Jabari carried out attacks against Israeli troops in Gaza and had stored weapons in the room he was operating from. At Al-Ahli Hospital, Saeed Abu Salah, who sought shelter in Tabeen School, said the airstrike killed his daughter and granddaughter. He had already lost four of his children since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, including two whose bodies were still under rubble. 'For the millionth time, the Israeli occupation commits crimes against innocent civilians,' he said. Abu Salah held his granddaughter wrapped in a white shroud, while a crying mother nearby held the body of her dead child in her arms. Associated Press footage on Wednesday showed the collapsed roof at the Tabeen School. Dozens gathered outside, some using equipment and bare hands to pull out bodies from under the rubble. One man carried a dead child covered in a blanket. Aid groups welcome ceasefire and urge donors to step up BEIRUT — International aid groups welcomed the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah and urge donors to provide funding to help rebuild parts of Lebanon and assist the displaced. The aid groups are concerned about the aftershocks of the war on Lebanon’s already struggling economy. With more than 1.2 million people displaced, they warned that the damage would leave many struggling and without homes. More than 100,000 homes have been either partially or fully destroyed across southern Lebanon, Bekaa and Beirut, the International Rescue Committee said. Mercy Corps said that half of Lebanon’s population now lives below the poverty line. It called on donors to fulfill pledges to support immediate humanitarian efforts and the long-term recovery. 'There will undoubtedly be a great deal of grief and trauma. Many will have no homes to return to, no schools for their children, and livelihoods destroyed,' Norwegian Refugee Council Secretary-General Jan Egeland said. Lebanese who fled to Syria start returning home MASNAA BORDER CROSSING — Among the Lebanese hoping to return home following a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah are thousands who had fled the war to Syria. Families with hastily packed belongings on Wednesday crossed under heavy rain from Syria into eastern Lebanon. The road, heavily damaged by Israeli airstrikes, is under repair. Mariam Mawla, from Bazouria in southern Lebanon, was thrilled to be returning home after two months in Syrian capital Damascus. As she waited in traffic at the crossing, she told The Associated Press that she hoped to find her house intact. 'I heard that there might be some damage, but no matter what, we thank God that we are returning home,' Mawla said. France will work with Netanyahu despite an arrest warrant PARIS — France says it 'intends to continue to work in close collaboration' with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu despite the arrest warrant issued for him by the world’s top war-crimes court. Since the International Criminal Court issued warrants last week, French officials have replied vaguely to questions about whether France would arrest Netanyahu should he visit the country. Prime Minister Michel Barnier told parliament this week that France would 'rigorously' respect its obligations according to international law. The position was echoed by France’s foreign minister in a broadcast interview Wednesday morning. But in a subsequent statement, the French Foreign Ministry argued that Netanyahu and others affected by the court warrants benefit from immunity because Israel is not a member of the court. It said this would be 'taken into consideration if the ICC was to ask us for their arrest and handing over.' The statement cited 'the historic friendship that links France and Israel' and described them as 'two democracies committed to the rule of law and respect for professional and independent justice.' Fighting rages in Gaza as ceasefire takes hold in Lebanon TEL AVIV, Israel — As a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah appears to hold in Lebanon, fighting raged on in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday. The Gaza Health Ministry said 33 bodies had been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours, raising the death toll in the nearly 14-month-long war to 44,282. The Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says more than half of the dead are women and children. The Israeli military said it struck dozens of Hamas sites in hard-hit northern Gaza, including weapons storage facilities and military structures. It said it warned civilians to evacuate the area beforehand. The military has battled for weeks a resurgence of Hamas in the area, which was an early target of Israel’s offensive. The Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire has no direct bearing on the conflict in Gaza, where international mediators have struggled to secure a truce. Israeli forces will only gradually withdraw from Lebanon, official says JERUSALEM — An Israeli security official says Israeli forces remain in their positions hours after a ceasefire took place and will only gradually withdraw from southern Lebanon. The official, speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity under military briefing rules, would not say when troops would begin the withdrawal but said it would be completed during the 60-day period laid out in the ceasefire agreement. He said the pace of the withdrawal and the scheduled return of Lebanese civilians to their homes would depend on whether the deal is implemented and enforced by all sides. 'We need to see the mechanism is working,' he said. 'It’s a gradual agreement. It’s a gradual withdrawal.' The official said Israeli soldiers were responding to an immediate threat when they opened fire earlier Wednesday at several vehicles approaching a restricted area in Lebanon. There were no reports on casualties. The official said that Israel was prepared to do so again if troops were at risk. 'We will fire when our forces are threatened,' he said. He said non-immediate threats would be reported to the international monitoring committee, but that if no action is taken, 'we will enforce it.' — By Josef Federman Hamas ready to cooperate in efforts to bring about ceasefire in Gaza CAIRO — Hamas says it’s ready to cooperate with any effort to bring about a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, after Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah reached a truce to end months of fighting. The deal does not address the war in Gaza. International mediators have repeatedly failed to bring Israel and Hamas to a deal that would end the brutal, 13-month-long war. In a statement, Hamas repeated it would seek the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the return of displaced Palestinians and a 'real and complete prisoner exchange deal.' Israel has refused to commit to ending the war under any ceasefire deal and some members of the Israeli government have balked over freeing large number of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the roughly 100 hostages still held by militants in Gaza. President Joe Biden said Tuesday he hoped for a renewed international push for negotiations in coming days. Lebanon’s caretaker government approves Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire BEIRUT — Lebanon’s caretaker government on Wednesday approved a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between the militant Hezbollah group and Israel. The move was largely a formality but also signaled the government’s commitment to its part in the deal, including deploying Lebanese soldiers along the border with Israel and cooperating with United Nations peacekeepers. 'Today is a new day, where we hope it carries with it peace and stability,' caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said in a statement following the morning meeting. The agreement is an implementation plan for U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed in 2006 to end the last Israel-Hezbollah war but never was fully carried out. Its goal was for the Lebanese military to be the exclusive armed presence in southern Lebanon alongside U.N. peacekeepers, and for Hezbollah and Israeli forces to withdraw from the area. According to a copy of the ceasefire agreement provided by the Lebanese government, the Lebanese military would gradually deploy in the south and dismantle unauthorized military infrastructure and weapons production facilities. The United States and France, in addition to UNIFIL peacekeepers, will monitor violations and support the process. German chancellor expresses relief over ceasefire in Lebanon BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has expressed relief over the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire and called on both sides to stick to the agreement. 'Finally, Hezbollah and Israel have agreed on a ceasefire in Lebanon, brokered by our partners USA and France,' Scholz wrote Wednesday on X. 'It is important that everyone sticks to what has been agreed, so that people on both sides of the border can live in safety again.' Germany is a staunch ally of Israel, but at the same time home to a Lebanese immigrant community of more than 100,000. Lebanese politician who helped broker ceasefire calls for effort to fill the country’s presidency BEIRUT — The speaker of Lebanon’s parliament called for another effort to fill the country’s long-vacant presidency just hours after a ceasefire to halt hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel went into effect. Lebanon has been without a president since October 2022, as its deeply divided parliament has been unable to elect a new head of state. The last effort to elect a president was more than a year ago. Speaker Nabih Berri called for political parties to come together to elect a president 'who unites rather than divides.' 'I call upon you because a moment of truth in which we must unite for the sake of Lebanon has arrived,' Berri said in a televised address. 'This is a test for how we can save Lebanon. How we can build it and how we can bring back life for its constitutional institutions.' The war compounded Lebanon’s economic troubles and worsened tensions between political groups allied and opposed to Hezbollah. Berri spearheaded Lebanon’s negotiation efforts for a U.S.-brokered ceasefire to end the war between Israel and Hezbollah. He’s a top Shiite politician and a key ally of Hezbollah. Iran-backed Iraqi militia vows to continue fighting Israel BAGHDAD — One of the most powerful Iran-backed factions in Iraq said it would continue its operations in support of Gaza despite the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire. Iraqi militias have repeatedly launched attacks on Israel from Iraq in the nearly 14 months since the Israel-Hamas war broke out. In a statement, the Kataib Hezbollah group said that the ceasefire would not have been possible without the 'resilience of Hezbollah fighters and the failure of the Zionists to achieve their objectives, making the decision solely Lebanese.' The group said that a pause by one member of the so-called Axis of Resistance, which includes Iran-backed groups from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, would not undermine the broader 'unity of fronts' strategy. The militia also said the U.S. had been Israel’s partner 'in all acts of betrayal, killing, destruction and displacement,' and said it 'will eventually have to pay for its actions.' A Lebanese man who's lived through multiple wars says this one has been the worst TYRE, Lebanon — Mohammed Kaafarani has lived through multiple conflicts with Israel. But he says the past two months were the worst of them all. 'They were a nasty and ugly 60 days,' said Kaafarani, 59, who was displaced from the Lebanese village of Bidias, near the southern port city of Tyre. Thousands of displaced people poured into the city Wednesday after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect. Kaafarani said the latest war was the most difficult because the bombardment was so intense. 'We reached a point where there was no place to hide. Even buildings were destroyed.' He said Tyre was left almost empty as most of its residents fled. Kaafarani said he hopes his children and grandchildren will have a better future without wars because 'our generation suffered and is still suffering.' 'The last two months were way too long,' said Kaafarani, whose home was badly damaged in the fighting. He vowed to fix it and continue on with life. Some people displaced from northern Israeli towns say they still don’t feel safe enough to return HAIFA, Israel — Some people in Israel who have been displaced by fighting with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah say the ceasefire deal doesn’t make them feel secure enough to go home. Some 50,000 people have been displaced from a string of cities, towns and villages along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. Those communities have been pummeled by Hezbollah rocket and drone fire for 13 months, with dozens of houses damaged and in need of rebuilding or rehabilitation. Noy Friedman, who was displaced from the town of Shlomi to the city of Haifa, said she wouldn’t feel safe in her hometown. 'I am also not ready for my family to return to Shlomi,' said Friedman. Many displaced Israelis have been living in hotels since the fighting began in Oct. 2023 or have tried to reestablish their lives in new areas far from the fighting. Returning could take months because of the damage caused to the communities, but also because of the fears many of the displaced still feel. On a cold, rainy Wednesday morning, the hard-hit Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona was quiet. A handful of people milled about, inspecting damage from rocket attacks, including to the roof of a bus. The town’s shopping mall, which had been hit before, appeared to have new damage. A rocket was seen stuck in the ground next to an apartment building. 'I am against the ceasefire,' said Eliyahu Maman, a Kiryat Shmona resident displaced to Haifa who feared Hezbollah could still attack from southern Lebanon. 'I am not ready to return to Kiryat Shmona.' Jordan says ceasefire is ‘an important step’ AMMAN, Jordan — Jordan on Wednesday welcomed the ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, saying it should be followed by an international effort to wind down the war in Gaza. In a statement, Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the ceasefire 'an important step.' But it said 'Israeli aggression on Gaza' must be stopped. Jordan expressed support for Lebanon and stressed the importance of fully implementing the ceasefire. Jordan is a close Western ally that made peace with Israel in 1994. But Israel’s devastating offensive in the Gaza Strip, launched after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, has strained relations. The country has a large Palestinian population which has demonstrated regularly against the war in Gaza. Gaza residents hope for ceasefire after nearly 14 months of grueling war KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Palestinians said Wednesday they hoped there would be a ceasefire in Gaza now that Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah agreed to a truce. But some feared that Israel would be more heavy handed with Gaza now that its forces were freed up from the fighting against Hezbollah. 'The situation will be worse, because the pressure will be more on Gaza,' said Mamdouh Yonis, a man currently living in Khan Younis after being displaced from the southern city of Rafah, told The Associated Press. Palestinians in Gaza are desperately waiting for a ceasefire agreement that would end the war between Hamas and Israel. It’s already killed over 44,000 people according to local authorities, who don’t distinguish between combatants and civilians in their count. The war was sparked when Hamas raided southern Israel in Oct. 2023, killing 1,200 and kidnapping 250, about 100 of whom remain in Gaza. International mediation efforts meant to clinch a deal have faltered repeatedly, and the war is now in its 14th month with no end in sight. 'They agree to a ceasefire in one place and not in the other? Have mercy on the children, the elderly and the women. We are sitting in tents and now it is winter,' said Ahlam Abu Shalabi, a woman displaced from Gaza City. Turkey welcomes ceasefire in Lebanon ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey welcomed the ceasefire reached between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, expressing hope that it would lead to a lasting truce. In a statement issued Wednesday, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry also called on the international community to exert pressure on Israel to force it to 'strictly comply with the ceasefire and compensate for the damage it has caused in Lebanon.' The ministry also urged the establishment of 'permanent and comprehensive' ceasefire in Gaza, calling on Israel to 'end its aggressive policies.' Israeli military says it fired at cars in Lebanon after they approached restricted area TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said Wednesday that its forces opened fire in Lebanon on a number of cars that approached an area it said was restricted, as a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah appeared to take hold. The military said the vehicles drove away. It was not immediately clear if there were any injuries as a result. The Israeli military has warned residents of previously evacuated areas of Lebanon that had been evacuated, but displaced people have been streaming south to their homes. The military said soldiers remained in position in southern Lebanon and that the air force was ready to act if needed. It said Israel’s aerial defense array was also at the ready for any ceasefire violations. France highlights its role in brokering the deal PARIS — France’s foreign minister underlined his country’s role in brokering an agreement that ended fighting between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group alongside the U.S., saying the deal wouldn’t have been possible without France’s special relationship with its former protectorate. 'It’s a success for French diplomacy and we can be proud,' said the minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, speaking hours after the ceasefire went into effect Wednesday. 'It is true that the United States have a privileged relationship with Israel. But with Lebanon, it’s France that has very old ties, very close ties,' the minister added. 'It would not have been possible to envisage a ceasefire in Lebanon without France being involved on the front line.' France will be involved in monitoring the ceasefire, Barrot noted, with 700 French soldiers deployed as part of the 10,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, that has been patrolling the border area between Lebanon and Israel for nearly 50 years. The minister said France will also work to strengthen Lebanese troops that will deploy in the south of the country as part of the ceasefire, although he didn’t specify what that might include. Lebanese military warns people returning homes in south Lebanon to wait for Israeli troops to leave BEIRUT — The Lebanese military asked displaced people returning to southern Lebanon to avoid frontline villages and towns near the border where the Israeli military is still present until the troops withdraw. Thousands of people have been returning to other previously evacuated areas in south Lebanon in defiance of an Israeli warning to avoid all previously evacuated areas. Many of those areas were hit by strikes just hours before the ceasefire took effect. Iran welcomes ceasefire DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran welcomed the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, Tehran's main militant partner in the Mideast. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei praised the ceasefire in a statement Wednesday morning. Baghaei said that Iran still sought a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. But like Hezbollah, it's dropped the demand that a ceasefire also take place at the same time in the Gaza Strip. He also called for the International Criminal Court to try the 'criminals of the occupying regime,' referring to Israel. The ICC has issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s former defense minister. Celebrations and relief as displaced people return to Tyre TYRE, Lebanon — Displaced people started returning to the coastal city of Tyre on motorcycles and in cars early Wednesday, defying an Israeli military warning to stay away from previously evacuated areas. Ahmad Husseini said returning to southern Lebanon was an 'indescribable feeling' and praised Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, who led Lebanon’s negotiations with Washington. 'He made us and everyone proud.' Husseini, who earlier fled a town near the coastal city, spoke to The Associated Press while in his car with family members. Meanwhile, sporadic celebratory gunfire could be heard at a main roundabout in the city, as people returning honked the horns of cars — some piled with mattresses — and residents cheered. A couple of men shouted slogans praising slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in September. Hussein Sweidan said he sees the ceasefire as a victory for Hezbollah. 'This is a moment of victory, pride and honor for us, the Shia sect, and for all of Lebanon,' he said. Smoke rises over Beirut from overnight strikes BEIRUT — As dawn broke in Beirut, plumes of smoke were visible rising from places hit by Israeli strikes before the ceasefire took effect at 4 a.m. Residents of Lebanon’s capital and its southern suburbs endured the most intense day of strikes since the war began on Tuesday. Lebanon sees quiet, but recovery could be slow BEIRUT — As the ceasefire went into effect early Wednesday, much of Lebanon was quiet for the first time since late September, following weeks of intense overnight strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon. Some celebratory gunshots could be heard in parts of Beirut’s southern suburbs, battered over the past two months. Israel’s Arabic military spokesperson Avichay Adraee has warned displaced Lebanese not to return to their villages in southern Lebanon, but some videos circulating on social media show displaced Lebanese defying these calls and returning to villages in the south near the coastal city of Tyre. Israeli troops are still present in parts of southern Lebanon after Israel launched a ground invasion in October. Lebanese have also been displaced from other parts of the country, notably the southern Beirut suburbs and the eastern Bekaa province. It’s unclear how long it will take cash-strapped Lebanon to rebuild these bombarded neighborhoods. The war has displaced some 1.2 million people, according to the Lebanese government. Israeli military says its evacuation orders in south Lebanon are in still in effect JERUSALEM — As the ceasefire took effect early Wednesday, Israel’s military warned people with homes in areas of south Lebanon that it ordered evacuated to stay away for now. Israeli military spokesman Col. Avichay Adraee issued the warning on the social platform X. 'You are prohibited from heading towards the villages that the IDF has ordered to be evacuated or towards IDF forces in the area,' Adraee wrote, using an acronym for the Israeli military. 'For your safety and the safety of your family members, refrain from moving to the area.' There were no immediate signs of renewed fighting as the ceasefire took hold early Wednesday morning. Ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon begins The ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants has begun as a region on edge wonders whether it will hold. The ceasefire announced Tuesday is a major step toward ending nearly 14 months of fighting sparked by the ongoing war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the ceasefire agreement. The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. An international panel led by the United States will monitor compliance. The ceasefire began at 4 a.m. Wednesday, a day after Israel carried out its most intense wave of airstrikes in Beirut since the start of the conflict that in recent weeks turned into all-out war.

What to know about the ceasefire deal between Israel and Lebanon'...	A ceasefire deal that went into effect on Wednesday could end more than a year of cross-border fighting between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, raising hopes and renewing difficult questions in a region gripped by conflict. The U.S.- and France-brokered deal, approved by Israel late Tuesday, calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. It offers both sides an off-ramp from hostilities that have driven more than 1.2 million Lebanese and 50,000 Israelis from their homes. An intense bombing campaign by Israel has left more than 3,700 people dead, many of them civilians, Lebanese officials say. Over 130 people have been killed on the Israeli side. But while it could significantly calm the tensions that have inflamed the region, the deal does little directly to resolve the much deadlier war that has raged in Gaza since the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023 that killed 1,200 people. Hezbollah, which began firing scores of rockets into Israel the following day in support of Hamas, previously said it would keep fighting until there was a stop to the fighting in Gaza. With the new cease-fire, it has backed away from that pledge, in effect leaving Hamas isolated and fighting a war alone. Here’s what to know about the tentative ceasefire agreement and its potential implications: The terms of the deal The agreement reportedly calls for a 60-day halt in fighting that would see Israeli troops retreat to their side of the border while requiring Hezbollah to end its armed presence in a broad swath of southern Lebanon. President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the deal is set to take effect at 4 a.m. local time on Wednesday (9 p.m. EST Tuesday). Under the deal, thousands of Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers are to deploy to the region south of the Litani River. An international panel lead by the U.S. would monitor compliance by all sides. Biden said the deal 'was designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.' Israel has demanded the right to act should Hezbollah violate its obligations, but Lebanese officials rejected writing that into the proposal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that the military would strike Hezbollah if the U.N. peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, does not enforce the deal. Lingering uncertainty Hezbollah indicated it would give the ceasefire pact a chance, but one of the group's leaders said the group's support for the deal hinged on clarity that Israel would not renew its attacks. 'After reviewing the agreement signed by the enemy government, we will see if there is a match between what we stated and what was agreed upon by the Lebanese officials,' Mahmoud Qamati, deputy chair of Hezbollah’s political council, told the Qatari satellite news network Al Jazeera. 'We want an end to the aggression, of course, but not at the expense of the sovereignty of the state' of Lebanon, he said. The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said Tuesday that Israel’s security concerns had been addressed in the deal. Where the fighting has left both sides After months of cross-border bombings, Israel can claim major victories, including the killing of Hezbollah’s top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, most of his senior commanders and the destruction of extensive militant infrastructure. A complex attack in September involving the explosion of hundreds of walkie-talkies and pagers used by Hezbollah was widely attributed to Israel, signaling a remarkable penetration of the militant group. The damage inflicted on Hezbollah has hit not only in its ranks, but the reputation it built by fighting Israel to a stalemate in the 2006 war. Still, its fighters managed to put up heavy resistance on the ground, slowing Israel’s advance while continuing to fire scores of rockets, missiles and drones across the border each day. The ceasefire offers relief to both sides, giving Israel’s overstretched army a break and allowing Hezbollah leaders to tout the group’s effectiveness in holding their ground despite Israel’s massive advantage in weaponry. But the group is likely to face a reckoning, with many Lebanese accusing it of tying their country’s fate to Gaza’s at the service of key ally Iran, inflicting great damage on a Lebanese economy that was already in grave condition. No answers for Gaza Until now, Hezbollah has insisted that it would only halt its attacks on Israel when it agreed to stop fighting in Gaza. Some in the region are likely to view a deal between the Lebanon-based group and Israel as a capitulation. In Gaza, where officials say the war has killed more than 44,000 Palestinians, Israel’s attacks have inflicted a heavy toll on Hamas, including the killing of the group’s top leaders. But Hamas fighters continue to hold scores of Israeli hostages, giving the militant group a bargaining chip if indirect ceasefire negotiations resume. Hamas is likely to continue to demand a lasting truce and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in any such deal, while Netanyahu on Tuesday reiterated his pledge to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed and all hostages are freed. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, whose forces were ousted from Gaza by Hamas in 2007 and who hopes to one day rule over the territory again as part of an independent Palestinian state, offered a pointed reminder Tuesday of the intractability of the war, demanding urgent international intervention. 'The only way to halt the dangerous escalation we are witnessing in the region, and maintain regional and international stability, security and peace, is to resolve the question of Palestine,' he said in a speech to the U.N. read by his ambassador.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-what-to-know-about-ceasefire-deal-between-israel-and-lebanons-hezbollah/	2024-11-27T01:06:58-08:00	
President Biden confirms Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) -- President Joe Biden announced from the White House Tuesday that Israel and the terror group Hezbollah agreed to the U.S.-led ceasefire deal. 'Peace is possible,' President Biden said. 'The fighting across the Lebanese border will end, will end.' The agreement, which the president said takes effect Wednesday morning, aims to create safe enough conditions over the next two months to allow people to return to their homes in northern Israel and southern Lebanon, as heavy fighting still continued Tuesday. 'All told this has been the deadliest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in decades,' President Biden said. An international committee led by the U.S. will help monitor both sides' compliance with the deal, but the Pentagon would not say what that entails. 'I don't want to get ahead of the process here,' Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said ahead of the president's announcement. Israel's deputy foreign minister, Sharren Haskel, struck a different tone if Hezbollah violates the agreement. 'We will react immediately,' Haskel said. President Biden said he has hope coming out of this deal but made a point to say Israel maintains its right to defend itself if Hezbollah breaks the agreement. While this ceasefire deal would not directly impact Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken remains hopeful for indirect ramifications. 'Hamas will know that it can't count on other fronts opening up in the war,' Blinken said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/president-biden-confirms-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-deal/	2024-11-26T14:01:30-08:00	
Israel's Netanyahu says he supports proposed ceasefire with Leban...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday recommended his Cabinet approve a United States-brokered ceasefire agreement with Lebanon's Hezbollah, setting the stage for an end to nearly 14 months of fighting linked to the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. In the hours leading up to the Cabinet meeting, Israel carried out its most intense wave of strikes in Beirut and its southern suburbs and issued a record number of evacuation warnings. At least 23 people were killed in strikes across the country, according to local authorities, as Israel signaled it aims to keep pummeling Hezbollah in the final hours before any ceasefire takes hold. A ceasefire would mark the first major step toward ending the regionwide unrest triggered by Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. But it does not address the devastating war in Gaza. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring peace to the Middle East, but neither he nor Netanyahu have proposed a postwar solution for the Palestinian territory, where Hamas is still holding dozens of hostages and the conflict is more intractable. Still, any halt to the fighting in Lebanon is expected to reduce the likelihood of war between Israel and Iran, which backs both Hezbollah and Hamas and exchanged direct fire with Israel on two occasions earlier this year. Israel says it will ‘attack with might’ if Hezbollah breaks truce In a televised statement, Netanyahu said he would present the ceasefire proposal to Cabinet ministers later Tuesday, when they are expected to vote on it. He listed a series of accomplishments against Israel’s enemies across the region and said a ceasefire with Hezbollah would further isolate Hamas in Gaza and allow Israel to focus on its main enemy, Iran, which backs both groups. 'If Hezbollah breaks the agreement and tries to rearm, we will attack,' he said. 'For every violation, we will attack with might.' It was not immediately clear when the ceasefire would go into effect, and the exact terms of the deal were not released. The deal calls for a two-month initial halt in fighting and would require Hezbollah to end its armed presence in a broad swath of southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops would return to their side of the border. Thousands of additional Lebanese troopsand U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor all sides’ compliance. But implementation remains a major question mark. Israel has demanded the right to act should Hezbollah violate its obligations. Lebanese officials have rejected writing that into the proposal. Hezbollah has said it accepts the proposal, but a senior official with the group said Tuesday that it had not seen the agreement in its final form. 'After reviewing the agreement signed by the enemy government, we will see if there is a match between what we stated and what was agreed upon by the Lebanese officials,' Mahmoud Qamati, deputy chair of Hezbollah’s political council, told the Al Jazeera news network. 'We want an end to the aggression, of course, but not at the expense of the sovereignty of the state.' of Lebanon, he said. 'Any violation of sovereignty is refused.' Bombardment of Beirut's southern suburbs continues Even as Israeli, U.S, Lebanese and international officials have expressed growing optimism over a ceasefire, Israel has continued its campaign in Lebanon, which it says aims to cripple Hezbollah’s military capabilities. An Israeli strike on Tuesday leveled a residential building in the central Beirut district of Basta — the second time in recent days warplanes have hit the crowded area near the city’s downtown. At least seven people were killed and 37 wounded, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. Israel also struck a building in the bustling commercial district of Hamra for the first time, hitting a site that is around 400 meters (yards) from Lebanon's Central Bank. There was no immediate word on casualties. Three people were killed in a separate strike in Beirut and three in a strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon. Lebanese state media said another 10 people were killed in the eastern Baalbek province. Israel says it targets Hezbollah fighters and their infrastructure. The evacuation warnings covered many areas, including parts of Beirut that previously have not been targeted. The warnings, coupled with fear that Israel was ratcheting up attacks before a ceasefire, sent residents fleeing. Traffic was gridlocked, and some cars had mattresses tied to them. Dozens of people, some wearing their pajamas, gathered in a central square, huddling under blankets or standing around fires as Israeli drones buzzed loudly overhead. Hezbollah, meanwhile, kept up its rocket fire, triggering air raid sirens across northern Israel. Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee issued evacuation warnings for 20 buildings in Beirut's southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a major presence, as well as a warning for the southern town of Naqoura where the U.N. peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL, is headquartered. UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti told The Associated Press that peacekeepers will not evacuate. The Israeli military also said its ground troops clashed with Hezbollah forces and destroyed rocket launchers in the Slouqi area on the eastern end of the Litani River, a few kilometers (miles) from the Israeli border. Under the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah would be required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border. Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel, saying it was showing support for the Palestinians, a day after Hamas carried out its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, triggering the Gaza war. Israel returned fire on Hezbollah, and the two sides have been exchanging barrages ever since. Israel escalated its campaign of bombardment in mid-September and later sent troops into Lebanon, vowing to put an end to Hezbollah fire so tens of thousands of evacuated Israelis could return to their homes. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon the past 13 months, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The bombardment has driven 1.2 million people from their homes. Israel says it has killed more than 2,000 Hezbollah members. Hezbollah fire has forced some 50,000 Israelis to evacuate in the country’s north, and its rockets have reached as far south in Israel as Tel Aviv. At least 75 people have been killed, more than half of them civilians. More than 50 Israeli soldiers have died in the ground offensive in Lebanon.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/israels-netanyahu-says-he-supports-proposed-ceasefire-with-lebanons-hezbollah/	2024-11-26T11:28:11-08:00	
Russia expels British diplomat after accusing him of spying	MOSCOW (AP) — Russian authorities on Tuesday ordered a British diplomat to leave the country on allegations of spying that the U.K. dismissed as 'baseless' as tensions soar over the conflict in Ukraine. Russia's Federal Security Service, the top domestic security and counterintelligence agency, said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies that the diplomat had provided false personal data while seeking permission to enter the country. The agency, known by its Russian acronym FSB, alleged that he has worked for British intelligence under diplomatic cover, replacing one of the six British diplomats who were expelled from Russia in August. The FSB alleged that the diplomat was involved in 'intelligence and subversive activities that threatened the security of the Russian Federation.' Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said a decision was made to revoke the diplomat's accreditation and he has been ordered to leave the country within two weeks. She said the ministry has summoned the British ambassador to hand over the notice. A spokesperson for the U.K. Foreign Office responded to the Russian statements: 'This is not the first time that Russia has made malicious and baseless accusations against our staff. We will respond in due course.' Russia announced the expulsion of the six British diplomats in September, weeks after it happened. Moscow accused them of spying, allegations rejected by the U.K. as 'completely baseless.' Russia and NATO allies have carried out multiple rounds of mutual expulsions of diplomats as relations have sunk to the lowest levels since the Cold War after the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-expels-british-diplomat-after-accusing-him-of-spying/	2024-11-26T07:55:49-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israel hits Lebanon's capital as EU urges it ...	Israeli warplanes struck the Lebanese capital of Beirut and its southern suburbs on Tuesday — a sign it was aiming to inflict punishment on the militant group Hezbollah in the final moments before any ceasefire takes hold. At least three people were killed and 26 wounded in a crowded neighborhood near downtown, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Tuesday there were 'no excuses' for Israel to refuse to implement a ceasefire with Hezbollah, saying all Israel's security concerns had been addressed in the U.S.-French-brokered deal. Speaking on the sidelines of a Group of Seven meeting in Italy, Borrell warned that if a ceasefire is not implemented, 'Lebanon will fall apart.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security Cabinet was convening Tuesday to discuss a proposed ceasefire. Among the remaining issues was Israel's demand to reserve the right to take military action should Hezbollah violate its obligations under the emerging deal. Hezbollah began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel, setting off more than a year of fighting. That escalated into all-out war in September with massive Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon and an Israeli ground invasion of the country’s south. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israeli military bases, cities and towns, including some 250 projectiles on Sunday. It’s not clear how the ceasefire will affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, where more than 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 wounded in the 13-month war between Israel and Hamas, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. ——— Here's the Latest: Israel strikes in central Beirut kill at least 3 people BEIRUT — An Israeli strike on Tuesday levelled a residential building in the central Beirut district of Basta — the second time in recent days warplanes have hit the crowded area near the city’s downtown. At least three people were killed and 26 wounded, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. It was not immediately clear if anyone in particular was targeted, though Israel says its airstrikes target Hezbollah officials and assets. The Israeli military also issued warnings for 20 more buildings in Beirut’s suburbs to evacuate before they too were struck — a sign it was aiming to inflict punishment on Hezbollah in the final moments before any ceasefire takes hold. Independent Israeli commission blames Netanyahu and others for October 2023 attack TEL AVIV, Israel — The independent civilian commission of inquiry into the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel has found Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly responsible for the failures leading up to the attack, alongside former defense ministers, the army chief and the heads of the security services. The civil commission presented its findings today after a four-month probe in which it heard some 120 witnesses. It was set up by relatives of victims of the Hamas attack, in response to the absence of any state probe. The commission determined that the Israeli government, its army and security services 'failed in their primary mission of protecting the citizens of Israel.' It said Netanyahu was responsible for ignoring 'repeated warnings' ahead of Oct. 7, 2023 for what it described as his appeasing approach over the years toward Hamas, and for 'undermining all decision-making centers, including the cabinet and the National Security Council, in a way that prevented any serious discussion' on security issues. The commission further determined that the military and defense leaders bear blame for ignoring warnings from within the army, and for reducing the army’s presence along the Gaza border while relying excessively on technological means. On the day of the Hamas attack, the report says, the army’s response was both slow and lacking. The civil commission called for the immediate establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack. Netanyahu has opposed launching a state commission of inquiry, arguing that such an investigation should begin only once the war is over. Israeli ground troops in Lebanon reach the Litani River JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says its ground troops have reached parts of Lebanon’s Litani River — a focal point of the emerging ceasefire. In a statement Tuesday, the army said it had reached the Wadi Slouqi area in southern Lebanon and clashed with Hezbollah forces. Under a proposed ceasefire, Hezbollah would be required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the Israeli border. The military says the clashes with Hezbollah took place on the eastern end of the Litani, just a few kilometers (miles) from the border. It is one of the deepest places Israeli forces have reached in a nearly two-month ground operation. The military says soldiers destroyed rocket launchers and missiles and engaged in 'close-quarters combat' with Hezbollah forces. The announcement came hours before Israel’s security Cabinet is expected to approve a ceasefire that would end nearly 14 months of fighting. Israeli airstrikes hit buildings near Beirut airport BEIRUT — Israeli jets Tuesday struck at least six buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs Tuesday, including one that slammed near the country’s only airport. Large plumes of smoke could be seen around the airport near the Mediterranean coast, which has continued to function despite its location beside the densely populated suburbs where many of Hezbollah’s operations are based. The strikes come hours before Israel’s cabinet was scheduled to meet to discuss a proposal to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The proposal calls for an initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River. There were no immediate reports of casualties from Tuesday’s airstrikes. EU top diplomat calls for urgent aid to Gaza FIUGGI, Italy — EU top diplomat Josep Borrell, whose term ends Dec. 1, said he proposed to the G7 and Arab ministers who joined in talks on Monday that the U.N. Security Council take up a resolution specifically demanding humanitarian assistance reach Palestinians in Gaza, saying deliveries have been completely impeded. 'The two-state solution will come later. Everything will come later. But we are talking about weeks or days,' for desperate Palestinians, he said. 'Hunger has been used as an arm against people who are completely abandoned.' It was a reference to the main accusation levelled by the International Criminal Court in its arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister. Borrell said the signatories to the court, including six of the seven G7 members, are obliged under international law to respect and implement the court’s decisions. Host Italy put the ICC warrants on the G7 agenda at the last minute, but there was no consensus on the wording of how the G7 would respond given the U.S., Israel’s closest ally, has called the warrants 'outrageous.' Italy, too, has said it respects the court but expressed concern that the warrants were politically motivated and ill-advised given Netanyahu is necessary for any deal to end the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Like it or not, the International Criminal Court is a court as powerful as any national court,' Borrell said. 'And if the Europeans don’t support International Criminal Court then there would not be any hope for justice,' he said.

Israel bombards central Beirut as its leadership prepares to vote...	BEIRUT (AP) — Israeli warplanes struck central Beirut and the city's southern suburbs on Tuesday, raising smoke over the Lebanese capital ahead of a planned vote by Israel's leadership on whether to accept a U.S.-brokered ceasefire aimed at ending more than a year of fighting with Hezbollah militants. The Israeli military issued warnings for 20 more buildings in Beirut's suburbs to evacuate before they too were struck — a sign it was aiming to inflict punishment on Hezbollah down to the final moments before any ceasefire takes hold. Israeli ground troops also reached parts of Lebanon’s Litani River for the first time in the conflict — a focal point of the emerging deal. A ceasefire was still not a sure thing, but Israel’s security Cabinet, meeting Tuesday afternoon, was expected to approve the proposal. Lebanese officials have said Hezbollah also supports the deal. If approved by all sides, the deal would be a major step towards ending the Israel-Hezbollah war that has inflamed tensions across the region and raised fears of an even wider conflict between Israel and Hezbollah's patron, Iran. The deal calls for a two-month initial halt in fighting and would require Hezbollah to end its armed presence in a broad swath of southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops would return to their side of the border. Thousands of Lebanese troopsand U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor all sides’ compliance. But implementation remains a major question mark. Israel has demanded the right to act should Hezbollah violate its obligations. Lebanese officials have rejected writing that into the proposal. Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz insisted on Tuesday that the military would strike Hezbollah if the U.N. peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, doesn’t provide 'effective enforcement' of the deal. 'If you don’t act, we will act, and with great force,' Katz said, speaking with U.N. special envoy Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert. The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said Tuesday that Israel’s security concerns had been addressed in the deal also brokered by France. 'There is not an excuse for not implementing a ceasefire. Otherwise, Lebanon will fall apart,' Borrell told reporters in Italy on the sidelines of a Group of Seven meeting. He said France would participate on the ceasefire implementation committee at Lebanon's request. Bombardment of Beirut's southern suburbs continues Even as Israeli, U.S, Lebanese and international officials have expressed growing optimism over a ceasefire, Israel has continued its campaign in Lebanon, which it says aims to cripple Hezbollah’s military capabilities. An Israeli strike on Tuesday leveled a residential building in the central Beirut district of Basta — the second time in recent days warplanes have hit the crowded area near the city’s downtown. At least three people were killed and 26 wounded, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. It was not immediately clear if anyone in particular was targeted, though Israel says its airstrikes target Hezbollah officials and assets. Earlier, Israeli jets struck at least six buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs. One strike slammed near the country’s only airport, sending plumes of smoke into the sky. The airport has continued to function despite its location on the Mediterranean coast next to the densely populated suburbs where many of Hezbollah’s operations are based. Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee issued evacuation warnings for 20 buildings in the suburbs, as well as a warning for the southern town of Naqoura where UNIFIL is headquartered. UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti told The Associated Press that peacekeepers will not evacuate. Other strikes hit in the southern city of Tyre, where the Israeli military said it killed a local Hezbollah commander. The Israeli military also said its ground troops clashed with Hezbollah forces and destroyed rocket launchers in the Slouqi area on the eastern end of the Litani River, a few kilometers (miles) from the Israeli border. Previous ceasefire hopes were dashed Under the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah would be required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border. A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the strongest Iranian-backed force in the region, would likely significantly calm regional tensions that have led to fears of a direct, all-out war between Israel and Iran. It’s not clear how the ceasefire will affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Hezbollah had long insisted that it would not agree to a ceasefire until the war in Gaza ends, but it dropped that condition. Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel, saying it was showing support for the Palestinians, a day after Hamas carried out its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, triggering the Gaza war.

After previous hopes for a ceasefire were dashed, U.S. officials cautioned that negotiations were not yet complete and noted there could be last-minute hitches that delay or destroy an agreement. 'Nothing is done until everything is done,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. While the ceasefire proposal is expected to be approved if Netanyahu brings it to a vote in his security Cabinet, one hard-line member, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, said he would oppose it. He said on X that a deal with Lebanon would be a 'big mistake' and a 'missed historic opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah.' ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-bombards-beirut-suburbs-as-its-leadership-prepares-to-vote-on-ceasefire-with-hezbollah/	2024-11-26T06:33:40-08:00	
Ukraine says Russian attack sets a new record for the number of d...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched 188 drones against most regions of Ukraine in a nighttime blitz, the Ukrainian air force said Tuesday, describing it as a record number of drones deployed in a single attack. Most of the drones were intercepted, according to the air force, but apartment buildings and critical infrastructure such as the national power grid were damaged. No casualties were immediately reported in the 17 targeted regions. Russia has been hammering civilian areas of Ukraine with increasingly heavy drone, missile and glide bomb attacks since the middle of the year. At the same time, Russia’s army has largely held the battlefield initiative for the past year and has been pushing hard in the eastern Donetsk region where it is making significant tactical advances, according to Western military analysts. Ukraine faces a difficult winter, with worries about the reliability of the electricity supply amid Russia’s attacks and how much U.S. support it can count on next year after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. The air raid alert in the Kyiv region overnight lasted more than seven hours. Russia is trying to unnerve civilians and wear down their will to resist in the almost 3-year-old war. The Russian Defense Ministry said Tuesday its forces destroyed 39 Ukrainian drones overnight over Russian regions near the border with Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s General Staff said Tuesday that over the past 24 hours roughly half of the clashes along the about 1,000-kilometer (600 mile) front line occurred near Pokrovsk and Kurakhove in the Donetsk region. Ukraine has a critical manpower problem on the front line, and though the Russian army’s gains have been incremental its momentum is adding up as the Ukrainians yield ground. The Russian advance is threatening important supply routes in Donetsk, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said late Monday. Ukrainian defenses in Donetsk are not in danger of being overrun, however, the think tank said. It also noted that Russia would need to capture more than 8,000 square kilometers (3,000 square miles) of territory to achieve the Kremlin’s goal of seizing the whole of Donetsk. In other developments, a court in Russia’s Kursk region has ordered a British national fighting with Ukraine to be held in detention pending an investigation and trial. The ruling on the Briton, identified by state news agency Tass and other media as James Scott Rhys Anderson, was announced Tuesday by court officials, who said in an online statement that it was handed down the previous day. The hearing took place behind closed doors in the Leninsky District Court in the city of Kursk. It wasn’t clear from the statement what charges Anderson is facing and whether he is considered a prisoner of war by the Russian authorities. The Briton reportedly was captured in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces have seized territory following a lightning offensive in August. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraine-says-russian-attack-sets-a-new-record-for-the-number-of-drones-used/	2024-11-26T03:36:50-08:00	
Top EU diplomat says Israel has 'no excuses' to refuse a ceasefir...	FIUGGI, Italy (AP) — The European Union’s top diplomat said Tuesday there were 'no excuses' for Israel to refuse to accept a ceasefire with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, saying all its security concerns had been addressed in the U.S.-French-brokered deal. Josep Borrell, the outgoing EU foreign policy chief, called for increased pressure on Israel to blunt extremists in the government who are refusing to accept the deal. Speaking on the sidelines of a Group of Seven meeting in Italy, Borrell warned that if a ceasefire is not implemented, 'Lebanon will fall apart.' Israeli officials said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security Cabinet was set to convene Tuesday to discuss a proposed ceasefire. Among the issues that remain is an Israeli demand to reserve the right to act should Hezbollah violate its obligations under the emerging deal. Borrell said under the proposed agreement, the U.S. would chair a ceasefire implementation committee, with France participating at the request of Lebanon. 'On the proposal agreement brokered by the U.S. and France, Israel has all security concerns (addressed),' Borrell told reporters in Fiuggi, Italy. 'There is not an excuse for not implementing a ceasefire. Otherwise, Lebanon will fall apart.' Following the October 2023 Hamas attacks in Israel, months of back-and-forth fighting between Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah have erupted into a full-blown war in recent months, with Israel killing Hezbollah’s main leaders and sending ground forces into southern Lebanon. Israeli bombardment has killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and wounded more than 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. On the Israeli side, about 90 soldiers and nearly 50 civilians have been killed by rockets, drones and missiles in northern Israel and in the fighting on the ground in Lebanon. The G7 meeting of foreign ministers from the world's leading industrialized nations, the last of the Biden administration, was dominated on Monday by the Mideast wars in Gaza and Lebanon. The G7 ministers were joined by the foreign ministers of the 'Arab Quintet': Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Borrell, whose term ends Dec. 1, said he proposed to the G7 and Arab ministers that the U.N. Security Council take up a resolution specifically demanding humanitarian assistance reach Palestinians in Gaza, saying deliveries there have been completely impeded. 'The two-state solution will come later. Everything will come later. But we are talking about weeks or days,' for desperate Palestinians, he said. 'Hunger has been used as an arm against people who are completely abandoned.' It was a reference to the main accusation leveled by the International Criminal Court in its arrest warrants against Netanyahu and his former defense minister. Israel has angrily denied the charges, calling them antisemitic and a victory for terrorism and said the charges failed to recognize the country’s right to defend itself. Borrell said the signatories to ICC, including six of the seven G7 members, are obliged under international law to respect and implement the court’s decisions. The U.S. is not a party to the court and has called the arrest warrants 'outrageous.' Host Italy put the ICC warrants on the G7 agenda at the last minute, but there was no consensus on the wording of how the G7 would respond given the position of the U.S., Israel’s closest ally. Italy, too, has said it respects the court but expressed concern that the warrants were politically motivated and ill-advised given Netanyahu is necessary for any deal to end the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Like it or not, the International Criminal Court is a court as powerful as any national court,' Borrell said. 'And if the Europeans don’t support International Criminal Court then there would not be any hope for justice.' By Tuesday, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani acknowledged Italy's obligations. Italy was one of the first signatories of the ICC and hosted the 1998 Rome conference that gave birth to it. 'We are friends of Israel but I think we need to respect international law,' he said as he waited to greet U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. While the G7 meeting was dominated Monday by the Mideast conflicts, the attention turned Tuesday to Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha was on hand and briefed the ministers on Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, Tajani said. 'We want to repeat, visibly, our solidarity from Italy and the G7,' Tajani told the ministers at the start of Tuesday’s session. 'Support to Kyiv is a priority.' The G7 has been at the forefront of providing military and economic support for Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, and G7 members are particularly concerned about how a Trump administration will change the U.S. approach. Trump has criticized the billions of dollars that the Biden administration has poured into Ukraine and has said he could end the war in 24 hours, comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia now occupies. Tensions have only heightened since Russia attacked Ukraine last week with an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile that escalated the nearly 33-month-old war. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the strike was retaliation for Kyiv’s use of U.S. and British longer-range missiles capable of striking deeper into Russian territory. Blinken, at his final G7 before the Biden administration leaves office, thanked Tajani for the collaboration over the years and said Washington was still standing with its allies. 'Our countries are standing together, along with other partners, to deal with the ongoing Russian aggression against Ukraine,' Blinken said. 'We’re standing together to deal with some of the challenges posed by China. We’re standing together in looking to bring a sustainable, lasting peace in the Middle East.' ___ AP visual journalist Paolo Santalucia contributed.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-eu-top-diplomat-says-israel-has-no-excuses-to-refuse-a-ceasefire-with-hezbollah-in-us-french-deal/	2024-11-26T03:15:54-08:00	
Israel launches new airstrikes on Lebanon as leaders draw closer ...	BEIRUT (AP) — Israel's military launched airstrikes across Lebanon on Monday, unleashing explosions throughout the country and killing at least 31 while Israeli leaders appeared to be closing in on a negotiated ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group. Israeli strikes hit commercial and residential buildings in Beirut as well as in the port city of Tyre. Military officials said they targeted areas known as Hezbollah strongholds. They issued evacuation orders for Beirut's southern suburbs, and strikes landed across the city, including meters from a Lebanese police base and the city's largest public park. The barrage came as officials indicated they were nearing agreement on a ceasefire, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's Security Cabinet prepared to discuss an offer on the table. Airstrikes kill at least 31 Massive explosions lit up Lebanon's skies with flashes of orange, sending towering plumes of smoke into the air as Israeli airstrikes pounded Beirut’s southern suburbs. The blasts damaged buildings and left shattered glass and debris scattered across nearby streets. No casualties were reported after many residents fled the targeted sites. Some of the strikes landed close to central Beirut and near Christian neighborhoods and other targets where Israel had issued evacuation warnings, including in Tyre and Nabatiyeh province. Israeli airstrikes also hit the northeast Baalbek-Hermel region without warning. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said that 26 people were killed in southern Lebanon, four in the eastern Baalbek-Hermel province and one in Choueifat, a neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs that was not subjected to evacuation warnings on Monday. The deaths brought the total toll to 3,768 killed in Lebanon throughout 13 months of war between Israel and Hezbollah and nearly two months since Israel launched its ground invasion. Many of those killed since the start of the war between Israel and Hezbollah have been civilians, and health officials said some of the recovered bodies were so severely damaged that DNA testing would be required to confirm their identities. Israel says it has killed more than 2,000 Hezbollah members. Lebanon's Health Ministry says the war has displaced 1.2 million people. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon in early October, meeting heavy resistance in a narrow strip of land along the border. The military had previously exchanged attacks across the border with Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group that began firing rockets into Israel the day after the war in Gaza began last year. Lebanese politicians have decried the ongoing airstrikes and said they are impeding U.S.-led ceasefire negotiations. The country's deputy parliament speaker accused Israel of ramping up its bombardment in order to pressure Lebanon to make concessions in indirect ceasefire negotiations with Hezbollah. Elias Bousaab, an ally of the militant group, said the pressure has increased because 'we are close to the hour that is decisive regarding reaching a ceasefire.' Hopes grow for a ceasefire Israeli officials voiced similar optimism about prospects for a ceasefire. Mike Herzog, the country's ambassador to Washington, earlier in the day told Israeli Army Radio that several points had yet to be finalized. Though any deal would require agreement from the government, Herzog said Israel and Hezbollah were 'close to a deal.' 'It can happen within days,' he said. Israeli officials have said the sides are close to an agreement that would include withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and a pullback of Hezbollah fighters from the Israeli border. But several sticking points remain. Two Israeli officials told The Associated Press that Netanyahu’s security Cabinet had scheduled a meeting for Tuesday, but they said it remained unclear whether the Cabinet would vote to approve the deal. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing internal deliberations. Danny Danon, Israel’s U.N. ambassador, told reporters that he expected a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah to have stages and to be discussed by leaders Monday or Tuesday. Still, he warned, 'it’s not going to happen overnight.' After previous hopes for a ceasefire were dashed, U.S. officials cautioned that negotiations were not yet complete and noted that there could be last-minute hitches that either delay or destroy an agreement. 'Nothing is done until everything is done,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. The proposal under discussion to end the fighting calls for an initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River. The withdrawals would be accompanied by an influx of thousands more Lebanese army troops, who have been largely sidelined in the war, to patrol the border area along with an existing U.N. peacekeeping force. Western diplomats and Israeli officials said Israel is demanding the right to strike in Lebanon if it believes Hezbollah is violating the terms. The Lebanese government has said that such an arrangement would authorize violations of the country's sovereignty. A ceasefire could mark a step toward ending the regionwide war that ballooned after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. The lack of a ceasefire has emerged as a political liability for Israeli leaders including Netanyahu, particularly while 60,000 Israelis remain away from their homes in the country's north after more than a year of cross-border violence. Hezbollah rockets have reached as far south into Israel as Tel Aviv. At least 75 people have been killed, more than half of them civilians. More than 50 Israeli soldiers died fighting in the ground offensive in Lebanon. The Israeli military said about 250 projectiles were fired Sunday, with some intercepted. A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the strongest of Iran’s armed proxies, is expected to significantly calm regional tensions that have led to fears of a direct, all-out war between Israel and Iran. It’s not clear how the ceasefire will affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Hezbollah had long insisted that it would not agree to a ceasefire until the war in Gaza ends, but it dropped that condition. A top Hamas official in Lebanon said the Palestinian militant group would support a ceasefire between its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and Israel, despite Hezbollah’s previous promises to stop the fighting in Lebanon only if the war in Gaza ends. 'Any announcement of a ceasefire is welcome. Hezbollah has stood by our people and made significant sacrifices,' Osama Hamdan of Hamas' political wing told the Lebanese broadcaster Al-Mayadeen, which is seen as politically allied with Hezbollah. While the ceasefire proposal is expected to be approved if Netanyahu brings it to a vote in his security Cabinet, one hard-line member, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, said he would oppose it. He said on X that a deal with Lebanon would be a 'big mistake' and a 'missed historic opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah.' If the ceasefire talks fail, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said, 'it will mean more destruction and more and more animosity and more dehumanization and more hatred and more bitterness.' Speaking at a G7 meeting in Fiuggi, Italy, the last summit of its kind before U.S. President Joe Biden leaves office, Safadi said such a failure 'will doom the future of the region to more conflict and more killing and more destruction.' ___ Federman reported from Jerusalem and Metz from Rabat, Morocco.

Middle East latest: Israeli ambassador to US says Hezbollah cease...	The Israeli ambassador to Washington says a ceasefire deal to end fighting between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah militants could be reached 'within days.' Ambassador Mike Herzog told Israeli Army Radio on Monday there remain 'points to finalize' and any deal requires agreement from the government. But he said 'we are close to a deal' and 'it can happen within days.' Israeli officials said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security Cabinet is set to convene on Tuesday to discuss a proposed ceasefire. Among the issues that remain is an Israeli demand to reserve the right to act should Hezbollah violate its obligations under the emerging deal. The deal seeks to push Hezbollah and Israeli troops out of southern Lebanon. Israel accuses Hezbollah of not adhering to a U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 war between the sides that made similar provisions, and Israel has concerns that Hezbollah could stage a Hamas-style cross-border attack from southern Lebanon if it maintains a heavy presence there. Lebanon says Israel also violated the 2006 resolution. Lebanon complains about military jets and naval ships entering Lebanese territory even when there is no active conflict. It is not clear whether Lebanon would agree to the demand. The optimism surrounding a deal comes after a top U.S. envoy held talks between the sides last week in a bid to clinch a deal. Hezbollah began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas’ raid on southern Israel, setting off more than a year of fighting. That escalated into all-out war in September with massive Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon and later an Israeli ground incursion into the country’s south. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israeli cities and towns, including some 250 on Sunday. ___ Here's the Latest: Israeli officials say security Cabinet to meet Tuesday on Lebanon ceasefire deal JERUSALEM — Israeli officials say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security Cabinet is set to convene on Tuesday to discuss a proposed ceasefire in the war with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Officials have said the sides are close to a deal that would include withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and a pullback of Hezbollah forces from the Israeli border. But several sticking points remain. Two officials confirmed the Cabinet meeting is set for Tuesday, but they said it is still not clear whether the decision-making body will vote to approve the deal. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing internal deliberations. — Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv Arab foreign ministers call for immediate ceasefire in Gaza ROME — Several Arab foreign ministers, gathering in Rome on the sidelines of the Group of Seven meeting, are calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon and the provision of humanitarian aid to Palestinians. The ministers of Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates, and the secretary general of the League of Arab States, all participated in a Rome conference before joining G7 foreign minsters later in the day in nearby Fiuggi. 'Gaza is now a graveyard for children, a graveyard for human values, a graveyard for international law,' said Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi. The Mideast conflict was the top agenda item Monday for the G7, amid reported progress on a possible ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel’s ambassador to the U.S. said a deal could be reached within days. 'We all hope and pray that this ceasefire will be realized because the absence of it will mean more destruction, and more and more animosity, and more dehumanization, and more hatred, and more bitterness which will doom the future of the region to more conflict and more killing and more destruction,' Safadi said. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty reaffirmed that Cairo would host a ministerial-level conference next Monday on mobilizing international aid for Gaza. In remarks to the 'Mediterranean Dialogues' conference, he called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, the release of hostages, provision of humanitarian aid for Palestinians and the initiation of 'a serious and genuine political process' to create a Palestinian state. Israeli rights group accuses prison authority of failing Palestinian prisoners after scabies outbreak TEL AVIV, Israel — An Israeli rights group said Monday that more than a quarter of all Palestinian prisoners currently held by Israel had contracted scabies since an outbreak was identified in May, and accused the prison authority of improper care and prevention. Physicians for Human Rights-Israel said that more than 2,800 prisoners had caught the rash-like infection, with more than 1,700 still actively infected. The outbreak was seen in five different detention facilities, the group said. It was citing figures it said came from the Israel Prison Service. The group said it filed a legal petition calling on the prison service ' to eradicate the scabies epidemic,' accusing the authorities of failing 'to implement widely recognized medical interventions necessary to contain the outbreak.' It said that it halted the legal proceedings after it received a commitment from the prison service to address the outbreak. The prison service said the court had cancelled the petition because the prisons had shown they were dealing with the outbreak in a 'systematic and thorough' way. Nadav Davidovich, an Israeli public health expert who wrote a medical analysis for the group’s court proceedings, said the outbreak was a result of overcrowding in prisons and apparent neglect from prison authorities. He said such outbreaks could be prevented if prisoners were held 'in more reasonable conditions.' If the first infections were treated as needed, such an outbreak could have been avoided, he said. Physicians for Human Rights-Israel also said that the Israel Prison Service had cited scabies as a reason for postponing lawyers' visits and court appearances for prisoners. It said those steps 'violate prisoners’ rights and serve as punitive measures rather than public health responses.' Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the prisons, has boasted about hardening conditions to the bare minimum required by law. Lebanese politician accuses Israel of increasing bombardment to wring concessions BEIRUT — Lebanon’s deputy parliament speaker has accused Israel of ramping up its bombardment of Lebanon in order to pressure the government to make concessions in indirect ceasefire negotiations with Hezbollah. Elias Bousaab, an ally of the militant group, said Monday that the pressure has increased because 'we are close to the hour that is decisive regarding reaching a ceasefire.' 'We are optimistic, and there is hope, but nothing is guaranteed with a person like (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu),' Bousaab told reporters. Israel has carried out heavy strikes in central Beirut in recent days, while Hezbollah has increased its rocket fire into Israel. The United States is trying to broker an agreement in which Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces would withdraw from southern Lebanon and Lebanese troops would patrol the region, along with a U.N. peacekeeping force. Israel has demanded freedom of action to strike Hezbollah if it violates the ceasefire, but Bousaab said that was not part of the emerging agreement. He also said Israel had accepted that France be part of the committee overseeing the ceasefire after Lebanese officials insisted. There was no immediate confirmation from the Israeli side. Israel has objected to France being on the committee in the wake of the International Criminal Court’s decision last week to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, his former defense minister and a Hamas military commander. France said it supports the court. It said the question of whether it would arrest Netanyahu if he set foot on French soil was a 'complex legal issue' that would have to be worked out. Palestinian officials say Israeli forces killed 2 people, including a 13-year-old, in the occupied West Bank JERUSALEM — The Palestinian Health Ministry says Israeli forces killed two people, including a 13-year-old, in the occupied West Bank. The Israeli military said the two had thrown explosives at forces overnight near the Palestinian town of Yabad and that the forces had responded by opening fire. The Health Ministry identified the two as Mohammed Hamarsheh, 13, and Ahmad Zayd, 20. It did not disclose details about the circumstances behind their deaths. It was the latest bloodshed in the West Bank, which has faced a surge of violence throughout the 13-month war in Gaza. The Health Ministry says nearly 800 people have been killed, with more than 160 of them 18 and younger. Many have been killed in fighting with the Israeli military, but Palestinians throwing rocks and others not involved in confrontations have also been killed. There has also been an increase in Palestinian attacks against Israelis in the West Bank since the war in Gaza began. Israeli government orders public entities to stop advertising in Haaretz newspaper JERUSALEM — The Israeli government has ordered all public entities to stop advertising in the Haaretz newspaper, which is known for its critical coverage of Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories. Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said Sunday that the government had approved his proposal after Haaretz’ publisher called for sanctions against Israel and referred to Palestinian militants as 'freedom fighters.' 'We advocate for a free press and freedom of expression, but also the freedom of the government to decide not to fund incitement against the State of Israel,' Karhi wrote on the social platform X. Noa Landau, the deputy editor of Haaretz, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of 'working to silence independent and critical media,' comparing him to autocratic leaders in other countries. Haaretz regularly publishes investigative journalism and opinion columns critical of Israel’s ongoing half-century occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state. It has also been critical of Israel’s war conduct in Gaza at a time when most local media support the war and largely ignore the suffering of Palestinian civilians. In a speech in London last month, Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken said Israel has imposed 'a cruel apartheid regime' on the Palestinians and was battling 'Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls ‘terrorists.’' He later issued a statement, saying he had reconsidered his remarks. 'For the record, Hamas are not freedom fighters,' he posted on X. 'I should have said: using terrorism is illegitimate. I was wrong not to say that.' Iran's supreme leader says Netanyahu should be ‘sentenced to death’ DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s supreme leader has suggested that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be 'sentenced to death' for his role in the ongoing wars in the Gaza Strip against Hamas and in Lebanon. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made the remarks Monday during an event in which he spoke to members of the Basij, the all-volunteer arm of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Khamenei referenced the International Criminal Court’s decision to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Israel’s former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'What the Zionist regime did in Gaza and Lebanon is not a victory, it is a war crime. Now they have issued a warrant for their arrest. This is not enough!' Khamenei said, according to remarks published by the state-run IRNA news agency. 'Netanyahu and the criminal leaders of this regime must be sentenced to death.' The International Criminal Court at the Hague does not issue death sentences. Khamenei also insisted those in Iran’s self-described 'Axis of Resistance,' like the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, would be stronger after the war. 'The idiots should not think that bombing houses and hospitals in Gaza and Lebanon is a victory,' he said. 'The enemy has not become winner in Gaza and Lebanon, and it will not be winner.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-ambassador-to-us-says-hezbollah-cease-fire-deal-could-come-within-days/	2024-11-25T07:39:17-08:00	
Russia reportedly captures a Briton fighting for Ukraine as Russi...	Russia's military captured a British national fighting with Ukrainian troops who have occupied part of Russia's Kursk region, according to reports Monday, as Moscow began daylight drone attacks on civilian areas of Ukraine and its ground forces accelerated gains along parts of the front line. The Briton was identified by state news agency Tass and other media as James Scott Rhys Anderson. Tass quoted him as saying that he had served as a signalman in the British army for four years and then joined the International Legion of Ukraine, formed early on in Russia's nearly 3-year-old war against its neighbor. On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces are straining to hold at bay a push by Russia's bigger army at places in the eastern Donetsk region. Russian forces recently have gained ground at 'a significantly quicker rate' than they did in the whole of last year, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank. The Russians have detected and are exploiting weaknesses in the Ukrainian defenses, it said in an analysis late Sunday. The war surpassed 1,000 days last week, and the milestone coincided with a significant escalation in hostilities. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s air force said Russia is adapting its drone tactics, as it fired 145 Shahed drones at Ukraine. Russia has started launching drones during the day, whereas in the past most drone attacks occurred during the night, the air force said. Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the National Security Council’s Counter-disinformation Center, said earlier this month that the Russians were looking to conserve their stocks of more destructive but more expensive missiles and also terrorize civilians. The air force said it stopped almost all the drones before they struck. But a morning missile attack on downtown Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city in the northeast, injured at least 23 people, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov. He said the attack on a densely populated residential area was carried out by a modified surface-to-air S-400 missile. A Russian ballistic missile also struck the southern Ukraine city of Odesa in the middle of the day, injuring 10 people as it landed in the downtown area, officials said. Ukraine, meantime, continued its attacks on logistical targets inside Russia that support the Kremlin’s war effort. Ukrainian drones set off explosions and a fire at an oil depot in Russia’s Kaluga region overnight, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) from the border, a military intelligence official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the rules of his job do not allow him to be quoted by name. Russia made no comment about the alleged strike. It was not possible to independently verify Ukraine’s claim. The father of the British man says he was told by a Ukrainian command er of his capture The captured Briton reportedly served as an instructor for Ukrainian troops and was deployed to the Kursk region against his will. Tass published a video of the man saying in English that he doesn’t want to be 'here.' The report couldn’t be independently verified, but if confirmed it could be one of the first publicly known case of a Western national captured on Russian soil while fighting for Ukraine. The U.K. Embassy in Moscow said officials were 'supporting the family of a British man following reports of his detention' but provided no further details. The Russian Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The soldier’s father, Scott Anderson, told Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper that his son’s Ukrainian commander had informed him that the young man had been captured. Scott Anderson said his son had served in the British military for four years, then briefly worked as a police custody officer before going to Ukraine to fight. He said he tried to convince his son not to join the Ukrainian military, and now he fears for his safety. 'I’m hoping he’ll be used as a bargaining chip, but my son told me they torture their prisoners and I’m so frightened he’ll be tortured,' he told the newspaper. The International Legion for Defense of Ukraine was created at the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Legion is a unit of Ukraine’s Ground Forces that consists mostly of foreign volunteers. Apart from the Legion, Ukraine recruits foreigners to other units of its army, filling squads, companies, or even battalions. Early on in the war, Ukraine’s authorities said over 20,000 people from 52 countries came to Ukraine to help it defend itself against Russia's aggression. Ever since, the numbers of foreign fighters in the ranks of the Ukrainian military have been classified. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-captures-uk-national-fighting-alongside-ukraine-in-the-kursk-region-report-says/	2024-11-25T07:09:43-08:00	
Here’s where ceasefire talks in the war between Israel and Hezbol...	BEIRUT (AP) — Diplomats and other officials say there have been several sticking points in ceasefire talks to end the war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, even as conditions for an agreement appear to be ripe. Israel’s military has killed nearly all of the militant group’s top leaders, but it continues to fire missiles into Israel. Tens of thousands of Israelis who were evacuated from the border months ago are pressuring their government to go home. And the world wants to stop regional conflict from spreading after more than a year of fighting. Following the latest visit to the region by a U.S. mediator, Israel hit central Beirut over the weekend, and Hezbollah responded with its biggest barrage in weeks as each applied pressure to reach a deal. Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire almost daily since the day after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, setting off the war in Gaza. Israel launched a widespread bombardment of Lebanon two months ago, then a ground invasion. More than 3,500 people in Lebanon have been killed, many of them civilians. More than 70 have been killed in Israel, over 40 of them civilians. In addition, over 50 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive. Here’s a look at the proposal and the sticking points. A proposed two-month ceasefire to start The proposal under discussion to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah calls for an initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River. The withdrawals would be accompanied by an influx of thousands more Lebanese army troops, who have been largely sidelined in the war, to patrol the border area along with an existing U.N. peacekeeping force. An international committee would be set up to monitor implementation of the ceasefire agreement and of U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed in 2006 to end a monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah but never fully implemented. Hezbollah never ended its presence in southern Lebanon, while Lebanon said Israel regularly violated its airspace and occupied small patches of its territory. It is not clear whether a new deal would be any more successfully implemented than the one in 2006. Michael Herzog, Israel’s ambassador to Washington, told Israeli Army Radio on Monday that the deal aimed to improve surveillance and enforcement of the previous resolution. While he said there were still certain points that needed to be finalized, a deal was close and could be clinched 'within days.' A U.S. official said negotiations continued to progress on Sunday, but the parties still need to work out some outstanding issues to close the deal. The official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the private talks, declined to detail the outstanding issues. Israel wants freedom to strike Hezbollah and other disagreements Two Western diplomats described several points of dispute to The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing negotiations. They said Israel was asking for more guarantees to ensure that Hezbollah’s weapons are removed from the border area. Israeli officials, concerned about the possibility of Hezbollah launching the kind of attack that Hamas carried out from Gaza into southern Israel, have said they would not agree to a ceasefire deal that doesn't explicitly grant them freedom to strike in Lebanon if they believe Hezbollah is violating it. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the sensitive talks, said the issue remained a point of contention, although he said the talks were headed in a 'positive direction.' Lebanese officials have said agreeing to such a deal would violate Lebanon’s sovereignty. Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem has said the militant group would not agree to a deal that does not entail a 'complete and comprehensive end to the aggression' and does not protect Lebanon’s sovereignty. Lebanon and Israel have also disagreed over which countries would sit on the international committee overseeing implementation of the deal and Resolution 1701. In a sign of progress, Israel appeared to have dropped its opposition to France, which has remained close with Lebanon since its colonial rule there ended and has recently been at odds with Israel. On Monday, an official familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing behind-the-scenes negotiations, said that France would be part of the monitoring committee. Lebanon’s deputy parliament speaker, Elias Bousaab, also said Israel had accepted France. But Lebanon has refused to allow Britain, a close ally of Israel. It was unclear Monday if Lebanese officials had dropped their opposition following Israel’s concession. Meanwhile, Israel does not want to enter into negotiations on 13 disputed points along the border as part of a ceasefire deal, the diplomats said. Both sides have an interest in ending the war A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the strongest of Iran's armed proxies, is expected to significantly calm regional tensions that have led to fears of war between Israel and Iran directly. It's not clear how it would affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Hezbollah had long insisted that it would not agree to a ceasefire until the war in Gaza ends, but it has now dropped that condition. One diplomat said there are fears that if no ceasefire is reached, the war will expand further into Syria and Iraq as Israel attempts to cut off the supply of weapons from Iran to Hezbollah. Israel has carried out regular airstrikes on Iran-linked groups in Syria and has threatened to strike in Iraq, where Iran-backed militias have periodically launched drone attacks on Israel. Geir Pedersen, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said during a visit to Damascus on Sunday that ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon are critical to 'avoid Syria being dragged even further into the conflict.' Meanwhile, analysts say Hezbollah has been weakened but continues to keep up steady fire into Israel, including strikes far from the border. On Sunday, Hezbollah fired about 250 rockets and other projectiles into Israel, wounding seven people in one of the militant group’s heaviest barrages in months, in response to deadly Israeli strikes in Beirut. Violent clashes continue in southern Lebanon as Israeli forces attempt to take control of strategic towns. Israel says its goal in the war with Hezbollah is to enable displaced Israelis to safely return home. In Lebanon, a quarter of the population has been displaced, and parts of the country, particularly in south Lebanon and areas south of the capital Beirut, have been destroyed. In Lebanon, where officials and residents are anxious for war to end, an initial rush of optimism dissipated after the Biden administration’s point man on Israel and Lebanon, Amos Hochstein, left the region last week without a deal. Many now believe no agreement will be reached before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

G7 foreign ministers meet in Italy with hopes of progress toward ...	FIUGGI, Italy (AP) — Foreign ministers from the world’s leading industrialized nations met Monday as signs emerged of progress on a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah and a certain pressure to advance diplomatic efforts in both the Mideast and Ukraine wars ahead of the new U.S. administration taking office. Progress on brokering a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon were foremost on the agenda of the Group of Seven meeting outside Rome that gathered ministers from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, in the last G7 encounter of the Biden administration. As the G7 ministers arrived in Italy, Israel’s ambassador to the U.S., Mike Herzog, told Israeli Army Radio on Monday a ceasefire deal to end fighting between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah could be reached 'within days.' Ministers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, as well as the Secretary General of the Arab League, were joining the G7 in the afternoon. Several intervened on a sideline event in Rome to call for an urgent end to Israel's strikes in Gaza and Lebanon, following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. 'We need a ceasefire, a permanent ceasefire. That will stop the killings and stop the destruction and restore a sense of normalcy to life,' Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told the 'Mediterranean Dialogues' conference organized by the Italian foreign ministry and the ISPI think tank. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, for his part, reaffirmed that Cairo would host a minister-level conference next Monday on mobilizing international aid for Gaza. The so-called 'Quintet' grouping of the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and the UAE will formally meet with the G7 ministers later in the day, and has been working to finalize a 'day after' plan for Gaza. There is some urgency to make progress before the Trump administration takes over in January. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to pursue a policy that strongly favors Israel over the aspirations of the Palestinians. 'Dialogue with partners is essential,' Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said as he opened the G7 meeting and announced all the non-G7 ministers participating. Tajani added another item to the G7 agenda last week after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief. Italy is a founding member of the court and hosted the 1998 Rome conference that gave birth to it. But Italy’s right-wing government has been a strong supporter of Israel after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, while also providing humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza. The Italian government has taken a cautious line, reaffirming its support and respect for the court but expressing concern that the warrants were politically motivated. Nathalie Tocci, director of the Rome-based Institute for International Affairs think tank, said Italy would be seeking to forge a united front on the ICC warrants, at least among the six G7 countries that are signatories of the court: all but the U.S. But in an essay this weekend in La Stampa newspaper, Tocci warned it was a risky move, since the U.S. tends to dictate the G7 line and has blasted the ICC warrants against Netanyahu as 'outrageous.' 'If Italy and the other (five G7) signatories of the ICC are unable to maintain the line on international law, they will not only erode it anyway but will be acting against our interests,' Tocci wrote, recalling Italy’s recourse to international law in demanding protection for Italian U.N. peacekeepers who have come under fire in southern Lebanon. The other major talking point of the G7 meeting is Ukraine, and tensions have only heightened since Russia attacked Ukraine last week with an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile that escalated the nearly 33-month-old war. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the strike was retaliation for Kyiv’s use of U.S. and British longer-range missiles capable of striking deeper into Russian territory. The G7 has been at the forefront of providing military and economic support for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and G7 members are particularly concerned about how a Trump administration will change the U.S. approach. 'It’s hugely important that this G7, that all colleagues across the G7 continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it lasts,' British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said as he arrived. He announced new sanctions on vessels of Russia's 'shadow fleet' of ships that are evading sanctions to export Russian oil. 'And we are confident that Ukraine can have the funds and the military equipment and kit to get through 2025,' Lammy said. Trump has criticized the billions of dollars that the Biden administration has poured into Ukraine and has said he could end the war in 24 hours, comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia now occupies. The G7 foreign ministers’ meeting, the second of the Italian presidency after ministers gathered in Capri in April, is being held in the medieval town of Fiuggi southeast of Rome, best known for its thermal spas. On Monday, which coincides with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, ministers will attend the inauguration of a red bench meant to symbolize Italy’s focus on fighting gender-based violence. Over the weekend, tens of thousands of people marched in Rome to protest gender-based violence, which in Italy so far this year has claimed the lives of 99 women, according to a report last week by the Eures think tank.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-foreign-ministers-meet-in-italy-for-the-last-g7-of-the-biden-administration/	2024-11-25T06:34:47-08:00	
Israeli strikes in central Beirut kill at least 20 as diplomats p...	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli airstrikes Saturday in central Beirut killed at least 20 people, officials said, as the once-rare attacks on the heart of Lebanon's capital continued without warning while diplomats scrambled to broker a cease-fire. Lebanon's Health Ministry said 66 people were wounded in the strikes, which were the fourth in central Beirut in less than a week. The escalation comes after U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein traveled to the region in pursuit of a deal to end months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that has erupted into full-on war. Israeli attacks have killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The fighting has displaced about 1.2 million people, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, about 90 soldiers and nearly 50 civilians have been killed by bombardment in northern Israel and the fighting. An eight-story building is turned to rubble The 4 a.m. strikes destroyed an eight-story building in central Beirut. Hezbollah legislator Amin Shiri said no Hezbollah officials were inside. The attack stripped the facades from some nearby buildings and crumpled cars. 'The area is residential, with closely packed buildings and narrow streets, making the situation challenging,' said Walid Al-Hashash, a first responder with the Lebanese Civil Defense. Israel’s military did not comment on the casualties. Also Saturday, a drone strike killed two people and injured three in the southern Lebanese port city of Tyre, according to the Lebanese state-run National News Agency. Mohammed Bikai, spokesperson for the Fatah Palestinian faction in the Tyre area, said those killed were Palestinian refugees from nearby al-Rashidieh camp who were out fishing. Despite a warning last month by Israel's army to avoid Lebanon's southern coast, 'you can’t tell someone who needs to eat that you can’t fish,' Bikai said. The Health Ministry said other airstrikes killed eight people, including four children, in the eastern town of Shmustar, five others in the southern village of Roumin, and another five people in the northeastern village of Budai. Sticking points in cease-fire talks Two Western diplomatic officials on Saturday described disputed points between Israel and Lebanon in cease-fire negotiations. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the talks. The current proposal calls for a two-month cease-fire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River. Thousands more Lebanese army troops would patrol the border area with U.N. peacekeepers, and an international committee would monitor the deal's implementation. The officials said Israel wanted more guarantees that Hezbollah’s weapons are removed from the border area. Israeli officials have said they would not agree to a deal that did not explicitly grant them freedom to strike in Lebanon if they believe Hezbollah is violating it. Lebanese officials have said the inclusion of such a term would violate their country's sovereignty. And Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said this week that the militant group would not agree to a deal that does not entail a 'complete and comprehensive end to the aggression.' Lebanon and Israel also dispute which countries would sit on the monitoring committee. The officials said Israel refused to allow France, which has been close with Lebanon since its colonial rule there ended. Lebanon refused to have Britain, a close ally of Israel. Deadly strikes in Gaza and people trapped in rubble In northern Gaza, the Health Ministry said at least 80 people were killed on Thursday and Friday, including near the Kamal Adwan and Al-Ahli hospitals. It said dozens of people were trapped under the rubble. Israel’s army said it wasn't aware of a strike near Kamal Adwan, and it didn’t respond to questions about the other attacks. On Saturday, at least six people, including three children and two women, were killed in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to Associated Press reporters and staff at Nasser Hospital. 'Suddenly we woke up to dust, smoke and a fire,' said one grieving father, Ahmad Ghassan. 'We found him dead and his brother injured.' Another father wept as he carried his child's body in a bloodstained sheet. And Al-Awda Hospital said it received six bodies after Israel shelled a house north of the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. The Palestinian death toll from the 13-month-long war surpassed 44,000 this week, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. It has said more than half the dead are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has devastated wide areas, and around 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands live in tent camps with little food, water or basic services. At least two women were shot dead Saturday while waiting in line for bread in central Deir al-Balah, relatives and witnesses told the AP. It was unclear who shot them and why. The United Nations says its attempts to support hard-hit northern Gaza, which has been the focus of a renewed Israeli offensive for weeks, have been denied or impeded, and that less than 20% of the population has remained there since the offensive began. Jordan security forces kill man who opened fire near Israeli Embassy Authorities in Jordan say they shot and killed a man who opened fire on a police patrol near the Israeli Embassy, an attack that left three police officers hurt. The shooting happened early Sunday in the Rabiah neighborhood of Amman, the Jordanian capital. Jordan’s Public Security Directorate said in a statement that a man was shooting in the area, and police pursued the shooter. 'He was chased and surrounded, so he started firing gunshots at the security force, which in turn applied the rules of engagement, which resulted in the killing of the perpetrator,' the statement said. It did not identify the shooter. Israel and Jordan reached a peace deal in 1994. Tensions have been high between the two countries amid the Israel-Hamas war, which has decimated the Gaza Strip, and the Israeli ground offensive in Lebanon. ___ Associated Press writers Fadi Tawil in Tyre, Lebanon, Ibrahim Hazboun in Jerusalem, Wafaa Shurafa in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip and Mohammad Jahjouh in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip contributed to this report. —— Find more of AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-at-least-11-killed-and-dozens-injured-in-israeli-strikes-in-beirut-as-diplomats-push-for-cease-fire/	2024-11-23T22:20:16-08:00	
Israel cracks down on Palestinian citizens who speak out against ...	UMM AL-FAHM, Israel (AP) — Israel’s yearlong crackdown against Palestinian citizens who speak out against the war in Gaza is prompting many to self-censor out of fear of being jailed and further marginalized in society, while some still find ways to dissent — carefully. Ahmed Khalefa's life turned upside down after he was charged with inciting terrorism for chanting in solidarity with Gaza at an anti-war protest in October 2023. The lawyer and city counselor from central Israel says he spent three difficult months in jail followed by six months detained in an apartment. It's unclear when he'll get a final verdict on his guilt or innocence. Until then, he's forbidden from leaving his home from dusk to dawn. Khalefa is one of more than 400 Palestinian citizens of Israel who, since the start of the war in Gaza, have been investigated by police for 'incitement to terrorism' or 'incitement to violence,' according to Adalah, a legal rights group for minorities. More than half of those investigated were also criminally charged or detained, Adalah said. 'Israel made it clear they see us more as enemies than as citizens,' Khalefa said in an interview at a cafe in his hometown of Umm al-Fahm, Israel's second-largest Palestinian city. Israel has roughly 2 million Palestinian citizens, whose families remained within the borders of what became Israel in 1948. Among them are Muslims and Christians, and they maintain family and cultural ties to Gaza and the West Bank, which Israel captured in 1967. Israel says its Palestinian citizens enjoy equal rights, including the right to vote, and they are well-represented in many professions. However, Palestinians are widely discriminated against in areas like housing and the job market. Israeli authorities have opened more incitement cases against Palestinian citizens during the war in Gaza than in the previous five years combined, Adalah's records show. Israeli authorities have not said how many cases ended in convictions and imprisonment. The Justice Ministry said it did not have statistics on those convictions. Just being charged with incitement to terrorism or identifying with a terrorist group can land a suspect in detention until they're sentenced, under the terms of a 2016 law. In addition to being charged as criminals, Palestinians citizens of Israel — who make up around 20% of the country’s population — have lost jobs, been suspended from schools and faced police interrogations posting online or demonstrating, activists and rights watchdogs say. It’s had a chilling effect. 'Anyone who tries to speak out about the war will be imprisoned and harassed in his work and education,' said Oumaya Jabareen, whose son was jailed for eight months after an anti-war protest. 'People here are all afraid, afraid to say no to this war.' Jabareen was among hundreds of Palestinians who filled the streets of Umm al-Fahm earlier this month carrying signs and chanting political slogans. It appeared to be the largest anti-war demonstration in Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. But turnout was low, and Palestinian flags and other national symbols were conspicuously absent. In the years before the war, some protests could draw tens of thousands of Palestinians in Israel. Authorities tolerated the recent protest march, keeping it under heavily armed supervision. Helicopters flew overhead as police with rifles and tear gas jogged alongside the crowd, which dispersed without incident after two hours. Khalefa said he chose not to attend. Shortly after the Oct. 7 attack, Israel’s far-right government moved quickly to invigorate a task force that has charged Palestinian citizens of Israel with 'supporting terrorism' for posts online or protesting against the war. At around the same time, lawmakers amended a security bill to increase surveillance of online activity by Palestinians in Israel, said Nadim Nashif, director of the digital rights group 7amleh. These moves gave authorities more power to restrict freedom of expression and intensify their arrest campaigns, Nashif said. The task force is led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, a hard-line national security minister who oversees the police. His office said the task force has monitored thousands of posts allegedly expressing support for terror organizations and that police arrested 'hundreds of terror supporters,' including public opinion leaders, social media influencers, religious figures, teachers and others. 'Freedom of speech is not the freedom to incite ... which harms public safety and our security,' his office said in a statement. But activists and rights groups say the government has expanded its definition of incitement much too far, targeting legitimate opinions that are at the core of freedom of expression. Myssana Morany, a human rights attorney at Adalah, said Palestinian citizens have been charged for seemingly innocuous things like sending a meme of a captured Israeli tank in Gaza in a private WhatsApp group chat. Another person was charged for posting a collage of children’s photos, captioned in Arabic and English: 'Where were the people calling for humanity when we were killed?' The feminist activist group Kayan said over 600 women called its hotline because of blowback in the workplace for speaking out against the war or just mentioning it unfavorably. Over the summer, around two dozen anti-war protesters in the port city of Haifa were only allowed to finish three chants before police forcefully scattered the gathering into the night. Yet Jewish Israelis demanding a hostage release deal protest regularly — and the largest drew hundreds of thousands to the streets of Tel Aviv. Khalefa, the city counselor, is not convinced the crackdown on speech will end, even if the war eventually does. He said Israeli prosecutors took issue with slogans that broadly praised resistance and urged Gaza to be strong, but which didn’t mention violence or any militant groups. For that, he said, the government is trying to disbar him, and he faces up to eight years in prison. 'They wanted to show us the price of speaking out,' Khalefa said. ___ Associated Press writers Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv, Israel, Ibrahim Hazboun in Jerusalem, Mahmoud Illean in Umm al-Fahm, and Drew Callister in New York, contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-cracks-down-on-palestinian-citizens-who-speak-out-against-the-war-in-gaza/	2024-11-23T21:15:21-08:00	
Many in Gaza are eating just once a day, as hunger spreads amid a...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Yasmin Eid coughs and covers her face, cooking a small pot of lentils over a fire fed with twigs and scrap paper in the tent she shares with her husband and four young daughters in the Gaza Strip. It was their only meal Wednesday — it was all they could afford. 'My girls suck on their thumbs because of how hungry they are, and I pat their backs until they sleep,' she said. After being displaced five times, the Eids reside in central Gaza, where aid groups have relatively more access than in the north, which has been largely isolated and heavily destroyed since Israel began waging a renewed offensive against the militant group Hamas in early October. But nearly everyone in Gaza is going hungry these days. In the north experts say a full-blown famine may be underway. On Thursday, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of using 'starvation as a method of warfare' — charges Israel adamantly denies. In Deir al-Balah, the Eids are among hundreds of thousands sheltering in squalid tent camps. The local bakeries shut down for five days this week. The price of a bag of bread climbed above $13 by Wednesday, as bread and flour vanished from shelves before more supplies arrived. The United Nations humanitarian office warned of a 'stark increase' in the number of households experiencing severe hunger in central and southern Gaza. The amount of food Israel has let into Gaza the past seven weeks has plummeted, now at nearly the lowest levels of the entire war. Even less than that is reaching the territory’s 2.3 million Palestinians because of the many obstacles to distribution, aid groups and the U.N. say – including restrictions on movement by the Israeli military, ongoing fighting, damage to roads, and theft. Armed men robbed nearly 100 aid trucks last weekend in southern Gaza, close to Israeli military positions. Israel blamed Hamas but appears to have taken no action to stop the looting, while Hamas said it was the work of local bandits. For the Eids, hunger is the daily routine For months, Yasmin and her family have gone to bed hungry. 'Everything has increased in price, and we cannot buy anything,' she said. 'We always go to sleep without having dinner.' She misses coffee, but a single packet of Nescafe goes for around $1.30. A kilogram (2 pounds) of onions goes for $10, a medium bottle of cooking oil for $15 — if available. Meat and chicken all but vanished from the markets months ago, but there are still some local vegetables. Such sums are astronomical in an impoverished territory where few people earn regular incomes. Crowds of hundreds wait hours to get food from charities, which are also struggling. Hani Almadhoun, co-founder of the Gaza Soup Kitchen, said his teams can offer only small bowls of rice or pasta once a day. He said they 'can go to the market on one day and buy something for $5, and then go back in the afternoon to find it doubled or tripled in price.' Its kitchen in the central town of Zuweida operated on a daily budget of around $500 for much of the war. When the amount of aid entering Gaza plummeted in October, its costs climbed to around $1,300 a day. It can feed about half of the 1,000 families who line up each day. The sharp decline in aid, and a U.S. ultimatum Israel says it places no limits on the amount of aid entering Gaza and has announced a number of measures it says are aimed at increasing the flow in recent weeks, including the opening of a new crossing. But the military's own figures show that the amount of aid entering Gaza plunged to around 1,800 trucks in October, down from over 4,200 the previous month. At the current rate of entry, around 2,400 trucks would come into Gaza in November. Around 500 trucks entered each day before the war. Israel blames U.N. agencies for not retrieving the aid, pointing to hundreds of truckloads languishing on the Gaza side of the border. The U.N. says it often cannot reach the border to pick up aid cargos because the Israeli military denies requests for movement and because of ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order. As a result, it says, only about half the incoming aid is distributed. The war started Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are dead, and Hamas militants have repeatedly regrouped after Israeli operations, carrying out hit-and-run attacks from tunnels and bombed-out buildings. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many of the dead were fighters. The United States warned Israel in October that it might be forced to curtail some of its crucial military support if Israel did not rapidly ramp up the amount of aid entering Gaza. But after the 30-day ultimatum expired, the Biden administration declined to take any action, saying there had been some progress. Israel, meanwhile, passed legislation severing ties with UNRWA. Israel accuses the agency of allowing itself to be infiltrated by Hamas — allegations denied by the U.N. Israeli news outlets have reported that officials are considering plans for the military to take over aid distribution or contract it out to private security companies. Asked about such plans Wednesday, government spokesman David Mercer said 'Israel is looking at many creative solutions to ensure a better future for Gaza.' Yoav Gallant, the former defense minister who was seen as a voice of moderation in the far-right government before being fired this month, warned on X that handing over aid distribution to a private firm was a 'euphemism for the beginning of military rule.' As that debate plays out in Jerusalem, less than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away from central Gaza, most Palestinians in the territory are focused on staying alive in a war with no end in sight. 'I find it difficult to talk about the suffering we are experiencing. I am ashamed to talk about it,' said Yasmin’s husband, Hani. 'What can I tell you? I’m a person who has 21 family members and is unable to provide them with a bag of flour.' ___ Khaled reported from Cairo.

NATO and Ukraine to hold emergency talks after Russia's attack wi...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — NATO and Ukraine will hold emergency talks Tuesday after Russia attacked a central city with an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile that escalated the nearly 33-month-old war. The conflict is 'entering a decisive phase,' Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Friday, and 'taking on very dramatic dimensions.' Ukraine’s parliament canceled a session as security was tightened following Thursday's Russian strike on a military facility in the city of Dnipro. In a stark warning to the West, President Vladimir Putin said in a nationally televised speech to his nation that the attack with the intermediate-range Oreshnik missile was retaliation for Kyiv’s use of U.S. and British longer-range missiles capable of striking deeper into Russian territory. Putin said Western air defense systems would be powerless to stop the new missile. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov kept up the bellicose tone on Friday, blaming 'the reckless decisions and actions of Western countries' in supplying weapons to Ukraine to strike Russia. 'The Russian side has clearly demonstrated its capabilities, and the contours of further retaliatory actions in the event that our concerns were not taken into account have also been quite clearly outlined,' he said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, widely seen as having the warmest relations with the Kremlin in the European Union, echoed Moscow's talking points, suggesting the use of U.S.-supplied weapons in Ukraine likely requires direct American involvement. 'These are rockets that are fired and then guided to a target via an electronic system, which requires the world’s most advanced technology and satellite communications capability,' Orbán said on state radio. 'There is a strong assumption … that these missiles cannot be guided without the assistance of American personnel.' Orbán cautioned against underestimating Russia’s responses, emphasizing that the country’s recent modifications to its nuclear deployment doctrine should not be dismissed as a 'bluff.' 'It’s not a trick… there will be consequences,' he said. Separately in Kyiv, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský called Thursday's missile strike an 'escalatory step and an attempt of the Russian dictator to scare the population of Ukraine and to scare the population of Europe.' At a news conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Lipavský also expressed his full support for delivering the necessary additional air defense systems to protect Ukrainian civilians from the 'heinous attacks.' He underlined that the Czech Republic will impose no limits on the use of its weapons and equipment given to Ukraine. Three lawmakers from Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, confirmed that Friday's previously scheduled session was called off due to the ongoing threat of Russian missiles targeting government buildings in central Kyiv. In addition, there also was a recommendation to limit the work of all commercial offices and nongovernmental organizations 'in that perimeter, and local residents were warned of the increased threat,' said lawmaker Mykyta Poturaiev, who added this is not the first time such a threat has been received. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office continued to work in compliance with standard security measures, a spokesperson said. Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate said the Oreshnik missile, whose name in Russian means 'hazelnut tree,' was fired from the Kapustin Yar 4th Missile Test Range in Russia’s Astrakhan region, and flew 15 minutes before striking Dnipro. The missile had six nonnuclear warheads each carrying six submunitions and reached a spoeed of Mach 11, it said. Test launches of a similar missile were conducted in October 2023 and June 2024, the directorate said. The Pentagon confirmed that Russia’s missile was a new, experimental type of intermediate-range missile based on its RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile. Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russia struck a residential district of Sumy overnight with Iranian-designed Shahed drones, killing two people and injuring 13, the regional administration said.. Ukraine’s Suspilne media, quoting Sumy regional head Volodymyr Artiukh, said the drones were stuffed with shrapnel elements. 'These weapons are used to destroy people, not to destroy objects,' said Artiukh, according to Suspilne. —— Associated Press journalists Lorne Cook in Brussels, Samya Kullab in Kyiv, Dasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, and Justin Spike in Budapest, Hungary, contributed. —— Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraines-parliament-cancels-session-after-russia-fired-a-new-missile/	2024-11-22T06:40:46-08:00	
Putin says Russia attacked Ukraine with a new missile that he cla...	The Kremlin fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile at Ukraine on Thursday in response to Kyiv's use this week of American and British missiles capable of striking deeper into Russia, President Vladimir Putin said. In a televised address to the country, the Russian president warned that U.S. air defense systems would be powerless to stop the new missile, which he said flies at ten times the speed of sound and which he called the Oreshnik — Russian for hazelnut tree. He also said it could be used to attack any Ukrainian ally whose missiles are used to attack Russia. 'We believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,' Putin said in his first comments since President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the green light this month to use U.S. ATACMS missiles to strike at limited targets inside Russia. Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed that Russia’s missile was a new, experimental type of intermediate range missile based on it’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile. 'This was new type of lethal capability that was deployed on the battlefield, so that was certainly of concern,' Singh said, noting that the missile could carry either conventional or nuclear warheads. The U.S. was notified ahead of the launch through nuclear risk reduction channels, she said. The attack on the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro came in response to Kyiv's use of longer-range U.S. and British missiles in strikes Tuesday and Wednesday on southern Russia, Putin said. Those strikes caused a fire at an ammunition depot in Russia's Bryansk region and killed and wounded some security services personnel in the Kursk region, he said. 'In the event of an escalation of aggressive actions, we will respond decisively and in kind,' the Russian president said, adding that Western leaders who are hatching plans to use their forces against Moscow should 'seriously think about this.' Putin said the Oreshnik fired Thursday struck a well-known missile factory in Dnipro. He also said Russia would issue advance warnings if it launches more strikes with the Oreshnik against Ukraine to allow civilians to evacuate to safety — something Moscow hasn’t done before previous aerial attacks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov initially said Russia hadn’t warned the U.S. about the coming launch of the new missile, noting that it wasn't obligated to do so. But he later changed tack and said Moscow did issue a warning 30 minutes before the launch. Putin's announcement came hours after Ukraine claimed that Russia had used an intercontinental ballistic missile in the Dnipro attack, which wounded two people and damaged an industrial facility and rehabilitation center for people with disabilities, according to local officials. But American officials said an initial U.S. assessment indicated the strike was carried out with an intermediate-range ballistic missile. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that the use of the missile was an 'obvious and serious escalation in the scale and brutality of this war, a cynical violation of the UN Charter.' He also said there had been 'no strong global reaction' to the use of the missile, which he said could threaten other countries. 'Putin is very sensitive to this. He is testing you, dear partners,' Zelenskyy wrote. 'If there is no tough response to Russia’s actions, it means they see that such actions are possible.' The attack comes during a week of escalating tensions, as the U.S. eased restrictions on Ukraine's use of American-made longer-range missiles inside Russia and Putin lowered the threshold for launching nuclear weapons. The Ukrainian air force said in a statement that the Dnipro attack was launched from Russia’s Astrakhan region, on the Caspian Sea. 'Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is,' Zelenskyy said hours before Putin's address. 'And how afraid he is.' Russia was sending a message by attacking Ukraine with an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of releasing multiple warheads at extremely high speeds, even if they are less accurate than cruise missiles or short-range ballistic missiles, said Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. 'Why might you use it therefore?' Savill said. 'Signaling — signaling to the Ukrainians. We’ve got stuff that outrages you. But really signaling to the West ‘We’re happy to enter into a competition around intermediate range ballistic missiles. P.S.: These could be nuclear tipped. Do you really want to take that risk?’' Military experts say that modern ICBMs and IRBMs are extremely difficult to intercept, although Ukraine has previously claimed to have stopped some other weapons that Russia described as 'unstoppable,' including the air-launched Kinzhal hypersonic missile. David Albright, of the Washington-based think tank the Institute for Science and International Security, said he was 'skeptical' of Putin’s claim, adding that Russian technology sometimes 'falls short.' He suggested Putin was 'taunting the West to try to shoot it down ... like a braggart boasting, taunting his enemy.' Earlier this week, the Biden administration authorized Ukraine to use the U.S.-supplied, longer-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia — a move that drew an angry response from Moscow. Days later, Ukraine fired several of the missiles into Russia, according to the Kremlin. The same day, Putin signed a new doctrine that allows for a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. The doctrine is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons. In response, Western countries, including the U.S., said Russia has used irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behavior throughout the war to intimidate Ukraine and other nations. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday that Russia’s formal lowering of the threshold for nuclear weapons use did not prompt any changes in U.S. doctrine. She pushed back on concerns that the decision to allow Ukraine to use Western missiles to strike deeper inside Russia might escalate the war. ″They’re the ones who are escalating this,' she said of the Kremlin — in part because of a flood of North Korean troops sent to the region. More than 1,000 days into war, Russia has the upper hand, with its larger army advancing in Donetsk and Ukrainian civilians suffering from relentless drone and missile strikes. Analysts and observers say the loosening of restrictions on Ukraine's use of Western missiles is unlikely to change the the course of the war, but it puts the Russian army in a more vulnerable position and could complicate the logistics that are crucial in warfare. Putin has also warned that the move would mean that Russia and NATO are at war. 'It is an important move and it pulls against, undermines the narrative that Putin had been trying to establish that it was fine for Russia to rain down Iranian drones and North Korean missiles on Ukraine but a reckless escalation for Ukraine to use Western-supplied weapons at legitimate targets in Russia,' said Peter Ricketts, a former U.K. national security adviser who now sits in the House of Lords. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless and Emma Burrows in London, and Zeke Miller and Lolita C.

Russia tests ballistic missile in Ukraine strike	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) - Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed Thursday, Russia launched an 'experimental' intermediate-range missile toward Ukraine overnight. Putin is threatening more aggressive strikes against Ukraine and its allies. He says the U.S. is escalating the war by allowing Ukraine, for the first time, to launch long range missiles into Russia. The White House and Pentagon said Thursday the U.S. will continue to support Ukraine, despite Putin’s warning. This week Putin lowered the threshold for launching nuclear weapons. 'This is more of the same irresponsible rhetoric that we've heard from Russia,' says White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre. 'Russia are the ones escalating this war.' The Pentagon says the U.S. was notified ahead of the missile launch but refused to answer if Russian missiles could ultimately reach the U.S. Putin claimed the U.S. air defense system was incapable of intercepting one. 'We're not getting into that,' says Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh. On Capitol Hill, Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) accused President Joe Biden of 'baiting' Putin in his final weeks in office. He called his actions 'dangerous.' Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on the other hand is criticizing the president for not acting sooner to strengthen Ukraine’s defense options. 'History will record hesitation, indecision and cowardness' said McConnell on the Senate floor Tuesday. President-elect Donald Trump is promising to usher in peace talks once he takes office next year. Speaking on a panel with the Atlantic Council Thursday, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep Michael McCaul (R-Texas.) cautioned the president-elect not to trust Putin. 'Don't ever underestimate him. Once KGB always. He wants all the Ukraine that's rightfully his in his mind,' says McCaul.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/russia-tests-ballistic-missile-in-ukraine-strike/	2024-11-21T14:18:27-08:00	
Pro-Ukraine lawmakers make last-ditch effort to safeguard US supp...	Pro-Ukraine lawmakers in both parties are working to get key provisions surrounding U.S. support for Kyiv passed into law by January, an effort to safeguard assistance that is under threat in a transition to a Trump administration and full GOP control of Congress. If passed into law, the Stand With Ukraine Act would compel the president to request ongoing military and economic support for Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia. The bill's goal is to help overcome increasing partisanship around the passage of supplemental aid packages. The legislation is bipartisan and bicameral, sponsored in the House by Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) and Mike Quigley (D-Ill.). It’s sponsored by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in the Senate. Some lawmakers are working to transform the bill's provisions to amendments for the National Defense Authorization Act, a House aide told The Hill. The NDAA is considered must-pass, end-of-year legislation that authorizes appropriations for the Pentagon and other defense-related activities. It’s not yet clear if lawmakers would seek to put most of the Stand with Ukraine Act provisions into one amendment or file a few separate amendments. Other supporters of the bill said it should be brought up for a standalone floor vote. 'Just have [Senate Majority Leader Chuck] Schumer (D-N.Y.) bring it up and let's vote,' Graham told The Hill. Either way, time is running out to secure passage of the bill before President-elect Trump — who is openly critical of how much aid the U.S. has provided to Ukraine — comes into office. The House and Senate have three more working weeks in December. Trump has pledged to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, saying he’ll bring together Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to make a peace deal. While support for Ukraine in the Senate remains fairly robust, Trump’s skepticism is shared by many Republicans in the House. It’s not clear if House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) would support putting stand-alone legislation on the floor, given that approximately half of the conference voted against a $60 billion aid package for Ukraine that passed in April. Also, passage of the bill could be viewed as constraining Trump’s future moves on Ukraine and Russia. 'I don’t expect we’ll see anything before the end of the year,' said Quigley. Wilson also said it’s better to wait for Trump’s return before moving on the legislation, but added he will push hard for the bill to be considered in the next Congress. 'It's not that the bill is not good, it is just that, there is a deferral when you have a new Congress elected, a new president, elected a new majority in the U.S. Senate,' he said. 'I think it's more crucial and more obvious than ever that war-criminal Putin is not to be trusted.' But Republican attitudes are trending away from Ukraine, and that’s unlikely to change in the next Congress. In April, 112 Republicans voted against the Ukraine supplemental aid package — more than half the conference. On Wednesday, 37 Republican senators voted in favor of a joint resolution of disapproval, sponsored by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky), that aimed to force Ukraine to pay back loans provided by the U.S. Blumenthal said passage of the bill could help put Ukraine in a better negotiating position with Russia, demonstrating bipartisan backing from the U.S. Congress. 'If there are negotiations, as President-elect Trump has said there should be, then Ukraine’s position at the bargaining table should be one of strength as a result of gains on the battlefield and also support in Congress, so I think that kind of measure from Congress could be very important,' he said. 'I’ll take any course,' he said of his preference for how it gets passed. The bill itself doesn’t authorize new funding for Ukraine. But it directs the president to submit budget requests to Congress on what amount is needed to execute the provisions of the bill. Some of the topline provisions of the Stand with Ukraine Act include prioritizing sending air defense, artillery and long-range missiles, armored vehicles, among other fighting systems. The text of the bill also commits the U.S. to help in modernizing Ukraine’s security capabilities, strengthening joint military relationships, prioritizing excess U.S. defense article transfers to Ukraine and fast-tracking foreign military financing sales to Ukraine. The bill’s drafting is an attempt by Congress to codify the 10-year bilateral security agreement that President Biden signed with Zelensky in June — safeguarding the agreement from any effort by a potential Trump administration to retreat from the commitments. Other provisions include treating Ukraine as a major non-NATO ally for the purpose of transferring defense assistance; reauthorizing the Lend-Lease for Ukraine, which would allow the transfer of U.S. weapons to Ukraine and allow payback at a later date; and supporting Ukraine in its reconstruction and recovery efforts. U.S. support for Ukraine is seen by its backers as indispensable in the country’s efforts to push back against Russia’s nearly three-year invasion. Zelensky has warned against a disruption of the US-Europe alliance that has held firm under Biden. 'This period, this moment depends, I think, on our unity in Ukraine,' Zelensky said in an interview Wednesday with Fox News. 'And I think that what is very dangerous if we will lose unity in Europe and what is most important, unity between Ukraine and the United States.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/pro-ukraine-lawmakers-make-last-ditch-effort-to-safeguard-us-support/	2024-11-21T14:02:58-08:00	
Middle East latest: ICC issues warrant for Israel's Netanyahu as ...	The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and a Hamas military leader, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The announcement came as health officials in the Gaza Strip said the death toll from the 13-month-old war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000. The warrant marked the first time that a sitting leader of a major Western ally has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by a global court of justice. The ICC panel said there were reasonable grounds to believe that both Netanyahu and his ex-defense minister bear responsibility for the war crime of starvation and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. Israel’s war has caused heavy destruction across Gaza, decimated parts of the territory and driven almost the entire population of 2.3 million people from their homes, leaving most dependent on aid to survive. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here’s the Latest: Israeli strikes in Lebanon kill more than 50 people nationwide BEIRUT — Israeli strikes killed at least 51 people on Thursday in towns and villages across Lebanon, according to the country's Health Ministry. In eastern Lebanon, intensified Israeli airstrikes killed 40 people in 10 different towns in Baalbek province, the ministry said. Rescuers were searching under the rubble of destroyed buildings, said Gov. Bachir Khodr, calling it 'a very violent day' in his province. In southern Lebanon, five people were killed by an Israeli strike in Tyre province, and seven others were killed by a strike in Nabatiyeh province, the Health Ministry said. As of Thursday, the Health Ministry has recorded at least 3,583 people killed and 15,244 wounded in Lebanon during the 13-month war between Hezbollah and Israel, with the majority of casualties taking place after Israel’s escalation and ground offensive in late September. Food deliveries across Gaza are grinding to a halt, UN warns UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. humanitarian chief for Gaza is warning that the delivery of critical food, water, fuel and medical supplies is grinding to a halt throughout the territory and 'the survival of two million people hangs in the balance.' Muhannad Hadi said in a statement Thursday that Israeli authorities have been banning commercial imports for more than six weeks and at the same time thefts from humanitarian convoys by armed individuals have surged. 'In 2024, U.N. trucks have been looted 75 times –- including 15 such attacks since Nov. 4 alone –- and armed people have broken into U.N. facilities on 34 occasions,' he said. Last week, one driver was shot in the head and hospitalized along with another truck driver, Hadi said. And on Saturday 98 trucks were looted in a single attack which saw the vehicles damaged or stolen. The Gaza humanitarian coordinator said bakeries are closing because of lack of flour or fuel to operate generators. 'Palestinian civilians are struggling to survive under unlivable conditions, amid relentless hostilities,' Hadi said. He demanded the immediate improvement of security and conditions throughout Gaza to allow the safe and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid 'through lawful means.' Israel says it puts no limit on the supplies permitted into Gaza, and it blames the U.N. distribution system. But Israel’s official figures show the amount of aid it has let in has plunged since the beginning of October. The U.N has blamed Israeli military restrictions, along with widespread lawlessness that has led to theft of aid shipments. Biden administration rejects ICC arrest warrants for top Israeli leaders WASHINGTON — The White House fundamentally rejects the International Criminal Court’s decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday. She said the Biden administration was 'deeply concerned by the prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.' The Biden administration has increased its warnings and appeals to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do more to spare civilians in airstrikes and other attacks, and to allow more aid to reach Gaza. However, a 30-day Biden administration deadline came and went earlier this month for Israel to meet specific U.S. targets to improve its treatment of Palestinian civilians in Gaza trapped in the war. U.S. demands included that Israel lift a near-total ban on delivery of aid to hard-hit north Gaza for starving civilians there. Israeli strike in Gaza kills 9 people, including 3 kids playing outside KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — The three children were playing outside a cluster of tents housing displaced people in the Gaza Strip when an Israeli airstrike killed them, along with six other people. It’s become a grim, near-daily ritual more than 13 months into the Israel-Hamas war, which local health authorities said Thursday has killed over 44,000 Palestinians. Israel carries out frequent strikes against what it says are militants hiding in civilian areas, and women and children are nearly always among the dead. Wednesday’s strike killed Hamza al-Qadi, 7, his brother Abdulaziz, 5, and their sister Laila, 4, in a tent camp in the southern city of Khan Younis. Areej al-Qadi, their mother, says they were playing outside when they were killed. 'All that’s left of them are their notebooks, their books and a blood-stained jacket,' she said as she broke into tears. 'They were children who did nothing.' The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment on the strike. Gaza’s Health Ministry said Thursday that 44,056 Palestinians have been killed and 104,268 wounded since the start of the war, which was ignited by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel. Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 people. The Health Ministry does not say how many of those killed in Gaza were fighters but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. Israel, which rarely comments on individual strikes, says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Hours after the ministry announced the latest toll, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and a Hamas military leader. Mahmoud bin Hassan, the children’s father, said he buried them on Thursday. He asked when the international community would take action to stop the war. 'When the entire Palestinian population has been killed?' he said. Rights group applauds ICC arrest warrants NEW YORK — Human Rights Watch applauded the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants issued Thursday against both Israeli and Hamas officials. The warrants 'break through the perception that certain individuals are beyond the reach of the law,' the associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, Balkees Jarrah, said in a statement. The New York-based rights group earlier this month released a report saying Israel has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip, including massive forced displacements that amount to ethnic cleansing. Israeli prosecutors charge a former Netanyahu aid of leaking classified documents JERUSALEM — Israeli prosecutors have charged a former aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with leaking classified documents to international media, apparently to protect the Israeli leader from criticism as a hostage deal was collapsing. Eli Feldstein, a former media adviser to Netanyahu, was charged Thursday with leaking classified information with the intent of harming state security and obstruction of justice. The leaked documents are said to have formed the basis of a widely discredited article in the London-based Jewish Chronicle — which was later withdrawn — suggesting Hamas planned to spirit hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, and an article in Germany’s Bild newspaper that said Hamas was drawing out the hostage talks as a form of psychological warfare on Israel. Critics say the leaks were aimed at giving Netanyahu political cover as the case-fire talks ground to a halt. Some have accused Netanyahu of resisting a deal in to preserve his governing coalition, which includes hard-line members who have threatened to bring down the government if he makes concessions to Hamas. The leaks came at a time of public uproar over the deaths of six hostages who were killed by their Hamas captors as Israeli soldiers were closing in. The indictment said the leaks were meant 'to create media influence on the public discourse in Israel in regards to the handling of the hostage situation, after the news of the murder of six hostages.' The indictment identified two other Netanyahu aides as being connected to the scheme, but only Feldstein and an unidentified reservist in Israeli military intelligence were charged. Netanyahu, who denies the accusations, has not been identified as a suspect in the burgeoning investigation. Israeli media say if convicted, Feldstein could potentially face life in prison. Israeli military opens probe into death of a man in Hezbollah ambush JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military has launched an investigation into the death of a 70-year-old Israeli man who entered Lebanon with Israeli forces and was killed in a Hezbollah ambush. Investigators are trying to determine, among other things, who allowed Zeev Erlich into the combat zone with the forces and why he was permitted to enter. According to Israeli media reports, Erlich was not on active duty when he was shot, but was wearing a military uniform and had a weapon. The army said he was a reservist with the rank of major and identified him as a 'fallen soldier' when it announced his death. Erlich was a well-known West Bank settler and researcher of Jewish history. Media reports said Erlich was permitted to enter Lebanon to explore a local archaeological site. The army said a 20-year-old soldier was killed in the same incident, while an officer was badly wounded. The army announced Thursday that the chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, has appointed a team of experts 'to examine and strengthen operational discipline and military culture' following the incident. It said its commander for northern Israel, Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin, would launch a separate 'command inquiry,' while Israeli military police conduct a separate probe. Such investigations can lead to criminal charges. At least 29 killed by Israeli strikes across Lebanon, state media reports BEIRUT — At least 29 people were killed Thursday in Israeli strikes on different towns and villages across Lebanon, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry and state-run media. In eastern Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes killed 26 people in six different towns in Baalbek province, the health ministry and the National News Agency said. In Tyre province, southern Lebanon, three people were killed in an Israeli strike, the health ministry said. The health ministry Wednesday said that over 3,550 people have been killed in the 13-month war between Hezbollah and Israel, the majority following Israel’s escalation in late September. EU foreign policy chief says ICC arrest warrants are binding on all bloc members The European Union's foreign policy chief has underlined that the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas officials are a legal and not political matter, and that they are binding on all 27 EU member countries and other signatories to the ICC to implement. 'The tragedy in Gaza has to stop,' Josep Borrell told reporters during a visit to Jordan. 'It is not a political decision. It is the decision of an international court of justice, and the decision of the court has to be respected, and implemented.' 'This decision is a binding decision on all state parties of the court, which include all members of the European Union,' he added. Turkey's ruling party welcomes warrant against Netanyahu ANKARA — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling partyhas welcomed the decision by the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamn Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, calling it a judgement made for the sake of 'humanity.' Omer Celik, spokesman for the Erdogan’s party, said on the social media platform X that Netanyahu and Gallant would 'eventually be held accountable for genocide.' Celik also criticised Israeli officials who described the ICC decision as antisemitic. Turkey is among the most vocal critics of Israel’s military actions in Gaza and has submitted a formal request to join a genocide case that South Africa has filed against Israel at the U.N.’s International Court of Justice. Dutch minister says his country would arrest Netanyahu if he visits Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp, whose country hosts the International Criminal Court, has confirmed The Netherlands would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he arrived on Dutch soil. 'The line from the government is clear. We are obliged to cooperate with the ICC ... we abide 100% by the Rome Statute,' he said in response to a question in parliament Thursday. Other European officials were more cautious. In France, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said he supported the International Criminal Court's prosecutor but declined to comment when asked more specifically if France would arrest Netanyahu if he were to step on French soil. 'Today, combating impunity is our priority. We ratified the ICC Statute in 2000 and have consistently supported the court’s actions. Our response will align with these principles,' Christophe Lemoine told reporters at a press conference. Lemoine added that the warrants were 'a complex legal issue ... It’s a situation that requires a lot of legal precautions.' In Italy, the foreign and justice ministries didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment about whether Italy, an ICC member which hosted the Rome conference that gave birth to the court, would honor the arrest warrant. Premier Giorgia Meloni hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in March 2023 and has strongly supported Israel since Oct. 7, while providing humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza. Israeli president says arrest warrants signal 'dark day for justice' JERUSALEM — Israel’s mostly ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, has called the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'a dark day for justice. A dark day for humanity.' In a post on X, he said the international court 'has chosen the side of terror and evil over democracy and freedom, and turned the very system of justice into a human shield for Hamas’ crimes against humanity.' Israel Katz, Israel’s new defense minister, said the decision was 'a moral disgrace, entirely tainted by antisemitism, and drags the international judicial system to an unprecedented low.' He said it 'serves Iran, the head of the snake, and its proxies.' Benny Gantz, a retired general and political rival to Netanyahu, also condemned the decision, saying it showed 'moral blindness' and was a 'shameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten.' Hamas welcomes warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant Hamas has welcomed the decision by the International Criminal Court to issue warrants against Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant, calling it an 'important and historic precedent' after what it said was decades of injustice at the hands of a 'fascist occupation.' The statement did not refer to the warrants issued for the militant group’s own leaders. Hamas called on all nations to 'cooperate with the court in bringing the Zionist war criminals, Netanyahu and Gallant, to justice, and to work immediately to stop the crimes of genocide against innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip.' Bakeries reopen in central Gaza after flour shortages DEIR AL-BALAH, The Gaza Strip — Bakeries have reopened in the central Gaza Strip after being closed for several days because of flour shortages. The shortages appear to have been linked to the looting of nearly 100 truckloads of aid by armed men in southern Gaza last weekend. Associated Press footage showed a crowd of hundreds pushing and shouting outside a bakery in the central city of Deir al-Balah on Thursday. The day before the reopening, the price of a bag of 15 loaves of pita bread had climbed above $13. 'In my house, there is not a morsel of bread, and the children are hungry,' said Sultan Abu Sultan, who was displaced from northern Gaza during the war. The amount of aid entering Gaza plunged in October as Israel launched a major offensive in the isolated north, where experts say famine may be underway. Hunger is widespread across the territory, even in central Gaza where aid groups have more access. Humanitarian organizations say Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order make it difficult to deliver assistance. Israel’s offensive, launched after Hamas’ October 2023 attack, has displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people. Hundreds of thousands are crammed into tent camps with little in the way of public services and are reliant on international food aid. Cyprus says EU must no longer stand by as an observer to the MidEast NICOSIA — The president of Cyprus says the European Union must play a bigger role in the Middle East as it can no longer stand by as an observer. President Nikos Christodoulides said the 27-member bloc needs to establish closer ties with countries that bolster regional stability like Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf states. 'The conflict in the Middle East is taking place on the EU’s doorstep, in an area of vital interest to the bloc’s interests, where any escalation or regional spillover will have significant consequences on its security and stability,' Christodoulides told an Economist conference in the Cypriot capital. Christodoulides said EU member Cyprus for years has tried to get this message across to Brussels. The island nation earlier this year was the staging ground for a maritime corridor delivering some 20,000 tons of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The EU is wracked by members’ divisions over how peace should come about in the Middle East International Criminal Court issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas officials THE HAGUE — The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas officials, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the war in Gaza and the October 2023 attacks that triggered Israel’s offensive in the Palestinian territory. The decision turns Netanyahu and the others into internationally wanted suspects and is likely to further isolate them and complicate efforts to negotiate a cease-fire to end the 13-month conflict. But its practical implications could be limited since Israel and its major ally, the United States, are not members of the court and several of the Hamas officials have been subsequently killed in the conflict. Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have previously condemned ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan’s request for the warrants as disgraceful and antisemitic. U.S. President Joe Biden also blasted the prosecutor and expressed support for Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas. Hamas also slammed the request. Death toll in Gaza surpasses 44,000, local officials say The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 13-month-old war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000, local health officials said Thursday. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The Health Ministry said 44,056 people have been killed and 104,268 wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are living in squalid tent camps with little food, water or basic services. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas, where they have built tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. Rocket from Lebanon kills 1, wounds 2 others in northern Israel JERUSALEM — A rocket fired from Lebanon killed a man and wounded two others in northern Israel on Thursday, according to the Magen David Adom rescue service. The service said paramedics found the body of the man in his 30s near a playground in the town of Nahariya, near the border with Lebanon, after a rocket attack on Thursday. Israel meanwhile struck targets in southern Lebanon and several buildings south of Beirut, the Lebanese capital, after warning people to evacuate.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-netanyahu-denounces-arrest-warrants-against-him-and-hamas-officials/	2024-11-21T13:54:00-08:00	
Top war-crimes court issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu, ex-def...	THE HAGUE (AP) — The world’s top war-crimes court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the 13-month war in Gaza. The warrants said there was reason to believe Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have used 'starvation as a method of warfare' by restricting humanitarian aid and have intentionally targeted civilians in Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza — charges Israeli officials deny. The action by the International Criminal Court came as the death toll from Israel’s campaign in Gaza passed 44,000 people, according to local health authorities, who say more than half of those killed were women and children. Their count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. Experts say hunger has become widespread across Gaza and may have reached famine levels in the north of the territory, which is under siege by Israeli troops. Netanyahu condemned the warrant against him, saying Israel 'rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions' by the court. In a statement released by his office, he said: 'There is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza.' Gallant, in a statement, said the decision 'sets a dangerous precedent against the right to self-defense and moral warfare and encourages murderous terrorism.' The decision turns Netanyahu and the others into internationally wanted suspects and could further isolate them, putting them at risk of arrest when they travel abroad. Its practical implications could be limited since Israel and its major ally, the United States, are not members of the court. Still, the warrant marked the first time that a sitting leader of a major Western ally has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by a global court of justice. It put Israel's allies, including some of its closest European friends, in an awkward position. Several leaders, including France, welcomed the court's decision and signaled they might arrest Netanyahu if he visited. The move 'represents the most dramatic step yet in the court’s involvement in the conflict between Israel and Hamas,' said Anthony Dworkin, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Israeli leaders, politicians and officials across the spectrum denounced the warrants and the ICC. The new defense minister, Israel Katz, who replaced Gallant earlier this month, said Thursday’s decision is 'a moral disgrace, entirely tainted by antisemitism, and drags the international judicial system to an unprecedented low.' Human rights groups applauded the move. The warrants against both sides 'break through the perception that certain individuals are beyond the reach of the law,' the associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, Balkees Jarrah, said in a statement. The decision came six months after ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan requested the warrants. The court issued a warrant for Mohammed Deif, head of Hamas’ armed wing, over the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that triggered Israel’s offensive in Gaza. It said it found reasonable grounds to believe Deif was involved in murder, rape, torture and the taking of hostages amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity. In the Hamas-led attack, militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and taking some 250 others hostage. Around 100 Israelis remain captive in Gaza, around a third of them believed to be dead. Khan withdrew requests for warrants for two other senior Hamas figures, Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, who have both since been killed. Israel says it also killed Deif in an airstrike, but Hamas has never confirmed his death. The warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were issued by a three-judge panel in a unanimous decision. The panel said there were reasonable grounds to believe that both men bear responsibility for the war crime of starvation and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. The judges said the lack of food, water, electricity, fuel and specific medical supplies created conditions 'calculated to bring about the destruction of part of the civilian population in Gaza,' including the deaths of children due to malnutrition and dehydration. They also found that by preventing hospital supplies and medicine from getting into Gaza, doctors were forced to operate, including performing amputations, without anesthesia or with unsafe means of sedation that led to 'great suffering.' The judges also rejected an Israeli petition challenging the court’s jurisdiction on the grounds that Israel is not a member state in the tribunal. Despite the warrants, none of the suspects is likely to face judges in The Hague anytime soon. Member countries are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. For example, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is wanted on an ICC warrant for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, recently visited Mongolia, a member state in the court but also a Russian ally. He was not arrested. Still, the threat of arrest now complicates any travel abroad by Netanyahu and Gallant — including to close allies of Israel. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the warrants are binding on all 27 members countries of the European Union. France signaled it could arrest Netanyahu if he came to its territory. Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine called it a 'complex legal issue' but said France supports the court’s actions. 'Combating impunity is our priority,' he said. 'Our response will align with these principles.' Hamas in a statement welcomed the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant but made no mention of the one against Deif. Israel’s opposition leaders fiercely criticized the ICC’s move. Benny Gantz, a retired general and political rival to Netanyahu, said it showed 'moral blindness' and was a 'shameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten.' Yair Lapid, another opposition leader, called it a 'prize for terror.' Israel’s campaign has caused heavy destruction across Gaza, decimated parts of the territory and driven almost the entire population of 2.3 million people from their homes, leaving most dependent on aid to survive. Two days after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel, Gallant announced a total seal on Gaza, vowing not to let in food, fuel or other supplies. Under U.S. pressure, Israel began allowing a trickle of humanitarian aid to enter a few weeks later. Israel now says it puts no limit on the amount of supplies into Gaza. Still, the flow of food and other goods is at nearly the lowest levels of the war, and the U.N. and other groups have said Israeli military restrictions are largely to blame, along with widespread lawlessness that has led to theft of aid shipments. The case at the ICC is separate from another legal battle Israel is waging at the top U.N. court, the International Court of Justice, in which South Africa accuses Israel of genocide, an allegation Israeli leaders staunchly deny. Lawyers for Israel argued in court that the war in Gaza was a legitimate defense of its people and that it was Hamas militants who were guilty of genocide. ___ Associated Press journalists Raf Casert in Brussels, Mike Corder in The Hague and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-international-criminal-court-issues-arrest-warrants-for-netanyahu-and-hamas-officials/	2024-11-21T09:59:43-08:00	
Ukraine says Russia launched an intercontinental missile in an at...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine claimed Thursday that Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile overnight at a city. If confirmed, it would be the first time Moscow has used such a weapon in the war. Ukraine did not provide any evidence that an ICBM was used in the attack on the central city of Dnipro, apparently armed with conventional warheads. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a missile used 'matches the speed and altitude' of an ICBM. The Kremlin refused to comment on the strike. The attack comes in a week when tensions have repeatedly soared, as the U.S. eased restrictions on Ukraine's use of American-made longer-range missiles inside Russia and the Kremlin lowered its threshold for launching nuclear weapons. In this photo provided by Ukraine's 24th Mechanised Brigade press service, servicemen of the 24th Mechanised Brigade fire 120mm mortar towards Russian positions near Chasiv Yar town, in Donetsk region, Ukraine, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024. (Oleg Petrasiuk/Ukrainian 24th Mechanised Brigade via AP) The range of an ICBM — which can exceed 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles) — is beyond what is needed to attack Ukraine. But such missiles are designed to carry atomic warheads, and the use of one, even with a conventional payload, would serve as a chilling reminder of Russia’s nuclear capability and a powerful message of potential escalation. In a statement Thursday on the Telegram messaging app, Ukraine's air force said an intercontinental ballistic missile was fired at Dnipro, along with eight other missiles, and that the Ukrainian military shot down six of them. Two people were wounded in the attack, and an industrial facility and a rehabilitation center for people with disabilities were damaged, according to local officials. The air force statement did not specify the exact type of ICBM but said it was launched from Russia’s Astrakhan region, on the Caspian Sea. 'Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is,' Zelenskyy said. 'And how afraid he is.' US to give antipersonnel mines to Ukraine to help slow the Russian advance U.K. officials did not immediately confirm what kind of missile Russia had fired. Defense Secretary John Healey said there were 'unconfirmed reports … of Russia firing a new ballistic missile into Ukraine, which we know they have been preparing for months.' Ballistic missiles can have a range of anywhere from under 500 kilometers (310 miles) to over 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles) in the case of intercontinental ones. 'Ballistic' refers to the shape of their trajectory.

(Oleg Petrasiuk/Ukrainian 24th Mechanised Brigade via AP) Since the Cold War era, Moscow and Washington have given each other advance notice about ICBM launches to prevent the other side from perceiving a test launch as a nuclear attack. They have stuck to exchanging such warnings despite increasing tensions — which ratcheted up again in recent days. Earlier this week, the Biden administration authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied, longer-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia — a move that drew an angry response from Moscow. Days later, Ukraine fired several of the missiles into Russia, according to the Kremlin. The same day, President Vladimir Putin signed a new doctrine that allows for a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. The doctrine is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons. In response, Western countries, including the U.S., said Russia has used irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behavior throughout the war to intimidate Ukraine and other nations. They have also expressed dismay at the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine. Also, Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that its air defense systems shot down two British-made Storm Shadow missiles, six HIMARS rockets, and 67 drones. The statement didn’t say when or where the Storm Shadows were shot down or what they were targeting. Russia earlier reported downing some of the missiles over the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ukraine-says-russia-launched-an-intercontinental-missile-in-an-attack-for-the-first-time-in-the-war/	2024-11-21T05:27:09-08:00	
Death toll in Gaza from Israel-Hamas war passes 44,000, Palestini...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 13-month-old war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000, local health officials said Thursday. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The Health Ministry said 44,056 people have been killed and 104,268 wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. The Israeli offensive has caused heavy destruction across wide areas of the coastal territory, leading many to wonder when or how it will ever be rebuilt. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are living in squalid tent camps with little food, water or basic services. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas, where they have built tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. Palestinian officials and rights groups accuse Israeli forces of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the United Nations’ top court is considering allegations of genocide brought by South Africa. The Israeli government adamantly denies the allegations, accusing critics of being biased against it. In recent weeks, the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza has plummeted, prompting the United States to threaten to reduce its military support for Israel before backing down, citing limited progress. Experts have warned that isolated, war-ravaged northern Gaza could already be experiencing famine. The United States, Egypt and Qatar spent months trying to broker a cease-fire agreement in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war. Those talks ground to a halt over the summer, with Israel and Hamas each accusing the other of making unacceptable demands. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how. His previous administration gave unprecedented support to Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-line policies toward the Palestinians. ___ Khaled reported from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-death-toll-in-gaza-from-israel-hamas-war-passes-44000-palestinian-officials-say/	2024-11-21T05:01:38-08:00	
US vetoes UN resolution demanding a cease-fire in Gaza because th...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States on Wednesday vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire in the war in Gaza because it was not linked to an immediate release of hostages taken captive by Hamas militants in Israel in October 2023. The council voted overwhelmingly in favor of the resolution — 14 of its 15 members voted 'yes' including U.S. allies Britain and France — but it was doomed by the veto. U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood said the United States worked for weeks to avoid a veto of the resolution sponsored by the council’s 10 elected members, and expressed regret that compromise language was not accepted. 'We made clear throughout negotiations we could not support an unconditional cease-fire that failed to release the hostages,' he said. 'Hamas would have seen it as a vindication of its cynical strategy to hope and pray the international community forgets about the fate of more than 100 hostages from more than 20 member states who have been held for 410 days.' The resolution that was put to a vote 'demands an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire to be respected by all parties, and further reiterates its demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.' The emotional response to the veto by the Palestinian deputy U.N. ambassador, Majed Bamya, reflected the widespread anger and disappointment at the failure of the U.N.’s most powerful body to demand an end to the more than 13-month war, which has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, and left most of the territory in ruins. The absence of a cease-fire is allowing a 'full-fledged Israeli assault against the Palestinian people and the Palestinian land' to continue, Bamya told the council. 'A cease-fire will allow to save lives — all lives. This was true a year ago. This is even more true today.' Stressing the tens of thousands of Palestinian deaths, Bamya asked, 'Do they have the right to kill, and the only right we have is to die?' He told council members: 'You are witnessing the attempt to annihilate a nation, destroy a nation.' Israel’s U.N. ambassador, Danny Danon, countered that the resolution 'was not a path to peace, it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed.' He thanked the United States, Israel's closest ally, 'for exercising its veto, for standing on the side of morality and justice, for refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.' The reason the council was meeting and 'the pain that the people are suffering (is) because of Hamas,' Danon said, stressing that the only future for Gaza is without the Palestinian militant group. In a statement, Hamas strongly condemned the veto, claiming the United States again demonstrated 'its direct involvement in the aggression against our people, acting as an accomplice in the killing of children and women and the complete destruction of civilian life in Gaza.' 'We demand the U.S. to stop this clumsy hostile policy if it truly seeks to end wars and achieve security and stability in the region, as we heard from the upcoming administration,' Hamas added, a reference to President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to end the war in Gaza. The Security Council has adopted several resolutions on Gaza, including for a cease-fire during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and demanding humanitarian access. The United States as well as Russia and China have vetoed several previous resolutions on the war. The council in June adopted its first resolution on a cease-fire plan aimed at ending the war between Israel and Hamas. That U.S.-sponsored resolution welcomed a cease-fire proposal announced by President Joe Biden that the United States said Israel had accepted. It called on Hamas to accept the three-phase plan, but the war goes on. The Palestinian deputy ambassador put the blame on Israel, saying, 'It is pretty clear that Israel had never an intention to accept a cease-fire, and has found every reason not to have a cease-fire.' The 10 elected council members said in a statement read by Guyana’s U.N. ambassador, Carolyn Rodrigues Birkett, after the vote that they all supported the June resolution 'with the expectation that a cease-fire deal would have been agreed and implemented swiftly.' But months later, the 10 elected members decided a new resolution should go further and make an unequivocal demand for an unconditional cease-fire not limited to any time period. Notwithstanding the U.S. veto, the elected members underscored that the war in Gaza must end immediately, hostages must be released immediately, humanitarian aid must be delivered everywhere in Gaza and civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected. 'Our collective efforts to end the hostilities will not stop,' they said. Algeria’s U.N. ambassador, Amar Bendjama, the Arab representative on the council, said the message to Israel after the veto is: 'You may continue your genocide. You may continue your collective punishment of the Palestinian people with complete impunity. In this chamber, you enjoy immunity.' But he vowed that the elected members will return soon with an even stronger resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which is militarily enforceable — and they will not stop until the council takes action. ____ Matthew Lee in Washington and Fatma Khaled in Cairo contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-us-vetoes-un-resolution-demanding-a-cease-fire-in-gaza-because-theres-no-link-to-a-hostage-release/	2024-11-20T11:58:18-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israel insists on right to act against Hezbol...	Israel’s defense minister says his country insists on the right to act militarily against Hezbollah in any agreement to end the fighting in Lebanon. Lebanon’s government is likely to view any such demand as an infringement on its sovereignty, complicating efforts to end more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that erupted into all-out war in September. Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement Wednesday that 'the condition for any political settlement in Lebanon is the preservation of the intelligence capability and the preservation of the (Israeli military’s) right to act and protect the citizens of Israel from Hezbollah.' Lebanese officials mediating between Israel and Hezbollah have called for a return to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between the sides. It calls for Hezbollah militants and Israeli forces to withdraw from a buffer zone in southern Lebanon patrolled by U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who has spent months trying to broker a cease-fire, held a second round of talks on Wednesday with Lebanon’s parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who has been mediating on their behalf. Hochstein told reporters the talks had made 'additional progress,' and that he would be heading to Israel 'to try to bring this to a close, if we can.' He declined to say what the sticking points are. Israeli strikes and combat in Lebanon have killed more than 3,500 people and wounded 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The war has displaced nearly 1.2 million people, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians, including some foreign farmworkers, have been killed by attacks involving rockets, drones and missiles. Hezbollah began firing on Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza. That attack killed some 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and another 250 were abducted. Around 100 hostages remain inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed nearly 44,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. ___ Here’s the Latest: Israeli bill targets families of minors convicted of security offenses JERUSALEM — The Israeli parliament has passed a bill stripping some insurance benefits from families of minors convicted of security offenses. A rights group denounced the legislation as a form of collective punishment of Palestinians. The bill, which passed 29-8 late Monday, bans direct family members of minors convicted of security offenses from receiving a child allowance, study grants, or other welfare benefits under Israel’s National Insurance program while the minor is imprisoned. It was passed to 'cause parents to supervise their children and make sure that they do not engage in terrorist activity,' according to a press release on the website of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Legal group Adalah, which called on Israel’s attorney general to withdraw the law, said the true aim of the legislation was 'to impose punitive measures under the pretext of counterterrorism by denying welfare benefits.' Adalah said that because the legislation only applies to those convicted of security offenses, who are overwhelmingly Palestinian, it 'creates a distinction on the basis of nationality.' It’s the latest in a series of measures passed by the Knesset that have been denounced by rights groups as draconian. A law passed earlier this month would allow Israel to deport family members of Palestinian attackers to Gaza or other locations. In late October, the Knesset passed two laws banning UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, from operating on Israeli soil. Lebanese army says one of its soldiers was killed by an Israeli airstrike BEIRUT — A Lebanese army soldier was killed Wednesday by an Israeli airstrike that hit his vehicle on the road linking Burj al-Muluk and Qalaa in southern Lebanon, the army said in a statement. The Israeli military said it was looking into reports. A day earlier, three soldiers were killed by an airstrike that targeted an army post in the town of Sarafand, near the coastal city of Saida. Wissam Khalifa, a resident of Sarafand who lives next to the army post and was injured in the strike, said he was shocked that it was targeted. 'It’s a safe residential neighborhood. There is nothing here at all' that would present a target, he said. 'Regarding the martyred soldiers, I don’t even know if there was a gun in the center. Why did this strike happen? We have no idea.' The Lebanese army has not been an active participant in the fighting between Israeli forces and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah over the past 13 months, but more than 40 soldiers have been killed in the conflict. Altogether, more than 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon since Oct. 8, 2023, the vast majority of them in the past two months. Wounded Al Jazeera reporter to be evacuated to Jordan for treatment AMMAN, Jordan: Israel has allowed an Al Jazeera journalist wounded in an airstrike in Gaza last month to be evacuated to Jordan for medical treatment. Jordan’s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Ali al-Attar had been transferred to the kingdom with his sister in coordination with the World Health Organization. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Al-Attar was wounded by shrapnel when Israeli forces struck makeshift points used by Hamas-run police outside a hospital in central Gaza early on Oct. 7. There were no police present at the time. Israel banned Al-Jazeera earlier this year, accusing it of serving as a mouthpiece of Hamas. It has also accused six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being current or former fighters for Hamas and another armed group. Al Jazeera has denied the allegations and accused Israel of trying to silence critical coverage. The Qatar-based network has reported round-the-clock from Gaza since the start of the war, with its field correspondents focusing on the killing of civilians in Israeli strikes. Several Al Jazeera reporters have themselves been killed or wounded. Al Jazeera has also regularly broadcast videos released by militant groups in their entirety, including some that show Israeli hostages speaking under duress.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israel-insists-on-right-to-act-against-hezbollah-in-any-deal-to-end-fighting/	2024-11-20T05:26:29-08:00	
US support for Ukraine and Israel is eating into weapons stockpil...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East are eating away at critical U.S. weapons stockpiles and could hamper the military's ability to respond to China should a conflict arise in the Indo-Pacific, the top U.S. commander for that region said Tuesday. Head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Adm. Samuel Paparo cautioned Tuesday that the U.S. providing or selling billions of dollars worth of air defenses to both Ukraine and Israel is now impeding his ability to respond in the Indo-Pacific, such as if China invades Taiwan. 'Up to this year, where most of the employment of weapons were really artillery pieces and short-range weapons, I had said, ‘not at all,'' when asked if the conflicts were hampering U.S. ability to respond to threats in the Indo-Pacific, Paparo said. 'It’s now eating into stocks, and to say otherwise would be dishonest,' he told an audience at the Brookings Institution in Washington. China has ramped up its military pressure against Taiwan, including a massive military exercise that involved 125 warplanes in October, and has said annexing Taiwan is a historical inevitability. China’s military has increased its encircling of Taiwan’s skies and waters in the past few years, holding joint drills with its warships and fighter jets on a near-daily basis near the democratically run island. The U.S., like most countries, does not recognize Taiwan as a country but is the island’s main partner and is bound by U.S. laws to provide it with the means to defend itself. Ukraine just passed its 1,000th day since Russia invaded, and in that timeframe the U.S. has provided more than $60.4 billion in military assistance, including three Patriot air defense systems and missiles, more than 40 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems and ammunition, and the coveted longer-range Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, which Ukraine deployed in Russia for the first time on Tuesday. In October, after Iran launched hundreds of ballistic missiles into Israel, the U.S. deployed one of its few Terminal High Altitude Area Defense batteries to Israel and about 100 troops to help operate it. The U.S. also has regularly shipped air defense munitions as Israel presses its offensives against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The conflicts have killed tens of thousands of civilians. The outgoing Biden administration has committed to spending the remaining $7.1 billion in presidential drawdown authority — meaning weapons pulled from U.S. stockpiles — to send weapons to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. It will announce another package this week, according to U.S. officials. However, the ability to send the weapons will be limited by what is on the shelves, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Tuesday. Paparo told the think tank audience that the push to get weapons to Ukraine and Israel has left the U.S. with too few munitions in reserves. 'We should replenish those stocks and then some,' Paparo said. 'I was already dissatisfied with the magazine depth. I’m a little more dissatisfied with the magazine depth,' he said, referring to the numbers of munitions in reserve.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-support-for-ukraine-and-israel-is-eating-into-weapons-stockpiles-indo-pacific-commander-says/	2024-11-19T14:57:27-08:00	
US-Israel panel to look into civilian harm in Gaza is set for fir...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration says a U.S.-Israel panel to look into reports of civilian harm from the war in Gaza will meet for the first time in early December, missing by more than a month a U.S. call for the channel to be set up by the end of October. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday that the upcoming meeting had been agreed to after much discussion between U.S. and Israeli officials on specific incidents and reports of civilian casualties involving American-made or -supplied weapons. 'The purpose of this channel is to inform the ongoing work that the State Department has to make assessments about the use of U.S.-provided weapons,' Miller told reporters. 'It’s to gather information about incidents that have been raised that are cause of concern or cause of questions.' He said the information gathered through that channel will inform U.S. policy decisions about any response to potential violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict that has been raging since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which led to its retaliatory offensives in Gaza. Experts say famine may already have set in in northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging a weekslong offensive that has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes. In October, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent a letter to top Israeli officials warning them that the Biden administration might limit the provision of some U.S. weapons systems to Israel, a close ally, if action to improve humanitarian conditions was not taken within 30 days. That deadline expired last week with no decisions being made on military aid and officials saying that Israel had taken some positive steps but was still not meeting the criteria for improvements laid out in the letter. Aid groups say the situation in Gaza has actually deteriorated instead of improved and urged the U.S. to respond accordingly. The theft in Gaza over the weekend of nearly 100 trucks loaded with food and other much-needed humanitarian aid sent prices soaring and caused shortages in central Gaza, where most of the population of 2.3 million people have fled and where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. Miller said reports of such incidents demonstrated a breakdown in law and order in Gaza and underscored the need to end the fighting and restore functioning governance to the territory. 'You are not going to fully, finally solve this problem without an end to the war and the establishment of a new governance and security authority inside Gaza, because ultimately that is the problem,' he said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-us-israel-panel-to-look-into-civilian-harm-in-gaza-is-set-for-first-meeting-next-month/	2024-11-19T13:54:04-08:00	
Middle East latest: US envoy holds talks in Lebanon about an Isra...	A U.S. envoy held talks in Beirut on Tuesday with Lebanese officials about a possible cease-fire in the Israel-Hezbollah war. Amos Hochstein, a senior advisor to United States President Joe Biden, arrived in the Lebanese capital a day after the militant Hezbollah group reportedly gave a positive response to a U.S. draft proposal to end the war, which has been ongoing for more than 13 months. The U.S. has been working on a proposal to end hostilities that would remove Israeli ground forces from Lebanon and push Hezbollah forces away from the Israeli border. More Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers would be sent to the buffer zone in southern Lebanon as part of the deal. Hochstein’s main meeting in beirut was with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who is mediating for the militants. Hours earlier, an Israeli strike in central Beirut killed five people and wounded others. It was the third Israeli strike in the heart of Beirut in two days. Since late September, Israel has dramatically escalated its bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to severely weaken Hezbollah and end its rocket barrages into Israel. Hezbollah began firing rockets, and drawing Israeli retaliation, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel ignited the war in Gaza. Both groups are supported by Iran. The fighting has left more than 3,500 dead in Lebanon and almost 15,000 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It also has displaced nearly 1.2 million, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians, including some foreign laborers who work in agriculture, have been killed by attacks involving rockets, drones and missiles. ___ Here's the Latest: Rockets hit headquarters of Italy's peacekeepers in Lebanon; no one is injured ROME — Italy says eight rockets struck the headquarters of Italy’s U.N. peacekeeping contingent in southern Lebanon. No one was injured. According to the Italian defense ministry, the eight 107-millimenter rockets hit outdoor areas and a warehouse at the base in Shama, where no soldiers were present. Five soldiers were being kept under observation, the statement said. Italy said it was investigating from where the rockets originated, and who was responsible. It was the second time in a week that Italy has complained about rockets or shells hitting its peacekeepers' base. Last week, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani spoke with his Israeli counterpart to demand an investigation after an artillery shell hit the gym on the base. No one was injured in that incident and the shell did not detonate. Also on Tuesday, the Israeli military said another U.N. peacekeeper's position was hit by a Hezbollah rocket, causing damage and 'several injuries.' The army said it had received a report from the peacekeeping mission, known as UNIFIL, that a post in the area of Ramyeh in southern Lebanon was hit. The military said it conducted a review and determined the location was hit by a Hezbollah rocket fired in a barrage aimed at Israel. There was no immediate comment from UNIFIL on the incident. Iraqi prime minister slams Israel's complaint over attacks by Iraqi Iran-backed militias BAGHDAD — Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has dismissed an Israeli complaint to the U.N. Security Council about strikes by Iraq's Iran-backed Shiite militias on Israel as a 'pretext and argument to attack Iraq' and to 'expand the war in the region.' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar had earlier posted on X a letter to the Security Council saying that 'Israel has the inherent right to self-defense ... and to take all necessary measures to protect itself and its citizens against the ongoing acts of hostilities by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq.' An umbrella group of Iraqi militias known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has regularly launched drone strikes on targets in Israel in recent months in support of its Hamas and Hezbollah allies in the ongoing wars in the Middle East. Saar said some of the militias are part of the Popular Mobilization Forces — a coalition of mostly Shiite armed groups that's technically part of the Iraqi army although it operates in practice largely outside state control — and urged the Iraqi government to 'take immediate action to halt and prevent these attacks.' Al-Sudani’s office said in a statement on Tuesday that Iraq has refused to enter into the regional conflict while 'seeking to provide relief to the Palestinian and Lebanese people.' Lebanese official mediating on behalf of Hezbollah says the situation looks positive regarding a US cease-fire proposal BEIRUT — Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is mediating on the group’s behalf, says some unresolved details remain following his meeting with U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein over an American proposal on a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel. Berri, in remarks to the pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat, said that representatives from his side and the American side are still working to address technical issues before progressing to the next stage. This would involve Hochstein traveling to Israel for further discussions, he said. 'We are waiting for what he will bring from there,' Berri said, emphasizing that the overall outlook remains positive. Berri and Hochstein met for nearly two hours on Tuesday to discuss the U.S. proposal. Berri also told that Lebanon holds the American negotiators responsible for guarantees regarding the Israeli position. Berri said that though Hochstein 'coordinated with the Israelis regarding the draft... It would not be the first time that the Israelis have reneged their commitments.' Yemen's Houthis say they targeted a Panama-flagged vessel twice on Monday DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels on Tuesday claimed responsibility for an attack that twice targeted a Panama-flagged bulk carrier traveling through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden the day before. Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree made the claim about the attack on the Anadolu S in a prerecorded statement. Missiles twice splashed down near the ship on Monday, causing no damage or injuries. Tuesday marked the first anniversary of the Houthis’ attacks on shipping in the Middle East waters. The attacks have targeted shipping through a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion in goods pass through it a year over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Israel’s ground offensive in Lebanon. Qatar says Hamas leaders have left Doha but denies closure of the group's office BEIRUT — Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson says Hamas leaders have left Doha but denied reports that Qatar has ordered a permanent closure of the Palestinian militant group’s political office or expulsion of its previously Doha-based leadership. Qatar, which had served as a mediator in indirect cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas for a cease-fire and hostage exchange deal, has suspended its efforts after growing frustration with the lack of progress on a cease-fire deal for Gaza. The Qatari spokesman, Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, told reporters on Tuesday that 'if there is decision to close the office permanently you will hear this news from this platform or in an official statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.' 'The leaders of Hamas that are in the negotiating team are now not in Doha and as you know, they move between the different capitals,' he said. '...The office in Doha was created for the purpose of the mediation process — obviously when there is no mediation process, the office itself doesn’t have any function.' Al-Ansari did not say where the Hamas leaders went nor did he rule out that Doha might return to its mediating role. 'The suspension of negotiation efforts does not in any way mean that there is a Qatari position to withdraw from de-escalation efforts or that there is a change in the position of the State of Qatar on the need to end this war,' he said. Israel's military says it sent 1,000 units of blood to a northern Gaza hospital JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has facilitated the delivery of blood units to a hospital in isolated northern Gaza. Israel has imposed a tight siege on the northernmost part of the territory since launching an offensive there in early October. Aid groups say very little humanitarian assistance has been allowed in and have warned of famine. The military agency in charge of transferring aid to Gaza, COGAT, said it had sent 1,000 units of blood through a northern crossing on Monday. The U.N.’s health cluster said the blood shipment was delivered to Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahiya. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled the northernmost reaches of the strip since the offensive began, and hospitals there have struggled to function. Israeli forces kill three militants in the West Bank JERUSALEM — Israeli forces have killed three militants during a raid Tuesday in the occupied West Bank, the military said. The militant Hamas group later identified the three as its fighters. They were killed in the area of Jenin, in the north of the occupied territory, which has been a flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian violence in recent years, even before the israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The military said the militants shot at them first, drawing return fire that killed a wanted suspect and two others. The military said it found rifles and military equipment at the site. It said it also destroyed two facilities used to manufacture explosives and dismantled explosives it said were buried under the roads. Since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza, Israeli fire has killed at least 784 Palestinians in the West Bank, including 167 children, according to the Palestinian Authority’s Health Ministry. Most appear to have been militants killed during Israeli raids, but the dead also include people killed during violent protests as well as civilian bystanders. There has also been a rise in stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis. Israel seized the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want it as part of their future state. Israel issues veiled warning to Iranian-backed militias in Iraq JERUSALEM — Israel has issued a veiled threat to strike Iraq in response to recent attacks by Iran-backed militant groups based there. In a letter to the United Nations Security Council posted on X, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said his country has the right to 'take all necessary measures to protect itself and its citizens against the ongoing acts of hostilities by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq.' Militants in Iraq have launched several rocket and drone attacks against both Israel and U.S. forces since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza. An Oct. 3 drone attack launched from Iraq on an army base in northern Israel killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded 24, Saar said. Israel is believed to have struck militants in Iraq in 2019, but it has not acknowledged any such strikes since the start of the war in Gaza. Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on Iran-backed militants in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. In his letter, Saar called on the U.N. to take 'immediate action' to address the situation. US envoy says a conclusion to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict is ‘within our grasp’ BEIRUT — A U.S. envoy to the Middle East says he had 'very constructive talks' in Lebanon and that reaching an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war 'is now within our grasp.' 'Specifically today, we have continued to significantly narrow the gaps. The meeting was very constructive and very helpful,' Amos Hochstein, the U.S. envoy to Lebanon and Israel, told reporters Tuesday. He spoke after a two-hour meeting with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is mediating on the group’s behalf. The emerging agreement would apparently restore a U.N. buffer zone patrolled by international peacekeepers and Lebanese troops in southern Lebanon, with Israel withdrawing its ground forces and Hezbollah militants pulling back to the north. Hochstein, who has been shuttling back and forth for several months, said he came back to the region because 'we have a real opportunity to bring this conflict to an end.' 'I’m here in Beirut to facilitate that decision-making, but it’s ultimately the decisions of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict,' he said. 'It is now within our grasp.' Hochstein was scheduled to meet Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and other officials. 'I am committed to do everything I can to work with the government here in Lebanon and in Israel to bring this conflict to a close,' he said. UN peacekeeping force says it's maintaining positions in Lebanon GENEVA — The U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, under pressure from an Israeli military campaign against militant group Hezbollah in its area of operations, says Argentina has asked three of its officers in the contingent to return home, while all other contributing countries are maintaining their commitments. Spokesman Andrea Tenenti of UNIFIL said its 'operational capabilities have not changed' after the move by Argentina, and U.N. forces have not moved from their positions – despite Israeli Defense Forces asking them to move from positions near the 'blue line' along the Lebanon-Israel border about a month ago. 'The posture of our more than 10,000 peacekeepers from nearly 50 countries remain unchanged,' he told a U.N. briefing in Geneva by video conference from Beirut. The UNIFIL forces have not left the 50 positions across their area of operations, aiming to monitor and report on this situation since Israeli forces began their military campaign in Lebanon in September. He said UNIFIL has limited means to monitor the situation amid the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. While Israeli forces have at times moved deeper into Lebanon, it’s not 'permanently,' and the level of destruction in UNIFIL zones was 'huge' and 'shocking.' Separately, UNICEF spokesman James Elder told the U.N. briefing that more than 200 children have been killed in Lebanon in less than the last two months, saying 'their deaths are being met with inertia from those able to stop this violence.' 'It’s become a silent normalization of horror,' Elder said. Tuesday marks 1-year anniversary of Houthi attacks on shipping in Red Sea DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of Yemen’s Houthi rebels beginning their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor. On Nov. 19, 2023, the Houthis seized the car carrier Galaxy Leader in a helicopter-borne attack in the Red Sea. The ship and its 25 crew remain held until today, something the United Nations Security Council noted in a statement calling on the rebels to release the ship and its crew. The Houthis have attacked over 90 commercial vessels in the time since. They sank two vessels in the campaign, which also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-us-envoy-arrives-in-lebanon-to-meet-with-officials-about-possible-cease-fire/	2024-11-19T08:15:30-08:00	
What does Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range U...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia said Ukraine has fired U.S.-made longer-range weapons inside its territory, days after the U.S. said it would allow Kyiv to use those systems to conduct deeper strikes, a long-sought request by Kyiv. It remained unclear if there are limits on Ukraine's use of the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, as there have been on other U.S. missile systems. Their deployment could — at least initially — be limited to curtailing Russia's advance in its Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops seized territory earlier this year. Ukraine fired six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles at Russia’s Bryansk region, Moscow said Tuesday, in what would be Kyiv’s first use of the weapon inside Russia. Ukraine's General Staff did not confirm whether the weapon was used, but said the armed forces struck an ammunition warehouse in the Bryansk region, which neighbors Kursk and was likely feeding Russian forces fighting there. Since the first year of the war, Ukrainian leaders have lobbied Western allies to allow them to use advanced weapons to strike key targets inside Russia — which they hope would erode Moscow’s capabilities before its troops reach the front line and could make it more difficult for the Russian forces to strike Ukrainian territory. It could also serve as a deterrent force in the event of future cease-fire negotiations. The U.S. has long opposed the move, with President Joe Biden determined to avoid any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. The Kremlin warned on Monday that the decision adds 'fuel to the fire.' The decision comes in the waning days of Biden’s presidency, before President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. Trump has said he would bring about a swift end to the war, which many fear could force unpalatable concessions from Kyiv. What are ATACMS? The ballistic missiles, developed by U.S. aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin, have nearly double the striking distance — up to 300 kilometers (190 miles) — of most of the weapons in Ukraine's possession. They carry a larger payload and have more precise targeting for pinpoint attacks on air fields, ammunition stores and strategic infrastructure. The United States has supplied Ukraine with dozens of ATACMS (pronounced attack-ems) and they have been used to destroy military targets in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine such as Crimea — but not on Russian soil. What is Biden allowing Ukraine to do? Biden authorized Ukraine to use the ATACMS to strike deeper inside Russia, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter. The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to send troops to support Kremlin forces, according to one of the people familiar with the development. Pyongyang’s troops are apparently being deployed to help the Russian army drive Ukrainian forces out of Russia’s Kursk border region, where they launched an incursion in August. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly. It was the second time that Washington has expanded Ukraine's authority to use its U.S.-provided weapons systems inside Russian territory. In May, after Russia’s offensive into the Kharkiv region threatened to stretch Ukrainian forces thin, Biden permitted the use of HIMARS systems — with a range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) — to quell that advance. That decision helped Ukrainian soldiers stabilize the fight for a time by forcing Russian forces to pull back military assets. Why does Ukraine need longer-range weapons? Ukraine has been asking its Western allies for longer-range weapons in order to alter the balance of power in a war where Russia is better resourced, and strike with precision air bases, supply depots and communication centers hundreds of kilometers (miles) over the border. It hopes the weapons would help blunt Russia’s air power and weaken the supply lines it needs to launch daily strikes against Ukraine and to sustain its military ground offensive into Ukraine. If used in Kursk, the weapons would likely require Russian forces preparing for counterattacks to push back valuable equipment and manpower and complicate battle plans. In lieu of Western weapons, Ukraine has been regularly striking Russia with domestically produced weapons, with some capable of traveling up to 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), but still lacks sufficient quantities to do serious long-term harm. Will the decision change the course of the war? Ukrainian leaders are being cautious about the announcement — and senior U.S. defense and military leaders have persistently argued that it won't be a gamechanger. They also have noted that Russia has moved many key assets out of range. 'I don’t believe one capability is going to be decisive and I stand by that comment,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said, noting that the Ukrainians have other means to strike long-range targets. Analysts have also suggested the effect could be limited. 'Today, many in the media are talking about the fact that we have received permission to take appropriate actions. But blows are not inflicted with words. Such things are not announced. The rockets will speak for themselves,' said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the announcement. The effect of the decision depends on the rules set for the weapons' use. If strikes are allowed across all of Russia, they could significantly complicate Moscow's ability to respond to battlefield demands. If strikes are limited to the Kursk region, Russia could relocate its command centers and air units to nearby regions, blunting the effect of those logistical challenges. That would also mean many of the valuable targets Ukrainian officials have expressed desire to hit may still be beyond reach. Either way, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Charlie Dietz has noted the ATACMS wouldn’t be the answer to the main threat Ukraine faces from Russian-fired glide bombs, which are being fired from more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) away, beyond the ATACMS' reach. In addition, the overall supply of ATACMS is limited, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference — though some proponents say that even a few strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources. Jennifer Kavanagh, director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, said the U.S. decision would not alter the course of the war. 'To really impose costs on Russia, Ukraine would need large stockpiles of ATACMS, which it doesn’t have and won’t receive because the United States’ own supplies are limited,' she said. 'Moreover, the biggest obstacle Ukraine faces is a lack of trained and ready personnel, a challenge that neither the United States nor its European allies can solve and that all the weapons in the world won’t overcome,' she added. What are the key remaining questions? In addition to it being unclear what, if any, restrictions the U.S. will impose on the weapons’ use, it’s also not known how many the U.S. will give to Ukraine. While the U.S. has provided ATACMS to Ukraine in various military aid packages, the Defense Department will not disclose how many have been sent or exactly how many of those missiles the Pentagon has. Estimates suggest the U.S. has a number that is in the low thousands. Also, the outcome of the recent American election raises questions over how long this policy will be in place. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration’s spending to support Ukraine — and could reverse moves like this one. On the other hand, it’s also not clear whether other allies might step up. The U.S. decision may encourage Britain and France to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles, also known as SCALP missiles, with a range of 250 kilometers (155 miles). ___ Associated Press writers Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv, Ukraine; Aamer Madhani in Manaus, Brazil; and Colleen Long, Zeke Miller, Matthew Lee, Ellen Knickmeyer and Lolita C.

US envoy says a truce in Lebanon is 'within our grasp' as Gaza's ...	BEIRUT (AP) — A United States envoy said an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war is 'within our grasp' after talks in Lebanon on Tuesday. There was no such optimism in the Gaza Strip, where the looting of nearly 100 aid trucks by armed men worsened an already severe food crisis. Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration’s pointman on Israel and Lebanon, arrived as Hezbollah’s allies in the Lebanese government said it had responded positively to the proposal, which would entail both the militants and Israeli ground forces withdrawing from a U.N. buffer zone in southern Lebanon. The buffer zone would be policed by thousands of additional U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops. Israel has called for a stronger enforcement mechanism, potentially including the ability to operate against any Hezbollah threats, something Lebanon is likely to oppose. Hochstein said he held 'very constructive talks' with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is mediating on the group’s behalf. 'Specifically today, we have continued to significantly narrow the gaps,' he told reporters after the two-hour meeting. 'It’s ultimately the decisions of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict. ... It is now within our grasp.' In Gaza, meanwhile, the theft of nearly 100 trucks loaded with food and other humanitarian aid over the weekend sent prices soaring and caused shortages in central Gaza, where most of the population of 2.3 million people have fled and where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. Experts say famine may already have set in in the north, where Israel has been waging a weekslong offensive that has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes. Food prices soar in central Gaza after looting On Monday, a crowd of people waited outside a shuttered bakery in the central city of Deir al-Balah. A woman who had been displaced from Gaza City, identifying herself as Umm Shadi, said the price of flour had climbed to 400 shekels (over $100) a bag, if it can even be found. Nora Muhanna, another woman displaced from Gaza City, said she was leaving empty-handed after waiting five hours for a bag of bread for her children. 'From the beginning, there are no goods, and even if they are available, there is no money,' she said. The United Nations said armed men stole food and other aid from 98 trucks over the weekend, the largest single incident of its kind since the start of the war. It did not say who was behind the theft. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the convoy of 109 trucks was instructed by the Israeli military to take an 'alternative, unfamiliar route' after the aid was brought through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and that the trucks were robbed near the crossing itself. Israel has long accused criminal gangs and Hamas of stealing aid, allegations denied by the militant group. Al-Aqsa TV, a media outlet operated by the militants, said Hamas-run security forces in Gaza had launched an operation against looters, killing 20 of them. Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official based abroad, said the looters were young men from Bedouin tribes in the area, emphasizing that they do not necessarily represent the tribes. He said they operate east of Rafah near Israeli military positions. The Hamas-run government had a police force of tens of thousands that maintained a high degree of public security before the war, but they have vanished from the streets in many areas after being targeted by Israeli strikes. Hamas says it has taken measures to prevent both looting and price-gouging in local markets. But the biggest problem is not theft – it’s the low amount of aid Israel allows into Gaza, said Tamara Alrifai, communications director for UNRWA, the U.N. agency with the biggest role in the aid operation. 'Take aid into a war zone a few trucks at a time, what do we expect a displaced, hungry and traumatized population to do?' she said of the theft. The flow of aid is at nearly the lowest level of the entire 13-month war. So far this month, Israel says it let into Gaza an average of 88 trucks a day – less than half the highest rate of the war, in April, which aid groups say was still too low. From the aid that does enter, UNRWA says only about half actually reaches Palestinians because Israeli military restrictions and fears of theft often prevent the agency from collecting truck cargos at the border. Israel says it puts no restrictions on the quantity of aid entering Gaza and that it is working to increase the amount. This month, it opened a new crossing into central Gaza. So far it has reported a few dozen trucks entering through it. Wars rage on in Biden administration’s final months Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their toll. The war has left much of the territory in ruins and forced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million to flee, often multiple times. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after the Hamas attack in what it said was solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes, and all-out war erupted in September. Israeli bombardment has killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and wounded almost 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It also displaced nearly 1.2 million, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians have been killed by rockets, drones and missiles. The Biden administration has spent several months trying to broker cease-fires on both fronts. It appears to have made some progress in Lebanon, while talks over a cease-fire and the release of hostages held in Gaza stalled over the summer. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how he would do it. He was a staunch supporter of Israel and its hawkish government during his first term. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip and Khaled from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-us-envoy-pushes-for-cease-fire-in-lebanon-as-food-crisis-worsens-after-looting-in-gaza/	2024-11-19T06:38:18-08:00	
Russia says Ukraine fired 6 US-made ATACMS at the Bryansk region,...	Ukraine fired six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles at Russia’s Bryansk region, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday, days after U.S. President Joe Biden eased restrictions on Ukrainian use of American-made weapons in the war that has reached its 1,000-day milestone. Ukraine claimed it hit a military weapons depot in Bryansk in the middle of the night, though it didn't specify what weapons it used. The Ukrainian General Staff said that multiple explosions and detonation were heard in the targeted area. In a statement carried by Russian news agencies, the Russian Defense Ministry said the military shot down five Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, and damaged one more. The fragments fell on the territory of an unspecified military facility, the ministry said. The falling debris sparked a fire, but didn’t inflict any damage or casualties, it said. Neither side's claims could be independently verified. The announcement came after Biden authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons after Russia deployed thousands of North Korean troops in the conflict. Earlier on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials reported a third Russian strike in three days on a civilian residential area in Ukraine killed at least 12 people, including a child. The strike by a Shahed drone in the northern Sumy region late Monday hit a dormitory of an educational facility in the town of Hlukhiv and wounded 11 others, including two children, authorities said, adding that more people could be trapped under the rubble. Ukrainian civilians have repeatedly been clobbered by Russian drones and missiles during the war, while on the battlefield it is under severe Russian pressure at places on the about 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line where its army is stretched thin against a bigger adversary. On Sunday, a Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions struck a residential area of Sumy in northern Ukraine, killing 11 people and wounding 84 others. On Monday, a Russian missile barrage sparked apartment fires in the southern port of Odesa, killing at least 10 people and wounding 43. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the series of aerial strikes proved that Russian President Vladimir Putin wasn't interested in ending the war. 'Each new attack by Russia only confirms Putin’s true intentions. He wants the war to continue. Talks about peace are not interesting to him. We must force Russia to a just peace by force,' Zelenskyy said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-a-3rd-russian-strike-in-3-days-kills-more-ukrainian-civilians-as-the-war-hits-a-milestone/	2024-11-19T04:45:39-08:00	
Middle East latest: Children and parents among 8 killed in Israel...	Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed eight people, including two children aged 7 and 9 and their parents, Palestinian officials said Monday. A third child, 10 years old, was wounded in an overnight strike on a tent where displaced people were sheltering in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to the Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government. An Associated Press reporter saw the children's bodies at nearby Nasser Hospital. A separate strike early Monday killed four people, including a woman and a child, in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The Israeli military blames civilian deaths on Hamas, accusing militants of hiding among civilians and fighting from residential areas. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. They do not distinguish between militants and civilians but say most of those killed are women and children. The fighting has left some 76 people dead in Israel, including 31 soldiers. ___ Here's the Latest: Death toll rises to 7 in Israeli strike in central Beirut BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry said the toll from Sunday’s Israeli strike in central Beirut rose to seven killed, including a woman, and 26 wounded. The Health Ministry also said Monday that three people were killed and 29 wounded in a separate strike Sunday in the Mar Elias area of central Beirut. The Hezbollah militant group said five members were killed including its spokesperson Mohammad Afif in the strike in the Ras Al Nabaa area. 9 members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad killed in Israeli strikes are buried in Damascus DAMASCUS — Nine members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group who were killed in Israeli airstrikes in Damascus were buried Monday in the Syrian capital. Women in the crowd wept as the dead were transported to the Yarmouk cemetery in the Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus. Some held images of slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. Israeli strikes on Thursday targeted two buildings with the offices of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, killing 15 people, including Syrian civilians, and wounding 20 others, officials said. The funeral on Monday was held for the nine Islamic Jihad members, including two high-ranking officials — commander Abdel Aziz Saeed Minawi and Rasmi Youssef Abu Issa, who was in charge of the group's Arab affairs. The wife of Ali Kabalan, a 44-year-old fighter who was killed Thursday, told The Associated Press that while the loss was unbearable, she and their five children were 'proud' that he died 'a martyr for the cause of Palestine’s liberation.' The Israeli military claimed the strikes dealt significant damage to its group’s leadership. Israel has accused the Islamic Jihad, alongside Hamas, of coordinating the Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel that ignited the ongoing war. Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria targeting members of Lebanon’s Hezbollah and officials from Iranian-backed groups. Head of UNRWA says banning the agency would leave Israel responsible for the needs of Palestinians GENEVA — The head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says Israel would have the 'responsibility' to respond to their needs if it goes through with plans to ban the agency. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, on Monday stepped up appeals to the international community to help convince Israeli authorities not to go through with the ban. Measures passed by the Knesset, if carried out as anticipated in January, would ban UNRWA from operating and cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. 'The clock is ticking,' Lazzarini told reporters in Geneva. Critics say the Knesset moves culminated a long-running campaign against UNRWA, which Israel contends has been infiltrated by Hamas. They say Israel’s real aim is to sideline the issue of Palestinian refugees. Lazzarini all but suggested that the considerable work helping Palestinian refugees would otherwise fall to Israel under international humanitarian law. 'I keep being asked, Is there yes, or not, a Plan B? There is no plan B within the U.N. agency -- within the U.N. family because there is no other agency geared to provide the same activities,' he said. 'UNRWA is the response of the international community to the plight of the Palestinian refugees, through the mandate provided by the GA (United Nations General Assembly) resolution,' Lazzarini added. 'So, if there is no U.N. or international community response, the responsibility will go back to the occupying power, being Israel.' 'And that’s where we have to ask: Where does a plan B sit today?' he said. Israeli troops deliver fuel and medical equipment to hospitals in northern Gaza, military says TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said Monday it had delivered fuel and medical equipment to hospitals in a besieged part of northern Gaza, where troops have launched an intense operation since October. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza said, said they delivered 10,000 liters of fuel and 149 packages of medical equipment to two hospitals, and helped oversee the evacuation of 64 patients and their escorts, along with the U.N., from hard-hit hospitals in the north. The hospitals that serve the area have been largely inaccessible because of the fighting, and a raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital last month left it barely functional. Israel has faced international pressure to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, particularly in the war-ravaged north. Last week, the United States said it would not limit arms transfers to Israel as it had threatened to do in October if aid was not significantly stepped up. In November, COGAT said they facilitated at least two aid deliveries to the far north, after a month in which virtually no supplies reached these areas. But international aid groups warned much more is needed, and famine is imminent in parts of northern Gaza. Funeral held for the Hezbollah main spokesman killed in an Israeli strike BEIRUT — A funeral was held Monday in southern Lebanon for Mohammad Afif, Hezbollah’s head of media relations, a day after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike in central Beirut. Afif’s coffin, draped in Hezbollah’s yellow flag, was carried through the streets of Sidon on the shoulders of mourners. 'Resistance is the response, and the convoys of martyrs create victory,' Afif’s brother, Sadiq al-Naboulsi, said at the funeral. 'Hajj Mohammad Afif was a big figure in the media, and therefore the Israelis and Americans were hurt by his voice. For that reason, they assassinated him. The killing of Hajj Mohammad Afif and all the martyrs and leaders will not turn (us) back at all,' he said. The strike that hit central Beirut for the first time in over a month also killed three other people on Sunday, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Afif had been a prominent spokesperson for Hezbollah, especially during the recent escalation of tensions with Israel. Days before his death, he held a press conference in Beirut’s southern suburbs, where he declared that Hezbollah was prepared for a prolonged war and denied claims that the group had lost its missile capabilities. Lebanon will convey its positive response to a US cease-fire proposal, minister says BEIRUT — A government minister close to Hezbollah says Lebanon will convey its 'positive position' on a United States-backed cease-fire proposal this week. The Biden administration is trying to halt the war between Israel and the militant group after months of sputtering cease-fire efforts. Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who is mediating for the militants, is expected to meet with U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein in the Lebanese capital on Tuesday. Labor Minister Mostafa Bayram, who met with Berri on Monday, said Hezbollah’s function 'is to make sure the (Israeli) aggression fails to achieve its goals, while negotiation is for the state and the government.' A Western diplomat familiar with the talks told The Associated Press there is a sense of 'cautious optimism.' 'Diplomatic efforts are converging towards a cease-fire, but it’s still in the hands and heads of key players to decide if it’s in their interest or not to stop things right now,' said the diplomat, who was not authorized to brief media and so spoke on condition of anonymity. The efforts are aimed at reestablishing a U.N. buffer zone in southern Lebanon established after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Israel is said to be pushing for guarantees it can continue to act militarily against Hezbollah if needed, a demand the Lebanese are unlikely to accept. — By Kareem Chehayeb Turkey denies overflight permission for a plane carrying Israel’s president ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey has denied Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s plane the right to use its airspace, preventing him from traveling to Azerbaijan, the Turkish state-run news agency reported. The Anadolu Agency report late Sunday said Israeli authorities requested permission for the plane to access the Turkish airspace on its way to Baku, Azerbaijan, where Herzog was scheduled to attend the COP29 conference on climate change. The agency based its report on unnamed Turkish officials. It did not say when the permission was denied. A statement from Herzog's office said the decision to cancel the president's trip to Baku was due to 'the situation assessment and for security reasons.' It did not comment on the Turkish report. Turkey has emerged as one of the strongest critics of Israel’s military actions in Gaza and Lebanon. It has suspended trade relations with Israel, accused the country of genocide and voiced support to Hamas. Children and their parents among 8 killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza, officials say KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip have killed eight people, including two children aged 7 and 9 and their parents, Palestinian officials said. A third child, 10 years old, was wounded in the same strike. The Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government, said Monday that the two children were killed in an overnight strike on a tent where displaced people were sheltering in the southern city of Khan Younis. An Associated Press reporter saw the bodies at nearby Nasser Hospital. The two children were beheaded by the blast and their remains were placed in one body bag. A separate strike early Monday killed four people, including a woman and a child, in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The Israeli military blames civilian deaths on Hamas, accusing militants of hiding among civilians and fighting from residential areas. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. They do not distinguish between militants and civilians but say most of those killed are women and children. ___ For more Middle East news:	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-2-young-children-and-parents-killed-in-an-israeli-strike-in-gaza-officials-say/	2024-11-18T07:32:15-08:00	
Moscow warns the US over allowing Ukraine to hit Russian soil wit...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The Kremlin warned Monday that President Joe Biden’s decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles adds 'fuel to the fire' of the war and would escalate international tensions even higher. Biden’s shift in policy added an uncertain, new factor to the conflict on the eve of the 1,000-day milestone since Russia began its full-scale invasion in 2022. It also came as a Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions struck a residential area of Sumy in northern Ukraine, killing 11 people, including two children, and injuring 84 others. Another missile barrage sparked apartment fires in the southern port of Odesa, killing at least 10 people and injuring 43, including a child, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said. Washington is easing limits on what Ukraine can strike with its American-made Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Sunday, after months of ruling out such a move over fears of escalating the conflict and bringing about a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO. The Kremlin was swift in its condemnation. 'It is obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps and they have been talking about this, to continue adding fuel to the fire and provoking further escalation of tensions around this conflict,' spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. The scope of the new firing guidelines isn’t clear. But the change came after the U.S., South Korea and NATO said recently that North Korean troops are in Russia and apparently are being deployed to help Moscow drive Ukrainian troops out of Russia’s Kursk border region. Russia also is slowly pushing Ukraine’s outnumbered army backward in the eastern Donetsk region. It has also conducted a devastating aerial campaign against civilian areas in Ukraine. Peskov referred journalists to a statement made by President Vladimir Putin in September in which he said allowing Ukraine to target Russia would significantly raise the stakes. It would change 'the very nature of the conflict dramatically,' Putin said at the time. 'This will mean that NATO countries — the United States and European countries — are at war with Russia.' Peskov claimed that Western countries supplying longer-range weapons also provide targeting services to Kyiv. 'This fundamentally changes the modality of their involvement in the conflict,' he said. Putin warned in June that Moscow could provide longer-range weapons to others to strike Western targets if NATO allowed Ukraine to use its allies' arms to attack Russian territory. He also reaffirmed Moscow’s readiness to use nuclear weapons if it sees a threat to its sovereignty. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office in about two months, has raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue vital military support to Ukraine. He has also vowed to quickly end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave a muted response to the approval that he and his government have been requesting of Biden for more than a year. 'Today, much is being said in the media about us receiving permission for the relevant actions,' Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address Sunday. 'But strikes are not made with words. Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves,' he said. The new policy's consequences on the battlefield are uncertain. ATACMS, which have a range of about 300 kilometers (190 miles), can reach targets far behind the about 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line in Ukraine, but they have relatively short range compared with other types of ballistic and cruise missiles. The policy change came 'too late to have a major strategic effect,' said Patrick Bury, a senior associate professor in security at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom. 'The ultimate kind of impact it will have is to probably slow down the tempo of the Russian offensives which are now happening,' he said. Ukraine could target enemy troops concentrated in Kursk or logistics hubs or command headquarters, Bury added. The cue for the policy change was the arrival in Russia of North Korean troops, according to Glib Voloskyi, an analyst at the CBA Initiatives Center, a Kyiv-based think tank. 'This is a signal the Biden administration is sending to North Korea and Russia, indicating that the decision to involve North Korean units has crossed a red line,' he told AP. Russian lawmakers and state media bashed the West over what they called an escalatory step, and threatened a harsh response. 'Biden, apparently, decided to end his presidential term and go down in history as ‘Bloody Joe,’' senior lawmaker Leonid Slutsky told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Vladimir Dzhabarov, deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of Russian parliament, called it 'a very big step toward the start of World War III' and an attempt to 'reduce the degree of freedom for Trump.' Russian newspapers offered similar predictions of doom. 'The madmen who are drawing NATO into a direct conflict with our country may soon be in great pain,' Rossiyskaya Gazeta said. Some NATO allies welcomed the move. Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna of Russian neighbor Estonia said easing restrictions on Ukraine was 'a good thing.' 'We have been saying that from the beginning — that no restrictions must be put on the military support,' he said at a meeting of senior European Union diplomats in Brussels. 'And we need to understand that situation is more serious (than) it was even maybe like a couple of months ago.' Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said he’s not 'opening the champagne' yet as it is unclear exactly what restrictions have been lifted and whether Ukraine has enough of the U.S. weapons to make a difference. ___ Lorne Cook in Brussels, Danica Kirka in London and Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-a-russian-ballistic-missile-with-cluster-munitions-kills-11-people-and-injures-84-in-ukraines-north/	2024-11-18T06:36:39-08:00
