Israeli strikes hit Beirut suburbs and kill 31 Palestinians in th...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes killed at least 31 people in the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, including 11 at a makeshift cafeteria in an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone, medics said. In Lebanon, warplanes struck Beirut’s southern suburbs on Tuesday after the military warned people to evacuate a number of homes. The new bombardment on both fronts comes on the verge of a deadline set by the United States for Israel to dramatically ramp up humanitarian aid allowed in Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. A group of eight international aid agencies said in a report on Tuesday that Israel has failed to meet the U.S. demands. In Lebanon, large explosions shook Beirut’s southern suburbs — an area known as Dahiyeh, where Hezbollah has a significant presence — soon after the Israeli military issued evacuation warnings for 11 houses there. There was no immediate word on casualties. The military said the houses contained Hezbollah installations, but the claim could not be independently confirmed. Late Monday night, a strike hit the village of Ain Yaacoub in northern Lebanon, killing at least 16 people, the Lebanese civil defense said. Four of the killed were Syrian refugees, and there were another 10 people wounded. There was no immediate Israeli military comment on the strike. Israel has been carrying out intensified bombardment of Lebanon since late September, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and put a stop to more than year of cross-border fire by the Lebanese militant group. Israeli strikes across Gaza kill 31 At the same time, Israel has continued its campaign in Gaza, now more than 13 months old, triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. An Israeli strike late Monday hit a makeshift cafeteria used by displaced people in Muwasi, the center of a 'humanitarian zone' that Israel’s military declared earlier in the war. At least 11 people were killed, including two children, according to officials at Nasser Hospital, where the casualties were taken. Video from the scene showed men pulling bloodied wounded from among tables and chairs set up in the sand in an enclosure made of corrugated metal sheets. In the southern city of Khan Younis, another 11 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a three-wheeled vehicle with a trailer known as a tuk-tuk, according to the Nasser Hospital. Tuk-tuks are widely used as taxis in Gaza. Another strike early Tuesday hit a house in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people including a woman, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The strike also wounded 11 others, it said. Another strike hit a group of people near a clinic run by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees in the central city of Deir al-Balah, killing at least six people, including two children, according to the city's Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strikes. Under US pressure, Israel allows more aid into Gaza Hours earlier, the Israeli military announced a small expansion of the humanitarian zone, where it has told Palestinians evacuating from other parts of Gaza to take refuge. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering in sprawling tent camps in and around Muwasi, a largely desolate area of dunes and agricultural fields with few facilities or services along the Mediterranean coast. Israeli forces have also been besieging the northernmost part of Gaza since the beginning of October, battling Hamas fighters it says regrouped there. With virtually no food or aid allowed in for more than a month, the siege has raised fears of famine among the tens of thousands of Palestinians believed to still be sheltering there. An Oct. 13 letter signed by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin gave Israeli 30 days to, among other things, allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods to enter Gaza each day. So far, Israel has fallen short. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, and 75 a day so far in November, according to Israel’s official figures. The United Nations puts the number lower, at 39 trucks daily since the beginning of October. Israel has announced a flurry of measures in recent days to increase aid, including opening a new crossing into central Gaza. But so far the impact is unclear. The military said Tuesday it had allowed hundreds of packages of food and water into Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, two areas under siege in the far north of Gaza. The Palestinian civil defense agency said three trucks carrying flour, canned food and water reached Beit Hanoun. It was only the second delivery allowed into the area since the beginning of October; a smaller cargo was let in last week, though not all of it reached shelters in the north, according to the U.N. More forced evacuations in isolated northern Gaza The military announced Tuesday that four soldiers were killed in Jabaliya, bringing to 24 the number of soldiers killed in the assault there since it began. Palestinian health officials say hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, though the true numbers are unknown as rescue workers are unable to reach buildings destroyed in strikes. Israel has ordered residents in the area to evacuate. But the U.N. has estimated some 70,000 people remain. Many Palestinians there fear Israel aims to permanently depopulate the area to more easily keep control of it. On Tuesday, witnesses told The Associated Press that Israeli troops had encircled at least three schools in Beit Hanoun, forcing hundreds of displaced people sheltering inside to leave. Drones blared announcements demanding people move south to Gaza City, said Mahmoud al-Kafarnah, speaking from one of the schools as sounds of gunfire could be heard. 'The tanks are outside,' he said. 'We don’t know where to go.' Hashim Afanah, sheltering with at least 20 other people in his family home, said the forces were evicting people from houses and shelters. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities that do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count but say more than half the dead are women and children. Israel says it targets Hamas militants who hide among civilians. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 250 as hostages. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of them believed to be dead. ___ Associated Press reporters Samy Magdy in Cairo and Melanie Lidman in Jerusalem contributed to this report. ___ This story has corrected to show that the span of the war is now 13 months, not 19 months, and that 75 aid trucks have entered per day in November, according to Israeli figures, not 87.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israeli-strikes-kill-14-palestinians-in-gaza-medical-officials-say/	2024-11-12T06:27:03-08:00	
Aid groups say Israel misses US deadline to boost humanitarian ai...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel has failed to meet U.S. demands to allow greater humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip, where conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war, international aid organizations said Tuesday. The obstacles facing aid distribution were on this display this week. Even after the military gave permission for a delivery to the northernmost part of Gaza — virtually cut off from food for more than a month by an Israeli siege — the United Nations said it couldn't deliver most of it because of turmoil and restrictions from Israeli troops on the ground. Hunger experts have warned the north may already be experiencing famine. Meanwhile, in the south, hundreds of truckloads of aid are sitting on the Gaza side of the border because the U.N. says it cannot reach them to distribute — again because of the threat of lawlessness, theft and Israeli military restrictions. The Biden administration last month set a deadline expiring Tuesday for Israel to 'surge' more food and other emergency aid into the Palestinian territory. The administration warned that failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back military support as Israel wages offensives against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has announced a series of steps — though their effect was unclear. On Tuesday, it opened a new crossing in central Gaza, outside the city of Deir al-Balah for aid to enter. It also announced a small expansion of its coastal 'humanitarian zone,' where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are sheltering in tent camps. It connected electricity for a desalination plant in Deir al Balah. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said last week that Israel had made some progress but needs to do more. Still U.S. officials haven’t said if they will take any action. Israel’s new foreign minister, Gideon Saar, appeared to downplay the deadline, telling reporters Monday that he was confident 'the issue would be solved.' The Biden administration may have less leverage after the reelection of Donald Trump, who was a staunch supporter of Israel in his first term. Eight international aid organization said in their report Tuesday that 'Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria' but also took actions 'that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza. … That situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago.' The report listed 19 measures of compliance with the U.S. demands. It said that Israel had failed to comply with 15 and only partially complied with four. The report was co-signed by Anera, Care, MedGlobal, Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam, Refugees International and Save the Children. In an Oct. 13 letter, the U.S. gave Israel 30 days to, among other things, allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods into Gaza each day; open a fifth crossing; allow people in coastal tent camps to move inland before the winter; and ensure access for aid groups to northern Gaza. It also called on Israel to halt legislation that would hinder operations of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Aid levels remain far below the U.S. benchmarks. Access to northern Gaza remains restricted, and Israel has pressed ahead with its laws against UNRWA. Israel launched a major offensive last month in the north, where it says Hamas militants had regrouped. The operation has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands. Through October and the first days of November, Israel allowed no food to enter the area, where tens of thousands of civilians have stayed despite evacuation orders. Last week, Israel allowed 11 trucks to go to Beit Hanoun, one of the north’s hardest-hit towns. But the World Food Organization said troops at a checkpoint forced its trucks to unload their cargo before reaching shelters in the town. On Tuesday, COGAT — the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza — announced it allowed a new delivery of food and water to Beit Hanoun a day earlier. Again, the WFP said that while it tried to send 14 trucks, only three made it to the town 'due to delays in receiving authorization for movement and crowds along the route.' When it tried to deliver the rest on Tuesday, Israel denied it permission, it said. Aid into all of Gaza plummeted in October, when just 34,000 tons of food entered, only a third of the previous month, according to Israeli data. U.N. agencies say even less actually gets through because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and lawlessness that makes it difficult to collect and distribute aid on the Gaza side. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, and 75 a day so far in November, according to Israel’s official figures. The U.N. says it only received 39 trucks daily since the beginning of October. COGAT said 900 truckloads of aid are sitting uncollected on the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south. 'Before the organizations give out grades, they should focus on distributing the aid that awaits them,' COGAT said in response to the aid groups’ report. COGAT blamed the drop in October on closures of the crossings for the Jewish high holidays and memorials marking the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the war. An Israeli official also pointed to theft by Hamas and organized crime families in Gaza, he said. He estimated as much as 40% of aid is stolen on some days. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations. The war began last year when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s bombardment and ground invasion have killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who don’t say how many of those killed were militants. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps, with little food, water or hygiene facilities. The United States has rushed billions of dollars in military aid to Israel during the war and has shielded it from international calls for a cease-fire, while pressing it to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. The amount of aid entering Gaza increased under U.S. pressure last spring after Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers before dwindling again. Trump has promised to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how. He was a staunch defender of Israel during his previous term, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says they have spoken three times since his reelection last week. Israeli President Isaac Herzog, whose role is mostly ceremonial, is scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden on Tuesday. Former U.S. State Department official Charles Blaha, who ran the office in charge of ensuring that U.S. military support complies with U.S. and international law, predicted the Biden administration would find that Israel violated U.S. law by blocking humanitarian aid from reaching Palestinians in Gaza. 'It’s undeniable that Israel has done that,' Blaha said. 'They would really have to torture themselves to find that Israel hasn’t restricted ... assistance.' But he expected the administration to cite U.S. national security interests and waive restrictions on military support. 'If the past is prologue — no restrictions, and then kick the can down the road to the next administration.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to Europe for urgent meetings on Ukraine with NATO and European Union officials following last week’s U.S. presidential election and the return of Donald Trump to the White House in January. The State Department will hold talks in Brussels on Wednesday on how to boost support for Ukraine as President-elect Trump has suggested U.S. military assistance to the country fighting off Russia's invasion could be severely curtailed after he takes office. After less than a day in Brussels, Blinken will fly to Peru and Brazil to join outgoing President Joe Biden at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and a summit of leaders from the Group of 20 top economies.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-blinken-is-heading-to-europe-for-urgent-talks-on-ukraine-after-trumps-election/	2024-11-12T05:39:13-08:00	
Doctor accused of criticizing Russia's war in Ukraine is convicte...	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A doctor accused of criticizing the war in Ukraine in front of a patient was convicted Tuesday of spreading false information about the Russian military and sentenced to 5 1/2 years in prison, part of an unrelenting Kremlin crackdown on dissent. Dr. Nadezhda Buyanova, 68, was arrested in February after Anastasia Akinshina, the mother of one of her patients, reported the pediatrician to authorities. Akinshina alleged that Buyanova told her and her son that his father, a Russian soldier who was killed in Ukraine, was a legitimate target for Kyiv’s troops and had blamed Moscow for the war. A video of the outraged Akinshina complaining about Buyanova was widely publicized, and chief of Russia’s Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin personally demanded a criminal case be brought against the doctor. Buyanova, who was born in western Ukraine, denied the accusation, insisting she never said what she was accused of saying. In a tearful closing statement to the court last week, she had urged it to acquit her. Her defense argued that the prosecution failed to present evidence that the purported conversation took place, including any recordings of it, and alleged that her accuser fabricated the story out of animosity toward Ukrainians, according to the independent news site Mediazona, which reported all of the hearings in the trial. In her closing statement to the court, Buyanova said it was 'painful' to read the accusations in the indictment, and broke down. 'A doctor, especially a pediatrician, is not capable of wishing harm to a child, his mother, or traumatizing the child’s psyche. Only a monster is capable of this -- and of the words that I allegedly said to them,' Mediazona quoted her as saying. 'Spreading false information' about the army has been a criminal offense since March 2022, when Russia adopted a series of laws prohibiting any public expression about the invasion that deviated from the official narrative. Authorities started actively using them against critics and protesters. According to OVD-Info, one of Russia’s leading rights groups that tracks political arrests, more than 1,000 people have been implicated in criminal cases on charges related to speaking or acting out against the war.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-doctor-accused-of-criticizing-russias-war-in-ukraine-is-convicted-and-given-over-5-years-in-prison/	2024-11-12T05:36:07-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes kill 11 in Gaza, hit Beirut s...	Palestinian medical officials said two Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 14 people, including two children and a woman. The deaths came as eight international aid groups said in a report on Tuesday that Israel has failed to meet U.S. demands that it allow greater humanitarian access to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, where conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war. A late Monday strike hit a cafeteria in the so-called Muwasi humanitarian zone west of the Gaza city of Khan Younis, killing at least 11 people, including two children, according to officials at Nasser Hospital, where the casualties were taken. Another strike early Tuesday hit a house in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people including a woman, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Biden administration last month called on Israel to 'surge' more food and other emergency aid into Gaza, setting a 30-day deadline that was expiring Tuesday. It warned failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back American military support as Israel wages war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has announced some steps toward improving the situation. But in recent days, U.S. officials signaled Israel still isn’t doing enough, though they have not said if they will take action against it. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. The officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. In Lebanon, to the north, the Iran-backed militant Hezbollah group, began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,200 people have been killed and more than 14,000 wounded in Lebanon, the country's Health Ministry reported. ___ Here's the latest: A drone fired from Lebanon smashes into a nursery school near the Israeli city of Haifa; no injuries are reported TEL AVIV, Israel — A drone fired from Lebanon smashed into a nursery school near the northern Israeli city of Haifa on Tuesday morning, but no children were injured as they were inside a bomb shelter at the time of the attack. That's according to an Associated Press reporter who visited the scene. The impact scattered debris across the playground. Hezbollah launched at least four drones toward Israel during the day, the Israeli military said, with the air force intercepting some of them. The Lebanese militant group has so far not claimed responsibility for the drones fired Tuesday but has said it fired rockets into Israel. Drones have challenged Israel’s robust aerial defense systems, and many have evaded interception, causing damage and killing people, including one of the worst mass-casualty strikes in Israel during the past year of war, when four soldiers were killed and dozens wounded by a drone strike. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,200 people have been killed and more than 14,000 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reported. In Israel, 73 people have been killed and over 600 wounded by Hezbollah fire, according to the prime minister’s office. Israel announces the opening of a fifth crossing point for aid into Gaza TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military announced on Tuesday the opening of a fifth crossing for humanitarian aid into Gaza, one of key demands by the United States for Israel to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza. The crossing, across from Kibbutz Kissufim, and closest to the city of Deir al Balah in Gaza, will allow for the delivery of food, water, medical supplies, and shelter equipment to central and southern Gaza, the military said. The aid will undergo a security check at the Kerem Shalom crossing and then be brought into Gaza via the new crossing. Trucks picking up aid at Kerem Shalom have repeatedly been attacked and supplies stolen as they travel to distribution hubs inside Gaza, according to an Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military briefing rules. Israel has come under intense criticism from the aid groups and the international community for failing to allow enough aid into Gaza, creating famine conditions in the northern part of the coastal strip. Israel has announced a series of steps toward improving the situation. But U.S. officials have signaled that Israel still is not doing enough, though they have not said if they will take any action against it. —Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel; Israeli warplanes strike Beirut's southern suburbs BEIRUT — Israeli airstrikes set off large explosions on Tuesday in Beirut’s southern suburbs — an area known as Dahiyeh where Hezbollah has a significant presence — soon after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for 11 houses there.

COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza said aid trucks were brought to the areas of Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, where the military has carried out an intense operation since Oct. 6. On Monday night, the Israeli security Cabinet approved more aid for Gaza, which will increase the number of trucks that enter the battered enclave each day, according to an official familiar with the matter. At least 700 Palestinians have been killed in northern Gaza since the operation began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and tens of thousands have been displaced. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its counts. An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military briefing rules, said the army estimates there are approximately 5,000–10,000 Palestinians still living in northern Gaza. The aid was delivered on a U.S.-imposed deadline that called on Israel to 'surge' more food and other emergency aid into Gaza. It warned that failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back military support as Israel wages war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs made 98 requests to Israeli authorities for authorization to go through the checkpoint along Wadi Gaza but only 15 made it, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday.

Dujarric said. In a new report published Monday, OCHA said humanitarian organizations submitted 50 requests to the Israeli authorities to enter North Gaza governorate in October and 33 were rejected while eight were accepted but faced impediments including delays that prevented their completion, he said. Over the past three days, Dujarric said, teams from OCHA, the U.N. human rights and de-mining agencies and other humanitarian groups visited nine sites in Gaza City to assess the needs of hundreds of displaced families, many from North Gaza. The teams say that some were in shelters, abandoned homes, destroyed clinic and some were sleeping in the streets or open fields where they feared stray dogs at night, Dujarric said. In a severely damaged structure, the team found more than a dozen families — including people with disabilities and some in urgent need of medical care — sheltering in the basement which had no electricity and was full of sewage, he said,. ___ For more Middle East news:	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-strikes-kill-11-in-gaza-as-us-deadline-to-israel-to-surge-aid-expires/	2024-11-12T05:33:29-08:00	
North Korea ratifies major defense treaty with Russia	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea ratified a major defense treaty with Russia stipulating mutual military aid, the North’s state media reported Tuesday, as the U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Russia had completed the ratification of the treaty last week after it was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. It is considered both countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership treaty will take effect when both sides exchange documents on the ratification, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said. North Korea ratified the treaty through a decree signed Monday by the country's president of state affairs, KCNA said, using one of Kim's titles. North Korea’s rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People’s Assembly, has the right to ratify treaties but Kim can unilaterally ratify major ones, according to South Korea’s Unification Ministry. The treaty requires both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. It also calls for the two countries to actively cooperate in efforts to establish a 'just and multipolar new world order' and strengthen cooperation on various sectors including peaceful atomic energy, space, food supply, trade and economy. Some observers speculate the treaty’s ratification in both countries could signal North Korea could formally enter the Russia-Ukraine war soon. According to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments, up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia likely as part of the June treaty. Last week, Ukrainian officials said Ukraine and North Korean troops engaged in small-scale fighting while Ukraine’s army fired artillery at North Korean soldiers in Russia’s Kursk border region. North Korea’s troop dispatch threatens to escalate the almost three-year war. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners also worry about what Russia could give North Korea in return. Possible Russian transfer of sensitive technology to enhance North Korea’s already-advancing nuclear and missile programs would be an alarming development for the U.S. and its allies. North Korea and Russia have been significantly strengthening their military and other cooperation. South Korea’s spy agency said last month that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-north-korea-ratifies-major-defense-treaty-with-russia/	2024-11-11T19:20:23-08:00

Israel’s new foreign minister said Monday that there has been 'certain progress' in efforts to end the fighting with Lebanon’s Hezbollah. But a spokesman for the militant group said it had not received any official proposal and was prepared to wage a long war if needed. The Biden administration has spent months trying to broker a cease-fire, and there were reports that U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein might return to the region in the coming days. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said any agreement would have to include enforcement mechanisms to prevent Hezbollah from reconstituting its military infrastructure near the border. 'There is certain progress on the issue. We are working with the Americans,' he told reporters. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer was meeting Monday with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the State Department said. He also met White House senior advisers Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk at the White House, according to a U.S. official.

In Beirut, Lacroix is scheduled to meet with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati; Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, the caretaker foreign and defense ministers, armed forces chief and the diplomatic corps, Dujarric said. Lacroix is also scheduled to visit the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Naqoura in southern Lebanon and front-line positions along the U.N.-drawn boundary between Lebanon and Israel to meet peacekeepers and 'thank them for their dedication in carrying out their work under extremely difficult conditions.' Dujarric said. The force, known as UNIFIL, has continued to monitor the escalating conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah across the boundary known as the Blue Line despite Israeli calls for peacekeepers to pull back 5 kilometers (3 miles) for their safety. UNIFIL has accused Israel of deliberately destroying observation equipment, and a number of peacekeepers have been injured in the military action. Israeli strike in northern Lebanon kills at least 8, health officials say BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike destroyed a home in northern Lebanon on Monday, killing at least eight people and wounding 14 others, the Health Ministry said. Rescue teams scrambled to pull survivors from under the rubble, Lebanon’s state media said, and video widely circulated on social media showed the Lebanese Red Cross moving corpses encased in body bags. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike and the target was not clear. The strike hit the village of Ain Yaaqoub in the northern Akkar region, which is home to Greek Orthodox and Sunni Muslim communities and is far from the Hezbollah militant group’s main areas of influence in the south and east. Israel has struck deeper into Lebanon since its military escalation and ground invasion against Hezbollah in late September. Israel's first strike in the Akkar region was on Nov. 2 and targeted a bridge near a Lebanese army checkpoint, cutting a key road leading to Syria. On Monday, another Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in southern Lebanon, killing seven people and wounding seven others, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Israel's military said 190 rockets were fired from Lebanon on Monday, with rescue services saying at least five people were injured. Israeli minister says he will push to annex parts of the occupied West Bank once Trump takes office RAMALLAH, West Bank — Israel’s finance minister says he will push for Israel to annex parts of the occupied West Bank after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Bezalel Smotrich said in a speech Monday that he will push 'for the inclusion of Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,' using the biblical term for the territory. '2025 will be the year ... of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,' he added. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has built scores of settlements to cement its control over the area. But it has never annexed the territory, which is home to 3 million Palestinians who live under military rule. The Palestinians seek the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and Gaza, for an independent state. The international community overwhelmingly considers the settlements, where some 500,000 Israelis live, to be illegal and obstacles to peace. Smotrich, along with other settler leaders, are counting on Trump to resume the pro-settler positions he took during his first term as president. During the first Trump administration, the U.S. reversed longstanding U.S. policy and said settlements do not violate international law. Trump's secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, made an unprecedented visit to a Jewish settlement. Lebanon death toll jumps to more than 3,240 people, Health Ministry says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry said Monday that 54 people were killed and 56 wounded on Sunday, raising the total toll from a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 3,243 killed and 14,134 wounded. One-quarter of them were women and children, the ministry said, with 2,325 men, 634 women and 201 children killed since the Israel-Hezbollah war began 13 months ago. Before the war intensified on Sept. 23, Hezbollah had said that nearly 500 of its members were killed but the group has stopped updating its death toll since. On Monday, an Israeli airstrike on a residential building in Al-Saksakiyeh town in Sidon province, South Lebanon, killed seven people and wounded seven others, the Health Ministry said. Most of those casualties were women and children, Lebanon’s state media said, adding that rescue teams were still searching for more missing people under the rubble. In the health care sector, the ministry said that 191 health workers have been killed, 308 wounded and 244 medical vehicles damaged since Oct. 8, 2023. Additionally, 88 medical and ambulatory centers have been affected, along with 65 hospitals. Israel says 190 rockets were fired from Lebanon, with reports that nearly half targeted the area around Haifa TEL AVIV — Israel’s military said at least 190 rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel on Monday, just as the country’s new foreign minister said efforts to reach a cease-fire deal with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah were moving forward. At least 90 rockets were fired toward Haifa, one of the largest barrages towards the northern port city since the war began last year, according to Israeli media. Israel’s rescue services said four people were wounded in the area around Haifa, and another person earlier in the day. Israel's military said most of the rockets were intercepted, without elaborating. The volley came the same day Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said 'certain progress' was being made toward a U.S.-brokered cease-fire with Lebanon’s Hezbollah. The group's leader has said it had not received a proposal and is prepared to keep fighting. Hezbollah did not immediately claim the volley on Monday evening, but said it was responsible for two rocket attacks in the afternoon it said targeted Israeli military bases near Haifa. Israel said its forces had targeted the Hezbollah launchers responsible for the attack. Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel's foreign minister isn't worried over US deadline for increased aid to Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel’s new foreign minister appeared to downplay a looming U.S. deadline for increased aid to Gaza, saying he was confident 'the issue would be solved.' The Biden administration warned Israel last month to increase the amount of food and other urgently needed aid entering Gaza to 350 trucks per day or risk a scaling back of American military support. It set a 30-day deadline that expires this week. The amount of aid entering the war-ravaged territory plummeted in October to its lowest level since the first month of the war, with an average of 57 trucks entering each day, according to Israeli figures. U.N. agencies say even less is actually being distributed because Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and lawlessness often prevent them from retrieving the aid on the Gaza side of the border. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday that he was 'sure we can also reach understanding with our American friends and that issue will be solved.' U.S. President Joe Biden may have less leverage over Israel as it awaits Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January. Trump was a staunch supporter of Israel during his previous term. He has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how. Lebanon's caretaker prime minister calls for a cease-fire along the border with Israel BEIRUT — Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Monday called for an immediate cease-fire along the Lebanon-Israel border, saying the war has had devastating effects on the small nation. Mikati called for the implementation of a U.N. resolution that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war in the summer of 2006, and the deployment of Lebanese troops along the border with Israel in coordination with U.N. peacekeepers. Mikati spoke at the opening session of the Arab-Islamic summit in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. He said the war has caused 'unprecedented losses' with more than 3,000 people dead, including 775 women and children. He said the war also had caused $8.5 billion in losses, including $3.4 billion caused by the destruction or damage of about 100,000 housing units in different parts of the country. 'No state can take the burden of this huge destruction,' Mikati said, adding that Beirut is about to set up a fund that will be funded by friendly states for the reconstruction process. He said the fund will be under international supervision and subject to international auditing. Mikati urged other nations to support the Lebanese state rather than the country’s political factions. Saudi Arabia hosts a summit to discuss Mideast wars RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Saudi Arabia on Monday hosted a summit over the ongoing Mideast wars. Speaking before leaders, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom renewed 'its condemnation and categorical rejection of the genocide committed by Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people, which has claimed the lives of 150,000 martyrs, wounded and missing, most of whom are women and children.' 'We affirm that Israel’s continued crimes against innocent people, its persistence in violating the sanctity of the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque, and its detraction from the pivotal role of the Palestinian National Authority in all Palestinian territories will undermine the efforts aimed at obtaining the Palestinian people’s legitimate rights and establishing peace in the region,' he added. The summit is a follow-up from the 2023 Arab-Islamic Summit. The new Israeli foreign minister says there's ‘certain progress’ in efforts to end war with Hezbollah JERUSALEM — Israel’s new foreign minister says there has been 'certain progress' in efforts to end the fighting with Lebanon’s Hezbollah. But a spokesman for the militant group said Monday that it had not received any official proposal and was prepared to wage a long war if needed. The Biden administration has spent months trying to broker a cease-fire, and there were reports that U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein might return to the region in the coming days. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said any agreement would have to include enforcement mechanisms to prevent Hezbollah from reconstituting its military infrastructure near the border. 'There is certain progress on the issue. We are working with the Americans,' he told reporters. 'The most important thing will not (be) the words but the enforcement,' he said, adding that if any agreement is breached, Israel 'will act immediately, militarily.' The U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war required both Hezbollah and Israeli forces to withdraw from a buffer zone in southern Lebanon that was to be patrolled by U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army. Israel says Hezbollah maintained a military presence right up to the border, while Lebanon accused Israel of violating other terms of the resolution. Lebanese officials are opposed to any changes to the resolution. In Beirut, Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Afif said the group has enough weapons and supplies to fight a long war with Israel. He said Israeli forces had failed to hold territory six weeks into their ground invasion, pointing to what he said was a failed Israeli attempt last week to enter the southern town of Khiyam. 'As long as you are not able to control areas in the field you will not achieve your political goals,' Afif said. He also denied claims by Israeli officials that Hezbollah has lost most of its missile capabilities, pointing to the fact that it is still launching dozens of projectiles a day and targeting areas in central Israel. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, and drawing retaliatory strikes, the day after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. All-out war erupted in September, when Israel carried out a wave of heavy airstrikes and killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. An Israeli strike closes Syria’s main north-south highway DAMASCUS, Syria — Israel’s air force attacked an aid convoy and forced the closure of Syria’s main north-south highway, Syria state media reported. There was no immediate word on casualties from Monday’s strike, and state TV did not provide details about the convoy. Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria in recent years. Israeli officials rarely acknowledge them, but say Israel is determined to disrupt arms shipments to Lebanon’s Hezbollah and to prevent Iran from developing military infrastructure near its borders. Monday’s airstrike occurred in Shamsin, around 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the border with Lebanon. People often gather there after fleeing the war, state TV said. It said the strike forced the closure of the M5 highway that links the capital, Damascus, with the northern city of Aleppo. On Sunday, an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in the Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab. The Syrian Defense Ministry said seven civilians were killed. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor linked to the Syrian opposition, suggested that Hezbollah was targeted. UN says more than 200 children have been killed in war in Lebanon BEIRUT — The United Nations children’s agency says the war between Israel and Hezbollah has killed more than 200 children in Lebanon. They include seven children who were among 23 people killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Lebanon on Sunday. UNICEF said protecting children from harm during war is a legal obligation and called for a cease-fire. Lebanon’s Health Ministry says at least 3,189 people have been killed and over 14,000 wounded in Lebanon in more than a year of conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. Some 1.2 million people have been displaced. On the Israeli side, 68 soldiers and 41 civilians have been killed in the fighting since October 2023, according to the prime minister’s office. More than 60,000 people have been displaced from their homes. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, and drawing retaliatory strikes, the day after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies backed by Iran. Hezbollah acknowledged the killing of nearly 500 of its fighters in the first 11 months of the conflict but stopped updating that toll after all-out war erupted in September. Yemen's Houthi rebels say they launched a missile targeting Israel DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Monday claimed they launched a missile targeting Israel. Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree made the claim in a prerecorded video message, claiming that the rebels launched a Palestine-2 ballistic missile he described as a 'hypersonic' toward a military base. The Israeli military said it 'intercepted one projectile that approached Israel from the direction of Yemen.' The Israelis also said the fire did not enter Israeli territory. The Houthis have launched missiles and targeted ships through the Red Sea corridor over the ongoing Mideast wars. The rebels separately said sites in the country came under attack in likely U.S. airstrikes early Monday morning, something not immediately acknowledged by the Americans. Senior UAE diplomat calls for de-escalation in Mideast wars DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A senior diplomat for the United Arab Emirates called on the world to focus on the plight of civilians and de-escalate the ongoing Mideast wars. Anwar Gargash’s remarks Monday, made at the Abu Dhabi Strategic Debate, followed the pattern of comments made by the UAE amid the Mideast wars. The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms home to Dubai, diplomatically recognized Israel in 2020. 'The complexities of the region require a steady hand and a clear and consistent vision,' Gargash said. 'The recent cycle of escalation between Israel and Iran cannot become a permanent feature of the strategic landscape of our region. This must be addressed through a political framework.' He called for 'pragmatism' and a 'serious political horizon' to resolve the wider Israeli-Palestinian conflict and reach a two-state solution. He described the war in the Gaza Strip as being 'driven by extremists on both sides, from the Israeli and Arab side.' Yet he also called the 'systemic violence' faced by Palestinians in Gaza 'criminal and unacceptable.' He added: 'At the present time, it is vital to identify that not all crises stem from the Palestinian issue, yet it undeniably remains central to the conflict in our region.' The UAE has provided aid for both the Gaza Strip and Lebanon in the wars, while maintaining its diplomatic ties with Israel. The UAE has, however, strenuously criticized Israel’s conduct at times in public in the wars. Gargash also offered criticism of governance in both the Palestinian territories and Lebanon. 'In both Palestine and Lebanon, a drastic reform is essential for the world to step in and provide considerable support,' Gargash said. ___ For more Middle East news:	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-strike-kills-3-people-in-central-gaza-palestinian-officials-say/	2024-11-11T17:00:50-08:00	
Israeli strikes kill dozens in Lebanon and isolated northern Gaza...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes killed dozens of people including children on Sunday in Lebanon and isolated northern Gaza, as the world watched for signs of how the U.S. election might affect the wars between Israel and Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he has spoken three times with Donald Trump since Tuesday’s election and they 'see eye-to-eye regarding the Iranian threat and all of its components.' Israeli President Isaac Herzog is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday. The Israeli airstrike in Lebanon killed at least 23 people, including seven children, in Aalmat village north of Beirut, far from the areas in the east and south where Hezbollah has a major presence. There was no Israeli evacuation warning. Israel’s military said that it hit a Hezbollah site used to store weapons, and the strike was under review. Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel after war broke out in Gaza, in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas. Israel retaliated, and a series of escalations have led to all-out war. In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people, including nine women, according to Dr. Fadel Naim, director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City. Israel's military said that it targeted a site where militants were operating, without providing evidence. It said the details of the strike were under review. A separate strike hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense first responders who operate under the government. Israel strikes deeper into Lebanon Israel has struck deeper inside Lebanon since September, when it killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire from northern to central Israel. The fighting has killed more than 3,100 people in Lebanon, according to the Health Ministry, and more than 70 people in Israel. After Israel's strike in Aalmat, around 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Beirut, legislator Raed Berro denied that any Hezbollah personnel or assets were in the building hit. 'Everyone can see, in front of cameras, that what is being pulled from under the rubble are women, children and elderly people who have nothing to do with weapons or rocket warehouses,' Berro said. Hassan Ghaddaf, who lived next door and was slightly wounded while heading to his balcony with morning coffee, said displaced people were in the building. 'I had seen them and got to know them the other day,' Ghaddaf said. 'They were peaceful. On the contrary, they had someone from the Lebanese Internal Security Forces that works for the state, and we saw their garb and clothes in the rubble.' In Syria, an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in the Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab, and the Defense Ministry said that seven civilians were killed, state news agency SANA reported. Britain-based opposition war monitor The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights suggested that Hezbollah was targeted. Israel didn't immediately comment. Fears of famine in northern Gaza The mid-month deadline is approaching for the Biden administration's ultimatum for Israel: Allow more aid into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby northern Gaza towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Experts from a panel that monitors food security say famine is imminent or may already be happening. The northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, has suffered the heaviest destruction of the 13-month war. Israel has sent forces back in, saying Hamas has regrouped. Israeli strikes often kill women and children. The military says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians. Also on Sunday, Israel's military released what it called footage of Hamas abusing detainees. The soundless footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, appears to show hooded detainees chained in stress positions. In some clips, men beat or poke them with batons. It wasn't possible to independently verify the videos, which the military said that it recovered during operations in Gaza. Rights groups have long accused the Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank of abusing detainees and violently quashing dissent. Israel has been accused of similar abuses, especially since the start of the war. Israeli prison authorities say they follow relevant laws and investigate allegations of wrongdoing. The toll of war The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities who don't distinguish between civilians and militants in their count, but say more than half the dead were women and children. Israeli bombardment and ground invasions have left vast areas of Gaza in ruins and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands live in tent camps with few if any services. Cease-fire talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled, as have parallel efforts by the U.S. and others to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, said Saturday that it had suspended its efforts and would resume them when 'the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war.' Some Palestinians in Gaza responded with frustration. 'The Arab silence that controls the Arab capitals, that’s because of the fear of the American administration and Israel,' said Akram Jarada, displaced from Gaza City. ___ Samy Magdy reported from Cairo and Chehayeb from Beirut.

Drones strike Moscow as top UK official highlights Russian casual...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A massive drone strike rattled Moscow and its suburbs overnight into Sunday, injuring several people and temporarily halting traffic at some of Russia's busiest airports, officials reported. Meanwhile, a huge nighttime wave of Russian drones targeted Ukraine. This came after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a pact with North Korea Saturday night, obliging the two countries to provide immediate military aid using 'all means' if either is attacked. The agreement marks the strongest link between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War. Earlier this week, Ukraine reported that its troops engaged for the first time with North Korean units. U.S. officials earlier confirmed the deployment of at least 3,000 North Korean troops to Russia, while Kyiv has repeatedly said the number is far higher. This has fueled concerns of a marked escalation in Moscow's war on Ukraine, and tensions spilling over into the Asia-Pacific. U.K. estimates Russian troop losses at 700,000 Both Moscow and Kyiv have kept a tight lid on casualty figures since the start of the full-scale war despite regular reports of Russian forces taking huge losses following 'human wave' attacks that aim to exhaust Ukrainian defenses. However, the chief of the U.K. defense staff, Tony Radakin, told the BBC that Russian forces had suffered their worst month of casualties in October since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He said Moscow’s troops suffered an average of 1,500 dead and wounded per day, bringing their total losses in the war to 700,000. According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying 'an extraordinary price' for the war, even as a grueling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine’s industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how U.K. officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures. 'There is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,' he said. But he added that they were 'tiny increments of land,' and Moscow’s mounting defense and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country. Radakin insisted that Ukraine’s Western partners should stand by it for 'as long as it takes' to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have signaled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace. Russia is cautiously optimistic about Trump’s forthcoming presidency On Sunday, the Kremlin’s official spokesman voiced cautious optimism about Trump’s upcoming presidency, saying: 'At least he talks about peace. … He does not talk about confrontation.' 'The signals are positive. Trump, during his election campaign, said that he perceives everything through deals, that he can make deals that will lead everyone toward peace,' Dmitry Peskov told reporters at a briefing. 'He does not talk about a desire to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, and this favorably distinguishes him from the current (U.S.) administration,' Peskov said. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday insisted that 'strong decisions' from Kyiv’s Western partners are needed to stop the 'terror' of Russian drone and missile strikes, and secure 'reliable peace' for Ukraine. 'The killing of children, the loss of family members cannot simply be forgotten,' Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. 'Without strong decisions, there is no security from terror, and this is equally clear in every country. There is no reliable peace without justice,' he said. Continuing fighting causes damage and casualties on both sides Fierce fighting has continued near the eastern Ukrainian cities of Toretsk and Kurakhove, Ukraine’s General Staff reported Sunday. Between 700 and 1,000 residents remain in Kurakhove, a front-line city surrounded on three sides and battered into ruin. Most of them live underground with no running water, heating or electricity. Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said a total of 84 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight in Russian territory, following what it called a 'mass strike on civilian infrastructure.' A man died under rubble after drones struck his apartment block in Russia’s Belgorod region, just kilometers from the Ukrainian border, local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported. Five other people were injured in the Moscow suburb of Ramenskoe and a nearby village, according to local officials. Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram carried eyewitness reports of drone debris setting fire to suburban homes. Russia's aviation authority said flights were briefly grounded at major international airports including Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo. At least 14 flights bound for Moscow were rerouted to Nizhnyi Novgorod, a city over 490 kilometers (300 miles) east, airport representatives there reported. Ukraine’s General Staff claimed on Sunday that Ukrainian drones caused a fire at an arms depot in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine and Belarus. The online update featured a photo showing thick plumes of reddish smoke rising into the night sky. The AP could not verify the circumstances in which it was taken, and there was no immediate comment from Russia. Separately, Russia’s emergencies ministry on Sunday said that a major fire broke out at a warehouse outside of Moscow. There were no immediate reports of casualties, and it was not clear whether the blaze was linked to the Ukrainian drone strikes. Russia overnight launched a 'record' 145 drones at Ukrainian territory, according to Ukraine’s air force, 62 of which were shot down. A further 67 were 'lost,' the air force said, a likely reference to electronic jamming that caused the drones to veer off course. At least one person was injured as Russian drones struck residential areas in Ukraine’s southern port of Odesa, local Gov. Oleh Kiper reported. And at least five civilians, including a 17-year-old girl and 10-year-old boy, were injured by falling drone debris and shelling in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region Sunday, its Gov. Oleh Syniehubov and local prosecutors said. Russia later on Sunday said that it had struck a large deployment of Ukrainian soldiers in the Kharkiv province with thermobaric rockets, but didn't immediately provide evidence. ___ Joanna Kozlowska reported from London. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-drones-strike-moscow-as-top-uk-official-highlights-russian-casualties-in-ukraine/	2024-11-10T09:26:34-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli defense minister officially steps dow...	Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant officially stepped down Friday in a ceremony that replaced him with Israel Katz, the former foreign minister, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired Gallant earlier this week. Israel has been rocked by Gallant’s dismissal, with the news setting off mass protests across the country. Many in Israel view Gallant as the sole moderate voice in a far-right government, and see his removal as a sign that the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu has lost interest in returning hostages still held in Gaza. Israel Katz, his replacement, currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. Also Friday, the Israeli military body handling aid to Gaza, COGAT, said it is preparing to open a new aid crossing into Gaza as the deadline for a U.S. deadline to increase desperately-needed aid into the war-ravaged territory approaches. But the body did not say when the crossing will open nor if aid will be delivered to north of Gaza, where the UN and aid groups say the humanitarian situation is most dire. The United Nations humanitarian office says Israel's monthlong offensive in northern Gaza is preventing the estimated 75,000 to 95,000 Palestinians in the north from receiving essential items for their survival. On Thursday, the Israeli military says it will allow 300 truckloads of humanitarian aid supplied by the United Arab Emirates to enter the Gaza Strip in the coming days. That’s less than the 350 trucks per day that the United States said it wants to see enter the war-ravaged territory. The Israel-Hamas war began after militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,100 people have been killed and some 13,800 wounded in Lebanon, the health ministry reported. ___ Here’s the latest: UN analysis finds 70% of Gaza deaths were women and children GENEVA — The U.N. human rights office released a report Friday that found that 70% of verified war deaths in the Gaza Strip were women and children. The agency examined 8,119 Palestinian deaths between Oct. 7, 2023, and Sept. 2, 2024, including 2,036 women and 3,588 children. Most died in attacks that killed five or more people and about 80% were in residential buildings, the report said. It blamed the Israeli military’s 'use of weapons with wide area effects in densely-populated areas,' though some of the deaths may also have been caused by rockets fired by Palestinian militant groups in Gaza that fell short. The youngest death was a 1-year-old boy and the oldest a 97-year-old woman. Most of the children were 5 to 9 years old. According to Gaza's health ministry, the overall death toll is over 43,500. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. 'Our monitoring indicates that this unprecedented level of killing and injury of civilians is a direct consequence of the failure to comply with fundamental principles of international humanitarian law,' U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk said. Israel’s diplomatic mission in Geneva said it 'categorically rejects' the report and accused the U.N. human rights office of disregarding the impact of activities of the militant group Hamas on civilians in Gaza. The mission also accused the agency of relying on 'unverified information.' The report comes as two world courts examine charges of war crimes against Israel. It also says Hamas and other militant groups 'committed serious violations of international law' when they stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Netanyahu appoints aide as new Israeli ambassador to the US JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday he was appointing Yechiel Leiter as Israel’s new ambassador to the U.S. U.S.-born Leiter will replace ambassador Michael Herzog, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Leiter has been a close aide to Netanyahu and was formerly the deputy director general of Israel’s education ministry and chief of staff to the minister of finance. His son was killed while fighting in Gaza in November. Netanyahu said Leiter was a 'highly talented diplomat, an eloquent speaker,' with a 'deep understanding of American culture and politics.' Leiter has been a senior fellow at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a conservative Jerusalem think tank. He lives in the settlement of Eli in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel prepares to open new aid crossing into Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel says it is preparing to open a new aid crossing into Gaza as the deadline for a U.S. deadline to increase desperately-needed aid into the war-ravaged territory approaches. The Israeli military body handling aid to Gaza, COGAT, said it has built inspection facilities and paved roads around the Kissufim crossing, located near the center of the Gaza. It says food, aid, and fuel will soon be able to be delivered through the crossing, but did not say when it will open nor if aid will be delivered to north of Gaza, where the UN and aid groups say the humanitarian situation is most dire. Since Israeli forces unleashed a fierce offensive on north Gaza in early October, no aid has made it to the northernmost reaches of the territory, where the UN says roughly 70,000 Palestinians still remain. The opening of the crossing likely reflects an Israeli desire to ramp up aid ahead of a US-imposed deadline. In an Oct. 13 letter sent to Israeli officials, US officials said Israel had 30 days to increase the daily number of aid trucks entering the Gaza Strip to 350 or risk the US reconsidering arms shipments to Israel -- which have been key to Israel’s war against Hamas militants in Gaza. Israel has so far fallen far short of this benchmark, with COGAT figures showing an average of 57 trucks a day entering Gaza. In the first seven days of November, the average has been 81. Israeli defense minister officially steps down JERUSALEM — Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant officially stepped down Friday in a ceremony that replaced him with Israel Katz, the former Foreign Minister, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Gallant earlier this week. Israel has been rocked by Gallant’s firing, with the news setting off mass protests across the country. Many in Israel view Gallant as the sole moderate voice in a far-right government, and see his dismissal as a sign that the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu has lost interest in returning hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas militants. Gallant thanked the military and warned that the war’s 'mission is not yet complete; we must meet our moral and traditional obligation, and the war’s objective is to bring home the remaining 101 hostages who haven’t yet seen their families and homes.' Israel Katz, his replacement, currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. Katz thanked Gallant and said the war’s objectives were to 'stop Iranian aggression and deny its capabilities, continue dismantling Hamas as a governing and military force, and defeat Hezbollah.' He added that returning the hostages was a top 'moral priority.' 'Yoav, we were friends and will remain friends because we believe in the same things that will secure Israel’s security and future, the Jewish state,' he said. 'I promise that the entire State of Israel will emerge from this war and from the pain to much higher places.' Turkey's Erdogan hopes Trump will fulfil promises to end Middle East conflicts ANKARA, Turkey - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he hopes US President-Elect Donald Trump will fulfil promises to end the conflict in the Middle East and tell Israel to 'stop' its aggression. Speaking to a group of journalists on a return flight from Hungary, Erdogan also said that cutting off U.S. arms support to Israel 'would be a good start' toward ending the conflict in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. 'We want that promise to be fulfilled and for Israel to be told to ‘stop,’' Hurriyet newspaper and other media quoted Erdogan as saying on Friday. Erdogan also called on Trump to abandon what he said were the Biden administration’s 'erroneous policies.' 'We expect my dear friend Trump to abandon the erroneous policies of the former administration during his second term as president,' Erdogan said in a televised address. 'We sincerely believed that the president will do his part to end the wars.' Turkey has become one of Israel’s most vocal critics, accusing the country of committing genocide in Gaza and strongly criticizing Western nations for backing Israel. ___ For more Middle East news:	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-defense-minister-officially-steps-down/	2024-11-08T08:41:40-08:00	
Hungary's leader Orbán predicts Trump will end support for Ukrain...	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Donald Trump's biggest European fan, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, predicted on Friday that a new U.S. administration under Trump will cease providing support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia's full-scale invasion. Orbán's comments were a signal that Trump's recent election could drive a wedge among European Union leaders on the question of the war. Hungary's leader hosted the second of two days of summits on Friday in the capital, Budapest, just days after Trump's election victory. The war in Ukraine was high on the agenda for the gathering of the EU's 27 leaders, most of whom believe continuing to supply Kyiv with weapons and financial assistance are key elements for the continent's security. The nationalist Hungarian leader has long sought to undermine EU support for Ukraine, and routinely blocked, delayed or watered down the bloc’s efforts to provide weapons and funding and to sanction Moscow for its invasion. He has sought to use the summits to make his case to other leaders that they should rethink their commitments to the war-ravaged country. In comments to state radio before Friday's summit, Orbán, who is considered close to both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, reiterated his long-held position that an immediate cease-fire should be declared, and suggested that Ukraine has already lost its fight. 'The situation on the front is obvious, there’s been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war,' Orbán said. The Hungarian leader has cast himself as the exemplar of some in the EU who are skeptical of providing indefinite support to Ukraine, especially in light of uncertainty over whether U.S. assistance could evaporate under Trump. He said Friday that Trump's reelection had created a 'new situation' for Europe, and that the continent 'cannot finance this war alone.' But numerous EU leaders made a point to downplay the risk of a shift in U.S. policies drifting across the Atlantic into European capitals. Arriving at the summit, the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said a new U.S. administration wouldn't lead Europe to change course. 'We cannot outsource our capacity of action. Whatever happens in the U.S., we have our interests, we have our values,' Borrell said. Italy’s hard-right leader, Premier Giorgia Meloni, who is aligned with Orbán on many issues but breaks with him sharply on Russia’s war, said: 'As long is there is a war, Italy is on the side of Ukraine.' Western support is crucial for Kyiv to sustain the costly war of attrition, but Trump's repeated statements criticizing U.S. aid, and his claims that he could bring the conflict to a rapid end, have led to uncertainty over how long the help will continue. At a gathering on Thursday of European leaders in Budapest, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy objected to Trump’s claim that Russia’s war with Ukraine could be ended in a day, something he and his European backers fear would mean peace on terms favorable to Putin and involving the surrender of territory. 'If it is going to be very fast, it will be a loss for Ukraine,' Zelenskyy said. Despite Orbán's attempts to throttle aid packages, EU leaders have largely found workaround solutions to any obstruction to providing Zelenskyy with assistance, and have been able to signal their commitment to supporting Ukraine in its fight, regardless of who occupies the White House. Closing out the summit on Friday, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said the EU would 'discuss with our American friends also the fact that Russia is not only a threat to Europe, but a threat to the global security as a whole' in an effort to dissuade a new Trump administration from abandoning aid to Ukraine. 'We see that technology from China and Iran is used by Russia on the battlefield,' she continued. 'It shows that the security of the Indo-Pacific and Europe are interconnected, and so are the European and the United States interests in this course.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-hungarys-orban-predicts-trumps-administration-will-end-us-support-for-ukraine/	2024-11-08T08:19:47-08:00	
Russia blasts Ukraine with more aerial attacks as part of an inte...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian missiles, bombs and drones battered three regions of Ukraine in targeted nighttime attacks, officials said Friday, as Russia mounts an intensified aerial campaign that Ukrainian officials say they need more Western help to counter — even as doubts deepen over what Kyiv can expect from a new U.S. administration. Since the war began almost three years ago following Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor, the Russian military has repeatedly used its superior air power to blast civilian targets across Ukraine. More than 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the conflict, according to the United Nations. A 500-kilogram (about 1,000 pounds) glide bomb severely damaged a high-rise apartment building in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, in the middle of the night, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. At least 25 people, including an infant, were injured, he said. Glide bombs, for which Ukraine has no effective countermeasure, obliterate their targets, sending out a powerful shock wave and often leaving a wide crater. In the southern city of Odesa, a Russian drone attack killed one person and injured nine others overnight, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said. In the capital Kyiv, falling wreckage from intercepted missiles injured four people, regional Gov. Ruslan Kravchenko said. In total, Russia fired 92 drones and five missiles at Ukraine during the night, Ukraine’s air force said. Four missiles and 62 drones were intercepted, and 26 drones were jammed electronically, it claimed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country needs more help to fight back against Russia’s military might, even as uncertainty deepens about what Western aid Ukraine can expect after Donald Trump was elected this week as the next U.S. president. 'It is important to act together and decisively at the international level every time Russia tries to destroy our lives,' Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. 'This is the only way to achieve a just peace and stop the deaths of our people.' Russia launched about 2,000 drones at Ukraine in October, about one-third more than the previous month, making it the third month in a row that there was a significant rise, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Friday. Russian fire rates have climbed since the middle of the year, it said, adding that the latest high monthly numbers will likely become the norm. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-blasts-ukraine-with-more-aerial-attacks-as-part-of-an-intensified-campaign/	2024-11-08T03:03:34-08:00	
An 8-hour Russian drone barrage keeps Kyiv on edge as the war in ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Dozens of Russian drones targeted Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, in an eight-hour nighttime attack, authorities said Thursday as Russia kept up its relentless pounding of Ukraine after almost 1,000 days of war. Lone Russian drones and also swarms of drones entered Ukrainian airspace from various directions and at a variety of altitudes, officials said, in what was an apparent attempt to stretch air defense systems and unnerve city residents. Ukrainian air defenses 'neutralized' three dozen drones, but falling debris caused damage to a hospital as well as residential and office buildings in Kyiv, local authorities said. A fire was ignited on the 33rd floor of an apartment building. At least two people were reported injured. Drone attacks on Kyiv have recently been occurring almost every day, with nighttime explosions and the continuous buzzing sound of drones keeping the city on edge. Russia is deploying about 10 times more Iranian-made Shahed drones than it was this time last year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week. Ukraine’s forces are struggling to match the might of Russia’s military, which is much bigger and better equipped. Western support is crucial for Ukraine to sustain the costly war of attrition. The uncertainty over how long that aid will continue deepened this week with Donald Trump elected as the next U.S. president. Trump has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine. Russia, meanwhile, is trying to grind down Ukraine’s appetite for the fight and sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. The Russian barrages mostly involve Iranian Shahed drones, which terrorize civilians, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of the state Center for Countering Disinformation. Russia is aiming to save and stockpile its missiles, which are much more powerful than drones, Kovalenko claimed on Thursday, though Russia has used missiles effectively in its campaign to knock out Ukraine’s power grid. Also, the drone attacks gradually wear down Ukraine’s air defenses, making it more vulnerable to future missile launches. During the day on Thursday, Russia launched five attacks using missiles and glide bombs on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, killing at least one person and wounding 10, including a year-old child, according to the regional military administration’s press service. The attacks damaged residential buildings and a hospital, it said. Power outages were reported in the Zhytomyr region, which borders Kyiv to the west, following a Russian attack there, according to the energy company Zhytomyroblenergo. Another Russian drone attack injured one person in the southern city of Odesa, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said, and drone debris damaged an 11-story residential building. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-an-8-hour-russian-drone-barrage-keeps-kyiv-on-edge-as-the-war-in-ukraine-nears-1000-days/	2024-11-07T07:05:02-08:00	
Middle East latest: Large airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs as Israel...	Several large airstrikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs early Thursday, including one on a site adjacent to Lebanon’s only international airport. The Israeli military had issued an evacuation notice for the site, saying there were Hezbollah facilities there, without giving more details. Also Thursday, the Israeli military announced it expanded its month-old ground operation in northern Gaza to include part of Beit Lahiya, a town that has been heavily bombed since the earliest days of the war, where Israel says Hamas militants have regrouped. Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said in a speech aired Wednesday that the Lebanese militant group is open for cease-fire negotiations only once 'the enemy stops its aggression.' His speech marked the 40-day mourning period since former Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated in Beirut. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,000 people have been killed and some 13,600 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reported. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel's military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli military to allow 300 truckloads of aid from UAE into Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it will allow 300 truckloads of humanitarian aid supplied by the United Arab Emirates to enter the Gaza Strip. That’s less than the 350 trucks per day that the United States has said it wants to see enter the war-ravaged territory. COGAT, the military body in charge of civilian affairs in Gaza, said the aid was brought in by sea and unloaded at the Israeli port of Ashdod, just north of Gaza. It said the shipment, which includes food, water, medical equipment, shelter and hygiene supplies, would be inspected before being trucked into Gaza. The amount of aid entering Gaza dropped off dramatically in October as Israel launched another offensive in the territory’s north. By the end of October, an average of just 71 trucks a day were entering Gaza, according to the latest U.N. figures. The United States has warned Israel to ramp up the entry of aid by mid-November, saying failure to do so could lead to a reduction in military support. Israel says it allows plenty of aid to enter Gaza and blames U.N. agencies and other aid groups for not distributing it. Humanitarian groups say their efforts are hobbled by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order. Dozens of Lebanese killed in struck apartment building are laid to rest TYRE, Lebanon — Dozens of Lebanese were laid to rest Thursday following an Israeli airstrike that hit an apartment building in the town of Barja, just north of the port city of Sidon. The Lebanese Civil Defense said they pulled at least 30 bodies and remains following late Tuesday's strike. Among the killed were many members of the Basma family, who had fled depper into southern Lebanon for safety. Family members who survived found shelter elsewhere or weren’t in the building at the time. 'My sister was killed last week, and now my brother, my nephew, and my other nephew with members of his family,' said Hassan Basma. Nearby, Khadija Daramsis, who washes the bodies of the dead before burial in accordance with Islamic tradition, found herself having to do the same for her nieces. She had just seen them last week. 'They told me they were scared of the strikes and then they were struck,' Daramsis said as she wept. 'What did they have to do with anything? Are they resistance? Are they Hezbollah?' Israel says its strikes target Hezbollah militants or the group’s assets. The strike in Barja came without warning. Khalil Basma says the ongoing war and Israel’s military escalation is the worst he’s seen in Lebanon. 'Knowing the wars we have gone through, this is regretfully the first time we see such crimes,' he said. 'May God protect everyone and end this crisis.' Israeli drone strike kills 3 in southern Lebanon city of Sidon, Lebanese state media says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state news agency says an Israeli drone strike has hit a car at an army checkpoint in the southern port city of Sidon, killing three people and wounding several others including U.N. peacekeepers. The National News Agency said one of the wounded was taken to the hospital while the peacekeepers were treated for minor injuries at the scene of the attack at the northern entrance of Sidon, Lebanon’s third-largest city. There was no immediate information on the identities of those who died. The convoy of peacekeepers happened to be driving nearby when the airstrike occurred, according to the report. A spokesperson for the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL did not respond to messages sent by The Associated Press. A drone strike earlier Thursday hit a car on a main highway just outside Beirut, killing one woman, according to local media. French diplomat urges diplomatic solution in coming weeks PARIS — France’s top diplomat has urged action in the coming weeks toward a political solution to the wars in the Mideast. Visiting Israel, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Thursday that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has ″never hid his wish to end the interminable wars in the Middle East.' 'So the conditions seem right to me to move in the coming weeks toward a diplomatic solution to the current conflict. Because force alone cannot suffice to guarantee Israel’s security,' he said. Barrot called for a halt to Israel’s bombings of northern Gaza, calling them contrary to Israel’s long-term interests. ″The Palestinian question will not disappear, regardless of what American administration is in office,″ Barrot told reporters. He also warned Iran against further escalation, and called for a diplomatic solution for Lebanon. He met his Israeli counterpart and heads next to the Palestinian territories for talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Iran's Supreme Leader says militant groups against Israel remain strong TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says its alliance of militant groups opposed to Israel remains strong despite the killing of many of their senior leaders. 'God willing, the world will see a day when the Zionist regime will be defeated by them,' Iranian state TV reported the leader as saying Thursday. The report quoted Khamenei as saying that Hamas and other 'leaders of the resistance' are 'still fighting' even though some of their leaders have been killed by intensified Israel airstrikes. Israeli strikes and military operations in recent months have killed the top leaders of both Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as many of their senior commanders. Both groups are part of the so-called Axis of Resistance, which includes other Iran-backed groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Iran and its allies have repeatedly traded fire with Israel and the United States over the past year following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, raising fears of a regional war. Israel announces $5.2 billion fighter jet deal with Boeing JERUSALEM — Israel says it has reached an agreement to purchase 25 advanced F-15 fighter jets from U.S. aerospace giant Boeing for $5.2 billion. The Defense Ministry said the agreement, concluded Wednesday, was part of a broader aid package approved by the U.S. government earlier this year. Deliveries will begin in 2031, and there’s an option for the purchase of an additional 25 aircraft. The United States has provided crucial military support to Israel as it has battled Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and traded fire with Iran. The Biden administration recently warned Israel that if it did not facilitate the delivery of more aid to Gaza, U.S. laws may force the administration to curb some of its military support. The State Department said this week that Israel had yet to sufficiently improve aid deliveries ahead of a mid-November deadline. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how he plans to do it. He was a staunch supporter of Israel during his previous term but also cultivated close ties with Arab Gulf leaders. Israeli military extends shutdown of Al Jazeera's West Bank bureau RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Al Jazeera news network says the Israeli military has extended the order shutting down its bureau in the occupied West Bank. Walid al-Omari, the network’s bureau chief, said Israeli troops raided the office in Ramallah again early Thursday and posted a notice extending the closure for an additional 45 days. Israel had previously raided the office and shut it down on Sept. 22. Earlier this year, authorities took the rare step of barring the Qatar-based network from operating in Israel. Israel accuses Al Jazeera of serving as a mouthpiece for Hamas, an allegation denied by the network. Last month, Israel accused six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants, which the network also denied. Al-Jazeera has provided near 24-hour coverage from inside Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, with a heavy focus on the war’s toll among Palestinian civilians. Several of its correspondents have been killed or wounded by Israeli forces. It also routinely airs unedited Hamas videos showing attacks on Israeli forces and hostages speaking under duress. Israel passes law that would allow it to deport the families of Palestinian attackers, including citizens Israel’s parliament passed a law early Thursday that would allow it to deport family members of Palestinian attackers, including the country’s own citizens, to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip or other locations. The law, which was championed by members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party and his far-right allies, passed with a 61-41 vote but is likely to be challenged in court. It would apply to Palestinian citizens of Israel and residents of annexed east Jerusalem who knew about their family members’ attacks beforehand or who 'express support or identification with the act of terrorism.' Read the full story here. Israel expands its ground operation in northern Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has expanded its month-old ground operation in northern Gaza to a town that has been heavily bombed since the earliest days of the war. The military said in a statement Thursday that 'troops started to operate' in the area of Beit Lahiya after intelligence indicated the presence of militants there. Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas where the military already conducted major operations. The town in the northwestern corner of Gaza was among the first targets of the ground invasion launched over a year ago, after Hamas’ attack into southern Israel. The northern third of the territory has been encircled by Israeli forces since then. Israel launched another major offensive in nearby Jabaliya, a decades-old urban refugee camp, in early October. It has sharply restricted the amount of aid entering northern Gaza and ordered a full evacuation. Tens of thousands have fled to nearby Gaza City in the latest mass displacement of the war. Airstrikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs, including one on site adjacent to airport BEIRUT — Several large airstrikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs early Thursday, including one on a site adjacent to Lebanon’s only international airport. The Israeli military had earlier issued an evacuation notice for the site, saying that there were Hezbollah facilities there, without giving more details. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Beirut’s airport has not been directly targeted in the war between Israel and Hezbollah, and national air carrier Middle East Airlines has continued to operate commercial flights. ___ For more Middle East news:	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-large-airstrikes-hit-beirut-suburbs-as-israel-expands-northern-gaza-operations/	2024-11-07T06:09:32-08:00	
A new law allows Israel to deport the relatives of attackers. Exp...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s parliament passed a law early Thursday that would allow it to deport family members of Palestinian attackers, including the country’s own citizens, to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip or other locations. The law, which was championed by members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and his far-right allies, passed with a 61-41 vote. But legal experts said that any attempt to implement it would likely lead to it being struck down by Israeli courts. It would apply to Palestinian citizens of Israel and residents of annexed east Jerusalem who knew about their family members' attacks beforehand or who 'express support or identification with the act of terrorism.' They would be deported, either to the Gaza Strip or another location, for a period of seven to 20 years. The Israel-Hamas war is still raging in Gaza, where tens of thousands have been killed and most of the population has been internally displaced, often multiple times. It was unclear if it would apply in the occupied West Bank, where Israel already has a long-standing policy of demolishing the family homes of attackers. Palestinians have carried out scores of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis in recent years. Oded Feller, a legal adviser to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, dismissed the law as 'populist nonsense.' He said it was unlikely to be applied, because there is no legal way for the Interior Ministry to send an Israeli citizen to another country or to Gaza. His organization doesn't plan to challenge the law unless authorities try to enforce it, in which case he expects any court challenge to succeed. Eran Shamir-Borer, a senior researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute and a former international law expert for the Israeli military, agreed that the law was likely to be struck down by the Supreme Court. He said that if a resident of east Jerusalem was deported under the law, it could be seen by many in the international community as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, because they view the area as occupied territory, although Israel doesn't. The deportation of an Israeli citizen could be seen not only as a violation of their constitutional rights under Israeli law, but also as a breach of their human rights under international law, he said. The law could also be seen as a form of collective punishment and as discriminatory, because it appears to only apply to Arab citizens and residents, and not to family members of Jews convicted under terrorism laws. 'The bottom line is this is completely nonconstitutional and a clear conflict to Israel’s core values,' Shamir-Borer said. Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war — territories the Palestinians want for their future state. It withdrew settlers and soldiers from Gaza in 2005, but has reoccupied parts of the territory since Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, 2023 triggered the war. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized by most of the international community. Palestinians there have permanent residency and are allowed to apply for citizenship, but most choose not to, and those who do face a series of obstacles. Palestinians living in Israel make up around 20% of the country's population. They have citizenship and the right to vote but face widespread discrimination. Many also have close family ties to those in the territories and most sympathize with the Palestinian cause. ___ Melanie Lidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Middle East latest: Rescue workers pull 30 bodies from apartments...	Lebanon’s Civil Defense service says they have pulled 30 bodies from the rubble of an apartment building that Israel struck the night before. Search efforts were ongoing Wednesday, and it was unclear how many survivors or bodies were still trapped under the rubble. The airstrike Tuesday night came without warning. There was no statement from the Israeli military on the strike, and it was not immediately clear what the intended target was. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in a surprise announcement that sparked protests across the country. Gallant’s replacement is Foreign Minister Israel Katz, a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. While Netanyahu has called for continued military pressure on Hamas, Gallant said military force created the necessary conditions for at least a temporary diplomatic deal that could bring home hostages held by the militant group. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel's military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in 2023, at least 3,000 people have been killed and some 13,500 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reported. A report by Lebanon’s crisis response unit said 361,300 Syrians and over 177,800 Lebanese crossed into Syria between Sept. 23 and Nov. 1. ___ Here’s the latest: Hezbollah rocket attack kills foreign worker in Israel JERUSALEM — Israeli medics say a foreign worker was killed in a Hezbollah rocket attack. The Magen David Adom rescue service said the worker’s body was found near the northern city of Acre after a rocket barrage from Lebanon on Wednesday. It did not give a nationality. Hezbollah has stepped up its rocket fire into Israel since war broke out in September after nearly a year of lower-level conflict linked to the fighting in Gaza. Israel has been carrying out waves of airstrikes and invaded Lebanon in early October. Rocket attacks last week killed seven people, including four Thai farm workers. Israeli airstrike lands close to Roman ruins at Baalbek BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike landed dangerously close to Baalbek’s UNESCO-listed Roman ruins, a revered heritage site with some of the largest and best-preserved Roman temples outside of Rome, a Lebanese local official said. 'This is the closest raid on Baalbek Temple since the beginning of the aggression, as a missile fell inside the castle’s parking lot,' the governor of Baalbek-Hermel province, Bachir Khodr, said in a post on X. 'The temple has not yet been inspected to determine if there is any damage inside it.' Footage captured by a resident in Baalbek showed thick smoke rising from the impact site, with panic gripping the scene as she repeatedly says, '(it hit) right at the temple.' Since early last week, the Israeli army has been bombarding various areas in Baalbek-Hermel, killing dozens, after having issued several evacuation warnings for the entire city of Baalbek and its surroundings. The maps attached with the evacuation warning included the Roman ruins. Concerns have been mounting that further strikes may impact the ancient temples, which have survived nearly two millennia. On Wednesday, 38 people were killed while 54 others were wounded across various areas in northeastern Lebanon amid intensified airstrikes throughout the day, Khodr said in a separate post on X, adding that operations to save more victims from under the rubble are still ongoing. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said that 37 people were killed and 105 wounded in Lebanon on Tuesday, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 3,050 killed and 13,658 wounded. UN completes vaccinating majority of children in Gaza against polio DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — United Nations agencies say they have completed the administration of a second dose of polio vaccine to the majority of children in the Gaza Strip. In all, 556,774 children under the age of 10 received the second dose, the World Health Organization and the U.N. children’s agency said in a statement Wednesday. That amounts to 94% of the total population that age in the territory, 'a remarkable achievement given the extremely difficult circumstances,' they said. But they also said coverage only reached 88% in northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging a major operation over the past month. An estimated 7,000 to 10,000 children in Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya were inaccessible, the agencies said. The first dose was administered across all parts of Gaza in September. The U.N. said both sides largely observed humanitarian pauses to allow the vaccinations to proceed. At least two doses and a minimum of 90% vaccination coverage are needed to prevent the spread of the disease in a given community, according to the agencies. The campaign was launched after the first polio case was reported in Gaza in 25 years — a 10-month-old boy, now paralyzed in the leg. UNRWA head urges action to stop Israel from banning its operations in Gaza and the West Bank UNITED NATIONS – The head of the U.N. agency that is a lifeline for Palestinian refugees is urging the world’s nations to take action to prevent Israel from implementing a ban on its operations in Gaza and the West Bank, warning it will have 'disastrous consequences' for millions of people caught in the ongoing war. Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini, who heads the agency known as UNRWA, told the 193-member General Assembly Wednesday that the ban 'will collapse the U.N. humanitarian response' in Gaza, end education for 650,000 boys and girls in the enclave, and severely harm the lives and future of Palestinians. Philemon Yang, president of the General Assembly which established UNRWA in 1949, said Israel’s legislation, which takes effect in 90 days, 'constitutes an intolerable affront to the authority of this assembly, an affront to international law and, most importantly, an affront to the human dignity of innocent Palestinian civilians.' He warned that dismantling UNRWA will also undermine the pursuit of a lasting solution to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict and constitute 'an attack on the foundations of a two-state solution.' Yang said the assembly extended UNRWA’s mandate in December 2022 by an overwhelming majority until June 30, 2026, and urgently called on Israel to comply with its international legal obligations, the U.N. Charter and U.N. resolutions. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon reiterated Israeli accusations that UNRWA is riddled with supporters of Hamas which masterminded the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in southern Israel and fosters terrorism and claimed it is not the backbone of humanitarian operations in Gaza and must be eliminated. Sitting next to released Israeli hostage Mia Schem in the assembly chamber, Danon strongly criticized the General Assembly and all other U.N. bodies for failing to condemn Hamas or to hold a single session dedicated to the hostages. Israeli strikes kill at least 11 people in northern Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say Israeli strikes have killed at least 11 people in the northern Gaza Strip. A strike hit a house in the northern town of Beit Lahiya, killing at least six people from the same family, according to the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service. The dead include a mother and her three children, as well as the children’s grandmother and uncle, according to a list provided by the service. In the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya, al-Awda Hospital said it received the bodies of five men killed in an Israeli strike. The military says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. Israel has been waging a major offensive over the past month in northern Gaza, the most heavily destroyed and isolated part of the territory, where it says Hamas has regrouped. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands driven from their homes. Attack in the West Bank leaves 2 lightly wounded JERUSALEM — Israeli authorities say two people were lightly wounded in a car-ramming and stabbing attack in the West Bank on Wednesday. The military said the attacker was killed. Palestinians have carried out scores of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis in recent years, and tensions have spiked across the region since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. Israel has carried out near-daily military raids in the West Bank that have killed hundreds of Palestinians. Most appear to have been militants killed in gunbattle, but the dead also include people killed during violent protests as well as civilian bystanders. Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want both territories to be part of their future state. Hezbollah leader says group is not concerned with results of US election BEIRUT — Hezbollah’s leader Naim Kassem said in a speech aired Wednesday the Lebanese militant group 'is not basing its expectations on the results of the American elections.' 'We will make the enemy seek to demand an end to the aggression,' Kassem said, speaking from an undisclosed location in a pre-recorded televised address. 'Our military capabilities are available for a long time, and we do not rely on the results of the American elections.' His speech marked the 40-day mourning period since former Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated in Beirut. 'Whether Harris wins or Trump wins, they have no value to us,' Kassem said. He said that Hezbollah is open for cease-fire negotiations only once 'the enemy stops its aggression.' 'The only thing that will stop the war is the battlefield,' he said. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein visited Israel nearly a week ago, raising hopes for an imminent cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel. However, he immediately returned to the U.S. without traveling to Lebanon, which many saw as a sign of a setback. As Kassem spoke, the Israeli army issued evacuation warnings for three buildings in Burj al-Barajneh, a district in Beirut’s southern suburbs with a strong Hezbollah presence. Since the hostilities escalation, the suburb has faced repeated Israeli strikes, which have leveled hundreds of buildings. Hezbollah rockets target Israel, reaching as far as Tel Aviv and central city of Raanana JERUSALEM — Sirens blared across northern and central Israel on Wednesday, including in the populous metropolitan area of Tel Aviv, as Hezbollah launched 10 rockets towards Israel. Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue services said there were no reports of injuries. A large portion of a rocket slammed into a parked car in the central Israeli city of Raanana. Rockets also struck an open area near Israel’s main airport, Israeli media reported, though the airport said flights were operating as normally. Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue services said there were no injuries. Israeli police said they arrested 40 people during protests on Tuesday night when the demonstrators blocked Israel’s main highway in Tel Aviv. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah continues to send dozens of rockets and drones towards Israel. The projectiles have killed 72 people in Israel so far, including 30 soldiers, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. 30 bodies are pulled from the rubble of a Lebanon apartment building struck by Israel BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Civil Defense service said Wednesday they have pulled 30 bodies and remains out of the rubble of an apartment building in the town of Barja that Israel struck the night before. Search efforts were ongoing. The airstrike Tuesday hit an area that had not been regularly targeted by Israeli military operations. It came without warning. There was no statement from the Israeli military on the strike, and it was not immediately clear what the intended target was. Civil defense official Mostafa Danaj said it was unclear how many survivors or bodies were still trapped under the rubble. 'We hope that there isn’t anyone else, but the neighbors have said that there are still people (missing),' he said. Israeli forces and the Hezbollah militant group have been clashing for more than a year, since Hezbollah started firing rockets across the border on Oct. 8, 2023 — a day after the deadly Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel sparked the war in Gaza. The war on the Lebanese front has substantially escalated since mid-September, with Israel launching a massive aerial bombardment of much of Lebanon and a ground invasion. More than 3,000 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon, the vast majority of them since Sept. 23. Israel has said it targets Hezbollah militants and weapons caches, but hundreds of civilians have also been killed. ___ For more Middle East news:	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-rescue-workers-pull-30-bodies-from-apartments-in-lebanon-after-israeli-strike/	2024-11-06T10:10:55-08:00	
Trump promises to bring lasting peace to a tumultuous Middle East...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Donald Trump will return to the U.S. presidency at a time of unprecedented conflict and uncertainty in the Middle East. He has vowed to fix it. But Trump's history of strong support for Israel coupled with his insistence during the campaign that the war in Gaza should end quickly, the isolationist forces in the Republican party and his penchant for unpredictability raise a mountain of questions over how his second presidency will affect the region at this pivotal moment. Barring the achievement of elusive cease-fires before the inauguration, Trump will ascend to the highest office in the country as a brutal war in Gaza still rages and Israel presses its offensive against the Lebanese Hezbollah militant group. A conflagration between Iran and Israel shows no signs of abating — nor do Israel’s conflicts with Iranian proxies in Iraq and Yemen — and Iran’s nuclear program remains a top concern for Israel. Trump says he wants peace, but how? Throughout his campaign, Trump has vowed to bring peace to the region. 'Get it over with and let’s get back to peace and stop killing people,' Trump said of the conflict in Gaza in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in April. Israel launched the war in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, when militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250, with dozens still in Gaza. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 43,000 people, according to Gaza health officials, whose count does not distinguish between civilians and fighters, though they say more than half of the dead are women and children. The war has ignited a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, driven Israel into increasing international isolation, with two world courts examining charges of war crimes, and has sparked a wave of protests on American campuses that have fueled debate over the U.S. role as Israel's key military and diplomatic supporter. International mediators from the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have tried unsuccessfully to bring about a lasting cease-fire. Yet Trump has repeatedly urged to Israel 'finish the job' and destroy Hamas — but hasn’t said how. 'Does finish the job mean you have a free hand to act in dealing with the remnants of Hamas? Or does finish the job mean the war has to come to an end now?' asked David Makovsky, director of the program on Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'That’s part of the enigmas here.' Netanyahu is pinning his hopes on a pro-Israel Trump administration Uncertainty also shrouds how Trump will engage with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During his first term, Trump offered broad support for the Israeli leader’s hard-line policies, including unilaterally withdrawing from a deal meant to rein in Iran’s nuclear program that Netanyahu long opposed. Trump also recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, bolstering its claim over the disputed city, and Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. He presented a peace plan with the Palestinians widely seen as favoring Israel. Settlement-building in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, seen as an obstacle to Palestinian statehood, surged under his presidency. Trump also helped secure agreements between Israel and four Arab countries to normalize ties that were not contingent on progress toward Palestinian statehood — a major victory for Netanyahu. The Israeli leader hopes to replicate those successes with a deal with Saudi Arabia. The leaders had a falling out after Netanyahu congratulated President Joe Biden following the 2020 elections — a move Trump viewed as a slight from his loyal ally, though Netanyahu visited Trump in Florida this year. Under Biden, the U.S. has been critical at times and slowed some weapons deliveries in response to Israel's conduct in Gaza. Netanyahu is likely hoping that Trump's return will loosen any restraints on Israel to pursue its war goals. The American leader could also work to challenge a potential international war crimes arrest warrant for Netanyahu. And a smoother relationship with Washington could help improve the Israeli leader's own popular support. 'He has the most pro-Israel record of any president,' said Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington. 'The hope is here that there’ll be more of the same.' Neither Netanyahu nor Trump has a clear vision for postwar Gaza Netanyahu leads a far-right government whose key members have vowed to topple his rule if the war in Gaza ends with anything short of Hamas' destruction. They support resettling Gaza and are enthusiastic about a Trump presidency — and their influence will only grow now that Netanyahu has fired his defense minister over his more pragmatic approach to the conflict. Their grip on the government and over Netanyahu’s political future helps explain why Netanyahu has not spelled out a clear vision for a postwar Gaza. The Biden administration has favored having the war-ravaged territory governed by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank. Netanyahu has rejected that idea and insists on the right for the Israeli military to operate there. Trump has not outlined a clear vision, although he has said developers could make Gaza 'better than Monaco' because it has 'the best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything.' Diana Buttu, a former adviser to Palestinian leaders, said a lack of a firm U.S. vision for Gaza, coupled with a politically powerful Israeli far right, made the future for people in Gaza and for Palestinians in general grim. 'I don’t see this as a president who is going to care about Palestinians,' she said. Will Trump help defend Israel against Iran or choose America first? In Lebanon, Israel is battling the Iranian-backed Hezbollah with both a ground invasion and strikes on Hezbollah targets. The militant group has fired thousands of rockets and drones at Israeli communities, killing dozens and displacing 60,000. Israel’s offensive, meanwhile, has displaced over 1 million people in Lebanon and killed more than 3,000. U.S. mediation efforts there too have been fruitless. Trump, who has a Lebanese-American son-in-law, recently posted on the social platform X that as president he would 'stop the suffering and destruction in Lebanon.' But a key question is how much Trump will be swayed by his America First instincts. The U.S. has played a central role in diplomatic efforts throughout the war, and an even more robust role in helping Israel defend itself against Iran and its allies. The U.S. has sent military assets to the region, helped Israel thwart two missile attacks by Iran and even has U.S. soldiers in Israel to operate a sophisticated air defense system. But any effective Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, a target it avoided in its strike last month, will likely need greater U.S. military involvement. Accusations that Iran has hacked campaign associates and concerns about the potential for Tehran to carry out violence against Trump or members of his administration could deepen his antipathy toward the country. While Trump has indicated he will focus on domestic affairs, the Mideast could be an outlier. He enjoys a wide base of support from evangelical Christians, who are staunchly pro-Israel, and his son-in-law and former adviser Jared Kushner was a prominent voice in support of the country in his first administration. 'As Trump is likely to navigate between those forces mostly based on his intuition,' said Udi Sommer, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Tel Aviv University, 'uncertainty will likely define his approach.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-trump-promises-to-bring-lasting-peace-to-a-tumultuous-middle-east-but-fixing-it-wont-be-easy/	2024-11-06T07:13:42-08:00	
On Ukraine's front and in Kyiv, hope and pragmatism compete when ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Soldiers in a Ukrainian artillery battery on the front lines of the country’s east were only vaguely aware of American election results pointing to Donald Trump’s victory Wednesday — but firm in their hopes for the next president of the United States. Their entrenched artillery battery fires on Russian forces daily — and takes fire nearly as often. Just the other day, one of their overhead nets snared a Russian drone. 'I hope that the quantity of weapons, the quantity of guns for our victory will increase,' the unit's 39-year-old commander, who goes by the name Mozart, said in the hours before Trump’s win was confirmed. 'We don't care who is the president, as long as they don't cut us off from help, because we need it.' Though Trump's election throws into doubt American support for Ukraine — and ultimately whether Kyiv can beat back Russia's invasion — the soldiers who use their Starlink connection to the internet sparingly learned of the results from Associated Press journalists. Mozart — who like other soldiers Wednesday did not give his name in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol and has given musical monikers to the battlefield positions — is among many Ukrainians who hope that Trump will hold the line on American support for their country. Russian forces have recently made gains in the east, although the commander described the front-line situation as 'static.' It was under Trump that the United States first sent weapons to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, in 2017. Those Javelin anti-tank missiles were crucial to Ukraine's ability to fend off the full-scale invasion in 2022. But Trump overall is wary of U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts. Trump, who has touted his good relationship with President Vladimir Putin and called the Russian leader 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized American backing of Ukraine. He characterized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for winning U.S. aid. Zelenskyy was among the first world leaders to publicly congratulate Trump and said the two discussed how to end 'Russian aggression against Ukraine' when they met in September. 'I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together,' he wrote on the social platform X. Trump has said repeatedly he would have a peace deal done between Ukraine and Russia within a day if elected, although he has not said how. During his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, he twice refused to directly answer a question about whether he wanted Ukraine to win — raising concerns that Kyiv would be forced to accept unfavorable terms in any negotiations he oversaw. In Kyiv, which comes under attack from Russian drones near daily, 18-year-old Viktoriia Zubrytska was pragmatic about her expectations for the next American president. She thinks Ukraine will be forced to give up territory in exchange for peace under a Trump presidency. But she said she preferred that to what she called the false hope that the Biden administration offered. 'We will live in a world of facts where we will be certain on what awaits us,' said the law student. 'Certainty and objective truth is much better than lies and life in illusions.' According to VoteCast, 74% of voters who supported Harris favored continuing aid to Ukraine, while only 36% of Trump’s voters did. AP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. On the front lines in Ukraine's eastern Kharkiv region, Andriy, who goes by 'Rodych' or 'Relative,' was resigned to the fact that he has no power to influence the American vote. 'We will come up with something' whatever happens, he said. 'We are a shield between Europe and Russia,' he added. 'Other countries do not understand what is happening here, they see it on TV and for them it is far away.' America's NATO allies were also closely watching the election. France and Germany arranged a last-minute, top-level defense meeting Wednesday in Paris to discuss the results, and Ukraine is likely to be central to the meeting. The two leading powers in the European Union provide significant support to Ukraine to defend it against Russia’s war. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, citing a 'more aggressive Russia,' also invoked Trump's motto of 'peace through strength.' Rutte praised Trump for his work during his first term to persuade countries in the alliance to ramp up defense spending. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had no information on whether Putin plans to congratulate Trump but emphasized that Moscow views the U.S. as an 'unfriendly' country. Peskov reaffirmed the Kremlin’s claim that the U.S. support for Ukraine amounted to its involvement in the conflict, telling reporters: 'Let’s not forget that we are talking about, the unfriendly country that is both directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state.' Still, he noted Trump's promise to end the war swiftly once elected. 'The U.S. can help end the conflict,' Peskov said, adding that 'it certainly can’t be done overnight.' ___ Konovalov reported from the Kharkiv region.

Russia ratifies North Korea pact after US says up to 10,000 North...	MOSCOW (AP) — The upper house of Russian parliament on Wednesday ratified a treaty with North Korea envisioning mutual military assistance, a move that comes as the U.S. has confirmed the deployment of 10,000 North Korean troops to Russia. The 'comprehensive strategic partnership treaty,' which Russian President Vladimir Putin signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on a visit to Pyongyang in June, obliges Russia and North Korea to immediately provide military assistance using 'all means' if either is attacked. It marked the strongest link between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War. The pact's endorsement by the upper house, the Federation Council, follows its ratification by the lower house, the State Duma, on Oct. 24. On Monday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that up to 10,000 North Korean soldiers were in Russia’s Kursk region and were preparing to join Moscow’s fight against Ukraine in the coming days. If they engage in combat, it would be North Korea’s first participation in a large-scale conflict since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Moscow and Pyongyang have responded vaguely to South Korean and Western claims of the North Korean troop deployment to Russia, emphasizing that their military cooperation conforms with international law, without directly admitting the presence of the North’s forces in Russia. On Monday, Putin met with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, who was on an official visit to Russia since late last week. During her talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Choe reiterated Pyongyang’s support 'for the just fight of Russia’s military and people to defend their country’s sovereign rights and security interests' in Ukraine. Russia and North Korea have previously rejected assertions by the U.S. and its allies that Pyongyang has given Moscow ballistic missiles and millions of artillery shells for use in Ukraine. South Korean and Western officials voiced concerns about Russia’s possible transfer of technology to North Korea to enhance its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for its troops. On Tuesday, North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea in a demonstration of its military capability hours before the U.S. presidential election.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-ratifies-north-korea-pact-after-us-says-up-to-10000-north-korean-troops-deployed-to-kursk/	2024-11-06T01:26:22-08:00	
Israel's Netanyahu dismisses his defense minister as wars rage. P...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday dismissed his popular defense minister, Yoav Gallant, in a surprise announcement that came as the country is embroiled in wars on multiple fronts across the region. The move sparked protests across the country, including a mass gathering that paralyzed central Tel Aviv. Netanyahu and Gallant have repeatedly been at odds over the war in Gaza. But Netanyahu had avoided firing his rival before taking the step as the world's attention was focused on the U.S. presidential election. Netanyahu cited 'significant gaps' and a 'crisis of trust' in his Tuesday evening announcement as he replaced Gallant with a longtime loyalist. 'In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and defense minister,' Netanyahu said. 'Unfortunately, although in the first months of the campaign there was such trust and there was very fruitful work, during the last months this trust cracked between me and the defense minister.' In the early days of the war, Israel's leadership presented a unified front as it responded to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. But as the war has dragged on and spread to Lebanon, key policy differences have emerged. While Netanyahu has called for continued military pressure on Hamas, Gallant had taken a more pragmatic approach, saying that military force has created the necessary conditions for at least a temporary diplomatic deal that could bring home hostages held by the militant group. In a late-night news conference broadcast on national TV, Gallant said that he had disagreed with Netanyahu over three main issues: the need to end controversial exemptions from the military draft for ultra-Orthodox men, the urgent need for a hostage deal and the need to establish an official commission of inquiry into the political and security failures of Oct. 7, when Hamas militants stormed into Israel and killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel estimates that about 100 hostages remain in captivity, only about 65 of them still alive. With military service compulsory for most Jews, Gallant said that drafting the ultra-Orthodox was both an issue of fairness and security at a time when Israel faces so many challenges. He said a hostage deal was needed 'as quickly as possible, when they are still alive' and said there will be 'no forgiveness' for neglecting them. And he said a full investigation into the events of Oct. 7 was the only way to ensure the government would learn the proper lessons. Netanyahu has rejected calls for an inquiry, saying it should only take place when the war is over. Gallant ended his statement by honoring the soldiers serving in the army and those who have died in the wars. He held up his hand and saluted as he walked away from the podium. Many of the families of the hostages, along with tens of thousands of people who have joined anti-government protests, accuse Netanyahu of scuttling a deal in order to maintain his hold on power. Netanyahu's hard-line partners have threatened to bring down the government if he makes concessions to Hamas, raising the risk of early elections at a time when the prime minister's popularity is low. This week, authorities announced the arrest of a Netanyahu aide on suspicion of leaking classified information to foreign media that gave the prime minister political cover as hostage talks fell apart. 'Firing Gallant in the middle of a war is an act of madness,' opposition leader Yair Lapid said on X. 'Netanyahu is selling Israel’s security and the Israeli army soldiers for a disgraceful political survival.' Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, whose largely ceremonial office is meant to help unify the country, called the dismissal 'the last thing Israel needs.' The grassroots forum representing hostage families said Gallant’s dismissal is 'a direct continuation of the ‘efforts’ to torpedo the abductee deal.' Within hours, thousands of protesters gathered in central Tel Aviv, blocking the city's main highway and crippling traffic. The crowd, many holding blue and white Israeli flags and others blowing whistles and pounding drums, gathered around multiple bonfires. Several thousand people demonstrated outside Netanyahu's home in Jerusalem and elsewhere in the city. Protesters gathered and blocked roads in several other spots across the country, and Israeli TV stations showed images of police scuffling with protesters. The dismissal comes at a delicate time. Israeli troops remain bogged down in Gaza, over a year after invading the territory in a war that has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, including tens of thousands of civilians, and caused widespread destruction, while Israeli ground troops are pressing ahead with a month-old ground invasion against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting. Israel also has clashed with Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and is facing the possibility of another strike by Iran. Iran has vowed to avenge an Israeli strike that came in response to an Oct. 1 Iranian missile attack, itself a reprisal for earlier Israeli attacks on Iranian-linked targets. On Monday, Gallant announced he had sent out thousands of draft notices to young ultra-Orthodox men. The system of exemptions for religious men has bred widespread resentment among the secular majority, and Israel's Supreme Court has ordered the government to scrap the system. Netanyahu, whose governing coalition depends on ultra-Orthodox parties, has not yet implemented the order. Channel 13 TV said Netanyahu had also taken advantage of the U.S. election, when American attention is focused elsewhere, to dismiss his rival. The White House on Tuesday declined to comment on the firing but called Gallant 'an important partner on all matters related to the defense of Israel.' 'As close partners, we will continue to work collaboratively with Israel’s next minister of defense,' the White House National Security Council said. Gallant, a former general with a gruff, no-nonsense demeanor, has emerged as the most popular figure with the public in Israel's wartime government. Gallant has worn a simple, black buttoned shirt throughout the war in a sign of sorrow over the Oct. 7 attack and developed a strong relationship with his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. A previous attempt by Netanyahu to fire Gallant in March 2023 sparked widespread street protests against Netanyahu. He also flirted with the idea of dismissing Gallant over the summer but held off until Tuesday's announcement. Israel Katz, his replacement, currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. Katz thanked Netanyahu and pledged to lead the security establishment to victory in the wars against Israel’s enemies. Katz, 69, was a junior officer in the military decades ago and has little military experience, though he has been a key member of Netanyahu's Security Cabinet over the years. Gideon Saar, a former Netanyahu rival who rejoined the government in September, will take the foreign affairs post. Netanyahu has a long history of neutralizing his rivals. In his statement, he claimed he had made 'many attempts' to bridge the gaps with Gallant. 'But they kept getting wider,' he said. 'Our enemies enjoyed it and derived a lot of benefit from it.' ___ Associated Press writers Eleanor H.

Officials say Ukraine has fired on North Korean troops	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) -- Officials confirm Ukraine has fired on North Korean troops for the first time since thousands of them joined Russia in its war. Ukrainian officials said the North Korean soldiers are wearing Russian uniforms and training on drones, but U.S. officials are still investigating the developments. 'We're looking into those,' said Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder. Ryder did confirm more North Korean troops are stationed at the Russia-Ukraine border. 'Placing these additional, you know, ten to 11 to 12,000 forces in Kursk is definitely something from a combat capability standpoint that could be significant,' he said. Ryder reiterated what it would mean if North Korean troops fought Ukrainians. 'They would become legitimate military targets,' he said. That's the unified message coming out of Washington, including from the U.S. State Department. 'We continue to be greatly concerned about the partnership between North Korea and Russia,' said State Spokesperson Matthew Miller. Last week, top Russian and North Korean diplomats met in Moscow, some with President Vladimir Putin. North Korea also test fired a long-range missile designed to reach the U.S., but officials said it didn't have that capability. Meanwhile, the U.S. and South Korea conducted their first-ever joint live-fire exercise using drones.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/officials-say-ukraine-has-fired-on-north-korean-troops/	2024-11-05T13:56:24-08:00	
US Army soldier dies after being injured while working on the Gaz...	WASHINGTON (AP) — A U.S. Army soldier who was injured in May while working on the American-built pier to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza has died. Sgt. Quandarius Stanley, 23, was a motor transport operator and was critically injured when high winds and heavy seas damaged the pier, causing four Army vessels to become beached. Two other service members also were injured but later returned to duty. U.S. military officials have not provided details on how exactly Stanley was injured but have noted it was not in combat. He died last Thursday and had been assigned to the 7th Transportation Brigade Expeditionary at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia. This image provided by the U.S. Army shows Sgt. Quandarius Stanley, 23. Stanley, assigned to the 7th Transportation Brigade Expeditionary, at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, who was injured in May while working on the pier built to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, has died. (U.S. Army via AP) 'Sgt. Quandarius Stanley was an instrumental and well respected first-line leader in the 7th Transportation Brigade Expeditionary (TBX), especially during the mission to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. We will continue to provide support to his family during this difficult time,' said Col. John 'Eddie' Gray, brigade commander. 'Our entire unit mourns alongside his family.' Capt. Shkeila Milford-Glover, a spokesperson for the 3rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command, said Stanley had recently been retired and was receiving treatment in a long-term care medical center. The massive pier project was hampered by unexpected bad weather and security issues, as well as persistent safety issues involving Israeli forces that prompted aid agencies to halt distribution of the supplies out of fear of being injured and killed. The Defense Department formally pulled the pier from the Gaza shore on June 28 and declared an end in mid-July to the mission to bring aid into the territory besieged by the war between Israel and Hamas. All together, the military moved nearly 20 million pounds of aid onto the Gaza shore in what officials said was the 'largest volume of humanitarian assistance' ever delivered into the Middle East. But aid agencies had difficulty moving the food brought ashore to areas further into Gaza where it was needed most because humanitarian convoys came under attack.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/us-army-soldier-dies-after-being-injured-while-working-on-the-gaza-pier-project/	2024-11-05T11:26:21-08:00	
Middle East latest: Dozens killed in Gaza as Israel says it targe...	Israeli strikes killed at least 30 people in Gaza, including on a home where displaced families were sheltering, according to Palestinian health officials. Ten people were killed early Tuesday, including four children and two women, and a strike late Monday on the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya killed at least 20 people, including eight women and six children, health officials said. The Israeli military said it targeted a weapons storage facility from which a militant had operated, and that 'numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.' Israel has been waging a massive offensive in northern Gaza — which was already the most isolated and heavily destroyed part of the territory — for nearly a month. Despite growing pressure from the United States and others in the international community for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon, intensified Israeli strikes against the Hezbollah militant group are expanding beyond Lebanon’s border areas. Israel is also fighting a seemingly endless war against Hamas in northern Gaza. Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in 2023, at least 3,000 people have been killed and some 13,500 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reports. More than a year of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: WHO working to arrange medical evacuation from Gaza GENEVA — The World Health Organization says it’s working to arrange medical evacuations for more than 100 people from Gaza on Wednesday, which would be the largest such operation of its kind in six months. Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territories, said the U.N. health agency was helping coordinate the evacuations through the Kerem Shalom crossing based on a list of priority candidates drawn up by the Health Ministry in Gaza. Speaking by video from Gaza to reporters in Geneva, Peeperkorn said medical evacuations have been arranged for 282 people since Israeli forces forced the closure of the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt on May 6. Before the Rafah closure, nearly 4,700 people were ferried out of Gaza in medical evacuations since the Oct. 7 attacks last year, he said. The largest one since May involved 97 people who were evacuated on Sept. 11. Thousands of people remain on waiting lists to get out. WHO said people with chronic conditions like cancer as patients from trauma cases – injuries -- were among those to be evacuated. Peeperkorn said most would be taken to the United Arab Emirates for further care, while about 30 were to go to Romania. (edited) Iran’s top diplomat says Tehran would respond to Israel’s strike in a ‘measured’ way ISLAMABAD — Iran’s foreign minister on Tuesday reiterated that his country does not seek an escalation in the Middle East but reserved the right to defend itself against Israel’s attack with a 'measured and calculative' response. Iranian officials are increasingly threatening to launch yet another strike against Israel after its Oct. 26 attack on the Islamic Republic that targeted military bases and other locations and killed at least five people. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking at a news conference during a visit to Pakistan, said that 'unlike the Israeli regime, the Islamic Republic of Iran does not seek escalation.' 'We reserve our inherent rights to legitimate defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter and we will certainly respond to the Israeli aggression in a proper time and in a proper manner in a very measured and very calculated manner,' he said. Araghchi met with Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who called for an urgent cease-fire to de-escalate tensions in the region. The Lebanese Red Cross will try again to remove bodies from a strike site BEIRUT — The Lebanese Red Cross will send another convoy Tuesday to Wata al-Khiam in southern Lebanon to search for and remove the bodies of 15 people killed in an Israeli airstrike, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said. Paramedics accessed the site of the strike two days prior and removed five other bodies, but needed to return with larger vehicles to remove the rubble. The NNA said the deployment is in coordination with the United Nations peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, which is the usual procedure. The Red Cross did not immediately comment on the news, but expressed concern in recent weeks over several instances where Israel has struck in or close to areas where they have deployed paramedics to search for wounded people and casualties. The Israeli military said it issued warnings to the residents there in late October to evacuate ahead of strikes on Hezbollah militant targets, and told ambulances to avoid the area. Israeli airstrike kills 20 people in northern Gaza, Palestinians officials say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli airstrike in the northern Gaza Strip has killed at least 20 people, mostly women and children. Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of a nearby hospital that received the casualties, said the strike late Monday hit a home in the town of Beit Lahiya where multiple families were sheltering. The dead included eight women and six children, according to a list provided by the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service. The Israeli military said it targeted a weapons storage facility from which a militant had operated, and that 'numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.' Israel has been waging a massive offensive in northern Gaza — which was already the most isolated and heavily destroyed part of the territory — for nearly a month. It ordered the complete evacuation of Beit Lahiya, the nearby town of Beit Hanoun, and the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, and has allowed almost no humanitarian aid into the area for over a month. Tens of thousands of people have fled to nearby Gaza City in the latest wave of displacement in the war, which began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Israeli strikes kill 10 in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian officials say Israeli strikes early Tuesday killed 10 people in the Gaza Strip, including four children and two women. One strike hit a house in the Tufah neighborhood in Gaza City, killing two children and their parents, according to the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service. Two other children were wounded, it said. In the central town of Zuweida, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent where a displaced family was sheltering, killing four people, including a mother and her two children, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah. Another strike hit a house in Deir al-Balah, killing two people, the hospital said. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses them of hiding among civilians. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 hostage. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which says over half were women and children. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israeli forces kill 4 people in the occupied West Bank RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian officials say Israeli forces have killed four people in the occupied West Bank. Two were killed in an airstrike early Tuesday near the northern city of Jenin, a flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian violence in recent years. Two other people were fatally shot in the village of Tamoun, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The Israeli military said it called in an airstrike on a militant cell near Jenin. It also said it killed two armed militants in an airstrike in the Tamoun area. Israeli forces have carried out near-daily military raids in the West Bank since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack out of the Gaza Strip triggered the Israel-Hamas war. The Health Ministry says at least 767 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since then. Most appear to have been militants killed in battles with Israeli forces, but the dead also include civilian bystanders and people killed during protests. Israel says the raids are aimed at dismantling Hamas in the West Bank and preventing attacks. Palestinians have carried out dozens of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis since the start of the war. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-strikes-kill-10-people-in-gaza-and-2-in-the-west-bank/	2024-11-05T05:12:50-08:00	
Federal agencies say Russia and Iran are ramping up influence cam...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation’s federal law enforcement and election security agencies debunked two new examples of Russian election disinformation on the eve of Election Day, highlighting attempts by foreign actors to sow doubt in the U.S. voting process and warning that the efforts run the risk of inciting violence against election officials. In a joint statement late Monday, federal officials pointed to a recent article posted by Russian actors falsely claiming that U.S. officials across presidential swing states were orchestrating a plan to commit fraud, as well as a video that falsely depicted an interview with an individual claiming election fraud in Arizona. U.S. intelligence reveals that Russia-linked influence actors 'are manufacturing videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences,' read the statement issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. 'These efforts risk inciting violence, including against election officials.' The Russian Embassy called the officials' announcement 'baseless' in an emailed statement, saying Russia 'has not interfered and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, including the United States.' Federal officials warned that Russia would likely release additional 'manufactured content' on Election Day and posed 'the most active threat' when it comes to foreign election influence. The statement also noted that Iran remains a 'significant foreign influence threat to U.S. elections.' The effort described by federal officials is part of a wide-ranging influence operation by Russia designed to undermine confidence in the electoral process and sow discord among American voters. Intelligence agencies have assessed that Russia, which also interfered on Donald Trump’s behalf in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, again prefers the Republican nominee and is likely to persist in its influence operations well after Election Day. Besides manufactured videos intended to promote disinformation, U.S. officials also have accused Russian state media of a covert, multimillion-dollar operation to spread pro-Russia content to American audiences and have seized dozens of internet domains they said fostered propaganda. In their statement, officials also drew fresh attention to Iran’s attempts to interfere in the election, which include a hack-and-leak operation designed to harm Trump’s candidacy. The Justice Department in September charged three Iranian hackers in that effort. Iranian actors also have created fake news sites and impersonated activists online in attempts to sway voters, according to analysts at Microsoft. The tech giant said last month that Iranian actors who allegedly sent emails aimed at intimidating U.S. voters in 2020 have been surveying election-related websites and major media outlets, raising concerns they could be preparing for another scheme this year. As large tech firms and intelligence officials have called out foreign interference this election cycle, Russia, China and Iran have rejected claims that they are seeking to meddle with the U.S. election. The Arizona video promoted on social media by Russian actors on Monday purported to show an anonymous whistleblower revealing an election fraud scheme. Federal officials said the Arizona Secretary of State’s office had already refuted the content of the video. Earlier this week, U.S. officials confirmed that a video claiming to show voter fraud in two left-leaning counties in Georgia was fake and the product of a Russian troll farm. And last month, they attributed to Russia another fake video of a person tearing up ballots in what appeared to be Bucks County, Pennsylvania. ___ Associated Press writer Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

North Korean troops in Russia are shelled by Ukrainian forces, an...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — North Korean troops recently deployed to help Russia in its war with Ukraine have come under Ukrainian fire, a Kyiv official said Tuesday. It is the first time a Ukrainian official has said that Pyongyang’s units were struck, following a deployment that has given the war a new complexion as it approaches its 1,000-day milestone. 'The first North Korean troops have already been shelled, in the Kursk region,' Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation branch of Ukraine’s Security Council, wrote on Telegram. He provided no further details. Western governments had expected that the North Korean soldiers would be sent to Russia’s Kursk border region, where a 3-month-old incursion by the Ukrainian army is the first occupation of Russian territory since World War II and has embarrassed the Kremlin. U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments say up to 12,000 North Korean combat troops are being sent by Pyongyang to the war under a pact with Moscow. The North Korean troops, whose fighting quality and battle experience is unknown, are adding to Ukraine’s worsening situation on the battlefield. Ukrainian defenses, especially in the eastern Donetsk region, are buckling under the strain of Russia’s costly but relentless monthslong onslaught. Russian advances have recently accelerated, with battlefield gains of up to 9 kilometers (more than 5 miles) in some parts of Donetsk, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Tuesday on the social platform X. It said Russia has superior troop numbers, and despite heavy casualties the Kremlin’s recruitment drive is providing enough new troops to keep up the pressure. Russia has held the battlefield initiative in Ukraine for the past year. Ukrainian officials have long complained that Western military support takes too long to arrive in the country. In early October, Russian forces drove Ukrainian troops out of Vuhledar, a town perched atop a tactically significant hill in eastern Ukraine. It was part of a key belt of Ukrainian defenses in the east. Russia’s next targets likely are the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk and the strategically important city of Chasiv Yar. In the meantime, Russia has kept up its long-range aerial attacks on civilian areas of Ukraine, authorities say. A Tuesday morning attack on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia killed six people and injured 16 others, regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov said. The head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andrii Yermak, said the Russian attacks 'must be stopped with strong action.' 'A stronger position by (Ukraine’s Western) allies is needed,' he wrote on Telegram. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-north-korean-troops-in-russia-are-shelled-by-ukrainian-forces-an-official-says/	2024-11-05T03:29:42-08:00	
US gives Israel a 'fail' grade on improving aid to Gaza so far	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is stepping up criticism of Israel for not doing enough to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza as a 30-day deadline looms for Israeli officials to meet certain requirements or risk potential restrictions on military assistance. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller on Monday gave Israel a 'fail' grade in terms of meeting the conditions for an improvement in aid deliveries to Gaza laid out in a letter last month to senior Israeli officials from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. He said there were still roughly nine days until the deadline expires, but that limited progress so far has been insufficient. 'As of today, the situation has not significantly turned around,' Miller told reporters. 'We have seen an increase in some measurements. But if you look at the stipulated recommendations in the letter — those have not been met.' A day before the U.S. election, the Biden administration called out its close ally, with support for Israel a key issue for many voters and the humanitarian crisis for Palestinians also a factor for many in the race. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have been competing for Muslim and Arab American voters and Jewish voters in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. Among other conditions, Austin and Blinken's letter from mid-October said that Israel must allow in a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying desperately needed food and other supplies for Palestinians besieged by more than a year of war between Israel and Hamas. By the end of October, an average of just 71 trucks a day were entering Gaza, according to the latest U.N. figures. 'The results are not good enough today,' Miller said. 'They certainly do not have a pass. … They have failed to implement all the things that that we recommended. Now, that said, we are not at the end of the 30-day period.' He would not say when asked what the U.S. would do when the deadline comes up next week, just that 'we will follow the law.' Blinken spoke Monday with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, urging additional steps to 'substantially increase and sustain humanitarian aid' to civilians in Gaza, according to a State Department readout of their call. Similarly, Austin has been reinforcing 'how important it is to ensure that humanitarian assistance can flow and flow faster into Gaza' in calls with Gallant, said Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary. The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, known as COGAT, said it had evacuated 72 patients from hospitals in northern Gaza to other medical facilities Monday and had brought medical supplies as well as fuel, food, water and units of blood. The head of UNICEF, the U.N. agency for children, said over the weekend that 'the entire Palestinian population in North Gaza, especially children, is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine, and the ongoing bombardments.' Miller also said the U.S. is looking into a decision by the Israeli government to end an agreement facilitating the work of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, which is the main aid provider in Gaza. It followed the passage of Israeli laws last week to sever ties with UNRWA, a move that Blinken and Austin opposed in their letter. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday that it has notified the U.N. of the cancellation of an agreement dating back to 1967 that facilitates UNRWA’s work. It said UNRWA 'is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip and not part of the solution.' Israel alleges that UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas, which the agency denies and says it takes measures to ensure its neutrality. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated that UNRWA is essential and there is no alternative to its work in the Palestinian territories, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. At the same time, Miller said the U.S. is 'deeply concerned' by a recent escalation in attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank, including several cars being torched overnight just a few kilometers (miles) away from the Palestinian Authority’s headquarters and attacks on Palestinians harvesting olives, their livestock and other property. 'These violent actions cause intense human suffering for Palestinians and they threaten Israel’s security,' Miller said. 'It is critical that the government of Israel deter extremist settler violence and take measures to protect all communities from harm in accordance with its international obligations.' He noted that the U.S. has since the beginning of the year imposed sanctions against Israeli groups and people implicated in violence against Palestinian civilians and warned of more to come. ___ AP reporters Ellen Knickmeyer and Lolita C.

Middle East latest: Israel ends agreement with UN agency providin...	Israel said on Monday it has terminated the agreement facilitating the work of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, the main aid provider in Gaza, in what appeared to be a step to implement legislation passed last month that would sever ties with the agency and prevent it from operating in Israel. Israel says the agency, known as UNRWA, has been infiltrated by Hamas. UNRWA denies the allegations and says it takes measures to ensure its neutrality. On Sunday, Israel said its troops had carried out a ground raid into Syria to seize a Syrian it accuses of working with Iran. It was the first time in the current war that Israel announced its troops operated in Syrian territory. Despite growing pressure from the United States and others in the international community for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon, intensified Israeli strikes against the Hezbollah militant group are expanding beyond Lebanon’s border areas. Israel is also fighting a seemingly endless war against Hamas in northern Gaza. Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted last year, at least 2,900 people have been killed and 13,150 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reports, not including Friday’s toll. Health authorities say that a quarter of those killed were women and children. More than a year of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: Ambulances can't operate in northern Gaza Strip, health ministry says DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Gaza Health Ministry says ambulances are no longer operating in the north of the enclave, where Israel has been waging a renewed offensive for nearly a month. Eyad Zaqout, a senior ministry official, told reporters Monday that 'a large number of injured people are bleeding on the roads.' The ministry also said in a statement that Israeli forces continue to bombard Kamal Adwan Hospital with strikes on Monday, injuring some staff and patients. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The Civil Defense, first responders operating under the Hamas-run government, said last week that they were no longer able to operate in the north because crews had been fired upon by Israeli forces. Israel launched its latest offensive in northern Gaza in early October, focusing on Jabaliya, a densely populated, decades-old urban refugee camp where it says Hamas had regrouped. It has also carried out strikes in nearby Beit Lahiya. Israel has ordered the entire population in northern Gaza to evacuate, and tens of thousands have fled to Gaza City in recent weeks. The three hospitals serving the northern areas are barely functioning and have been largely cut off by the fighting. Israeli forces raided one of them, saying militants were sheltering there, allegations denied by Palestinian officials. Israel has also sharply reduced the amount of aid allowed into Gaza, even after a warning from the United States that it could jeopardize American military support. Palestinian officials say Israeli settlers torched cars in Ramallah RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian officials said Israeli settlers were behind an attack in which several cars were torched overnight just a few kilometers (miles) away from the Palestinian Authority’s headquarters in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. No one was wounded in the attack overnight into Monday in Al-Bireh, a city adjacent to Ramallah, where the Western-backed Palestinian Authority is headquartered. An Associated Press reporter counted 18 burned-out cars. Settler attacks on Palestinians and their property have surged since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, which was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. But attacks in and around Ramallah, home to senior Palestinian officials and international missions, are rare. The Palestinian Authority, which administers population centers in the territory, condemned the attack. Israeli police, who handle law enforcement matters involving settlers in the West Bank, said they were investigating. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. The territory’s 3 million Palestinians live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy over less than half of the territory. Over 500,000 Jewish settlers with Israeli citizenship live in scores of settlements across the West Bank, which most of the international community considers illegal. Israel ends agreement with UN agency for Palestinian refugees TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel said Monday it had terminated the agreement facilitating the work of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, the main aid provider in Gaza. It appeared to be the first step in implementing legislation passed last month that would sever ties with the agency, which Israel says has been infiltrated by Hamas, and prevent it from operating in Israel. The agency, known as UNRWA, denies the allegations and says it takes measures to ensure its neutrality. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it had notified the U.N. of the cancellation of an agreement dating back to 1967 that facilitates UNRWA’s work. It said UNRWA 'is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip and not part of the solution.' Aid groups have warned that the legislation could severely hamper UNRWA’s work, creating further obstacles to addressing a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel has said other U.N. agencies and aid groups can fill the gap, but those organizations say UNRWA is essential. The agency provides education, health and other basic services to Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation and their descendants, who now number nearly 6 million. Refugee families make up the majority of Gaza’s population.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israel-ends-agreement-with-un-agency-providing-aid-in-gaza/	2024-11-04T06:37:14-08:00	
Germany's top diplomat is in Kyiv as Ukraine girds for impact of ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Germany’s top diplomat arrived Monday in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on an unannounced visit, in what appeared to be a show of European support for Ukraine on the eve of a U.S. presidential election that could bring far-reaching changes in Washington’s policy toward Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor. Germany is Ukraine’s second biggest weapons supplier after the U.S., and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock vowed that Berlin’s backing would remain steadfast. 'Together with many partners around the world, Germany stands firmly by Ukraine’s side,' she said, German news agency dpa reported. 'We will support the Ukrainians for as long as they need us so that they can continue on their path to a just peace.' The war is at a critical moment for Ukraine, with the Russian army making creeping gains on the battlefield and another hard winter ahead after Russia relentlessly battered the Ukrainian power grid. With his army under severe Russian pressure in the eastern Donetsk region, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that Western military aid deliveries have accelerated, including for artillery. The grinding attritional warfare being fought in Ukraine requires large amounts of ammunition, and Ukrainian officials have long grumbled that Western pledges of support take too long to arrive. Zelenskyy said Ukraine is also trying to strengthen its air defense systems. Russia is currently deploying about 10 times more Iranian-made Shahed drones than it was this time last year, he said. Ahead of the U.S. election, Zelenskyy attempted to lock Ukraine’s Western supporters into a long-term 'victory plan,' including a formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western long-range missiles to strike military targets in Russia, but the response was disappointing for Kyiv officials. Russia is using its superior numbers to heap pressure on Ukrainian positions along the front line. Ukraine’s top commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday his troops are struggling to hold back 'one of the most powerful (Russian) offensives' of the war. Russia is now adding to its offensive push what Western intelligence sources say is a force of about 10,000 North Korean combat troops sent by Pyongyang under a pact with Moscow. That has deepened Zelenskyy’s frustration with Western help. On Saturday, he urged allies to stop 'watching' and take steps before the North Korean troops reach the battlefield. Zelenskyy said Kyiv knows at which Russian camps the North Korean troops are being trained but Ukraine can’t strike them without permission from allies to use the Western-made long-range weapons to hit targets deep inside Russia. Baerbock arrived in Kyiv hours after debris from drones intercepted by air defenses fell in two districts of the city, starting small fires, officials said. No people or property were harmed, according to the head of the Kyiv city administration, Serhii Popko. A Russian glide bomb attack on Sunday night injured 15 people in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city in the northeast, regional police said. Russia fired some 80 Shahed drones at Ukrainian cities overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-germanys-top-diplomat-in-kyiv-as-ukraine-girds-for-impact-of-us-election-on-the-war/	2024-11-04T06:34:02-08:00	
Israel says it carried out ground raid into Syria, seizing a Syri...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli military said Sunday it has carried out a ground raid into Syria, seizing a Syrian citizen involved in Iranian networks. It was the first time in the current war that Israel announced its troops operated in Syrian territory. Israel has carried out airstrikes in Syria multiple times over the past year, targeting members of Lebanon’s Hezbollah and officials from Iran, the close ally of both Hezbollah and Syria. But it has not previously made public any ground forays into Syria. The Israeli military said the seizure was part of a special operation 'that took place in recent months,' though it did not say exactly when it occurred. Syria did not immediately confirm the announcement, but a pro-government Syrian radio station, Sham FM, reported Sunday that Israeli forces carried out a 'kidnapping operation' over the summer targeting a man in the south of the country. Israel has waged an escalating campaign of bombardment in Lebanon for the past six weeks, as well as a ground invasion along the countries' shared border, vowing to cripple Hezbollah. On Saturday, an Israeli military official said naval forces carried out a raid in a northern Lebanese town, seizing a man they called a senior Hezbollah operative. The army identified the man as Ali Soleiman al-Assi, saying he lives in the southern Syrian region of Saida. It said the man had been under military surveillance for many months and was involved in Iranian initiatives targeting areas of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights near the border with Syria. Body camera video of the raid released by the army showed soldiers seizing a man in a white tank top inside a building. The man was brought to Israel for interrogation, the military said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the border with Lebanon on Sunday, saying his focus was trying to keep Hezbollah from rearming itself through the 'oxygen lifeline' of Iranian weapons transferred to Lebanon via Syria. Israel says its campaign in Lebanon aims to push Hezbollah away from the border and put an end to more than a year of fire by the group into northern Israel. Israel's strikes in Lebanon have killed more than 2,500 people over the past year. In Israel, 69 people have been killed by Hezbollah projectiles. On the U.S. presidential campaign trail this weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged progressives and members of the state’s significant population of Arab Americans who are angry at the Biden administration for its continuation of the U.S. alliance with Israel as the Netanyahu government presses its war against Hamas in Gaza. 'I have been very clear that the level of death of innocent Palestinians is unconscionable,' Harris told reporters. In East Lansing, Michigan, she addressed the issue soon after beginning her remarks. 'As president I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza, to bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure Israel is secure and ensure the Palestinian people can realize their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination,' she said. Some students in East Lansing voiced their opposition Sunday with audible calls for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war. At least one attendee was escorted out after the cease-fire calls. Meanwhile, Israeli forces continued an offensive in the northern Gaza Strip, where the military has said it is battling Hamas fighters who regrouped there. Shell fire hit Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, injuring patients, including children, hospital director Hossam Abu Safiya said in a statement to the media. He said the shells hit the hospital's nursery, dormitory and water tanks just after a delegation from the World Health Organization ended a visit. Kamal Adwan and two other nearby hospitals have been hit by Israel several times during the fighting. Earlier this month, Israeli troops stormed Kamal Adwan, detaining a large number of people, including much of the staff, Abu Safiya said at the time of the raid. The military said those detained included members of Hamas, without providing evidence, and said weapons were found in the facility. But the Israel Defense Forces in a statement denied striking Kamal Adwan on Sunday, blaming 'an explosive device planted by the terrorist organizations in Gaza' for the attack. 'Attacks on civilians, including humanitarian workers, and what remains of Gaza’s civilian facilities and infrastructure must stop,' UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement Saturday. 'The entire Palestinian population in North Gaza, especially children, is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine, and the ongoing bombardments.' In southern Gaza, an Israeli strike hit a group of people gathered outside in an eastern district of Khan Younis, killing at least eight Palestinians, including four children and a woman, the territory's Health Ministry’s emergency services said. The city’s Nasser Hospital, which received most of the bodies, confirmed the figures. Palestinian officials said an Israeli drone strike on Saturday hit a clinic in northern Gaza where children were being vaccinated for polio, wounding six people including four children. The Israeli military denied responsibility. Dr. Munir al-Boursh, director general of the Gaza Health Ministry, told The Associated Press that a quadcopter struck the Sheikh Radwan clinic in Gaza City early Saturday afternoon, just a few minutes after a United Nations delegation left the facility. UNICEF and WHO, which are jointly carrying out the polio vaccination campaign, expressed concern over the reported strike. Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for UNICEF, said the strike occurred when a 'humanitarian pause' agreed to by Israel to allow vaccinations was in effect. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said that 'contrary to the claims, an initial review determined that the (Israeli military) did not strike in the area at the specified time.' It was not possible to resolve the conflicting accounts. Israeli forces have repeatedly raided hospitals in Gaza over the course of the war, saying Hamas uses them for militant purposes, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials. Hamas fighters are also operating in the north, battling Israeli forces. Northern Gaza has been encircled by Israeli forces and largely isolated for the past year. Israel has been carrying out another offensive there in recent weeks that has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands. A scaled-down campaign to administer a second dose of the polio vaccine began Saturday in parts of northern Gaza. It had been postponed from Oct. 23 due to lack of access, Israeli bombings and mass evacuation orders, and the lack of assurances for humanitarian pauses, a U.N. statement said. Administration of the first doses was carried out in September across the Gaza Strip, including the north. At least 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate from areas of north Gaza toward Gaza City in the past few weeks, but around 15,000 children under the age of 10 remain in northern towns, including Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, which are inaccessible, according to the U.N. The final phase of the polio vaccination campaign had aimed to reach an estimated 119,000 children in the north with a second dose of the oral polio vaccine, the agencies said, but 'achieving this target is now unlikely due to access constraints.' They say 90% of children in every community must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of the disease. The campaign was launched after the first polio case was reported in Gaza in 25 years — a 10-month-old boy, now paralyzed in the leg. The World Health Organization said the presence of a paralysis case indicates there could be hundreds more who have been infected but aren’t showing symptoms. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-palestinians-say-israel-struck-a-gaza-clinic-during-a-polio-campaign-the-army-denies-it/	2024-11-03T18:29:01-08:00	
Israel investigates leaks that appear to have bolstered Netanyahu...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — An Israeli court on Sunday loosened a gag order on a case investigating leaks of classified information suspected to involve one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s media advisers. Critics say the leaks were aimed at giving Netanyahu political cover as Gaza cease-fire talks ground to a halt. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing, downplaying the affair and publicly calling for the gag order to be lifted. Netanyahu has said the person in question 'never participated in security discussions, was not exposed to or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits.' On Sunday, an Israeli court allowed the publication of the name of the central suspect in the case, Eli Feldstein, whom Israeli media said was one of Netanyahu’s media advisers. Israeli media reports say the case concerns the leak of classified information to two European media outlets, allegedly by Feldstein, who may not have been formally employed and did not have security clearance. The media reported Feldstein joined Netanyahu as an adviser weeks after the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks and previously worked as an adviser to far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. The court did not release the names of three other suspects who are also being investigated in connection with the leak. The leaked documents are said to have formed the basis of a widely discredited article in the London-based Jewish Chronicle — which was later withdrawn — suggesting Hamas planned to spirit hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, and an article in Germany's Bild newspaper that said Hamas was drawing out the talks as a form of psychological warfare on Israel. Israeli media and other observers expressed skepticism about the articles, which appeared to support Netanyahu's demands in the talks and absolve him of blame for their failure. Netanyahu made no mention of the case in a visit to Israel’s northern border with Israel Sunday, according to a video released by his office. The articles came out as Netanyahu was calling for lasting Israeli control over the Philadelphi corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, a demand that was first made public over the summer. Hamas rejected the demand and accused Netanyahu of deliberately sabotaging the talks, which have been mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. The articles also seemed to provide political cover as Netanyahu faced intense criticism from the families of the hostages and much of the Israeli public, who blame him for the failure to reach a deal. The criticism reached a fever pitch in early September, with mass protests and calls for a general strike, after Hamas killed six hostages as Israeli troops closed in on them. A court document confirmed that an investigation by police, the military and the Shin Bet internal security agency is underway and that a number of suspects have been arrested for questioning. It said the affair poses 'a risk to sensitive information and sources' and 'harms the achievement of the goals of the war in the Gaza Strip.' The leak led to a scandal at the Jewish Chronicle, where prominent columnists resigned in protest over the discredited articles. The London-based newspaper removed the article in question and others by a freelance journalist, saying it was 'not satisfied with some of his claims.' The Bild article suggested Hamas was not serious about the negotiations and was using psychological warfare to stoke Israeli divisions. Netanyahu cited it in a meeting with his Cabinet after it was published. He again defended the article in a statement released over the weekend, saying it had 'exposed the Hamas methods of exerting psychological pressure from home and abroad on the Israeli government and public by blaming Israel for the failure of the talks to release the hostages.' Netanyahu has sought to blame Hamas, whose Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel ignited the war, for the failure of the talks. Hamas, which is still holding scores of hostages, has said it will only release them in exchange for a lasting cease-fire, a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas says those demands have not changed following last month's killing of its top leader Yahya Sinwar, as the United States, Egypt and Qatar seek to restart the negotiations. Netanyahu, often described by critics as image-obsessed, is on trial for corruption in three separate cases, two of which involve accusations that he gave favors to media moguls in exchange for positive coverage. His office has downplayed the latest affair and accused the judiciary of bias, citing the many other leaks over the course of the war. It has also denied the leak in question had any impact on the cease-fire talks. 'The document only helped the effort to return the hostages, and certainly did not harm it,' Netanyahu's office said in a statement Saturday, adding that he only learned about the document when it was publicized. His critics say the allegations are far more serious. Yoav Limor, writing in the pro-Netanyahu daily Israel Hayom, called it 'one of the gravest affairs Israel has ever known.' 'The damage it caused extends beyond the realm of national security and gives rise to suspicion that the prime minister’s bureau acted to scuttle a hostage deal, contrary to the war’s objectives.' ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-investigates-leaks-that-appear-to-have-bolstered-netanyahu-as-gaza-truce-talks-stalled/	2024-11-03T13:23:32-08:00	
Russia sends nearly 100 drones into Ukraine, as Zelenskyy urges t...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Moscow sent 96 drones and a guided air missile into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine’s Air Force, 66 drones were destroyed during the overnight barrage, along with the missile. A further 27 drones were 'lost' over various areas, it said, likely having been electronically jammed, while one drone flew into Belarusian airspace. No casualties were reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that Russia had launched around 900 guided aerial bombs, 500 drones and 30 missiles against Ukraine over the past week. Zelenskyy appealed Sunday on X to Ukraine’s allies to provide 'long-range capabilities for our security', saying that these 'attacks would have been impossible if we had sufficient support from the world.' Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil, including for preemptive Ukrainian strikes on camps where North Korean troops are being trained. The Ukrainian President also urged partners to enact 'truly effective sanctions to prevent Russia from importing critical components for drone and missile production'. This appeal followed an address on Saturday, in which he said over 2,000 drones and missiles 'still using Western components' were launched against Ukraine in October, and underlined the need for more stringent export controls to prevent sanctions evasion. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said that 19 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight into Sunday in three regions of Russia: 16 in the Rostov region, two in the Belgorod region and one in the Volgograd region. A man died Sunday in a Ukrainian drone attack in the Belgorod region, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-sends-nearly-100-drones-into-ukraine-as-zelenskyy-urges-tougher-sanctions-against-moscow/	2024-11-03T07:13:13-08:00	
Still wrecked from past Israeli raids, hospitals in northern Gaza...	JERUSALEM (AP) — They were built to be places of healing. But once again, three hospitals in northern Gaza are encircled by Israeli troops and under fire. Bombardment is pounding around them as Israel wages a new offensive against Hamas fighters that it says have regrouped nearby. As staff scramble to treat waves of wounded, they remain haunted by a war that has seen hospitals targeted with an intensity and overtness rarely seen in modern warfare. All three were besieged and raided by Israeli troops some 10 months ago. The Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals still have not recovered from the damage, yet are the only hospitals even partially operational in the area. Medical facilities often come under fire in wars, but combatants usually depict such incidents as accidental or exceptional, since hospitals enjoy special protection under international law. In its yearlong campaign in Gaza, Israel has stood out by carrying out an open campaign on hospitals, besieging and raiding at least 10 of them across the Gaza Strip, some several times, as well as hitting multiple others in strikes. It has said this is a military necessity in its aim to destroy Hamas after the militants’ Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. It claims Hamas uses hospitals as 'command and control bases' to plan attacks, to shelter fighters and to hide hostages. It argues that nullifies the protections for hospitals. 'If we intend to take down the military infrastructure in the north, we have to take down the philosophy of (using) the hospitals,' Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said of Hamas during an interview with The Associated Press in January after the first round of hospital raids. Most prominently, Israel twice raided Gaza City’s Shifa Hospital, the biggest medical facility in the strip, producing a video animation depicting it as a major Hamas base, though the evidence it presented remains disputed. But the focus on Shifa has overshadowed raids on other facilities. The AP spent months gathering accounts of the raids on al-Awda, Indonesian and Kamal Adwan Hospitals, interviewing more than three dozen patients, witnesses and medical and humanitarian workers as well as Israeli officials. It found that Israel has presented little or even no evidence of a significant Hamas presence in those cases. The AP presented a dossier listing the incidents reported by those it interviewed to the Israeli military spokesman’s office. The office said it could not comment on specific events. Al-Awda Hospital: ‘A death sentence’ The Israeli military has never made any claims of a Hamas presence at al-Awda. When asked what intelligence led troops to besiege and raid the hospital last year, the military spokesman’s office did not reply. In recent weeks, the hospital has been paralyzed once again, with Israeli troops fighting in nearby Jabalia refugee camp and no food, water or medical supplies entering areas of northern Gaza. Its director Mohammed Salha said last month that the facility was surrounded by troops and was unable to evacuate six critical patients. Staff were down to eating one meal a day, usually just a flat bread or a bit of rice, he said. As war-wounded poured in, exhausted surgeons were struggling to treat them. No vascular surgeons or neurosurgeons remain north of Gaza City, so the doctors often resort to amputating shrapnel-shattered limbs to save lives. 'We are reliving the nightmares of November and December of last year, but worse,' Salha said. 'We have fewer supplies, fewer doctors and less hope that anything will be done to stop this.' The military, which did not respond to a specific request for comment on al-Awda hospital, says it takes all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties. Last year, fighting was raging around al-Awda when, on Nov. 21, a shell exploded in the facility's operating room. Dr. Mahmoud Abu Nujaila, two other doctors and a patient’s uncle died almost instantly, according to international charity Doctors Without Borders, which said it had informed the Israeli military of its coordinates. Dr. Mohammed Obeid, Abu Nujaila’s colleague, recalled dodging shellfire inside the hospital complex. Israeli sniper fire killed a nurse and two janitors and wounded a surgeon, hospital officials said. By Dec. 5, al-Awda was surrounded. For 18 days, coming or going became 'a death sentence,' Obeid said. Survivors and hospital administrators recounted at least four occasions when Israeli drones or snipers killed or badly wounded Palestinians trying to enter. Two women about to give birth were shot and bled to death in the street, staff said. Salha, the administrator, watched gunfire kill his cousin, Souma, and her 6-year-old son as she brought the boy for treatment of wounds. Shaza al-Shuraim said labor pains left her no choice but to walk an hour to al-Awda to give birth. She, her mother-in-law and 16-year-old brother-in-law raised flags made of white blouses. 'Civilians!' her mother-in-law, Khatam Sharir, kept shouting. Just outside the gate, a burst of gunfire answered, killing Sharir. On Dec. 23, troops stormed the hospital, ordering men ages 15 to 65 to strip and undergo interrogation in the yard. Mazen Khalidi, whose infected right leg had been amputated, said nurses pleaded with soldiers to let him rest rather than join the blindfolded and handcuffed men outside. They refused, and he hobbled downstairs, his stump bleeding. 'The humiliation scared me more than death,' Khalidi said. The hospital’s director, Ahmed Muhanna, was seized by Israeli troops; his whereabouts remain unknown. One of Gaza’s leading doctors, orthopedist Adnan al-Bursh, was also detained during the raid and died in Israeli custody in May. In the wreckage from the November shelling, staff found a message that Abu Nujaila had written on a whiteboard in the previous weeks. 'Whoever stays until the end will tell the story,' it read in English. 'We did what we could. Remember us.' Indonesian Hospital: ‘Patients dying before your eyes’ Several blocks away, on Oct. 18, artillery hit the upper floors of Indonesian Hospital, staff said. People fled for their lives. They'd already been surrounded by Israeli troops, leaving doctors and patients inside without enough food, water and supplies. 'The bombing around us has increased. They’ve paralyzed us,' said Edi Wahyudi, an Indonesian volunteer. Two patients died because of a power outage and lack of supplies, said Muhannad Hadi, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Palestinian territories. Tamer al-Kurd, a nurse at the hospital, said around 44 patients and only two doctors remain. He said he was so dehydrated he was starting to hallucinate. 'People come to me to save them. … I can’t do that by myself, with two doctors,' he said in a voice message, his voice weak. 'I’m tired.' On Saturday, the Israeli military said it had facilitated the evacuation of 29 patients from Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals. The Indonesian is Northern Gaza’s largest hospital. Today its top floors are charred, its walls pockmarked by shrapnel, its gates strewn with piled-up rubble — all the legacy of Israel's siege in the autumn of 2023. Before the assault, the Israeli army claimed an underground command-and-control center lay beneath the hospital. It released blurry satellite images of what it said was a tunnel entrance in the yard and a rocket launchpad nearby, outside the hospital compound. The Indonesia-based group that funds the hospital denied any Hamas presence. 'If there’s a tunnel, we would know. We know this building because we built it brick by brick, layer by layer. It’s ridiculous,' Arief Rachman, a hospital manager from the Indonesia-based Medical Emergency Rescue Committee, told the AP last month. After besieging and raiding the hospital, the military did not mention or show evidence of the underground facility or tunnels it had earlier claimed. When asked if any tunnels were found, the military spokesman's office did not reply. It released images of two vehicles found in the compound — a pickup truck with military vests and a bloodstained car belonging to an abducted Israeli, suggesting he had been brought to the hospital on Oct. 7. Hamas has said it brought wounded hostages to hospitals for treatment. During the siege, Israeli shelling crept closer and closer until, on Nov. 20, it hit the Indonesian’s second floor, killing 12 people and wounding dozens, according to staff. Israel said troops responded to 'enemy fire' from the hospital but denied using shells. Gunfire over the next days hit walls and whizzed through intensive care. Explosions sparked fires outside the hospital courtyard where some 1,000 displaced Palestinians sheltered, according to staff. The Israeli military denied targeting the hospital, although it acknowledged nearby bombardment may have damaged it. For three weeks, wounded poured in — up to 500 a day to a facility with capacity for 200. Supplies hadn’t entered in weeks. Bloodstained linens piled up. Doctors, some working 24-hour shifts, ate a few dates a day. The discovery of moldy flour on Nov. 23 was almost thrilling. Without medicines or ventilators, there was little doctors could do. Wounds became infected. Doctors said they performed dozens of amputations on infected limbs. Medics estimated a fifth of incoming patients died. At least 60 corpses lay in the courtyard. Others were buried beneath a nearby playground. 'To see patients dying before your eyes because you don’t have the ability to help them, you have to ask yourself: ‘Where is humanity?’' asked Dergham Abu Ibrahim, a volunteer. Kamal Adwan: ‘This makes no sense’ Kamal Adwan Hospital, once a linchpin of northern Gaza’s health system, was burning on Thursday of last week. Israeli shells crashed into the third floor, igniting a fire that destroyed medical supplies, according to the World Health Organization, which had delivered the equipment just days before. The artillery hit water tanks and damaged the dialysis unit, badly burning four medics who tried to extinguish the blaze, said the hospital’s director, Hossam Abu Safiya. In videos pleading for help over the past weeks, Abu Safiya had fought to maintain his composure as Israeli forces surrounded the hospital. But last weekend, there were tears in his eyes. 'Everything we have built, they have burned,' he said, his voice cracking. 'They burned our hearts. They killed my son.' On Oct. 25, Israeli troops stormed the hospital after what an Israeli military official described as an intense fight with militants nearby. During the battle, Israeli fire targeted the hospital’s oxygen tanks because they 'can be booby traps,' the official said. Israeli forces withdrew after three days, during which Palestinian health officials said nearly all of Kamal Adwan's medical workers were detained, an Israeli drone killed at least one doctor and two children in intensive care died when generators stopped working. Days later, a drone struck Abu Safiya’s son in nearby Jabalia. The 21-year-old had been wounded by Israeli snipers during the first military raid on Kamal Adwan last December. Now he is buried in the yard of the hospital, where just Abu Safiya and one other doctor remain to treat the dozens of wounded pouring in each day from new strikes in Jabalia. The Israeli military said troops detained 100 people, some who were 'posing as medical staff.' Soldiers stripped the men to check for weapons, the military said, before those deemed militants were sent to detention camps. The military claimed that the hospital was 'fully operational, with all departments continuing to treat patients.' It released footage of several guns and an RPG launcher with several rounds it said it found inside the hospital. Kamal Adwan staff say more than 30 medical personnel remain detained, including the head of nursing, who is employed by MedGlobal, an American organization that sends medical teams to disaster regions, and Dr. Mohammed Obeid, the surgeon employed by Doctors without Borders who previously worked at al-Awda Hospital and had moved to Kamal Adwan. The turmoil echoed Israel’s nine-day siege of Kamal Adwan last December. On Dec. 12, soldiers entered and allowed police dogs to attack staff, patients and others, multiple witnesses said. Ahmed Atbail, a 36-year-old who had sought refuge at the hospital, said he saw a dog bite off one man’s finger. Witnesses said the troops ordered boys and men, ranging from their mid-teens to 60, to line up outside crouched in the cold, blindfolded and nearly naked for hours of interrogation. 'Every time someone lifted their heads, they were beaten,' said Mohammed al-Masri, a lawyer who was detained. The military later published footage of men exiting the hospital. Al-Masri identified himself in the footage. He said soldiers staged the images, ordering men to lay down rifles belonging to the hospital guards as if they were militants surrendering. Israel said all photos released are authentic and that it apprehended dozens of suspected militants. As they released some of the men after interrogation, soldiers fired on them as they tried to reenter the hospital, wounding five, three detainees said. Ahmed Abu Hajjaj recalled hearing bursts of gunfire as he made his way back in the dark. 'I thought, this makes no sense — who would they be shooting at?' Witnesses also said a bulldozer lumbered into the hospital compound, plowing into buildings. Abu Safiya, Abu Hajjaj and al-Masri described being held by soldiers inside the hospital as they heard people screaming outside. After the soldiers withdrew, the men saw the bulldozer had crushed tents that previously sheltered some 2,500 people. Most of the displaced had evacuated, but Abu Safiya said he found bodies of four people crushed, with splints from recent treatment in the hospital still on their limbs. Asked about the incident, the Israeli military spokesman’s office said: 'Lies were spread on social media' about troops’ activities at the hospital. It said bodies were discovered that had been buried previously, unrelated to the military’s activities. Later, the military said Hamas used the hospital as a command center but produced no evidence. It said soldiers uncovered weapons, but it showed footage only of a single pistol. The hospital’s director, Dr. Ahmed al-Kahlout, remains in Israeli custody. The military released footage of him under interrogation saying he was a Hamas agent and that militants were based in the hospital. His colleagues said he spoke under duress. The fallout Hagari, the military spokesperson, said hospitals 'provide a life of their own ... to the (Hamas) war system.' He said hospitals were linked to tunnels allowing fighters movement. 'And when you take it, they have no way to move. Not from the south to the north.' Despite often suggesting hospitals are linked to Hamas' underground networks, the military has shown only one tunnel shaft from all the hospitals it raided — one leading to Shifa's grounds. In a report last month, a U.N. investigation commission determined that 'Israel has implemented a concerted policy to destroy the health-care system of Gaza.' It described Israeli actions at hospitals as 'collective punishment against the Palestinians in Gaza.' Some patients now fear hospitals, refusing to go to them or leaving before treatment is complete. 'They are places of death,' Ahmed al-Qamar, a 35-year-old economist in Jabalia refugee camp, said of his fear of taking his children to the hospital. 'You can feel it.' Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal who has also worked in Gaza during the war, said the sense of safety that should surround hospitals has been destroyed. 'This war has become a scar in the minds of every doctor and nurse.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-still-wrecked-from-past-israeli-raids-hospitals-in-northern-gaza-come-under-attack-again/	2024-11-03T02:10:24-08:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy urges allies to act before North Korean troop...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged its allies to stop 'watching' and take steps before North Korean troops deployed in Russia reach the battlefield, and the country's army chief warned that his troops are facing 'one of the most powerful offensives' by Moscow since the all-out war started more than two years ago. Zelenskyy raised the prospect of a preemptive Ukrainian strike on camps where the North Korean troops are being trained and said Kyiv knows their location. But he said Ukraine can’t do it without permission from allies to use Western-made long-range weapons to hit targets deep inside Russia. 'But instead … America is watching, Britain is watching, Germany is watching. Everyone is just waiting for the North Korean military to start attacking Ukrainians as well,' Zelenskyy said in a post late Friday on the Telegram messaging app. The Biden administration said Thursday that some 8,000 North Korean soldiers are now in Russia’s Kursk region near Ukraine’s border and are preparing to help the Kremlin fight against Ukrainian troops in the coming days. On Saturday, Ukraine's military intelligence said that more than 7,000 North Koreans equipped with Russian gear and weapons had been transported to areas near Ukraine. The agency, known by its acronym GUR, said that North Korean troops were being trained at five locations in Russia's Far East. It did not specify its source of information. Western leaders have described the North Korean troop deployment as a significant escalation that could also jolt relations in the Indo-Pacific region, and open the door to technology transfers from Moscow to Pyongyang that could advance the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile program. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui met with her Russian counterpart in Moscow on Friday. Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly said they need permission to use Western weapons to strike arms depots, airfields and military bases far from the border to motivate Russia to seek peace. In response, U.S. defense officials have argued that the missiles are limited in number, and that Ukraine is already using its own long-range drones to hit targets farther into Russia. Moscow has also consistently signaled that it would view any such strikes as a major escalation. President Vladimir Putin warned on Sept. 12 that Russia would be 'at war' with the U.S. and NATO states if they approve them. Ukraine facing 'one of most powerful' Russian offensives since war began Zelenskyy's call came shortly before Ukraine's top commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskiy, said on Saturday that his troops are struggling to stem 'one of the most powerful offensives' by Russia since its all-out invasion of its southern neighbor in February 2022. Writing on Telegram following a call with a top Czech military official, Syrskyi hinted that Ukrainian units are taking heavy losses in the fighting, which he said 'require constant renewal of resources.' While Syrskyi did not specify where the heavy fighting took place, Russia has for months been conducting a ferocious campaign along the eastern front in Ukraine, gradually compelling Kyiv to surrender ground. But Moscow has struggled to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk border region following an incursion almost three months ago. Dozens injured in Russian strikes on Ukraine Russian missiles hit Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv overnight into Saturday, killing a policeman and injuring dozens, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov reported. According to Syniehubov and Ukraine’s national police force, one missile slammed into a spot where a large group of police were gathered, killing a 40-year-old serviceman and injuring 36 more. In Ukraine’s southern Kherson province, Russian shelling on Saturday killed a 40-year-old woman and wounded three others, including two children, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Another Kherson resident was wounded in a drone attack later that day, according to local Ukrainian authorities. Five more civilians, including two children, were injured after Russia struck Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, Gov. Serhii Lysak said. In Kyiv, air raid sirens wailed for over five hours early Saturday morning as Russian drones rained on the capital, sparking a fire in an office block downtown and injuring two people, according to the city’s military administration. Overall, Russian forces overnight attacked Ukraine with over 70 Iranian-made Shahed drones, the Ukrainian air force reported Saturday. It said most were shot down or sent off-course using GPS jamming. Falling debris damaged power networks and residential buildings in multiple provinces and injured an elderly woman near Kyiv, officials said. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry hinted that Russia’s drone campaign was slowing down, saying Moscow launched just over half as many in October as the month before. Meanwhile, Russia’s defense ministry reported that its forces overnight shot down 24 Ukrainian drones over four Russian regions and occupied Crimea. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. In a separate development, four civilians were injured following a Ukrainian strike in Russia’s southern Kursk region, its Gov. Aleksei Smirnov said, without specifying what weapon was used. Moscow is still trying to dislodge Ukrainian forces from the province, months after they staged a bold assault that rattled the Kremlin and constituted the largest attack on Russia since World War II. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraines-zelenskyy-urges-allies-to-take-steps-before-north-korean-troops-reach-the-front/	2024-11-02T10:50:58-07:00	
Israel is falling far short of a US ultimatum to surge aid to Gaz...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Halfway through the Biden administration's 30-day ultimatum for Israel to surge the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding, Israel is falling far short, an Associated Press review of U.N. and Israeli data shows. Israel also has missed some other deadlines and demands outlined in a Oct. 13 letter from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The mid-November deadline — following the U.S. election — may serve as a final test of President Joe Biden 's willingness to check a close ally that has shrugged off repeated U.S. appeals to protect Palestinian civilians during the war against Hamas. In their letter, Blinken and Austin demanded improvements to the deteriorating humanitarian condition in Gaza, saying that Israel must allow in a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying desperately needed food and other supplies. By the end of October, an average of just 71 trucks a day were entering Gaza, according to the latest U.N. figures. Blinken said the State Department and Pentagon were closely following Israel’s response to the letter. 'There’s been progress, but it’s insufficient, and we’re working on a daily basis to make sure Israel does what it must do to ensure that this assistance gets to people who need it inside of Gaza,' Blinken told reporters. 'It’s not enough to get trucks to Gaza. It’s vital that what they bring with them can get distributed effectively inside of Gaza,' he added. Blinken and Austin’s letter marked one of the toughest stands that the Biden administration has taken in a year of appeals and warnings to Israel to lessen the harm to Palestinian civilians. Support for Israel is a bedrock issue for many Republican voters and some Democrats. That makes any Biden administration decision on restricting military funding to the U.S. ally a fraught one for the tight presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. In hard-hit north Gaza in particular, an escalated Israeli military campaign and restrictions on aid has kept all food and other care from reaching populated areas since mid-October, aid organizations say. It could set the stage for famine in coming weeks or months, international monitors say. And despite U.S. objections, Israeli lawmakers this week voted to effectively ban the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Governments worldwide, the U.N. and aid organizations say cutting off UNRWA would shatter the aid networks struggling to get food and other supplies to people in Gaza. 'Catastrophic,' Amber Alayyan, a medical program manager for Gaza at Doctors Without Borders, said of the move. Humanitarian officials are deeply skeptical Israel will significantly improve assistance to Gaza’s civilians even with the U.S. warning — or that the Biden administration will do anything if it doesn’t. At this point in the war, 'neither of those has happened,' said Scott Paul, an associate director of the Oxfam humanitarian organization. 'Over and over and again, we’ve been told' by Biden administration officials 'that there are processes to evaluate the situation on the ground' in Gaza 'and some movement’s been made to implement U.S. law, and time and again that has not happened,' Paul said. Before the war, an average of 500 trucks daily brought aid into the territory. Relief groups have said that's the minimum needed for Gaza’s 2.3 million people, most of whom have since been uprooted from their homes, often multiple times. There has never been a month where Israel came close to meeting that figure since the conflict began, peaking in April at 225 trucks a day, according to Israeli government figures. By the time Blinken and Austin sent their letter this month, concerns were rising that aid restrictions were starving civilians. The number of aid trucks that Israel has allowed into Gaza has plunged since last spring and summer, falling to a daily average of just 13 a day by the beginning of October, according to U.N. figures. By the end of the month, it rose to an average of 71 trucks a day, the U.N. figures show. Once supplies get to Gaza, groups still face obstacles distributing the aid to warehouses and then to people in need, organizations and the State Department said this week. That includes slow Israeli processing, Israeli restrictions on shipments, lawlessness and other obstacles, aid groups said. Data from COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, shows aid has fallen to under a third of its levels in September and August. In September, 87,446 tons of aid entered the Gaza Strip. In October, 26,399 tons got in. Elad Goren, a senior COGAT official, said last week that aid delivery and distribution in the north has been mainly confined to Gaza City. When asked why aid was not being delivered to other parts of the north — like Jabaliya, a crowded urban refugee camp where Israel is staging an offensive — he said the population there was being evacuated and those who remained had 'enough assistance' from previous months. In other areas like Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, Goren claimed falsely that there was 'no population' left there. COGAT declined to comment on the standard in the U.S. letter. It said it was complying with government directives on aid to Gaza. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon blamed Hamas for plundering aid. Paul of Oxfam said no aid at all was reaching populated areas in northern Gaza and only small amounts getting to Gaza City. 'No way' has Israel made progress in getting humanitarian support to the hundreds of thousands of people in north Gaza in particular since the U.S. ultimatum, said Alayyan of Doctors Without Borders. Israel’s government appeared to blow past another deadline set in Austin and Blinken's letter. It called for Israel to set up a senior-level channel for U.S. officials to raise concerns about reported harm to Palestinian civilians and hold a first meeting by the end of October. No such channel — requested repeatedly by the U.S. during the war — had been created by the final day of the month. The U.S. is by far the biggest provider of arms and other military aid to Israel, including nearly $18 billion during the war in Gaza, according to a study for Brown University's Costs of War project. The Biden administration paused a planned shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel last spring, citing concerns for civilians in an Israeli offensive. In a formal review in May, the administration concluded that Israel’s use of U.S.-provided weapons in Gaza likely violated international humanitarian law but said wartime conditions prevented officials from determining that for certain in specific strikes. ___ AP writers Matthew Lee in Washington, Julia Frankel in Jerusalem and Edith M.

Russia sentences former US consulate worker to nearly 5 years in ...	MOSCOW (AP) — A court in Russia's far-eastern city of Vladivostok on Friday convicted a former U.S. Consulate worker charged with cooperating with a foreign state and sentenced him to four years and 10 months in prison. Robert Shonov, a Russian citizen and former employee of the U.S. Consulate in Vladivostok, was arrested in May 2023. Russia's top domestic security agency, the FSB, accused him of 'gathering information about the special military operation' in Ukraine, a partial call-up in Russian regions and its influence on 'protest activities of the population in the runup to the 2024 presidential election.' The U.S. State Department last year condemned the arrest and said the allegations against Shonov 'are wholly without merit.' Shonov was charged under a new article of Russian law that criminalizes 'cooperation on a confidential basis with a foreign state, international or foreign organization to assist their activities clearly aimed against Russia’s security.' Kremlin critics and human rights advocates have said it is so broad that it can be used to punish any Russian with foreign connections. It carries a prison sentence of up to eight years. The State Department has said Shonov worked at the U.S. Consulate in Vladivostok for more than 25 years. The consulate closed in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and never reopened. The State Department has said that after a Russian government order in April 2021 required the dismissal of all local employees in U.S. diplomatic outposts in Russia, Shonov worked at a company the U.S. contracted with to support its embassy in Moscow. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in May 2023 that Shonov’s only role at the time of his arrest was 'to compile media summaries of press items from publicly available Russian media sources.' Shonov was held in the Lefortovo Prison in Moscow, notorious for its harsh conditions, pending investigation, but stood trial in Vladivostok's Primorsky District Court. In addition to a prison term, which Shonov was ordered to serve in a general regime penal colony, the court ruled that he must pay a fine of 1 million rubles (just over $10,000) and face additional restrictions for 16 months after finishing his prison sentence.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-sentences-former-us-consulate-worker-to-nearly-5-years-in-prison/	2024-11-01T04:11:28-07:00	
Death toll in Israeli strikes in central Gaza rises to 25 as Beir...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The death toll from Israeli strikes in the central Gaza Strip rose to 25, including five children, as more bodies have been recovered, while three people were killed in an early morning airstrike near the Lebanese capital, officials said Friday. Sixteen people had initially been reported killed in two strikes on Thursday on the Gaza Strip's central Nuseirat refugee camp, but officials from the Al-Aqsa hospital said bodies continued to be brought in. Overall, the hospital said they had received 21 dead bodies from the strikes, including some transferred from the Awda hospital, where they had been brought the day before. One of the strikes killed an 18-month-old and his 10-year-old sister — the children’s mother was missing as of Friday and the father was killed by an Israeli airstrike four months ago, the family told AP journalists at Aqsa hospital. Strikes on a motorcycle in Zuwaida and on a house in Deir al-Balah on Friday killed four more, the hospital officials said, bringing the overall toll to 25. The Israeli military did not comment on the specific strikes but said it had killed armed militants in central and southern Gaza Thursday. Israel’s blistering offensive on the Gaza Strip has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians since October 7, 2023, say health officials inside Gaza who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. They say more than half of the dead are women and children. The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Friday that a total of 55 people had been killed in the past 24 hours and that another 196 had been wounded. Israel began bombarding Gaza after the Hamas attack on Israel Oct. 7, when the militants killed roughly 1,200 people and took some 250 hostages back to Gaza. Despite growing pressure from the United States and others in the international community for a cease fire both in Gaza and Lebanon, Israel’s air force pounded Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh overnight, destroying dozens of buildings in several neighborhoods, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency. The early Friday airstrikes on Dahiyeh — after a four-day lull during which no airstrikes were reported in the suburb — destroyed dozens of buildings and caused fires in the area, the agency said. In recent days, Israel has intensified its airstrikes on the northeastern city of Baalbek and nearby villages, as well as different parts of southern Lebanon. Early Friday, an Israeli airstrike on the edge of Qamatiyeh, southeast of Beirut, killed three people and wounded five, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. An Associated Press journalist who visited the scene said the strike was closer to the nearby village of Ein al-Rummaneh, adding that it caused minor damage to an apartment on the first floor of a building. Lebanon’s Heath Ministry said more than 2,800 people have been killed and 13,000 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets almost daily into Israel, drawing retaliation. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem.

Israel fights a seemingly endless war in Gaza's most devastated r...	JERUSALEM (AP) — More than a year into a war that has ricocheted across the Middle East, Israeli troops are still battling Hamas in the most heavily destroyed and isolated part of the Gaza Strip. In northern Gaza, Hamas militants carry out hit-and-run attacks from bombed-out buildings. Residents say Israeli forces have raided shelters for the displaced, forcing people out at gunpoint. First responders say they can barely operate because of the Israeli bombardment. Since its Oct. 7 attack into Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, Hamas has taken heavy losses. The recent killing of its top leader, Yahya Sinwar, was viewed as a possible turning point, yet the two sides do not appear any closer to a cease-fire, and Hamas, which still holds scores of hostages, remains the dominant power in Gaza. The conflict has drawn in militants from Lebanon to Yemen, and their key sponsor, Iran, has inched closer to all-out war with Israel. But in northern Gaza, the war seems stuck in a loop of devastating Israeli offensives, followed by Hamas fighters regrouping. Israel is once again ordering mass evacuations, severely restricting aid despite global outrage and raiding hospitals it says are used by militants. In the northern border town of Beit Lahiya — one of the first targets of last year’s ground invasion — two Israeli strikes this week killed at least 88 Palestinians, including dozens of women and children. The military said its target was a spotter on the roof. As the war grinds on, Israel is resorting to ever more draconian measures. There is even talk of adopting a surrender-or-starve strategy proposed by former generals. On Monday, Israel passed legislation that could severely restrict the U.N. agency that is the largest aid provider in Gaza despite protests by the United States and other close allies. It accuses the agency of allowing itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. Another offensive, as Hamas keeps filling the void Israel launched its latest offensive in northern Gaza in early October, focusing on Jabaliya, a crowded, decades-old urban refugee camp where it says Hamas had regrouped. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250 that day. Israel’s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence, and the United States says Hamas is no longer capable of mounting an Oct. 7-style attack. But Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to areas where they had battled before — only to face renewed attacks. At least 16 Israeli soldiers have been killed in northern Gaza since the latest operation began, including a 41-year-old colonel. Israel has yet to lay out a plan for postwar Gaza and has rejected a U.S. push for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to return and govern with Arab support. Plainclothes Hamas security men still patrol most areas. 'It’s endless war,' said Michael Milshtein, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who now leads a Palestinian studies program at Tel Aviv University. He says Israel has only two options to break the cycle: Either completely reoccupy Gaza, which would require several thousand troops to be stationed there indefinitely. Or secure a cease-fire with Hamas that involves the release of its hostages in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli jails, and a full Israeli withdrawal — the kind of deal that has long eluded U.S. and Arab mediators. 'We are in Jabaliya for the fourth time, and maybe in the next month we will find ourselves there for the fifth and the sixth.' he said. ‘Leave now’ if you care about the lives of your children Around a million people fled the north, including Gaza City, when Israel ordered its wholesale evacuation at the start of the war. They have not been allowed to return. Some 400,000 have remained, even as Israel has encircled the area and obliterated entire neighborhoods and critical infrastructure. The U.N. says at least 60,000 people have fled to Gaza City in recent weeks from Jabaliya and the northern border towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya. Residents who remain describe being stuck in their homes for days at a time because of the fighting, with bodies rotting in the streets and rescue teams unable to venture out. Amna Mustafa and her children were asleep before dawn in a crowded school-turned-shelter in Beit Lahiya last week when an Israeli drone hovering overhead ordered everyone to evacuate. 'If you care about your life and the lives of your children, leave now,' it said. She said men were ordered to strip down and taken away in trucks. The military says it makes every effort to avoid harming civilians, and that such procedures are used to search and detain militants who it says hide among civilians. Women and children were ordered to walk to a nearby hospital, where Israeli soldiers searched them before allowing most to walk onward to Gaza City, several miles (kilometers) to the south. Mustafa said she spent two nights in the open before moving into a new tent camp in a soccer field. 'There is no food, no water, no blankets, no diapers and no milk for the children,' she said. 'We are here waiting for God’s mercy.' The Israeli military shared drone footage of a similar exodus, showing thousands of people walking down a plowed up road past tanks. It said Hamas had prevented them from leaving before its forces arrived, without providing evidence. The U.N. human rights office warned earlier this month that Israel 'may be causing the destruction of the Palestinian population in Gaza’s northernmost governate through death and displacement.' Israel restricts aid despite U.S. warnings Israel has severely restricted aid to Gaza in October, allowing in only about a third of the humanitarian assistance that entered the previous month. Alia Zaki, a spokesperson for the World Food Program, said Israel has not allowed U.N. agencies to deliver aid to the north outside of Gaza City since the latest offensive began. Col. Elad Goren, a spokesperson for COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs in Gaza, attributed the lack of aid in the first half of the month to Jewish holiday closures and troop movements. At a briefing last week, he said there was no need for aid deliveries in Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya because there was 'no population' left in either town. That was before this week’s strikes on Beit Lahiya killed scores of people. The Biden administration has told Israel to increase the supply of aid entering Gaza, warning it of U.S. laws that could require it to reduce its crucial military support. Does Israel plan to empty the north? Palestinians fear Israel is carrying out a strategy proposed by former generals in which aid to the north would be cut off, civilians would be ordered to leave and anyone remaining would be branded a militant. Rights groups say the plan would violate international law. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who visited the region last week for the 11th time since the start of the war, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told him that Israel had not adopted the plan. The military has denied receiving such orders. But the Israeli government has not publicly repudiated the plan, even after Blinken’s visit. Milshtein says the fact that Israel is even considering it is 'a post-traumatic phenomenon' born of desperation. 'Many people in the (Israeli military) know it’s a bad idea... But they say: ’OK, we don’t have any other plan, so let’s try it.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-fights-a-seemingly-endless-war-in-gazas-most-devastated-region/	2024-10-31T21:57:41-07:00	
Harris tries to turn Gaza protests into a way to energize the cro...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Protesters can create awkward moments for presidential candidates. They interrupt, heckle and, oftentimes, knock a candidate off track. But Vice President Kamala Harris is trying a new strategy late in the campaign to turn what would otherwise be awkward interactions into moments of energy used to rally her supporters and subtly drive her message against her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. At all three of the Democratic nominee’s rallies on Wednesday — in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — pro-Palestinian protesters broke in with chants, banners, and even a whistle to criticize Harris for how she and President Joe Biden have handled the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Gaza protesters have long targeted Harris' events, and Biden's when he was still the party's nominee, hoping to use the disturbances to draw media attention to their cause. They have often prompted prolonged pauses while security officers remove the demonstrators or create uncomfortable interactions. After three months as a candidate, and as she tries to stick to her carefully honed closing message in the final week of the campaign, Harris' latest tactic aims to both validate protester concerns and use them as a proof point in her case against the former president. When a protester in North Carolina yelled that Harris was 'disrespecting the Palestinian community,' Harris used the moment to attack Trump. 'This is the thing, we know we’re actually fighting for a democracy,' Harris said in Raleigh. 'Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe that people who disagree with you are the enemy.' Hours later, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Harris used a similar protest to embrace democracy. 'Look, I will repeat it, we are fighting for a democracy, we love our democracy,' she said. 'It could be complicated at times, but it is the best system in the world.' When she faced protests at the end of her night in Wisconsin, Harris used a familiar callback to what she said when then-Vice President Mike Pence attempted to interrupt her during their debate in 2020. 'We all want the war in Gaza to end and to get the hostages out and I will do everything in my power to make it heard and known,' Harris said. 'And everyone has a right to be heard, but right now I am speaking.' The moments, at each stop, energized the large crowds at Harris’ events, drowning out the protesters and turning into a way for her supporters to come together. In Wisconsin, the response was so loud and sustained that a second group with a banner wasn’t loud enough to disrupt the event. Despite the way the protests were drowned out on Wednesday, some pro-Palestinian figures opposed to Harris see her focus on democracy and her acknowledgment that those protesting have the right to be heard as a softening from the Democratic nominee. 'It’s nice her rhetoric has softened but the time for that has passed,' said Dearborn City Council member Mustapha Hammoud. 'Instead of peace, we’ve seen an increase in violence in the war. So we can’t accept talk, we need actual outcomes.' In September, Hammoud told The Associated Press that he considered himself a Democrat until recently. Protests are an occupational hazard for presidential candidates. In 2016, Trump responded to a protest in Nevada by saying, 'I’d like to punch him in the face.' Hillary Clinton, that same year, was regularly protested by Black Lives Matter activists, including at one event where the protesters drowned her out for 10 minutes and forced Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights icon, to ask the group to stop. And in 2020, after Biden won a slate of state primaries on Super Tuesday, anti-dairy industry protesters stormed the stage, forcing Jill Biden to protect her husband by pushing the activists aside. 'I’m a good Philly girl,' Jill Biden told reporters after the confrontation. Harris, unlike Biden, has taken a more confrontational posture toward protesters since she won the Democratic nomination earlier this year. When a group of pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted her at an August event by chanting, 'Kamala, Kamala, you can’t hide, we won’t vote for genocide,' Harris responded directly: 'If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.' ___ Associated Press writers Joey Cappelletti and Mike Householder in Lansing, Michigan, contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-harris-tries-to-turn-gaza-protests-into-a-way-to-energize-the-crowds-at-her-rallies/	2024-10-31T20:01:03-07:00	
Thousands of North Korean troops in Russia. What does that mean f...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The Biden administration said Thursday some 8,000 North Korean troops are now in Russia near Ukraine’s border and are preparing to join the fight against Ukrainian troops in coming days – a potentially serious escalation of the nearly 3-year-old war. If they go into Ukraine, it would be the first time a third country puts boots on the ground in the war. Other countries on both sides of the divide have sent military aid, including weapons and training: Iran has supplied Russia with drones, and Western nations have provided Ukraine with modern weapons and financial and humanitarian assistance. The United States says some of those troops have already moved near Ukraine’s border in the Kursk region, where Moscow’s forces have struggled to push back a Ukrainian incursion. 'We’ve not yet seen these troops deploy into combat against Ukrainian forces but we would expect that to happen in the coming days,' U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said at a news conference with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and their South Korean counterparts on Thursday. Blinken said Russia has been training North Korean soldiers in artillery, drones and 'basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, indicating that they fully intend to use these forces in front line operations.' South Korea’s spy chief told lawmakers earlier this month that 3,000 North Korean troops were being trained to use equipment including drones before being sent to fight in Ukraine. Neither South Korean officials nor American officials have provided details about how they knew about the North Korean troops, and many questions surround the impact of North Korean participation. What do we know about the North Korean troops? Reports of North Korean troops arriving in Russia’s Kursk region to help Russian troops fight off a Ukrainian border incursion began more than a week ago. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that North Korean officers and technical personnel have already been spotted in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine. 'I believe they sent officers first to assess the situation before deploying troops,' Zelenskyy said. He has cautioned that the participation of a third country could escalate the conflict into a world war. This week, U.S. officials said they estimate there are about 10,000 North Korean troops in Russia. Seoul and its allies assess that the number has increased to 11,000, while Ukraine has put the figure higher, at up to 12,000. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said North Korean troops are wearing Russian uniforms and carrying Russian equipment as they advance toward Ukraine, in what he called a dangerous and destabilizing development. Austin said that it would be a 'very, very serious issue' if Pyongyang indeed did join the war on Russia’s side. Ukraine’s U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya, speaking at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday, said they expect as many as 4,500 North Korean troops to be at the border this week and to begin directly participating in combat operations against Ukrainian forces in November. What is Ukraine doing? Ukraine is preparing as though combating North Korea in its territory is inevitable. An injection of 10,000 North Korean troops, which is what both Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence have claimed, 'could significantly destabilize Ukraine’s defense there and greatly accelerate the advancement of Russian forces,' said Glib Voloskyi, an analyst from a Ukrainian think tank, Come Back Alive Initiatives Center. Speaking to South Korea’s KBS channel Thursday, Zelenskyy said that psychologically, 3,000 or 10,000 soldiers from North Korea will not impact Ukraine, because that number is insufficient. But he said Putin is testing the reaction of the West. 'Whether it will be 3,000, 10,000, or even 100,000 will directly depend on the West’s reaction to the use of North Korean forces. If the response is weak, there will be more. And then we will no longer be talking about psychological impact, but about real impact.' How is the West reacting? Western leaders have described the prospect of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian soldiers against Ukraine as an escalation. Austin said officials are discussing what to do about the deployment, which he said has the potential to broaden or lengthen the conflict in Ukraine. It’s become a key topic as U.S. and South Korean leaders met this week in Washington, fueling concerns that the presence of those soldiers will further destabilize the Asia-Pacific and broaden Moscow’s war on Ukraine. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul on Thursday condemned the deployment 'in the strongest possible terms' and called for an immediate withdrawal of the troops. North Korea’s belligerent actions not only places the European continent but also the Korean peninsula under threat and that Seoul agrees 'to take necessary measures accordingly,' he said. German and British officials have also weighed in. 'It’s a kind of escalation and it shows us a very important, a very important aspect. International conflicts are approaching very rapidly,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said. United Kingdom Defense Secretary John Healey said there was 'not just a concern about the potential for an escalation of conflict in Europe. There is an indivisible link with security concerns in the Indo-Pacific as well.' Why does Russia need North Korea? North Korea and Russia, both in separate confrontations with the West, have deepened their military cooperation in the past two years. In June, they signed a defense deal requiring both countries to provide military assistance if the other is attacked. For analysts, the introduction of troops would be a sign that the war isn’t going as Russia planned. 'I think Ukraine is wearing down the Russian army as we talk. You don’t get thousands of soldiers from North Korea if your war is going well,' said Justin Crump, a former British tank commander who heads Sibylline, a strategic advisory firm. 'You don’t require them.' North Korea has already sent over 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Those missiles are being actively used against Ukrainian targets, officials in Kyiv say. ___ Associated Press reporters Hanna Arhirova and Illia Novikov contributed.

Russia and Ukraine exchange drone strikes as North Korea's top di...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia and Ukraine exchanged scores of drone strikes Wednesday as North Korea's top diplomat arrived in Russia for talks after his country reportedly deployed thousands of soldiers to help Moscow's war efforts. Ukraine's air force said that Russia launched 62 drones and one missile overnight, adding that 33 of them were intercepted and 25 were jammed. The drones struck a residential building and a kindergarten in Kyiv, injuring nine people, including a child, according to the city administration. 'Russian drones did not change their constant tactics — they approached the capital from different directions, at different heights,' it said. Russian attacks also targeted other regions of Ukraine, killing at least four and injuring about 30 others over the past 24 hours, authorities said. At the same time, Russian forces have pressed their slow-moving offensive in eastern Ukraine. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry announced the capture of the village of Kruhlyakivka in the Kharkiv region. The ministry said that air defenses downed 25 Ukrainian drones over several regions in the country's west and southwest. The new attacks come as North Korea's Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui traveled to Russia for talks that South Korea's spy agency said could involve discussions on sending additional troops to Russia and what the North would get in return. The Pentagon said North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia, and that they will likely fight against Ukraine 'over the next several weeks.' Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Tuesday that a 'relatively small number' of North Korean troops are now in the Kursk region, where Russia has struggled to push back a Ukrainian incursion. Speaking to the media on Wednesday during a trip to Iceland, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denied that his government had set a goal of capturing the Kursk nuclear power plant as Russia has suggested. 'If we wanted to occupy their nuclear station, we could do it, but we never wanted it,' he said. Talking about the 'victory plan' that he has presented to Ukraine's Western allies, Zelenskyy said that while many of them began to accept it, some told him that he wanted too much. 'Too much of what? We want to live. Is it too much? Just to live,' he said. Zelenskyy also complained that some confidential parts of his plan were leaked to the media, including Kyiv's call on the U.S. to provide long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles that was reported by The New York Times. 'They say that Ukraine wants or wanted a lot of missiles, like Tomahawks and etcetera, but it was confidential information between Ukraine and White House,' he said. 'How to understand these messages? So, it means between partners there is nothing confidential.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-and-ukraine-exchange-drone-strikes-as-north-koreas-top-diplomat-visits-moscow/	2024-10-30T07:29:40-07:00	
North Korean troops sent to Russia may be pleased to be there, ev...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The thousands of young soldiers North Korea has sent to Russia, reportedly to help fight against Ukraine, include many elite special forces, but that hasn't stopped speculation they'll be slaughtered because they have no combat experience, no familiarity with the terrain and will likely be dropped onto the most ferocious battlefields. That may be true, and soon. Observers say some of the troops have already arrived at the front. From the North Korean perspective, however, these soldiers might not be as miserable as outsiders think. They may, in fact, view their Russian tour with pride and as a rare chance to make good money, see a foreign country for the first time and win preferred treatment for their families back home, according to former North Korean soldiers. 'They are too young and won't understand exactly what it means. They'll just consider it an honor to be selected as the ones to go to Russia among the many North Korean soldiers,' said Lee Woong-gil, a former member of the same special forces unit, the Storm Corps. He came to South Korea in 2007. 'But I think most of them won’t likely come back home alive.' Troop deployment is Kim's ‘big gamble’ Worries about North Korea’s likely participation in the Russian-Ukraine war were highlighted this week when the Pentagon said North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia, and that they will likely fight against Ukraine 'over the next several weeks.' South Korea’s presidential office said Wednesday that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been moved close to battlefronts in western Russia. North Korea's troop deployment could mark a serious escalation of the almost three-year war. It caught many outside observers by surprise because North Korea has its own security headache, a festering standoff with the United States and South Korea over its nuclear program. Large North Korean troop casualties would be a major political blow for the country’s 40-year-old ruler, Kim Jong Un, whose government hasn't formally confirmed the deployment. But experts say Kim may see this as a way to get much needed foreign currency and security support from Russia in return for joining Russia's war against Ukraine. 'Kim Jong Un is taking a big gamble. If there are no large casualty numbers, he will get what he wants to some extent. But things will change a lot if many of his soldiers die in battle,' said Ahn Chan-il, a former North Korean army first lieutenant who is now head of the World Institute for North Korean Studies think tank in Seoul. Ordinary soldier's wage is less than $1, defectors say The Storm Corps, also known as the 11th Corps, is one of Kim’s top units. Its main missions would be infiltrating agents into South Korea, blowing up important facilities in the South and assassinating key figures in the event of war on the Korean Peninsula. Lee, who served in the Storm Corps in 1998-2003, recalled that his unit received better food and supplies than other units, but many members still suffered from malnutrition and tuberculosis. Despite a gradual economic recovery in North Korea over the past 30 years, defectors say the average monthly wage for ordinary North Korean workers and soldiers is less than $1. They say many people engage in capitalist market activities to make a living because the country's state rationing system remains largely broken. Russia is expected to pay all the costs related to the deployment of North Korean troops, including their wages, which observers estimate will be at least $2,000 per month for each person. About 90% to 95% of their stipends will likely go to Kim’s coffers, and the rest to the soldiers. This means one year of service in Russia would earn a North Korean soldier $1,200 to $2,400. That's big enough to prompt many young soldiers to volunteer for risky Russian tours, former soldiers say. Ahn said North Korea will likely offer other incentives meant to elevate the social standings of soldiers, such as membership in the ruling Workers’ Party and the right to move to Pyongyang, the country’s showcase capital. Kang Mi-Jin, a defector who runs a company analyzing North Korea’s economy, said even family members of soldiers sent to Russia could be given benefits such as good houses or entrance to good universities. Choi Jung-hoon, a former first lieutenant in North Korea’s army, said serving on foreign soil will attract many soldiers who are eager to see other countries for the first time. North Koreans are barred from accessing foreign news and need state approval to move from one province to another within the country. North Korean construction, logging and other workers sent abroad to bring in foreign currency have often been called 'slaves' by international human rights groups. But defectors testify that such overseas jobs are often better than staying in North Korea, and many used bribery and family connections to get them. 'North Korean soldiers would see going to Russia as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,' Ahn said. Ahn and other observers say such views could change if the soldiers see colleagues dying in large numbers. They say many North Korean soldiers could surrender to Ukraine forces and ask for resettlement in South Korea. North Korean soldiers lack familiarity of the terrain North Korean soldiers have been trained on the Korean Peninsula's mountainous terrain and are not familiar with the largely flat plain battlefields in the Russian-Ukraine war. They also don't understand modern warfare, including drone use, because North Korea hasn’t fought a big battle since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, experts say. 'My heart ached,' said Choi, now leader of an activist group in Seoul, when he saw a Ukraine-released video purportedly showing undersized North Korean soldiers believed to be in their late teens or early 20s. 'None would think they are going to Russia to die,' Choi said. 'But I think they're cannon fodder because they will be sent to the most dangerous sites and will surely be killed.' Leader Kim Jong Un may also be hoping that his troop offer will push Russia to share sophisticated and highly sensitive technology that he needs to perfect his nuclear-capable missiles. That transfer could depend on how long the war continues and how many more troops Kim will send. Nam Sung-wook, a former director of a think tank run by South Korea’s spy agency, said North Korea will likely get hundreds of millions of dollars because of the soldiers' wages. The soldiers will get direct experience of modern warfare but will likely die in large numbers, and Russia will be reluctant to hand over its high-tech missile technology, he said. 'North Korea will continue to hide its troop dispatches from its own people because the public will be agitated if they know their soldiers are being sent abroad to be killed,' said Nam, who is now a professor at Korea University in South Korea.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-north-korean-troops-sent-to-fight-in-ukraine-may-welcome-rare-tour/	2024-10-30T05:24:24-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israel issues evacuation warning for the enti...	The Israeli army issued an evacuation warning for residents in the entire eastern Lebanese city of Baalbeck, along with surrounding areas and key routes in the Bekaa Valley. The area marked for evacuation includes the ancient Roman temple complex, inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Lebanon’s Heath Ministry said more than 2,790 people have been killed and 12,700 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of October. Multiple United Nations agencies rallied Tuesday around their fellow organization, UNRWA, that provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after Israel’s parliament took steps to ban it in the coming months. The foreign ministers of Cyprus and Luxembourg say the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees is 'indispensable' to providing food, education and health care to Palestinians. Turkey’s Foreign Ministry called Israel’s decision a 'clear violation of international law.' United States President Joe Biden’s administration says it is seeking an explanation from Israel about its attack Tuesday on a town in northern Gaza that Palestinians say killed at least 88 people, including dozens of women and children. The death toll from more than a year of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has passed 43,000, Palestinian officials reported Monday, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli military says Tuesday’s strike on Gaza building was targeted JERUSALEM — An Israeli military official says the target of Tuesday’s attack on a five-story building that Gaza health officials reported resulted in scores of deaths was a spotter with binoculars in the building, and that the intent was not to destroy the structure. The military official agreed to provide details only on condition of anonymity, citing military protocol and the ongoing investigation into the incident. The official said Wednesday the building was not known to be a shelter for civilians, and that it collapsed as a result of the strike on the spotter. The Gaza Health Ministry said Tuesday that at least 70 people were killed in the first of two strikes on the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya, and that more than half of the victims were women and children. The Israeli military had earlier said it was investigating the strike. The Gaza Health Ministry’s casualty tolls do not differentiate between civilians and militant fighters. The official said there were discrepancies between the numbers of victims reported by authorities in Gaza and what Israeli intelligence indicates, and that the victims included known militants. The official did not provide detailed evidence to support that assertion. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people in recent months. It says it carries out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but the strikes often kill women and children. —By Adam Schreck Israeli hospital officials say rocket from Lebanon wounded 2 JERUSALEM — Hospital officials in Israel say a rocket fired from Lebanon has wounded two men, one seriously. The men were wounded by rocket shrapnel on Wednesday in Metula, an Israeli town just across the border from Lebanon, said a spokesperson for the Rambam Hospital, where they were airlifted. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israel since Oct. 8, 2023, when it opened fire in solidarity with Hamas a day after its cross-border attack from the Gaza Strip. All-out war erupted last month, when Israel carried out large waves of airstrikes and killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground invasion at the start of October. Israel issues an evacuation warning for the entire Baalbek city in eastern Lebanon BEIRUT — For the first time in the ongoing Israel-Hezbollah war, the Israeli army has issued an evacuation warning for residents in the entire eastern city of Baalbek, along with surrounding areas and key routes in the Bekaa Valley. Earlier Wednesday, a drone strike targeted a van on Lebanon's Aaraya highway, a major road linking Beirut to the Bekaa, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Lebanese capital, resulting in flames, according to Lebanese state media. Another vehicle in Bchamoun, roughly 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of Beirut, was also targeted, as reported by the state-run National News Agency. This is the first time in the conflict that the area is targeted. The number of casualties and the intended targets were not yet known. The area marked in Wednesday’s evacuation order includes the ancient Roman temple complex, inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. On Oct. 6, an Israeli strike hit some 700 meters (750 yards) away from the ancient citadel, which houses two of the largest Roman temples in the world. Norway wants clarity on Israel's obligation to Palestinians under international law OSLO, Norway — Norway is asking for a clarification on Israel’s responsibility under international law when preventing the United Nations, international humanitarian organizations and states from helping Palestinians. 'The international community cannot accept that the U.N., international humanitarian organizations and states face systematic obstacles to being able to work in Palestine and provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians under occupation,' Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Wednesday. 'It undermines the Palestinians’ right to vital aid. Then we have to react.' The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, also known as UNRWA, provides essential services to millions of Palestinians across the Middle East and has underpinned aid efforts in Gaza throughout the Israel-Hamas war. Legislation barring it from operating in Israel passed with an overwhelming majority Monday. Israel says UNRWA has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, with the militants siphoning off aid and using the agency’s facilities as shields. UNRWA denies the allegations, saying it is committed to neutrality and acts quickly to address any wrongdoing by its staff. Norway has called for a resolution in the U.N. General Assembly that asks the International Court of Justice 'to give an advisory opinion on the duties of Israel as an occupying power to facilitate aid to the population of Palestine.' Gahr Støre added that a number of countries have expressed support for the initiative, in addition to UNRWA. Under international law, Israel has an obligation to help the Palestinian population under occupation, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said. 'With this initiative, Norway wants to establish that no country can rise above its obligations under international law,' Barth Eide said. 'We see similar trends in other countries — that leaders try to undermine humanitarian law and aid work in situations of crisis and conflict. We must stop this development.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israel-issues-evacuation-warning-for-the-entire-baalbek-city-in-eastern-lebanon/	2024-10-30T04:51:25-07:00	
Israel must step in if it bans the UN agency that is a lifeline f...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations stressed Tuesday that if Israel puts in place new laws cutting ties with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, the Israeli government will have to meet their needs under international law. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a letter obtained by The Associated Press that there is no other alternative to the agency, known as UNRWA. It has been a lifeline during the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, and the Israeli legislation 'will have devastating consequences for Palestinian refugees' in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, he said. The U.N. agencies for children, health and migration also stressed that UNRWA is the 'backbone' of the world body’s operations in Gaza, where people have relied on its emergency food aid and health centers during the more than yearlong war, which has killed tens of thousands and left much of the enclave in ruins. The United Nations is heartened by statements of support for UNRWA from all quarters and countries, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, and 'we would very much appreciate efforts by any member state to help us get over this hurdle.' Israel has alleged that some of UNRWA’s 13,000 staffers in Gaza participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas that sparked the war. It's also accused hundreds of UNRWA staff of having militant ties and said it has found Hamas military assets in or under the agency’s facilities. Israel's new laws Two laws passed Monday could prevent UNRWA from continuing its work. Even the U.S., Israel's closest ally, joined many governments and humanitarian organizations in opposing the legislation, which doesn’t take effect for three months. Guterres sent the letter Tuesday to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlining his concerns. As an occupying power, under international humanitarian law, Israel is required to ensure the needs of the Palestinians are met, including for food, health care and education, Guterres said. And if Israel isn’t in a position to meet those needs, it has an obligation to allow and facilitate the activities of the U.N., and 'UNRWA is the principal means by which assistance is supplied to Palestinian refugees,' he said. If UNRWA's activities are restricted or halted, the secretary-general said, Israel would have to fill the vacuum 'to ensure the needs of the population are met.' 'Otherwise, it would be in violation of international law,' said Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon responded to the letter by saying, 'Rather than condemning UNRWA for turning a blind eye to terrorism and in some cases participating in terrorism, the U.N. instead condemns Israel.' He claimed in a statement that UNRWA isn’t interested in providing humanitarian aid to Gaza, calling it 'nothing but an arm of Hamas operating under the guise of the United Nations.' 'Israel will continue to facilitate humanitarian aid in Gaza according to international law,' Danon said, 'but UNRWA has failed in its mandate and is no longer the right agency for this job.' Dismay from U.N. agencies World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said UNRWA health workers have provided over 6 million medical consultations over the past year. They also offered immunizations, disease surveillance and screening for malnutrition, and UNRWA’s work 'couldn’t be matched by any agency — including WHO,' he said. Jeremy Laurence, spokesman for the U.N. human rights office, said that 'without UNRWA, the delivery of food, shelter, health care, education, amongst other things, to most of Gaza’s population would grind to a halt.' UNRWA was established by the U.N. General Assembly in 1949 to provide relief for Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes before and during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that followed Israel’s establishment, as well as their descendants. Israel faces criticism Timed to the Israeli laws, Norway announced Tuesday that it will ask the 193-nation General Assembly to request a ruling from the top United Nations court about whether Israel is obligated to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians by international organizations, including the U.N. The International Court of Justice in July condemned Israel’s rule over the Palestinian territories, declaring its occupation unlawful. The nonbinding opinion called on Israel to end its occupation and immediately halt settlement construction. Norway’s foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told the AP that Israel's policy is making it increasingly difficult for Palestinians to access life-saving assistance. He said Norway will argue that even if Israel's occupation is illegal, it has obligations, 'and we believe that these are not met.' Guterres told Netanyahu that while the Israeli laws prohibit any activity by UNRWA 'within the sovereign territory of the State of Israel,' the U.N. considers Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem part of the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel has no sovereignty because of its occupation. Meanwhile, at the U.N.’s regular Security Council meeting on the Middle East — this month open to all U.N. members — speakers supported UNRWA and virtually all called for immediate cease-fires in Gaza and Lebanon. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield expressed deep concern at the Israeli legislation, saying, 'right now there is no alternative to UNRWA when it comes to delivering food and other life-saving aid in Gaza.' She also called on Guterres 'to create a mechanism to review and address allegations that UNRWA personnel have ties to Hamas and other terrorist groups.' Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said its internal watchdog is working on that. He said a letter from the Israeli government last week raising specific undisclosed issues is also being looked at 'extremely seriously.' U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller went further, warning that the Israeli legislation 'poses risks for millions of Palestinians who rely on UNRWA for essential services.' Miller reiterated that the U.S. opposes the legislation and will be discussing it with Israel in the days ahead. He says there may be consequences under U.S. law and policy if it takes effect, referencing a letter that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent to their Israeli counterparts saying humanitarian aid must increase or the country risks losing military assistance. ___ Keaten reported from Geneva.

Israeli strikes in northern Gaza kill at least 88, officials say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Two Israeli airstrikes in the northern Gaza Strip on Tuesday killed at least 88 people, including dozens of women and children, health officials said, and the director of a hospital said life-threatening injuries were going untreated because a weekend raid by Israeli forces led to the detention of dozens of medics. Israel has escalated airstrikes and waged a bigger ground operation in northern Gaza in recent weeks, saying it is focused on rooting out Hamas militants who have regrouped after more than a year of war. The intense fighting is raising alarm about the worsening humanitarian conditions for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians still in northern Gaza. Concerns about not enough aid reaching Gaza were amplified Monday when Israeli lawmakers passed two laws to cut ties with the main U.N. agency distributing food, water and medicine, and to ban it from Israeli soil. Israel controls access to both Gaza and the occupied West Bank, and it was unclear how the agency known as UNRWA would continue its work in either place. 'The humanitarian operation in Gaza, if that is unraveled, that is a disaster within a series of disasters and just doesn’t bear thinking about,' said UNRWA spokesperson John Fowler. He said other U.N. agencies and international organizations distributing aid in Gaza rely on its logistics and thousands of workers. In Lebanon, the militant group Hezbollah said Tuesday it has chosen Sheikh Naim Kassem to succeed longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike last month. Hezbollah, which has fired rockets into Israel since the start of the war in Gaza, vowed to continue with Nasrallah’s policies 'until victory is achieved.' A short while later, eight Austrian soldiers serving in the U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon were reported lightly injured in a midday missile strike. The peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, said the rocket that struck its headquarters in Lebanon was 'likely' fired by Hezbollah, and that it struck a vehicle workshop. Strike in northern Gaza comes as Israel wages a major operation there The Gaza Health Ministry's emergency service said at least 70 people were killed and 23 were missing in the first of Tuesday's strikes in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. More than half of the victims were women and children, the ministry said. A mother and her five children — some of them adults — and a second mother with six children, were among those killed in the attack on a five-story building, according to the emergency service. A second strike on Beit Lahiya on Tuesday evening killed at least 18 people, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count. The nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital was overwhelmed by a wave of wounded women and children, including many who needed urgent surgeries, according to its director, Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya. The Israeli military raided the hospital over the weekend, detaining dozens of medics it said were Hamas militants. 'The situation is catastrophic in every sense of the word,' Safiya said, adding that the only remaining doctor at the hospital was a pediatrician. 'The health care system has collapsed and needs an urgent international intervention.' U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller referred to the 'horrifying incident' in Beit Lahiya in comments to reporters. He said Israel's yearlong campaign against Hamas has ensured it cannot repeat the type of attack that started the war in Gaza, but that 'getting to here came at a great cost to civilians.' The Israeli military said it was investigating the first Beit Lahiya strike; it did not immediately comment on the second. Israel’s recent operations in northern Gaza, focused in and around the Jabaliya refugee camp, have killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people in recent months. It says it carries out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but the strikes often kill women and children. On Tuesday, Israel said four more of its soldiers were killed in the fighting in northern Gaza, bringing the toll since the start of the operation to 16, including a colonel. As the fighting raged, Hamas signaled it was ready to resume cease-fire negotiations, although its key demands — a permanent cease-fire and full withdrawal of the Israeli military — do not appear to have changed, and have been dismissed in the past by Israel. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said on Tuesday the group has accepted mediators’ request to discuss 'new proposals.' Hezbollah's new leader has vowed to keep fighting Israel Hezbollah said in a statement that its decision-making Shura Council elected Kassem, who had been Nasrallah's deputy leader for over three decades, as the new secretary-general. Kassem, 71, a founding member of the militant group established following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, had been serving as acting leader. He has given several televised speeches vowing that Hezbollah will fight on despite a string of setbacks. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation, after Hamas’ surprise attack out of Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023. Iran, which backs both groups, has also directly traded fire with Israel, in April and then again this month. The tensions with Hezbollah boiled over in September, as Israel unleashed a wave of heavy airstrikes and killed Nasrallah and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon at the start of October. Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets into northern Israel on Tuesday, killing one person in the northern city of Maalot-Tarshiha, authorities said. Israeli strikes in the coastal city of Sidon killed at least five people, the Lebanese Health Ministry said. Israeli laws targeting UN agency could further restrict aid UNRWA and other international groups continued to express outrage Tuesday about the Israeli parliament's decision to cut ties to the agency. Israel says UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas and that the militant group siphons off aid and uses U.N. facilities to shield its activities, allegations denied by the U.N. agency. Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer vowed that aid will continue to reach Gaza, as Israel plans to coordinate with aid organizations or other bodies within the U.N. 'Ultimately, we will ensure that a more efficient replacement for UNRWA takes its role, not one which is infiltrated by the terrorist organization,' he said. Multiple U.N. agencies rallied Tuesday around UNRWA, calling it the 'backbone' of the world body’s aid activities in Gaza and other Palestinian areas. UNRWA provides education, health care and emergency aid to millions of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation and their descendants. Refugee families make up the majority of Gaza’s population. Israel has sharply restricted aid to northern Gaza this month, prompting a warning from the United States that failure to facilitate greater humanitarian assistance could lead to a reduction in military aid. In its attack on Israel last year, Hamas killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 as hostages. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced from their homes, often multiple times. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Mroue from Beirut.
