King of Jordan urges patience as Trump presses Gaza takeover	President Trump on Tuesday dug in on his vision for a U.S. takeover of the Gaza Strip as he sat alongside King Abdullah II of Jordan, who expressed reservations about the idea. Trump met in the Oval Office with Abdullah along with his son and heir, where the president remained adamant that Palestinians did not want to live in Gaza and would welcome relocating to Jordan, Egypt and elsewhere. That idea has been met with opposition from the greater Arab region as well as Turkey and other foreign allies. And Trump insisted the United States would 'have' Gaza, while offering few specifics on how it would acquire the territory without spending any money or deploying troops. 'We're not going to have to buy. We're going to have Gaza . We don't have to buy. There's nothing to buy. We will have Gaza,' Trump told reporters. 'It’s a war-torn area. We’re going to take it, we’re going to hold it, we’re going to cherish it…It’s going to be for the people in the MIddle East. But I think it could be a diamond.' One aspect of Trump’s plan that has run into stiff opposition in the Arab world is his declaration that Palestinians would relocate to Jordan and Egypt while Gaza is rebuilt. He has also offered mixed signals about the long-term fate of Palestinians. On Tuesday, Trump was again insistent that Palestinians did not want to live in Gaza. 'It's not where I want them to live, it's going to be where we ultimately choose as a group. And I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Jordan. I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Egypt. We may have some place else,' Trump said. 'But when we finish our talks they're going to have a place where they live very happily and very safely.' 'They don't want to be in the Gaza Strip. But they have no choice. They have to be,' Trump added. The king of Jordan sought to temper expectations around Trump’s proposal during their meeting, saying Egypt and other Arab nations expect to present a proposal to the United States but not just yet in an attempt to slow Trump’s roll on the idea. 'This is something that we as Arabs will be coming to the United States with something that we're going to talk about later to discuss all these options,' Abdullah said. Abdullah extended an olive branch to Trump early in the meeting, praising the president as 'somebody that can take us across the finish line to bring stability, peace and prosperity to all of us in the region.' Abdullah also said Jordan would accept 2,000 sick Palestinian children, which Trump praised as a 'beautiful gesture.' Trump in turn sought to back pedal remarks he made the day before over whether he would threaten aid to Jordan and Egypt if they were not on board with his plan to relocate Palestinians that remain in Gaza. Trump sent shockwaves through the Middle East last week when he proposed the United States would take control of the Gaza Strip and rebuild it. Leaders in the region have said efforts to displace Palestinians or move them into neighboring countries are a nonstarter. Egypt and Jordan — countries with peace treaties with Israel — oppose absorbing more Palestinians, claiming it poses a security risk, is destabilizing and threatens to provoke mass opposition. Jordan already houses about 3 million Palestinians, many of whom have been displaced by prior wars. Egypt announced Sunday it would host a summit of Arab nations on Feb. 27 to discuss the latest developments around the future of Palestinians, according to The Associated Press.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/king-of-jordan-urges-patience-as-trump-presses-gaza-takeover/	2025-02-11T10:36:57-08:00	
Netanyahu threatens to resume fighting in Gaza if hostages aren't...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday threatened to withdraw from the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and resume its fight against Hamas if the militant group does not go ahead with the next scheduled release of hostages on Saturday. Hamas said Monday — and reiterated Tuesday — that it planned to delay the release of three more hostages after accusing Israel of failing to meet the terms of the ceasefire, including by not allowing enough tents and other aid into Gaza. U.S. President Donald Trump has emboldened Israel to call for the release of even more remaining hostages on Saturday, but it wasn't immediately clear whether Netanyahu's threat referred to the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza, or just the three scheduled for release on Saturday. Earlier Tuesday, an Israeli official said Netanyahu ordered the army to add more troops in and around the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu also ordered officials 'to prepare for every scenario if Hamas doesn’t release our hostages this Saturday,' according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting. Israel had signaled Monday it planned to reinforce defenses along the Gaza border. The all-scenario plan was announced during a four-hour meeting between Netanyahu and his Security Cabinet that focused on Hamas’ threat, which risks jeopardizing the three-week-old ceasefire. So far, Hamas has released 21 hostages in a series of exchanges for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. President Donald Trump has said Israel should cancel the entire ceasefire if all of the roughly 70 hostages aren’t freed by Saturday. Hamas brushed off his threat on Tuesday, doubling down on its claim that Israel has violated the ceasefire and warned that it would only continue releasing hostages if all parties adhered to the ceasefire. Trump is hosting Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday as he escalates pressure on the Arab nation to take in refugees from Gaza — perhaps permanently — as part of his audacious plan to remake the Middle East. Palestinians and the international community have seethed over Trump's recent comments that any Palestinians potentially expelled from Gaza would not have a right to return. During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas committed to freeing 33 hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, while Israel said it would release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The sides have carried out five swaps since Jan. 19. The war could resume in early March if no agreement is reached on the more complicated second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for the return of all remaining hostages and an indefinite extension of the truce. But if Israel resumes the war, it will face a drastically different battlefield. After forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to evacuate to southern Gaza in the early stages of the war, Israel allowed many of those displaced people to return to what is left of their homes, posing a new challenge to its ability to move ground troops through the territory.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-orders-beefed-up-troops-around-gaza-as-ceasefire-shows-signs-of-faltering/	2025-02-11T09:30:04-08:00	
Some Israeli soldiers traveling abroad are targeted for alleged w...	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — An Israeli army reservist's dream vacation in Brazil ended abruptly last month over an accusation that he committed war crimes in the Gaza Strip. Yuval Vagdani woke up on Jan. 4 to a flurry of missed calls from family members and Israel's Foreign Ministry with an urgent warning: A pro-Palestinian legal group had convinced a federal judge in Brazil to open a war crimes investigation for his alleged participation in the demolition of civilian homes in Gaza. A frightened Vagdani fled the country on a commercial flight the next day to avoid the grip of a powerful legal concept called 'universal jurisdiction,' which allows governments to prosecute people for the most serious crimes regardless of where they are allegedly committed. Vagdani, a survivor of Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack on an Israeli music festival, told an Israeli radio station the accusation felt like 'a bullet in the heart.' The case against Vagdani was brought by the Hind Rajab Foundation, a legal group based in Belgium named after a young girl who Palestinians say was killed early in the war by Israeli fire as she and her family fled Gaza City. Aided by geolocation data, the group built its case around Vagdani's own social media posts. A photograph showed him in uniform in Gaza, where he served in an infantry unit; a video showed a large explosion of buildings in Gaza during which soldiers can be heard cheering. Judges at the International Criminal Court concluded last year there was enough evidence to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for crimes against humanity for using 'starvation as a method of warfare' and for intentionally targeting civilians. Both Israel and Netanyahu have vehemently denied the accusations. Since forming last year, Hind Rajab has made dozens of complaints in more than 10 countries to arrest both low-level and high-ranking Israeli soldiers. Its campaign has yet to yield any arrests. But it has led Israel to tighten restrictions on social media usage among military personnel. 'It’s our responsibility, as far as we are concerned, to bring the cases,' Haroon Raza, a co-founder of Hind Rajab, said from his office in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It is then up to authorities in each country — or the International Criminal Court — to pursue them, he added. The director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, Eden Bar-Tal, last month said fewer than a dozen soldiers had been targeted, and he dismissed the attempted arrests as a futile public relations stunt by 'terrorist organizations.' Universal jurisdiction is not new. The 1949 Geneva Conventions -- the post Second World War treaty regulating military conduct — specify that all signatories must prosecute war criminals or hand them over to a country who will. In 1999, the United Nations Security Council asked all U.N. countries to include universal jurisdiction in their legal codes, and around 160 countries have adopted them in some form. 'Certain crimes like war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity are crimes under international law,' said Marieke de Hoon, an international law expert at the University of Amsterdam. 'And we’ve recognized in international law that any state has jurisdiction over those egregious crimes.' Israel used the concept to prosecute Adolf Eichmann, an architect of the Holocaust. Mossad agents caught him in Argentina in 1960 and brought him to Israel where he was sentenced to death by hanging. More recently, a former Syrian secret police officer was convicted in 2022 by a German court of crimes against humanity a decade earlier for overseeing the abuse of detainees at a jail. Later that year, an Iranian citizen was convicted by a Swedish court of war crimes during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. In 2023, 16 people were convicted of war crimes through universal jurisdiction, according to TRIAL International, a Swiss organization that tracks proceedings. Those convictions were related to crimes committed in Syria, Rwanda, Iran and other countries. In response to Brazil's pursuit of Vagdani, the Israeli military has prohibited soldiers below a certain rank from being named in news articles and requires their faces to be obscured. It has also warned soldiers against social media posts related to their military service or travel plans. The evidence Hind Rajab lawyers presented to the judge in Brazil came mostly from Vagdani’s social media accounts. 'That's what they saw and that's why they want me for their investigation,' he told the Israeli radio station Kan. 'From one house explosion they made 500 pages. They thought I murdered thousands of children.' Vagdani does not appear in the video and he did not say whether he had carried out the explosion himself, telling the station he had come into Gaza for 'maneuvers' and 'was in the battles of my life.' Social media has made it easier in recent years for legal groups to gather evidence. For example, several Islamic State militants have been convicted of crimes committed in Syria by courts in various European countries, where lawyers relied on videos posted online, according to de Hoon. The power of universal jurisdiction has limits. In the Netherlands, where Hind Rajab has filed more than a dozen complaints, either the victim or perpetrator must hold Dutch nationality, or the suspect must be in the country for the entirety of the investigation — factors likely to protect Israeli tourists from prosecution. Eleven complaints against 15 Israeli soldiers have been dismissed, some because the accused was only in the country for a short time, according to Dutch prosecutors. Two complaints involving four soldiers are pending. In 2016, activists in the U.K. made unsuccessful attempts to arrest Israeli military and political leaders for their roles in the 2008-09 war in Gaza. Raza says his group will persist. 'It might take 10 years. It might be 20 years. No problem. We are ready to have patience.' There is no statute of limitations on war crimes. ___ Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-some-israeli-soldiers-traveling-abroad-are-targeted-for-alleged-war-crimes-in-gaza/	2025-02-11T05:40:26-08:00	
Hamas' threat to delay the next release of Israeli hostages raise...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Hamas' threat to delay the next planned release of Israeli hostages from the Gaza Strip has jolted a fragile ceasefire that’s seen as having the potential to wind down the war. It has brought new dismay for Israelis who watched the latest Hamas handover of hostages in growing horror over the weekend as the three emaciated men came into sight. Of the 17 hostages yet to be released from Gaza under this phase of the ceasefire, Israel has said eight are dead. President Donald Trump responded to Hamas' threat by saying the ceasefire should be canceled if all the remaining hostages are not freed by midday Saturday, though he said that was Israel's decision to make. The militant group brushed off the threat, saying the hostages would only be returned if all sides held to the truce. The next handover of three hostages had been scheduled for Saturday, and families say time is running out for those still alive. Israel now awaits what comes from a security Cabinet meeting moved up in response to Monday's Hamas announcement. The developments also have led to new fear in Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have surged to what remains of their homes in the territory’s north after fleeing in the war’s earliest weeks. The uncertainty, just over halfway into the ceasefire’s six-week first phase, complicates talks on the far more difficult second phase. It also jeopardizes the pause in the devastating fighting and the increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza that the truce has made possible. Already, there had been concerns that the war would resume at the end of the first phase in early March. What happened? Hamas accused Israel of not holding up its end of the deal by initially delaying the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza over an earlier dispute, carrying out strikes across the territory and hindering the entry of tents, mobile homes and medical supplies for hospitals. The militant group, which quickly reasserted control over Gaza when the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, said the next hostage release would be delayed 'until further notice.' Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz called the delay 'a complete violation' of the ceasefire agreement, and he instructed the military to be on highest alert. The prime minister’s coordinator for hostages said the government intends to live up to its end of the deal. A later Hamas statement called the postponement a 'warning signal' to Israel and noted that five days remained for mediators – the United States, Qatar and Egypt -- to pressure Israel to act. 'The door remains open for the exchange to proceed as planned if Israel abides by its obligations,' it said. There was no immediate public reaction from the other mediators. What’s Trump saying? The Hamas announcement came as Trump pressed further on his stunning proposal to remove the Palestinian population from devastated Gaza and have the U.S. take 'ownership' of the territory. He told Fox News on Sunday that the Palestinians would not have the right to return. That deepened the shock among Palestinians, who live with the history of fleeing or being forced from their homes in what is now Israel during the 1948 war. And it brought new condemnation from Arab nations that have long pressed for an independent Palestinian state. Trump’s comments contradicted some of his own administration officials who had said the president was only calling for the Palestinians’ temporary relocation. Hamas has repeatedly condemned Trump's Gaza proposal but has not linked those objections to the future of the ceasefire. Who and what is at stake? In immediate limbo is the planned release on Saturday of three more Israeli hostages, along with dozens more Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody. Such exchanges — five so far in a gradual release of 33 hostages — have been sometimes tense and chaotic acts of trust that have gradually pushed the ceasefire forward, allowing its other measures to fall into place. But the latest release brought home like no other the bleak and dangerous conditions for those still held in Gaza. Relatives of the newly released hostages, at times sobbing, have described people being chained or held underground for months and eating half a piece of pita per day. Freed hostages have described going months without showering. The accounts have put furious new pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to begin the delayed talks on the ceasefire’s second phase, which is meant to see dozens of remaining hostages released and bring a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. 'The hostages are in a clear and present danger. Their lives are at risk,' a doctor working with families of hostages, Hagai Levine, warned on Monday. 'Delaying their release means that some of them will not survive.' ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-a-hamas-delay-in-gazas-next-hostage-release-brings-fear-on-all-sides-for-ceasefire/	2025-02-11T04:47:51-08:00	
Ukraine and Russia trade long-range attacks as officials probe po...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces targeted Ukraine’s energy and gas infrastructure in a 'massive' nighttime missile attack and Ukrainian drones struck an important oil refinery inside Russia, officials said Tuesday, as the near three-year war rumbled on against a backdrop of renewed diplomatic efforts to end it. Ukraine’s state energy company, Ukrenergo, said it imposed emergency blackouts due to the Russian attack. Russia has repeatedly hammered Ukraine’s power grid throughout the war. Meanwhile, as part of its long-range drone campaign against targets deep inside Russia, Ukraine hit a refinery in Russia’s Saratov region about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from Ukraine's border, the Army General Staff claimed. The facility produces gasoline, fuel oil and diesel fuel for the Russian military, it said. International efforts are afoot to stop the fighting, with President Donald Trump’s senior advisers expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later this week on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference to discuss a path toward ending the war. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, are among the U.S. administration officials traveling to Germany for the summit. Zelenskyy said late Monday that Trump's representatives will visit Ukraine this week, ahead of Munich, though he didn’t provide details. The Ukrainian government aims to sidestep new U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, according to Ukraine’s First Deputy Prime Minister and Economic Development Minister, Yuliia Svyrydenko. Metallurgical products make up nearly 58% of Ukrainian exports to the U.S., earning Ukraine just over $500 million last year, she said. Ukraine is also offering to make a deal with Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine’s mineral industry, including rare earth elements needed for modern technology. The Ukrainian air force said Russia fired 124 Shahed and decoy drones across Ukraine overnight. In addition, at least 19 Russian missiles of various types hit Ukrainian gas production facilities, it said. Reports in Russia of the claimed Ukrainian drone attack were sketchy. Officials rarely provide details of successful Ukrainian attacks. The governor of Russia’s Saratov region, Roman Busargin, reported a Ukrainian drone attack that sparked a brief fire and inflicted damage on an unspecified 'industrial facility.' He said that the fire was put out within hours. One unconfirmed Russian media report identified the attacked facility as the Saratov oil refinery, part of Russia’s state-run oil giant Rosneft. Some other unconfirmed reports said the attack also targeted Engels, a city in the Saratov region that houses multiple industrial plants. In addition, the main base of Russia’s nuclear-capable strategic bombers is located just outside Engels. It has come under repeated Ukrainian drone attacks since the early stages of the war, forcing the Russian military to relocate most of its bombers to other areas. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraine-and-russia-trade-long-range-attacks-as-officials-probe-possibilities-for-peace/	2025-02-11T04:22:04-08:00	
Ukraine offers rare earth deal to Trump for more US military aid	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine’s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology. Trump said that he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv’s hand in future negotiations with Moscow. 'We really have this big potential in the territory which we control,' Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. 'We are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.' Here is a look at Ukraine’s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together: What are rare earth elements? Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles. It's unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer. 'It can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,' Yermak said. 'It’s a lot.' China, Trump’s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world’s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing. For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally doesn't freeze military support. That would be devastating for the country, which has been at war for nearly three years after Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally. What is the state of the Ukrainian minerals industry? Ukraine’s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining. Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts. In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe’s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe’s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass. In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country’s gross domestic product and 30% of exports. An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Trump’s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more. The European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for more than 20 critical raw materials and concluded that if the country joins the 27-nation EU, it could strengthen the European economy. What happens next? Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy and Trump will probably discuss the subject when they meet. U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms. It's unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies. ___ Susie Blann contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-why-are-ukraines-minerals-key-to-keeping-us-military-aid-flowing/	2025-02-11T04:18:27-08:00	
Trump’s proposal for Gaza entangles Arab allies	President Trump’s proposal to permanently resettle Palestinians from the Gaza Strip is complicating relationships with allies in the Arab world. His meeting Tuesday with Jordan’s King Abdullah II stands to be an awkward moment as Trump continues to suggest Abdullah’s country take in more Palestinians, who by some estimates already take up about half the population. But Trump’s proposal has been met with steep opposition from the greater Arab world, who see Palestinian resettlement as a nonstarter, in addition to going against decades of U.S. foreign policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 'Arab nations and global leaders have been clear in their opposition to the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and the urgent need to rebuild Gaza so its people can live with dignity and security,' said Iman Awad, national director of policy and advocacy at Emgage Action, a Muslim American advocacy group, in a statement. 'In particular, we expect that the upcoming meeting with the Jordanian King will reinforce these concerns, underscoring the necessity of upholding international law and preventing the displacement of millions of Palestinians,' Awad added. Trump sent shockwaves through the Middle East last week when he proposed the United States would take control of the Gaza Strip and rebuild it. He since has offered some new details of his vision, including that U.S. troops would not get involved, while sending mixed messages about the fate of Palestinians. The president for weeks has said he would like to see Jordan, Egypt and other nations in the region take in Palestinians who would be relocated out of Gaza. While the White House has suggested the relocation would only be temporary while Gaza is rebuilt — something officials have said could take 10 years to 15 years — Trump has been less clear about the long-term plan for displaced Palestinians. 'It would be my hope that we could do something really nice, really good, where they wouldn’t want to return. Why would they want to return? The place has been hell,' Trump told reporters last week alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But Trump then told Fox News’s Bret Baier during a pre-Super Bowl interview that Palestinians would not have the right to return to Gaza after it is rebuilt 'because they're going to have much better housing.' 'In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them because if they have to return now, it’ll be years before you could ever — it's not habitable. It would be years before it could happen,' Trump said. But Trump’s proposal has fallen flat with the Arab nations that would be key to making it happen. Leaders in the region have said efforts to displace Palestinians or move them into neighboring countries are a nonstarter. Egypt and Jordan — countries with peace treaties with Israel — oppose absorbing more Palestinians, claiming it poses a security risk, is destabilizing and threatens to provoke mass opposition. Jordan already houses about 3 million Palestinians, many of whom have been displaced by prior wars. Egypt announced Sunday it would host a summit of Arab nations on Feb. 27 to discuss the latest developments around the future of Palestinians, according to The Associated Press. Some experts have suggested Trump’s proposal may be a negotiating tactic, just as he used the threat of tariffs against Mexico and Canada to secure commitments to protecting the border. But Trump administration officials have touted the president’s proposal as an out-of-the-box suggestion to address a decades-long quagmire. 'Now is the time for the other governments and other powers in the region, some of these very rich countries, to basically say, OK, we’ll do it. We’re going to pay for this; we’re going to step forward; we’re going to be the ones that take charge,' Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday on SiriusXM. 'None of them is offering to do it,' he added. 'And I think that you can’t go around claiming that you’re a fighter for, an advocate for the Palestinian people, but you’re not willing to do anything to help rebuild Gaza.' Rubio is set to travel to the Middle East later this week, with stops planned in Israel, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Trump’s controversial proposal will serve as the backdrop for a key meeting Tuesday, when the president hosts Jordan’s king at the White House. While in Washington, Abdullah is set to meet with Trump, Rubio, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz, special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and members of Congress. Abdullah met Sunday with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment about what would be on the agenda for Tuesday’s meeting, but the Gaza proposal is expected to be central to the visit. Abdullah met Wednesday with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the day after Trump first floated the idea of the U.S. taking over Gaza. The Jordanian royal court posted on social media following that meeting that Abdullah 'stresses the need to put a stop to settlement expansion, expressing rejection of any attempts to annex land and displace the Palestinians.' A former National Security Council aide in the Biden White House argued Trump’s comments about Gaza 'overshadow the meeting and start it out on a pretty rough note.' 'Driving a wedge with our allies especially in pursuit of goals that are unrealistic … and cause significant heartburn in the region for our allies, it just makes no sense,' the aide said.

Israel's fatal shooting of a pregnant Palestinian woman raises fe...	KAFR AL-LABAD, West Bank (AP) — The call came in the middle of the night, Mohammed Shula said. His daughter-in-law, eight months pregnant with her first child, was whispering. There was panic in her voice. 'Help, please,' Shula recalled her saying. 'You have to save us.' Minutes later, Sondos Shalabi was fatally shot. Shalabi and her husband, 26-year-old Yazan Shula, had fled their home in the early hours of Sunday as Israeli security forces closed in on Nur Shams refugee camp, a crowded urban district in the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem. Israeli military vehicles surrounded the camp days earlier, part of a larger crackdown on Palestinian militants across the northern occupied West Bank that has escalated since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza took effect last month. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has announced the expansion of the army’s operations, saying it aimed to stop Iran — Hamas’ ally — from opening up a new front in the occupied territory. Palestinians see the shooting of Shalabi, 23, as part of a worrying trend toward more lethal, warlike Israeli tactics in the West Bank. The Israeli army issued a short statement afterward, saying it had referred her shooting to the military police for criminal investigation. Also on Sunday, just a few streets away, another young Palestinian woman, 21, was killed by the Israeli army. An explosive device it had planted detonated as she approached her front door. In response, the Israeli army said that a wanted militant was in her house, compelling Israeli forces to break down the door. It said the woman did not leave despite the soldiers’ calls. The army said it 'regrets any harm caused to uninvolved civilians.' Across the West Bank and east Jerusalem, at least 905 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered the war in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Many appear to have been militants killed in gunbattles during Israeli raids. But rock-throwing protesters and uninvolved civilians — including a 2-year-old girl, a 10-year-old boy and 73-year-old man — have also been killed in recent weeks. 'The basic rules of fighting, of confronting the Palestinians, is different now,' said Maher Kanan, a member of the emergency response team in the nearby village of Anabta, describing what he sees as the army's new attitude and tactics. 'The displacement, the number of civilians killed, they are doing here what they did in Gaza.' Mohammed Shula, 58, told The Associated Press that his son and daughter-in-law said they started plotting their flight from Nur Shams last week as Israeli drones crisscrossed the sky, Palestinian militants boobytrapped the roads and their baby's due date approached. His son 'was worried about (Shalabi) all the time. He knew that she wouldn’t be able to deliver the baby if the siege got worse,' he said. Yazan Shula, a construction worker in Israel who lost his job after the Israeli government banned nearly 200,000 Palestinian workers from entering its territory, couldn't wait to be a father, his own father said. Shalabi, quiet and kind, was like a daughter to him — moving into their house in Nur Shams 18 month sago, after marrying his son. 'This baby is what they were living for,' he said. Early Sunday, the young couple packed up some clothes and belongings. The plan was simple — they would drive to the home of Shalabi’s parents outside the camp, some miles away in Tulkarem where soldiers weren't operating. It was safer there, and near the hospital where Shalabi planned to give birth. Yazan Shula's younger brother, 19-year-old Bilal, also wanted to get out and jumped in the backseat. Not long after the three of them drove off, there was a burst of gunfire. Mohammed Shula's phone rang. His daughter-in-law's breaths came in gasps, he said. An Israeli sniper had shot her husband, she told her father-in-law, and blood was flowing from the back of his head. She was unscathed, but had no idea what to do. He coached her into staying calm. He told her to knock on the door of any house to ask for help. Her phone on speaker, he could hear her knocking and shrieking, he said. No one was answering. She told him she could see soldiers approaching. The line went dead, said Mohammed Shula, who then called the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. 'We couldn't go outside because we were afraid we'd be shot,' said Suleiman Zuheiri, 65, a neighbor of the Shula family who was helping the medics reach their bodies. 'We tried and tried. All in vain. (The medics) kept getting turned back, and the girl kept bleeding.' Bilal Shula wasn’t hurt. He was arrested from the scene and detained for several hours. The Red Crescent said that the International Committee of the Red Cross had secured approval from the Israeli military to allow medics inside the camp. But the paramedics were detained twice, for a half-hour each time, as they made their way toward the battered car, it said. The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment on why soldiers had blocked ambulances. It wasn't until after 8:00 a.m. that medics finally reached the young couple, and were detained a third time while rushing the husband out of the camp to the hospital, the Red Crescent said. Yazan Shula was unconscious and in critical condition, and, as of Tuesday, remains on life support at a hospital. Shalabi was found dead. Her fetus also did not survive the shooting. Mohammed Shula keeps thinking about how soldiers saw Shalabi's body bleeding on the ground and did nothing to help as they handcuffed his other son and marched him into their vehicle. 'Why did they shoot them? They were doing nothing wrong. They could have stopped them, asked a question, but no, they just shot,' he said, his fingers busily rubbing a strand of prayer beads. Israeli security forces invaded the camp some hours later. Explosions resounded through the alleyways. Armored bulldozers rumbled down the roads, chewing up the pavement and rupturing underground water pipes. The electricity went out. Then the taps ran dry. Before Mohammed Shula could process what was happening, he said, Israeli troops banged on his front door and ordered everyone — his daughter, son and several grandchildren, one of them a year old, another two months old — to leave their home. The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment on why it was forcibly evacuating civilian homes in Nur Shams. Mohammed Shula pointed to a bag of baby diapers in the corner of his friend's living room. That's all he had time to bring with him, he said, not even photographs, or clothes.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israels-fatal-shooting-of-a-pregnant-palestinian-woman-raises-fears-in-the-west-bank/	2025-02-11T02:23:50-08:00	
Trump will host Jordan's King Abdullah II as he escalates pressur...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will host Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday as he escalates pressure on the Arab nation to take in refugees from Gaza — perhaps permanently — as part of his audacious plan to remake the Middle East. The visit is happening at a perilous moment for the ongoing ceasefire in Gaza as Hamas, accusing Israel of violating the truce, has said it is pausing future releases of hostages and as Trump has called for Israel to resume fighting if all those remaining in captivity are not freed by this weekend. Trump has proposed the U.S. take control of Gaza and turn it into 'the Riviera of the Middle East,' with Palestinians in the war-torn territory pushed into neighboring nations with no right of return. He suggested on Monday that, if necessary, he would withhold U.S. funding from Jordan and Egypt, longtime U.S. allies and among the top recipients of its foreign aid, as a means of persuading them to accept additional Palestinians from Gaza. 'Yeah, maybe. Sure, why not?' Trump told reporters. 'If they don’t, I would conceivably withhold aid, yes.' Jordan is home to more than 2 million Palestinians and, along with other Arab states, has flatly rejected Trump's plan to relocate civilians from Gaza. Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said last week that his country’s opposition to Trump’s idea was 'firm and unwavering.' In addition to concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily. When asked how he’d persuade Abdullah to take in Palestinians, Trump told reporters, 'I do think he’ll take, and I think other countries will take also. They have good hearts.' The king is also meeting with top Trump administration officials during his visit, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He is the third foreign leader to hold an in-person meeting with Trump since his Jan. 20 inauguration. Trump announced his ideas for resettling Palestinians from Gaza and taking ownership of the territory for the U.S. during a press conference last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump initially didn’t rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure Gaza but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of the territory, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan. After Trump’s initial comments, Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza 'temporarily' and sought an 'interim' period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordnance and reconstruction. But asked in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier that aired Monday if Palestinians in Gaza would have a right to return to the territory under his plan, he replied, 'No, they wouldn’t.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-trump-will-host-jordans-king-abdullah-ii-as-he-escalates-pressure-on-his-gaza-resettlement-plan/	2025-02-10T21:01:44-08:00	
Trump says no right of return for Palestinians in Gaza under his ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Palestinians in Gaza would not have a right to return under his plan for U.S. 'ownership' of the war-torn territory, contradicting other officials in his administration who have sought to argue Trump was only calling for the temporary relocation of its population. Less than a week after he floated his plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and turn it in 'the Riviera of the Middle East,' Trump, in an interview with FOX News' Bret Baier that was set to air on Monday, said 'No, they wouldn’t' when asked if Palestinians in Gaza would have a right to return to the territory. It comes as he has ramped up pressure on Arab states, especially U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt, to take in Palestinians from Gaza, who claim the territory as part of a future homeland. 'We’ll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is,' Trump said. 'In the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land. No big money spent.' Arab nations have sharply criticized the Trump proposal, and Trump’s latest words were released a day before he is set to host Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday. In addition to concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily. Trump's comments risked jeopardizing the already tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza after 15 months of war, with the existing framework for negotiations calling for the massive humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for civilians in Gaza. After Trump's initial comments last week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Secretary of State Marco Rubio respectfully insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza 'temporarily' and for an 'interim' period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordinance and reconstruction. Trump last week didn't rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure the territory but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of Gaza, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan. Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty’s said there is 'Arab consensus' on the rejection of the transfer of Palestinians, as Trump continued to press his suggestion of moving Palestinians out of Gaza. Abdelatty stressed on 'the importance of finding a political horizon for the Palestinian cause, leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, and for the Palestinian people to enjoy the right of self-determination,' the Egyptian foreign ministry statement said. A senior Hamas official blasted Trump’s latest remarks about the U.S. ownership of Gaza, as 'absurd.' Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas politico bureau, said these comments 'reflect a deep ignorance of Palestine and the region.' In comments released by Hamas early Monday, he said Trump’s approach toward the Palestinian cause will fail. 'Dealing with the Palestinian cause with the mentality of a real estate dealer is a recipe for failure,' he said. 'Our Palestinian people will thwart all transfer and deportation plans.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo contributed.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-trump-says-no-right-of-return-for-palestinians-in-gaza-under-his-plan-for-us-ownership/	2025-02-10T10:35:54-08:00	
Hamas says it will delay the release of more hostages, putting fr...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Hamas said Monday it will delay the further release of hostages in the Gaza Strip after accusing Israel of violating a fragile ceasefire that now faces its most serious crisis since it began three weeks ago. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under heavy pressure to secure the release of remaining hostages after last Saturday’s release, in which three Israelis came home emaciated after 16 months in Hamas captivity. Hamas’ announcement to delay the next planned release of hostages came as Palestinians and the international community seethed over U.S. President Donald Trump's recent comments that Palestinians from Gaza would not have a right to return under his plan for 'ownership' of the war-torn territory after helping to rebuild it. In an effort to improve relations with the Trump administration, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday ended a controversial system that paid stipends to the families of Palestinian prisoners, including those convicted in deadly attacks on Israel. The U.S. and Israel have said the so-called 'martyrs fund' rewarded violence against Israel. Israel and Hamas are in the midst of a six-week ceasefire during which Hamas has committed to releasing 33 hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The sides have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire went into effect last month, freeing 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners. The next exchange, scheduled for Saturday, called for three more Israeli hostages to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Threatening a fragile ceasefire deal An Israeli official said Netanyahu was consulting security officials after the Hamas announcement. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Netanyahu also pushed forward a scheduled meeting of his Security Cabinet to Tuesday morning from later in the day. Defense Minister Israel Katz said Hamas’ plan to delay the next release of hostages was 'a complete violation' of the ceasefire agreement and that he instructed the Israeli military to be on the highest level of alert. The Prime Minister's coordinator for hostages said all of the hostage families had been updated about Hamas' announcement and that Israel 'insists on fulfilling the agreement in its entirety.' Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida said on social media that Israel has obstructed key provisions of the ceasefire by not allowing Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, carrying out strikes across the territory and failing to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid. The Hostages and Missing Family Forum, which represents many of the hostage families, called on mediating countries to restore the existing deal. 'Recent evidence from those released, as well as the shocking conditions of the hostages released last Saturday, leaves no room for doubt — time is of the essence, and all hostages must be urgently rescued from this horrific situation,' the Forum said. Trump made his latest comments about Gaza in an interview with FOX News set to air Monday, less than a week after he floated his plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and turn it in 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' He has also ramped up pressure on Arab states, especially U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt, to take in Palestinians from Gaza, who claim the territory as part of a future homeland. The ceasefire previously hit a snag when an Israeli female civilian held hostage wasn't released as early as planned, and Israel delayed the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza for two days. Negotiators were able to find a solution, and the hostage, Arbel Yahoud, was eventually released with two other hostages. Palestinian Authority ends payments to prisoners' families Under the new system announced by Abbas, the Palestinian president, prisoners’ families will still be eligible for government assistance, but only depending on their financial needs. Previously, payments were determined based on the amount of time a prisoner had spent in prison. The system will also be transferred from the Palestinian government to an outside foundation. There was no immediate reaction from the U.S. or Israel. During Trump’s first term, the U.S. halted assistance to the Palestinian Authority because of the martyr’s fund. Israel has withheld hundreds of millions of dollars of tax transfers to the cash-strapped authority because of the policy. A senior Palestinian official said the Palestinians have informed the Trump administration of the decision and hope the U.S. legislation cutting assistance, known as the Taylor Force Act, will be rescinded and that Israel will unfreeze the transfers. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing internal deliberations. ___ Associated Press writer Samy Magdy contributed from Cairo.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hamas-accuses-israel-of-ceasefire-violations-and-says-it-will-delay-next-hostage-release/	2025-02-10T09:53:28-08:00

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A performer in Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl halftime show was detained on the field and could face charges after unfurling a combination Sudanese-Palestinian flag with 'Sudan' and 'Gaza' written on it. The NFL confirmed the person was part of the 400-member field cast. The New Orleans Police Department said in a statement that 'law enforcement is working to determine applicable charges in this incident.' 'The individual will (be) banned for life from all NFL stadiums and events,' NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy said in an emailed statement. The performer stood on a car used as a prop for Lamar's performance and held up the flag. The NFL said 'the individual hid the item on his person and unveiled it late in the show' and that 'no one involved with the production was aware of the individual’s intent.' Taylor Swift booed by heavily pro-Eagles crowd at the Super Bowl Roc Nation, the entertainment company which produced the show, said that the act 'was neither planned nor part of the production and was never in any rehearsal.' The show continued without interruption, and it did not seem as though the person was shown on the broadcast of Lamar’s performance.	https://wgntv.com/news/super-bowl-halftime-performer-detained-after-unfurling-sudanese-palestinian-flag-2/	2025-02-10T07:19:07-08:00	
Famine mostly averted but is a danger again if Gaza ceasefire col...	CAIRO (AP) — Famine has been mostly averted in Gaza as a surge of aid enters the territory during a fragile ceasefire, the United Nations humanitarian chief said Sunday. But he warned the threat could return quickly if the truce collapses. Tom Fletcher spoke to The Associated Press after a two-day visit to Gaza, where hundreds of trucks carrying humanitarian aid have arrived each day since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19. 'The threat of famine, I think, is largely averted,' Fletcher said in Cairo. 'Those starvation levels are down from where they were before the ceasefire.' He spoke as concerns grow over whether the ceasefire can be extended and talks are meant to begin on its more difficult second phase. The six-week first phase is halfway through. As part of the agreement, Israel said it would allow 600 aid trucks into Gaza each day, a major increase after months of aid officials expressing frustration about delays and insecurity hampering both the entry and distribution of food, medicines and other badly needed items. The U.N. humanitarian office has said more than 12,600 aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire took effect. Fletcher urged both Hamas, which quickly reasserted its control of the territory in the hours after the ceasefire took effect, and Israel to stick to the deal that has 'saved so many lives.' 'The conditions are still terrible, and people are still hungry,' he said. 'If the ceasefire falls, if the ceasefire breaks, then very quickly those (famine-like) conditions will come back again.' The internationally recognized mortality threshold for famine is two or more deaths a day per 10,000 people. For months before the current ceasefire, food security monitors, U.N. officials and others had been warning of possible famine in parts of devastated Gaza, especially the north, which had been largely isolated since the earliest weeks of the 16-month war. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been able to return to the north under the ceasefire. 'We can’t ... sit by and just allow these people to starve to death,' Cindy McCain, the American head of the U.N. World Food Program, told CBS in December. The Biden administration repeatedly urged Israel to allow more aid deliveries and warned that failing to do so could trigger U.S. restrictions on military support. Fletcher said more food and medical supplies are crucially needed for the territory of more than 2 million people, most of them displaced, and he expressed concerns about disease outbreaks due to the lack of basic health supplies. He also called for scaling up the delivery of tents and other shelters to those who have returned to their home areas, as winter continues. 'We must get tens of thousands of tents very rapidly in, so that people who are moving back, particularly moving back into the north, are able to take shelter from those conditions,' he said. Fletcher entered the Palestinian territory through the Erez crossing between Israel and northern Gaza, where he said he drove through 'bombed-out, flattened and pulverized' areas. 'You can’t see the difference between a school or a hospital or a home,' he said of the north. He said he saw people trying to find where their homes had been and collecting the bodies of loved ones from the rubble. He saw dogs looking for corpses in the rubble, too. 'It is a horror movie. It’s a horror show,' he said. 'It breaks your heart again and again and again. You drive for miles and miles and miles, and this is all you see.' Fletcher acknowledged that some Palestinians have been angry at the international community over the war and its response. 'There was despair and anger. And I can understand the anger at the world that this has happened to them,' he said. 'But there was also a sense of defiance as well. People were saying, ‘We will go back to our homes. We will go back to the places that we have lived for generations, and we will rebuild.’' ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-un-humanitarian-chief-says-gaza-ceasefire-has-averted-famine-but-any-truce-collapse-brings-danger/	2025-02-09T16:36:01-08:00	
Trump repeats pledge to take control of Gaza even as pressure mou...	MUGHRAQA, Gaza Strip (AP) — New details and growing shock over emaciated hostages renewed pressure Sunday on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to extend a fragile Gaza ceasefire beyond the first phase, even as U.S. President Donald Trump repeated his pledge that the U.S. would take control of the Palestinian enclave. Talks on the second phase, meant to see more hostages released and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, were due to start Feb. 3. But Israel and Hamas appear to have made little progress, even as Israeli forces withdrew Sunday from a Gaza corridor in the latest commitment to the truce. Netanyahu sent a delegation to Qatar, a key mediator, but it included low-level officials, sparking speculation that it won’t lead to a breakthrough. Netanyahu, who returned after a U.S. visit to meet with Trump, is expected to convene security Cabinet ministers on Tuesday. Trump weighs in on Gaza again Speaking on Sunday, Trump repeated his pledge to take control of the Gaza Strip. 'I’m committed to buying and owning Gaza. As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it. Other people may do it through our auspices. But we’re committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn’t move back. There’s nothing to move back into. The place is a demolition site. The remainder will be demolished,' he told reporters onboard Air Force One as he traveled to the Super Bowl. Trump said Arab nations would agree to take in Palestinians after speaking with him and insisted Palestinians would leave Gaza if they had a choice. 'They don’t want to return to Gaza. If we could give them a home in a safer area — the only reason they’re talking about returning to Gaza is they don’t have an alternative. When they have an alternative, they don’t want to return to Gaza.' Trump also suggested he was losing patience with the deal after seeing the emaciated hostages released this week. 'I watched the hostages come back today and they looked like Holocaust survivors. They were in horrible condition. They were emaciated. It looked like many years ago, the Holocaust survivors, and I don’t know how much longer we can take that,' he said. Israel has expressed openness to the idea of resettling Gaza's population — 'a revolutionary, creative vision,' Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday — while Hamas, the Palestinians and much of the world have rejected it. Egypt said it will host an emergency Arab summit on Feb. 27 to discuss the 'new and dangerous developments.' Trump’s proposal has moral, legal and practical obstacles. It may have been proposed as a negotiation tactic to pressure Hamas or an opening gambit in discussions aimed at securing a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia condemned Netanyahu’s recent comment that Palestinians could create their state there, saying it aimed to divert attention from crimes committed by 'the Israeli occupation against our Palestinian brothers in Gaza, including the ethnic cleansing they are being subjected to.' Qatar called Netanyahu’s comment 'provocative' and a blatant violation of international law. Hostage families say time is running out Families of remaining hostages said time is running out as some survivors described being barefoot and in chains. 'We cannot let the hostages remain there. There is no other way. I am appealing to the cabinet,' said Ella Ben Ami, daughter of a hostage released Saturday, adding she now understands the toll of captivity is much worse than imagined. The father of a remaining hostage, Kobi Ohel, told Israel's Channel 13 the newly released men said his son, Alon, and others 'live off half a pita to a full pita a day. These are not human conditions.' Ohel's mother, Idit, sobbed as she told Channel 12 her son has been chained for over a year. Michael Levy said his brother, the newly released Or Levy, had been barefoot and hungry for 16 months. 'The decision-makers knew exactly what his condition was and what everyone else’s condition was, and they did not do enough to bring him back with the urgency that was needed,' he said. On Saturday, as Israelis reeled, former defense minister Yoav Gallant said on social media that the deterioration in hostages’ conditions was something 'Israel has known about for some time.' The ceasefire's extension is not guaranteed The ceasefire that began on Jan. 19 has held, raising hopes that the 16-month war that led to seismic shifts in the Middle East may be headed toward an end. The latest step was Israel forces' withdrawal from the 4-mile (6-kilometer) Netzarim corridor separating northern and southern Gaza, which was used as a military zone. No troops were seen in the vicinity Sunday. As the ceasefire began last month, Israel began allowing hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to cross Netzarim and return to the north. But the deal remains fragile. On Sunday, civil defense first responders in Gaza said Israeli fire killed three people east of Gaza City. Israel's military noted 'several hits' after firing warning shots and warned Palestinians against approaching its forces. Cars piled with belongings headed north. Under the deal, Israel should allow cars to cross Netzarim uninspected. Troops remain along Gaza’s borders with Israel and Egypt. Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the troops' withdrawal showed the militant group had 'forced the enemy to submit to our demands' and thwarted 'Netanyahu’s illusion of achieving total victory.' Israel has said it won’t agree to a complete withdrawal from Gaza until Hamas’ military and political capabilities are eliminated. Hamas says it won’t hand over the last hostages until Israel removes all troops. During the ceasefire's 42-day first phase, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Israel has said Hamas confirmed that eight of the 33 are dead. Families of the hostages gathered in Tel Aviv to urge Netanyahu to extend the ceasefire, but he is also under pressure from far-right political allies to resume the war. Trump's proposal for the U.S. to take control of the Gaza Strip may also complicate the situation. 'They are dying there, so we need to finish this deal in a hurry,' said Ayala Metzger, daughter-in-law of hostage Yoram Metzger, who died in captivity. The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas’ attack that killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostage, has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Much of the territory has been obliterated. Violence in the occupied West Bank Violence has surged in the occupied West Bank during the war and intensified in recent days with an Israeli military operation against Palestinian militants in the territory's north. On Sunday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Israeli gunfire killed two women, one of them, Sundus Shalabi, eight months pregnant. It said Rahaf al-Ashqar, 21, was also killed. The shooting occurred in the Nur Shams urban refugee camp, a focal point of Israeli operations. Israel's military said its police had opened an investigation. Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz on Sunday announced the expansion of the operation that started in Jenin several weeks ago. He said it was meant to prevent Iran — allied with Hamas — from establishing a foothold in the West Bank. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

US officials are bound for Europe for top-level talks on Ukraine	President Donald Trump’s national security adviser said Sunday that top administration officials will meet with European officials this week about how to end the war in Ukraine, nearly three years after Russia launched an all-out invasion. Less than a day earlier, the New York Post reported that Trump had a phone call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to discuss steps toward a negotiated solution. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew to the Super Bowl in New Orleans, Trump declined to discuss his reported phone conversation with Putin. 'I don’t want to do that. We’re trying to end that war. It’s a war that would have never happened if I were president, it would have never happened, but we’re making progress. But I can’t tell you,' he said. Asked to clarify whether his conversations with Putin took place before he took office or after, Trump said, 'I’ve had it. Let’s just say I’ve had it. And I expect to have many more conversations. We have to get that war ended. It’s going to end.' There was no immediate confirmation of the call by the Kremlin. Waltz: Europe needs to take bigger role in the conflict In a television interview, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said the Russian economy is not doing well and that Trump 'is prepared to tax, to tariff, to sanction' Moscow to get Putin to the negotiating table. Waltz also underscored that the Trump administration is looking to use this week’s engagements to begin talks on clawing back some of the United States’ assistance to Ukraine. He said European allies will also need to take a greater role in supporting Ukraine going forward. 'We need to recoup those costs and that is going to be a partnership with the Ukrainians in terms of their natural resources and their oil and gas and also buying ours,' Waltz said in an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press. 'Those conversations are going to happen this week. And I think an underlying principle here is that the Europeans have to own this conflict going forward. President Trump is going to end it. And then in terms of security guarantees, that is squarely going to be with the Europeans.’’ Vice President JD Vance will be in Paris on Monday for an artificial intelligence summit that’s gathering government officials and will head later in the week to the Munich Security Conference, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will lead the battle-weary country’s delegation. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Trump’s special envoy on Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, will also be in Munich. On Wednesday, Hegseth will join the main international forum for drumming up weapons and ammunition for Ukraine. He's set to participate in a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels the following day. Kyiv under pressure as Russian troops advance and Trump floats talks with Putin Putin is closer than ever to achieving his objectives in battle-weary Ukraine, with little incentive to come to the negotiating table, no matter how much Trump might cajole or threaten him, according to Russian and Western experts interviewed by The Associated Press. Putin has previously said Trump was 'clever and pragmatic,' and even parroted his false claims of having won the 2020 election. Trump’s opening gambit was to call Putin 'smart' and to threaten Russia with tariffs and oil price cuts, which the Kremlin brushed off. Trump boasted during the presidential election campaign that he could end the war in 24 hours, which later became six months. He’s indicated the U.S. is talking to Russia about Ukraine without Kyiv’s input, saying his administration already had 'very serious' discussions. That would run counter to the Biden administration’s position that echoed Zelenskyy’s call of 'Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.' The Ukrainian leader has suggested any peace deal reached without Kyiv's input would send the dangerous signal that adventurism pays to authoritarian leaders in China, North Korea and Iran. Meanwhile, Trump has hinted he and Putin could soon take 'significant' action toward ending the war, in which Russia is suffering heavy casualties daily while its economy endures stiff Western sanctions, inflation and a serious labor shortage. But the economy has not collapsed, and because Putin has unleashed the harshest crackdown on dissent since Soviet times, he faces no domestic pressure to end the war. Ukraine hopes to make its case in Munich Andriy Yermak, a top Zelenskyy adviser who will attend the Munich security conference, has told AP the Ukrainian delegation will use its platform to present Kyiv's position on ending the war. He said Kyiv hopes to discuss what security guarantees could be put in place to prevent repeated aggression by Russia. The Munich summit comes at a pivotal moment for Ukraine, which is striving to establish a relationship with the new U.S. administration, a key partner during its yearslong war against Russia. ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani in Paris and Darlene Superville, traveling aboard Air Force One, contributed.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-officials-are-bound-for-europe-for-top-level-talks-on-ukraine/	2025-02-09T14:17:52-08:00	
Hamas releases 3 more Israeli hostages for dozens of Palestinian ...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas-led militants released three gaunt, frail-looking Israeli civilian men they held for the past 16 months on Saturday, and Israel was freeing dozens of Palestinian prisoners as part of a fragile agreement that has paused the war in the Gaza Strip. Before a crowd of hundreds, armed Hamas fighters led Eli Sharabi, 52, Ohad Ben Ami, 56, and Or Levy, 34, onto a stage, where they were forced to make a public statement before being handed over to the Red Cross. The three were among about 250 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war. They appeared to be in much poorer physical condition than any of the 18 other hostages released so far during the ceasefire that began Jan. 19. Hostages' condition sparks concern The hostages' emaciated condition and the stage-managed ceremony — a departure from previous hostage releases where the captives were not made to speak — sparked outrage in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said 'we will not accept the shocking scenes' that played out. The statement did not lay out punitive measures. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said the 'difficult scenes' were reason to extend the truce with Hamas and bring home the dozens of remaining hostages. In an apparent response to concerns over the released hostages’ health, Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, claimed it had 'made efforts to preserve their lives despite the (Israeli) bombardment.' Many Palestinians released from Israeli jails during the ceasefire have also appeared gaunt and pale, and have alleged abuses and mistreatment in Israeli custody. The current phase of the truce, which runs until early March, does not appear to have been affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's stunning proposal to transfer the Palestinian population out of Gaza, welcomed by Israel but vehemently rejected by the Palestinians and most of the international community. But it could complicate talks over the second and more difficult phase, when Hamas is to release dozens more hostages in return for a lasting ceasefire. Hamas may be reluctant to free more captives — and lose its main bargaining chip — if it believes the U.S. and Israel are serious about depopulating the territory, which rights groups say would violate international law. This was the fifth swap of hostages for prisoners during the ceasefire. Before Saturday, 18 hostages and more than 550 Palestinian prisoners had been freed. The gaunt appearance of the three hostages 'evoke the horrifying pictures from the liberation of the camps in 1945, the darkest chapter of our history,' said the Hostages Families Forum, a group representing relatives of most of the captives. 'We have to get all of the hostages out of hell. There can be no more delays.' The first phase of the ceasefire calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 prisoners, the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory. Last week, wounded Palestinians were allowed to leave Gaza for Egypt for the first time since May. Who was released on Saturday? Sharabi and Ben Ami were both captured from Kibbutz Beeri, one of the hardest-hit farming communities, during the Hamas-led attack. Levy was abducted from the Nova music festival, where he was taking shelter in a safe room when the militants arrived. Sharabi’s wife and two teenage daughters were killed in the attack. His brother Yossi was also abducted and died in captivity. Levy’s wife was killed during the attack and his now 3-year-old son has been cared for by relatives. It is unclear whether either man knows about what happened to their families. Ben Ami, a father of three, was kidnapped with his wife, Raz, who was released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Relatives of the hostages cheered, clapped and cried as they watched live footage of their loved ones being released. Levy's brother, Michael, said his brother’s young son, Almog, was already told his father was on his way. 'Mogi, we found daddy,' Michael Levy said he told the boy, using his nickname, in an interview with Israeli Channel 12. 'We haven’t seen happiness like that in him for a long time.' The 183 Palestinian prisoners being released by Israel on Saturday include 18 people serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis, 54 serving long-term sentences and 111 Palestinians from Gaza who were detained after the Oct. 7 attack but not tried for any crime. All are men are aged between 20 and 61. Virtually every Palestinian has a friend, relative or acquaintance who has been imprisoned. More than 100 hostages were released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. More than 70 are still in Gaza, and Israel has said 34 of those are believed to be dead. Israel says Hamas has confirmed eight of the 33 to be released during the first phase of the truce are dead. Ceasefire's next phase is uncertain It is not clear whether Israel and Hamas have begun negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if no agreement is reached. Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the ceasefire. A key far-right partner in Netanyahu’s coalition is calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase. Hamas says it won’t release remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. In the Oct. 7 attack, some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory air and ground war, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants. The Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in residential neighborhoods. Senior militants among Palestinian prisoners set for release Of the 72 prisoners being released Saturday, five are from east Jerusalem, 14 from the Gaza Strip and the remaining 53 from the occupied West Bank. Seven are to be transferred to Egypt ahead of further deportation. A total of 47 prisoners were being freed Saturday from Ofer prison in the West Bank, and transferred to Palestinian custody near Ramallah where scores of relatives, friends and supporters welcomed some of them cheering and clapping. One extremely frail-looking prisoner was loaded directly from a bus into an ambulance for emergency treatment. The Palestinian security prisoners were detained over offenses ranging from bomb attacks to involvement in militant organizations, in some cases dating back decades. They include Iyad Abu Shakhdam, 49, who has been locked up for nearly 21 years over his involvement in Hamas attacks in crowded civilian areas that killed dozens of Israelis during the Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s. That included a notorious 2004 suicide bus bombing in Israel’s southern desert city of Beersheba that killed 16 people, including a 4-year-old. Another is Jamal al-Tawil, a prominent Hamas politician in the occupied West Bank and former mayor of the village of al-Bireh, abutting Ramallah. He has spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli jail, with the military reporting his last arrest in 2021 over his alleged participation in violent riots and efforts to entrench Hamas' leadership in the West Bank. He was transferred to administrative detention, a repeatedly renewable six-month period in which suspects are held without charge or trial. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. ___ Goldenberg contributed from Tel Aviv, Israel ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hamas-to-free-3-more-israeli-hostages-for-dozens-of-palestinian-prisoners-under-gaza-ceasefire/	2025-02-08T03:26:35-08:00	
Arab, Muslim Americans blast Trump's 'grotesque' Gaza proposal	Arab American and Muslim American leaders are blasting President Trump’s proposal to take over Gaza, warning that it’s antithetical to their beliefs and amounts to ethnic cleansing. The backlash comes after Trump made significant inroads among these groups’ voters in the November election, peeling them away from the Democratic Party, which has been their home for decades, in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. But while these leaders have no kind words for Trump’s plans, they’re also pointing blame at both former President Biden and former Vice President Harris for allowing the conflict to continue and not taking the opportunity to convince voters that they were a better alternative. 'You got to remember that Donald Trump today is talking about moving Palestinians out of Gaza because they have no homes,' said Yousef Munayyer, the head of the Palestine/Israel program and a senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC. 'They have no homes because of Joe Biden's policy. And this is less a shift from one administration to the next than a continuation.' Considered a solid part of the Democratic coalition throughout much of the 21st century, Muslim and Arab American voters seem to be without a clear political home in the aftermath of the 2024 race. Polling from the Arab American Institute and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) showed a clear drop in support among members of these communities for Harris during her presidential bid, considerably lower than had been for other recent Democratic tickets. While Harris softened some of Biden’s stances on the war and expressed more solidarity for the plight of Palestinians, she avoided promises to place conditions on aid to Israel, a top demand for her detractors. And an exit poll from CAIR released just after Election Day found 53 percent of American Muslims nationally voted for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, while 21 percent voted for Trump and 20 percent voted for Harris. Notably, Harris lost the first majority Arab American city in the U.S., Dearborn, Mich., by 6 points to Trump after Biden overwhelmingly won the city in 2020. Every Democrat had won the city since 2004. The ongoing conflict, which began on Oct. 7, 2023, yielded two major efforts within the Democratic Party hesitant to back the party’s ticket: the Abandon movement and the Uncommitted movement. The Abandon group endorsed Stein, while the Uncommitted group avoided endorsing Harris but also vocally opposed Trump. Leaders within both groups slammed Trump’s calls as illegal and constituting ethnic cleansing, though they also turned blame to Biden and Harris for not offering a clear enough alternative. Hudhayfah Ahmad, who served as a spokesperson for the Abandon movement, called Trump’s comments 'inflammatory,' 'grotesque' and 'unacceptable' but also drew a distinction between Trump’s words and the Biden administration’s actions. 'At the same time, [Trump’s comment] is rhetoric, and we are not going to equate rhetoric with the actions of the previous administration,' he said. 'We believe that is disingenuous and dishonest.' The Abandon movement said in a statement following Trump’s remarks that his administration pressured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire is a 'surprising relief.' The statement argued that Trump was only acting out of self-interest and not humanitarian reasons, but he still got the fighting to stop, which it said would not have happened if Harris won. 'It was for his own personal self-interest,' Ahmad said. 'Still, it must be emphasized that Trump did what Biden and Harris blatantly refused to do, which is pressure Netanyahu into ending the genocide.' The outgoing Biden administration and incoming Trump administration worked together ahead of Inauguration Day to solidify a ceasefire deal that releases the hostages held in Gaza. Layla Elabed, a co-founder of the Uncommitted movement, told The Forward that she feels 'sad, angry, and scared for our communities.' She said the group warned about the danger that Trump poses domestically and internationally for months, but their words were largely ignored. 'Harris left a vacuum by not visiting Michigan families impacted by US-supplied bombs to help create a permission structure for their trust while Trump visited Dearborn and filled a community in despair with lies,' she told the outlet. 'Trump’s illegal calls for ethnic cleansing are horrific, but as on so many other issues, Democrats had a chance to persuade voters that they were the better alternative and they blew it,' she said. Both groups appeared more driven away from the Democratic ticket than toward the GOP, while some others outside the party were openly supportive of Trump as a result, though they still don’t support Trump’s proposal. A pro-Trump Arab American group received attention Wednesday when it announced it was changing its name from 'Arab Americans for Trump' to 'Arab Americans for Peace.' Bishara Bhabha, the organization’s chair, said the group had been considering a name change since after the election, but given Trump’s comments this week, it decided to send out a release about the decision. He said he was surprised by Trump’s statement but noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt both sought to walk back Trump’s comments. Trump doubled down on his proposal in comments Thursday, though he said U.S. troops wouldn’t be needed to carry it out. Bhabha said Trump’s comments were 'clearly' not fully thought out, but he expects as Trump hears from various Arab countries that they would not accept Palestinian refugees being sent into their territory, Trump will be able to reach a 'reasonable and acceptable resolution.' 'The voluntary or involuntary transfer of Palestinians from their homeland is totally unacceptable and rejected by all of us as Arab and Muslim Americans,' he said. Those who favored Trump over Harris, or at least rejected the Democrats in 2024, also could have been influenced by other issues outside the conflict, others noted. As a result, winning back these voters may be complex. Ani Zonneveld, the president of Muslims for Progressive Values, said she has been tracking a shift to the right among a certain group of Muslims for the past decade, particularly regarding LGBTQ rights. Trump’s first-term policy to suspend immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries caused these voters to identify as progressives, but they shifted back during the Biden administration. She pointed to a 2023 document called 'Navigating Differences' that pushed back against 'LGBTQ-centric values,' citing religious text. 'It became a real effort by the Christian right to court the Muslim right, in a real strategic manner,' Zonneveld said, noting former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn’s meeting with Muslim political and religious leaders in Michigan to come together to push against LGBTQ rights. 'They're going to vote based on how this next four years is going to affect them, and I think that's still to be played out, but I think it's going to play up badly for everyone, except for a few,' she said. Munayyer cautioned against treating these communities as a monolith, as other voters outside the Arab and Muslim American communities also made their decision on this issue and those in the community made their voting decision on a range of issues. But he said many of those whose decision hinged on the war likely stayed home rather than voting for either candidate in November. And Trump’s comments demonstrate the conundrum that faced this group and still does. 'They understood Trump is not going to be good and Biden’s not going to be good,' Munayyer said. 'But on this issue, there's not a whole lot of tangible difference between the two of them, and the impact of that ended up alienating voters that, in my view, probably made a difference in this election.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/arab-muslim-americans-blast-trumps-grotesque-gaza-proposal/	2025-02-07T03:01:11-08:00	
Trump's Gaza plan shocks the world but finds support in Israel	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — President Donald Trump’s plan to seek U.S. ownership of the Gaza Strip and move out its population infuriated the Arab world. It stunned American allies and other global powers and even flummoxed members of Trump’s own party. The reaction in Israel was starkly different. The idea of removing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza — once relegated to the fringes of political discourse in the country — has found fertile ground in an Israeli public traumatized by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attacks and grasping for ways to feel secure again after the deadliest assault in their country’s history. Jewish Israeli politicians across the spectrum either embraced the idea wholeheartedly or expressed openness to it. Newspaper columns praised its audacity and TV commentators debated how the idea could practically be set in motion. The country’s defense minister ordered the military to plan for its eventual implementation. Whether or not the plan becomes reality — it is saddled with obstacles, not to mention moral, legal and practical implications — its mere pronouncement by the world's most powerful leader has sparked enthusiasm about an idea once considered to be beyond the pale in the Israeli mainstream. 'The fact that it has been laid on the table,' said Israeli historian Tom Segev, 'opens the door for such a clear crime to become legitimate.' To be sure, many of those who expressed openness to the plan said it seemed unfeasible for a multitude of legal and logistical reasons. And they say the departures should be voluntary, perhaps an acknowledgment of claims by critics, among them the U.N. secretary-general, that forced expulsions could amount to 'ethnic cleansing.' And many others, including liberal Israelis and Palestinian citizens of Israel, voiced opposition to it. The liberal daily Haaretz, in an editorial Thursday, urged Israelis to 'oppose transfer.' 'Even if Trump disregards international law, it’s crucial to remind Israelis that the forced expulsion or transfer of civilians violates international humanitarian law, constitutes a war crime and amounts to a crime against humanity,' the editorial said. In a joint Washington news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, Trump said he envisioned the U.S. taking control of the Gaza Strip, having its people relocate to other places and rebuilding the war-battered coastal enclave into the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' The proposal sparked outrage in the Middle East, including in Egypt and Jordan, two close U.S. allies at peace with Israel that Trump has suggested take in the Palestinians. Netanyahu, meanwhile, called Trump’s plan 'remarkable' and the 'first good idea' that he had heard. 'The actual idea of allowing first Gazans who want to leave, to leave. I mean, what’s wrong with that?' Netanyahu told Fox News. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz took it a step further, asking the military to craft a plan for a potential exodus. Katz has given few details on how such a plan would work. Even Netanyahu's rivals indicated openness. Benny Gantz, a former defense minister and centrist opposition figure, said Trump’s proposal showed 'creative, original and intriguing thinking.' Opposition leader Yair Lapid, also a centrist, told Israeli Army Radio 'in general, it’s good.' Both said the details and practicability of the plan were complicated and needed to be studied, and they urged Trump and Netanyahu to focus on freeing the hostages who remain in Gaza. For Palestinians, Trump's proclamation triggered painful memories of the expulsion or flight from their homes in what is now Israel in the 1948 war that led to its creation. It also resurfaced the trauma of further displacement wrought by the 1967 Mideast war, when Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Staying steadfast on their land is a key component of the Palestinian identity. In fact, many Palestinian refugees dream of returning to the lands in Israel from which they were originally displaced — something Israel says would threaten its existence as a Jewish majority state. Segev says the concept of driving people off their land is not foreign to the Israeli consciousness. He says Israel's founding leaders felt they needed to clear Palestinians off the land to ensure the security and stability of the state. But in modern Israel, the idea has been promoted only by fringe elements, most prominently the slain radical Rabbi Meir Kahane. The American-born Kahane's views got him banished from the Israeli parliament and led the U.S. to outlaw his group, the Jewish Defense League. Now, however, Kahane's once radical positions are the mainstay of far-right political parties, including one led by a disciple of his, that have been key to Netanyahu’s rule. They were thrilled to have someone as powerful as Trump adopt their idea, which they have billed as 'voluntary emigration,' a term the Palestinians say is a euphemism for forced transfer. Trump’s backing will likely embolden these hard-liners. When Hamas attacked on Oct. 7, Israelis were already in a yearslong shift away from support for Palestinian statehood and many had adopted an approach, promoted by Netanyahu, that the conflict was unsolvable and could only be managed through sporadic wars and military operations. The shock of Hamas’ attack — militants killed 1,200 and took about 250 hostages, parading some through Gaza to cheering crowds — brought the Palestinian issue back to the fore and prompted in Israelis an openness to more radical ideas as long as they help restore a sense of security. Sefi Ovadia, a broadcaster on a popular Israeli talk radio morning show, told his audience Thursday that he had 'moral reservations' to the idea before Oct. 7, but that since the attack, he no longer does. Ben Caspit, a widely read columnist, wrote in the Maariv daily that 'every Israeli, barring the most delusional ones on the outer reaches of the left, ought to welcome this initiative.' Trauma from Hamas' attack has prompted many Israelis to believe that a way to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is to 'remove Gaza from the equation,' said Shmuel Rosner, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank. 'It was a fringe idea in Israel before Oct. 7 and in some cases it was an illegitimate idea,' Rosner said of Trump's plan. 'Oct. 7 changed everything.' ___ This story has been edited to clarify that many Israelis who expressed openness to the plan say any departures should be voluntary.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-trumps-gaza-plan-shocks-the-world-but-finds-support-in-israel/	2025-02-06T17:34:45-08:00	
Trump doubles down on Gaza Strip idea, says no US soldiers would ...	(The Hill) - President Trump on Thursday doubled down on his proposal for the U.S. to take control of the Gaza Strip and rebuild it, despite pushback from Arab leaders and some Republicans, arguing it would not require American troops. The president in an early Thursday post on Truth Social expanded on his idea first laid out Tuesday, making clear he was serious about the idea after some advisers sought to clarify or temper aspects of the proposal. Trump claimed Israel would turn over Gaza to the U.S. 'at the conclusion of fighting.' Israel has been at war with Hamas, which controls the strip, for about 16 months, though they are currently under a flimsy ceasefire agreement. The president said Palestinians 'would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region. They would actually have a chance to be happy, safe, and free.' A man sells bread under the destruction of his bakery destroyed by the Israeli air and ground offensive in Jabaliya, Gaza Strip, Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2025. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana) 'The U.S., working with great development teams from all over the World, would slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth,' Trump continued. 'No soldiers by the U.S. would be needed! Stability for the region would reign!!!' The president during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday suggested Palestinians should permanently relocate out of Gaza and that the U.S. should turn the territory into an economic development. Trump said at the time U.S. troops would be used to secure the Gaza Strip 'if it’s necessary.' Press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday said Trump had not committed to sending U.S. troops to Gaza, and she suggested the relocation of Palestinians may only be temporary. Palestinian and Arab leaders have rejected Trump’s proposal. Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian National Authority, said Trump’s comments 'represent a serious violation of international law.' Saudi Arabia reiterated its 'absolute rejection of infringement on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, whether through Israeli settlement policies, annexation of Palestinian lands or efforts to displace the Palestinian people from their land.' Republicans appeared skeptical of the proposal, even as some welcomed it as an unorthodox solution to a long-standing problem. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump’s closest Senate allies, warned that a U.S.-led attempt to remove Palestinians from Gaza would be 'very problematic.' 'All I can say is I want to destroy Hamas, but I’ve been on the phone with Arabs all day. That approach I think will be very problematic,' Graham said. 'The idea of Americans going in on the ground in Gaza is a nonstarter for every senator.' Charlie Kirk, a top Trump ally and influential conservative media voice, said Wednesday the proposal was likely a way to 'create more leverage.' But, he added, 'the occupation of Gaza is not worth the life of a single Marine from Oklahoma. Period.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/trump-doubles-down-on-gaza-strip-idea-says-no-us-soldiers-would-be-needed/	2025-02-06T07:50:45-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli defense minister tells army to set pl...	Israel’s defense minister says he has instructed the army to prepare plans for large numbers of Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip in line with President Donald Trump’s proposal for the war-ravaged territory. Defense Minister Israel Katz said Thursday the plan 'will include options for exit at land crossings as well as special arrangements for exit by sea and air.' He said he welcomed Trump’s 'bold plan, which could allow a large population in Gaza to leave for various places in the world.' He did not say whether Palestinians would be able to one day return to Gaza, which has been rendered largely uninhabitable by Israel’s 15-month military campaign against Hamas. There were no immediate signs of such preparations on the ground Thursday and Katz did not give details about how the military planned to facilitate the departures. Trump on Wednesday proposed that most of Gaza’s population be 'permanently' resettled elsewhere while the United States rebuilds the territory. Palestinians say they don’t want to leave. Trump’s plan was roundly rejected by the Palestinians and much of the international community. Rights groups said it would amount to forcible displacement in violation of international law. U.S. officials later said the relocation would only be temporary, but Palestinians fear Israel would never allow them to return, deepening and perpetuating a refugee crisis dating back to the establishment of the state. ___ Here's the latest: Displaced Palestinians endure second cold, wet winter since war began DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Frigid winds have blown down tents in the Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands are still homeless despite a two-week-old ceasefire. Palestinians in the territory are enduring their second cold, wet winter since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack ignited the war with Israel. Hundreds of thousands returned to northern Gaza last month after the truce took hold, but many found their homes had been smashed to rubble. Temperatures dropped to 8 degrees Celsius (46 F) overnight. Israel sentences reserve soldier to prison for beating Palestinian detainees TEL AVIV, Israel — An Israeli military court has sentenced a reserve soldier to seven months in prison for beating Palestinian detainees at a detention facility where rights groups say abuses were rampant. The military said the soldier, who served as a guard at the Sde Teiman facility, was convicted of beating detainees with his fists and weapons on several occasions while they were handcuffed and blindfolded. It said these acts 'were committed in the presence of other soldiers, some of whom called on him to stop, and were even recorded on the defendant’s cell phone.' The facility is where Israel has held Palestinian prisoners throughout the war in Gaza. Israel has long been accused of failing to hold its soldiers accountable for crimes committed against Palestinians, and the allegations have intensified during the war in Gaza. Israel says its forces act in accordance with military and international law. In July, Israeli military police arrested 10 soldiers from Sde Teiman over the suspected sexual assault of a Palestinian detainee at the facility. The high-profile case triggered protests in support of the soldiers and calls by politicians for their release. At least five of them were released without charge. An investigation by The Associated Press and multiple reports by rights groups have exposed abysmal conditions and abuses at Sde Teiman. After the accusations of harsh treatment prompted a legal appeal last year to close the facility, Israel said it was transferring the bulk of Palestinian detainees out of Sde Teiman and upgrading it. Trump: ‘No US soldiers would be needed’ for his Gaza proposal WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said 'no soldiers by the U.S. would be needed' to carry out his proposal for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip and redevelop the war-torn territory. 'The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting,' Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. He added that Palestinians would be 'resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region.' He added that the U.S. would work 'with great development teams from all over the World,' and 'slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth.' The comments come two days after Trump, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by his side, stunned the world with his plan for relocating Gaza residents and redeveloping the land. Trump’s top diplomat and his chief spokesperson on Wednesday walked back the idea that he wants the permanent relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, after American allies and even Republican lawmakers rebuffed his suggestion that the U.S. take 'ownership' of the territory. Human Rights Watch says Trump plan could amount to ‘ethnic cleansing’ AMMAN, Jordan — Human Rights Watch says President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, if implemented, could amount to 'ethnic cleansing.' The euphemism, which came into wide use after the war in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, refers to the forcible displacement of the civilian population of an ethnic group from a geographic area. Adam Coogle, deputy Middle East director at the New York-based Human Rights Watch, said it is unclear if Trump’s plan will be implemented, but that the statement of intent was 'very concerning.' 'If it were to transform into state policy, it would potentially amount to ethnic cleansing. And if done with intent, it would be forced displacement. And if that forced displacement was done as part of a systematic and widespread attack against the civilian population as a matter of state policy, it would actually be a crime against humanity,' he said. Trump and Israeli officials who support the plan portray it as voluntary migration and have called on other countries to absorb Palestinians who want to leave. Palestinians insist they want to stay in their homeland and fear Israel would never allow them to return. Coogle said countries are obliged to consider individual applications for asylum, but 'do not have an obligation to participate in the forced displacement of the entire population of the Gaza Strip.' Palestinians hold protest against Trump's Gaza proposal DEIR AL-BALAH, The Gaza Strip — Dozens of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have protested President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate most of the territory’s population. Thursday’s protest outside a hospital in central Gaza was organized by a breakaway faction of the secular Fatah movement that is led by Mohammed Dahlan, who is closely allied with the United Arab Emirates. The UAE, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020, has joined other Arab countries in rejecting any expulsion of Palestinians and reiterating calls for a Palestinian state Emad Mohsen, an organizer of the demonstration, said they were protesting against Trump’s 'criminal hellish plan' and affirming their desire to remain in their homeland. The protesters carried signs calling for the rebuilding of Gaza by its own residents. Trump, and Israeli officials who have welcomed his plan, depict the proposed relocation from war-ravaged Gaza as voluntary, but the Palestinians have universally expressed their determination to remain in their homeland. Trump and Israeli officials have not said how they would respond if Palestinians refuse to leave. Pakistan calls Gaza proposal ‘deeply troubling’ ISLAMABAD — Pakistan says the 'proposal to displace the people of Gaza is deeply troubling and unjust.' In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the 'Palestinian land belongs to the Palestinian people and the only viable and just option is the two-state solution' under the UN Security Council resolutions. 'Any attempts to displace the Palestinians from their land as well as to continue illegal settlements would be a blatant violation of the international law, and undermine the peace and security of the entire region,' it said. Pakistan also reiterated its call for the return of all displaced Palestinians to their homes, including in Gaza, and 'a complete withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the occupied territories'. Egyptian officials try to head off Trump's proposal for Gaza CAIRO — Egypt has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz to try and head off President Donald Trump’s proposal for the mass relocation of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip. Egypt has warned that such a plan could undermine its peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of stability and American influence in the Middle East for decades. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has not publicly responded to Trump’s stunning proposal that most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million Palestinians be relocated and the United States take charge of rebuilding the territory. But two Egyptian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks, said Cairo has made clear to the Trump administration and Israel that it will resist any such proposal, and that the peace deal with Israel — which has stood for nearly half a century — is at risk. They said the message has been delivered to the US. government and Congress, as well as Israel’s Western European allies, including Britain, France and Germany. A Western diplomat in Cairo, also speaking anonymously because the discussions have not been made public, confirmed receiving the message from Egypt through multiple channels. The diplomat said Egypt viewed the plan as a threat to its national security. The diplomat said Egypt rejected similar proposals from the Biden administration and European countries early in the war, which was sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. The earlier proposals were broached privately, while Trump announced his plan Tuesday at a White House press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. -- By Samy Magdy 2 Israeli soldiers die after crane accidentally collapses in Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says two soldiers died and another was severely injured in the Gaza Strip. Israeli media on Thursday reported that the deaths were caused by the accidental collapse of a crane in the border area. The military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They are the first Israeli soldiers to die in Gaza since a ceasefire agreement took hold last month, halting the 15-month war sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack. Under the first phase of the ceasefire, which runs until early March, Israeli forces have withdrawn from most of the territory and are mainly concentrated along the border. The military has warned Palestinians to avoid areas where troops are operating and has opened fire on people accused of violating the terms of the agreement. In the current phase, Hamas is set to gradually free a total of 33 hostages captured in the initial attack in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The terms of the second phase, in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in return for more prisoners and a lasting ceasefire, have yet to be agreed upon.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-defense-minister-tells-army-to-set-plans-for-palestinians-to-leave-gaza/	2025-02-06T05:01:20-08:00	
Israel begins preparations for Gaza exodus as Egypt lobbies again...	CAIRO (AP) — Israel said on Thursday it has begun preparations for the departure of large numbers of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip in line with President Donald Trump's plan for the territory. Officials meanwhile said Egypt has launched an diplomatic blitz behind the scenes to try and head off the plan. The Trump administration has already dialed back aspects of the proposal after it was widely rejected internationally, saying the relocation of Palestinians would be temporary. U.S. officials have provided few details about how or when the plan would be carried out. In a social media post on Thursday, Trump said Israel would turn Gaza over to the United States after the war and that no U.S. soldiers would be needed for his plan to redevelop it. The Palestinians have vehemently rejected Trump's proposal, fearing that Israel would never allow refugees to return. Egypt has warned that an expulsion of Palestinians would destabilize the region and undermine its peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of stability and American influence for decades. Saudi Arabia, another key U.S. ally, has also rejected any mass transfer of Palestinians and says it will not normalize relations with Israel — a key goal of the Trump administration — without the creation of a Palestinian state that includes Gaza. Trump and Israeli officials have depicted the proposed relocation from war-ravaged Gaza as voluntary, but the Palestinians have universally expressed their determination to remain in their homeland. Trump and Israeli officials have not said how they would respond if Palestinians refuse to leave. But Human Rights Watch and other groups say the plan, if implemented, would amount to 'ethnic cleansing,' the forcible relocation of the civilian population of an ethnic group from a geographic area. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he has ordered the military to make preparations to facilitate the emigration of large numbers of Palestinians from Gaza through land crossings as well as 'special arrangements for exit by sea and air.' There were no immediate signs of such preparations on the ground. Egypt wages a behind-the-scenes campaign Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has not publicly responded to Trump's stunning proposal that most of Gaza's population of 2.3 million Palestinians be relocated and the United States take charge of rebuilding the territory. Israel's 15-month campaign against the militant Hamas group had reduced large parts of Gaza to rubble before a fragile ceasefire took hold last month. But Egyptian officials, speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks, said Cairo has made clear to the Trump administration and Israel that it will resist any such proposal, and that the peace deal with Israel — which has stood for nearly half a century — is at risk. One official said the message has been delivered to the Pentagon, the State Department and members of the U.S. Congress. A second official said it has also been conveyed to Israel and its Western European allies, including Britain, France and Germany. A Western diplomat in Cairo, also speaking anonymously because the discussions have not been made public, confirmed receiving the message from Egypt through multiple channels. The diplomat said Egypt was very serious and viewed the plan as a threat to its national security. The diplomat said Egypt rejected similar proposals from the Biden administration and European countries early in the war, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. The earlier proposals were broached privately, while Trump announced his plan at a White House press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. US officials scale back Trump's proposal Trump said he wanted to 'permanently' resettle most of Gaza's population in other countries and for the United States to take charge of clearing debris and rebuilding Gaza as a 'Riviera of the Middle East' for all people. He did not rule out the deployment of U.S. troops there. U.S. officials later appeared to walk it back, saying the relocation of Palestinians would be temporary and that Trump had not committed to putting American boots on the ground or spending American tax dollars in Gaza. The Egyptian officials said their government does not believe the Palestinians need to be relocated for reconstruction to proceed and is committed to the creation of a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood and has said it will maintain open-ended security control over both Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized by most of the international community and considers the entire city its capital. Last week, Egypt hosted a meeting of top diplomats from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — which was the driving force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords Trump brokered with Israel. All five Arab nations rejected the transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza or the West Bank. In an editorial on Thursday, Egypt’s main state-run daily, Al-Ahram, warned that 'the Arab countries' independence, their peoples’ unity and their territorial integrity are under grave threat.' ___ Associated Press writer Natalie Melzer in Nahariya, Israel, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-begins-preparations-for-gaza-exodus-as-egypt-lobbies-against-trump-plan/	2025-02-06T04:15:19-08:00	
Ukraine says its long-range drones hit a Russian airfield as Fran...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian forces struck an airfield in southern Russia that was being used to launch Iran-designed Shahed drones, Ukraine’s General Staff claimed Thursday, as France said it had delivered a first batch of Mirage fighter jets to Ukraine. The nighttime attack on the Primorsko-Akhtarsk airfield in Russia’s Krasnodar region started a fire, the General Staff wrote on Facebook. The facility houses and fires drones and maintains aircraft used to attack Ukraine’s Kherson and Zaporizhzhia border region. It was not possible to independently verify the claim. The Russian Defense Ministry reported downing Ukrainian drones over Krasnodar, but it didn’t say where or mention the airfield. Ukraine has developed its own long-range drones as part of its effort to grow its domestic arms industry and become less dependent on Western help to fight its almost three-year war with Russia. The drones have at times reached deep into Russia, hitting oil refineries, weapons stores and airfields. Meanwhile, French authorities said they had delivered the first fighter jets promised to Ukraine by President Emmanuel Macron last June. 'The first of them arrived in Ukraine today,' Sebastien Lecornu, the minister of the armed forces, said on X. 'With Ukrainian pilots on board, trained for several months in France, they will now help to defend the skies over Ukraine.' Lecornu did not say how many planes were delivered. Ukraine has also received F-16s from European countries, though Ukrainian officials have rarely mentioned them in official comments about the fighting. Russian forces fired 77 Shahed and other types of drones, as well as two ballistic Iskander-M missiles, at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine’s air force. A statement said 56 drones were destroyed and 18 others were jammed and lost mid-flight. Some buildings were damaged, but no casualties were reported. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraine-says-its-long-range-drones-hit-a-russian-airfield-as-france-delivers-mirage-fighter-jets/	2025-02-06T03:39:02-08:00	
What can I do to bring the others home?' Hostages freed from Ham...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — For the final two months of his captivity in Gaza, American-Israeli Keith Siegel was forced to lie down at all times in a cramped room. For most of his ordeal there was little electricity or running water, which made hygiene impossible, he said. When he returned to Israel last week, gaunt and pale, the first words to his family, according to his brother, Lee Siegel, were: 'I’m back, I’m home.' Then, he asked, 'What can I do to help bring the other hostages home?' Hostages are returning after 15 months in captivity as part of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, and with their freedom, the first details of their ordeals are emerging. Their accounts, told mostly through relatives, are shining a light on what the roughly 75 captives who remain in Gaza are facing, and are driving families of the released captives to keep up their public campaign until everyone is free. 'My family and I traveled the globe, knocking on every door, sharing our story with anyone who would listen,' Siegel’s wife, Aviva, a former hostage, told reporters after the release of her husband. 'We must not rest. We must not turn away,' she said, adding that the 'hostages remaining in Gaza deserve better.' After 15 months of devastating war sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire deal last month. Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages during the attack; around 75 remain in Gaza. About half are presumed by Israel to be dead. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but says more than half the dead are women and children. The first stage of the ceasefire calls for a pause in fighting, the release of hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and an increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza. Another three hostages are expected to be released on Saturday. The families of the hostages and their supporters have waged a tireless campaign in Israel and abroad to keep public attention on their loved ones and secure their release. Their commitment to securing the release of all the remaining hostages is made all the more difficult because extension of the ceasefire is not guaranteed and relies on renewed negotiations between Israel and Hamas to carry the deal into a second phase, when more hostages are expected to be freed. Siegel, 65, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was taken captive along with Aviva from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, one of the communities hardest hit in Hamas' attack. She was released in a brief ceasefire in November 2023. Lee Siegel, 73, said his brother told the family he was moved frequently and that for about six months he was kept alone, separate from other hostages. Beyond what his captors told him, he had very little exposure to the outside world, other than hearing rare snippets of radio or TV reports. For long periods he was required to stay silent, he told his family. Siegel drew on his meditation practice to help him stay grounded, his brother said. He would keep track of time by saying the date and the day of the week every day. Siegel would have imagined conversations with each family member, according to his brother. If his captors allowed him to speak aloud, he would whisper these; otherwise he would have the conversations silently in his head. He would say, 'Aviva, I love you,' or to his daughter, 'Gal, I dreamed of you, I saw you.' Even as he has started sharing some of his experiences with the family, Lee Siegel said they can’t begin to comprehend his ordeal. His brother is also grappling with the challenges of catching up on everything he missed, the seismic changes in Israel as well as personal family news: the death of their mother, the birth of great nieces and nephews. 'It’s a human being who was taken for 484 days, suffering the worst things we can appreciate,' Lee Siegel said. Romi Gonen, 24, who was released on the first day of the ceasefire, will need a complex surgery and lengthy physical therapy for an untreated hand wound she suffered during the Hamas attack, according to her mother, Meirav Leshem Gonen. While doctors said Gonen’s condition was stable when she returned, her mother said her skin was gray after being kept out of sunlight for nearly her entire captivity. Leshem Gonen said her daughter lost 10 kilograms (22 pounds), a fifth of her body weight, and was often deprived of food by her captors, even when they had food to share. When she was freed, Gonen had lost the ability to recognize hunger, and didn’t want to eat at all, her mother said, adding that it was more than two weeks before she finally asked for something specific to eat. Gonen has spoken very little to her family about what she went through, except to share humorous stories, trying to inject a bit of levity into a horrific situation because that’s the kind of person she is, her mother said. 'I ask everybody to take action to make sure the ceasefire will continue for the hostages to get out,' said Leshem Gonen, who has been a prominent voice for the hostages’ freedom and has continued the campaign for those still in captivity. Lee Siegel said his family is taking some time to themselves before returning to the demonstrations, overseas travel and media interviews for the remaining hostages' release. For now, the family is concentrating on the small things: just being able to embrace Siegel. 'It will take time for him to regroup physically and emotionally, but he’s strong, and he’s resilient,' Lee Siegel said. 'Actually, I think he provides us with more strength than we can provide for him.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-what-can-i-do-to-bring-the-others-home-hostages-freed-from-hamas-captivity-vow-all-must-return/	2025-02-06T00:32:35-08:00	
5 takeaways as Trump’s Gaza Strip proposal reverberates	Aftershocks reverberated Wednesday from President Trump’s declaration the previous day that the United States should take 'long-term ownership' of Gaza and that the Palestinians who live there should be moved. The position, outlined during the visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, threatened to upend the framework of U.S. policy in the region, which has been based around the hypothetical possibility of a two-state solution, in which Israel and an independent Palestine would co-exist. Trump caused further consternation across much of the political spectrum — and in the wider world — when he declined to rule out using the U.S. military in this effort. Asked about that point, he said, 'We’ll do what is necessary.' Here are the five big takeaways 24 hours later. Details are notable by their absence If Trump really plans to follow through on his proposal, it will be an enormous — and vastly controversial — undertaking. As of Wednesday evening, there were still very few details on how specifically it would be accomplished. Trump had said Tuesday he believed 'all' of the Palestinians should be moved. How would that be accomplished? Why would it be realistic to assume a people who have clung so fiercely to their national identity would submit to abandoning their homeland? If they do not do so voluntarily, would American troops be placed in harm’s way to force them out? None of that was clear. It appears the White House believes that neighboring nations — notably Egypt and Jordan — could be induced to take in Palestinian refugees, perhaps by leveraging U.S. aid payments. But there are clear risks for the rulers of those nations in acquiescing in such a plan. Those risks center on potential rage at home if the rulers are seen as colluding in the destruction of a discrete Palestinian people — as well as the capacity of an influx of Palestinian activists to cause internal instability. White House walks back permanent provision Trump had indicated during his remarks on Tuesday that Palestinians in Gaza could be resettled permanently in some other location. The suggestion of permanence underscored the danger from an Arab perspective, given how central the notion of dispossession is to Palestinian identity. Many Palestinians were uprooted from their homes at Israel’s creation in 1948, and Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Trump also said he thought the United States should take a 'long-term ownership position' over Gaza. But on Wednesday, the White House did a measure of back-pedaling on the issue. Secretary of State Marco Rubio characterized the idea of displacing the Palestinians as a temporary measure while Gaza was rebuilt. 'In the interim, obviously people are going to have to live somewhere while you’re rebuilding it,' Rubio told a news conference in Guatemala City, according to The Associated Press. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, pressed on the question during Wednesday’s media briefing, said of Gaza’s population that Trump had 'made it clear that they need to be temporarily relocated out of Gaza for the rebuilding of this effort.' Those comments are the first concrete sign that the administration is backing off at least some elements of the proposal. A deluge of criticism from Democrats and others Democrats reacted with fury to Trump’s proposal, with some describing his plan for the displacement of Palestinians — potentially at the hands of U.S. troops — as ethnic cleansing. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who is Palestinian American, accused Trump of being able to 'only spew this fanatical bulls‑‑‑' because of what Tlaib characterized as 'bipartisan support in Congress for funding genocide and ethnic cleansing.' Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Trump had 'completely lost it' and suggested that his plan, if enacted, would 'set the Middle East on fire for 20 years.' Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) accused the president of pursuing 'ethnic cleaning by another name,' while Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) pledged to bring articles of impeachment against Trump over the proposal. There was also criticism from Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia. A statement from the kingdom’s foreign ministry called its commitment to Palestinian statehood 'firm, steadfast and unwavering.' Even many Republicans sound lukewarm Trump has the GOP firmly in his grip after last November’s comfortable election victory. So it is always notable when a significant number of members of his own party appear tepid about his plans. That certainly seems to be the case here, perhaps because Trump has reoriented the party around a broadly anti-interventionist, 'America First' stance. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) wrote on social media: 'I thought we voted for America First. We have no business contemplating yet another occupation to doom our treasure and spill our soldiers blood.' But the libertarian-leaning Paul was not the only Republican to express misgivings. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said that most people in his state were 'probably not excited about sending Americans to take over Gaza.' Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) struck a similar tone, saying it was not 'the best use of United States resources to spend a bunch of money in Gaza.' To be sure, Trump’s plan had its GOP boosters. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told his home state Journal Sentinel that the Middle East could benefit from 'bold new ideas' and that Trump’s proposal was 'paradigm-shifting.' That said, the lack of enthusiasm from other quarters was notable. Plan renews focus on Trump’s family connections Amid the initial shock caused by Trump’s proposals Tuesday evening, some observers noted how his plan echoed an earlier comment from his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Last year, Kushner — a real-estate developer like Trump — caused controversy of his own when he said that Gaza’s 'waterfront property' had the potential to be 'very valuable.' Kushner, speaking roughly four months into the Israeli assault on Gaza that followed the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, added that it was 'a little bit of an unfortunate situation there, but from Israel’s perspective I would do my best to move the people out and then clean it up.' On Wednesday, The New York Times turned its attention to the Trump family’s business dealings in the region. 'The Middle East has in the past three years turned into the hottest spot for the Trump family in terms of new international real-estate deals,' the Times reported. It noted that these included recent agreements with a Saudi-based company to 'build high-risk luxury apartments, golf courses or hotels in Oman, Saudi Arabia and Dubai.' The report also reminded readers that Kushner spearheads a private equity firm 'that has raised $4.5 billion, mostly from sovereign wealth funds of the oil-rich nations of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/5-takeaways-as-trumps-gaza-strip-proposal-reverberates/	2025-02-05T16:01:20-08:00

The first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began last month after nearly 15 months of conflict. Now Gaza residents – displaced by war -- are slowly returning home to find destruction as far as the eye can see. Trump’s suggestion the US ‘take over’ the Gaza Strip is rejected by allies and adversaries alike United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund—or UNICEF—said the aid organization has 350 trucks on the ground delivering water, food, and health supplies to the nearly one 1 million children in Gaza. Trump won’t rule out deploying US troops to support rebuilding Gaza, sees ‘long-term’ US ownership UNICEF workers say it’s critical that ceasefire holds so the progress made to help vulnerable children in recent weeks made doesn’t slip away.

Jeffries amps up call for two-state solution after Trump push to ...	House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday flatly rejected President Trump’s proposal for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip, suggesting it would undermine ongoing efforts to free Israeli hostages and bring peace to the volatile region. The Democratic leader instead promoted more aid for Palestinians in Gaza and amplified his previous calls for a two-state peace deal — two facets of the multipronged strategy advanced by former President Biden throughout Israel’s war with Hamas. 'I strongly support the Biden peace plan, and we need to make sure that it is fully implemented with respect to surging humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza; making sure every single hostage is brought back home; and a foundation is laid to create a just and lasting peace,' Jeffries said. 'I support a two-state solution,' he added, 'which is a safe and secure Israel as a Jewish and democratic state existing side-by-side in peace and prosperity with a demilitarized Palestinian state that meets their aspirations for self-determination.' Jeffries’s preferred strategy clashes diametrically with the bombshell proposal offered by Trump a day earlier, when the president met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington and suggested the millions of Palestinians living in Gaza should leave their homes. In their wake, he said, the United States would assume ownership of the war-torn territory and rebuild it with a massive 'economic development' project. 'I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East — and maybe the entire Middle East,' Trump said during a press conference at the White House. 'This was not a decision made lightly,' he continued. 'Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.' Trump’s proposal marked a stunning reversal in U.S. policy toward the Middle East stretching back across decades of administrations of both parties. And it triggered an international debate about whether Trump was advancing a serious foreign policy objective or merely floating a bombastic threat as a negotiating tactic aimed at winning more concessions from the region’s Arab states. Amid the debate, many Democrats on Capitol Hill dismissed the idea as irrational, as best. 'I don't take it seriously at all,' said Rep. Gregory Meeks (N.Y.), senior Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee. 'This guy just talks off the top of his head.' Meeks pointed out that a major theme of Trump’s campaign was to end foreign entanglements and overseas spending for the sake of concentrating taxpayer resources on domestic priorities. The president’s proposal to seize Gaza, he noted, would do just the opposite. 'They're all talking about, 'We've got to stop nation-building and all of those kinds of things.' And then he comes out of the room talking about what would cost billions — trillions — of dollars of the taxpayers' money,' Meeks said. 'It just doesn't make any rational and common sense.' Republicans on Capitol Hill have different ideas, and many rushed to Trump’s support on Wednesday, including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.). 'That area is so dangerous, and he’s taking bold, decisive action to try to ensure the peace of that region,' Johnson said. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, pointed to one impediment to Trump’s plan: It would violate international laws that prohibit the forced removal of the legal residents of occupied territories, of which Gaza is one. 'If this country can't learn what happens when we put a major presence, unwelcomed, in the Middle East — or in Afghanistan or in Iraq — we can't learn anything,' Himes said. 'So I don't really know whether to take his proposal seriously, because obviously moving Palestinians against their will is a violation of the Geneva Conventions.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/jeffries-amps-up-call-for-two-state-solution-after-trump-push-to-seize-gaza/	2025-02-05T10:17:15-08:00	
U.S. allies, adversaries reject Trump suggestion to 'take over' G...	(The Hill) — Both U.S. allies and adversaries alike rejected President Donald Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. 'take over' the war-torn Gaza Strip and turn it into the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' Trump floated the idea during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Tuesday. He said the U.S. would be involved in clearing the territory where not only Palestinians but 'the world’s people' would benefit from it as an access point to the Mediterranean coast. 'I think you’ll make that into an international, unbelievable place. … I don’t want to be cute, I don’t want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle East … this could be so magnificent,' Trump said in his first major Middle East policy announcement since his return to the Oval Office. Among U.S. friends and foes, the message was not well received. 5 takeaways from the Trump, Netanyahu joint presser Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry refused to forge a diplomatic relationship with Israel without a path for Palestinians to get an independent state. 'The kingdom of Saudi Arabia also stresses what it had previously announced regarding its absolute rejection of infringement on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, whether through Israeli settlement policies, annexation of Palestinian lands or efforts to displace the Palestinian people from their land,' the ministry said in a statement shortly after Trump’s remarks. Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also reaffirmed his backing for a two-state solution on Wednesday. 'Australia played, historically, a very important role in the creation of the state of Israel. It's something that … governments consistently since then have supported,' he told reporters, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 'But those governments have also supported what happened then, which was the creation of two states, not just one, and that remains my position, and it has been a bipartisan position up to this point,' Albanese added. Trump's comments on Gaza came as the fragile ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas is underway, with Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners while the Palestinian militant group has freed many of the hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, which sparked war in the region. Some of the U.S.'s biggest adversaries also reiterated their backing of a two-state solution. 'We oppose the forced relocation of people in Gaza and hope that the relevant parties will take the ceasefire and post-war governance in Gaza as an opportunity to push the Palestinian issue back on the right track,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in a statement, according to The Associated Press. Protests against Trump, Project 2025 planned in cities across the country A spokesperson for Hamas' Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that Trump’s remarks were 'ridiculous and absurd,' emphasizing the group’s commitment to a three-step-phase ceasefire with Israel. When the president was asked about possibly sending in U.S. troops to Gaza, Trump said America will 'do what is necessary.' 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job — whether we’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out,' Trump said Tuesday. Trump also suggested that Palestinians who have been displaced be permanently relocated from Gaza, echoing his previous proposals to have other countries in the region take in refugees. Reconstruction in the region, he added, will also likely take longer than the ceasefire suggests.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/u-s-allies-adversaries-reject-trump-suggestion-to-take-over-gaza-strip/	2025-02-05T06:54:09-08:00	
Trump's suggestion the US 'take over' the Gaza Strip is rejected ...	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — President Donald Trump's proposal that the United States 'take over' the Gaza Strip and permanently resettle its Palestinian residents was swiftly rejected and denounced on Wednesday by American allies and adversaries alike. Trump's suggestion came at a White House news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who smiled several times as the president detailed a plan to build new settlements for Palestinians outside the Gaza Strip, and for the U.S. to take 'ownership' in redeveloping the war-torn territory into 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too,' Trump said. 'We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs.' The comments came amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, during which the militant group has been turning over hostages in exchange for the release of prisoners held by Israel. Egypt, Jordan and other American allies in the Middle East have already rejected the idea of relocating more than 2 million Palestinians from Gaza elsewhere in the region. Following Trump's remarks, Egypt's Foreign Ministry issued a statement stressing the need for rebuilding 'without moving the Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.' Saudi Arabia, an important American ally, weighed in quickly on Trump's expanded idea to take over the Gaza Strip in a sharply worded statement, noting that its long call for an independent Palestinian state was a 'firm, steadfast and unwavering position.' 'The kingdom of Saudi Arabia also stresses what it had previously announced regarding its absolute rejection of infringement on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, whether through Israeli settlement policies, annexation of Palestinian lands or efforts to displace the Palestinian people from their land,' the statement said. The prime ministers of Australia and Ireland, foreign ministries from China, New Zealand and Germany, and a Kremlin spokesman all reiterated support for a two-state solution. 'Australia's position is the same as it was this morning, as it was last year, as it was 10 years ago,' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said. Trump has already made waves — and upset longtime allies — suggesting the purchase of Greenland, the annexation of Canada and the possible takeover of the Panama Canal. It was not immediately clear whether the idea of taking over the Gaza Strip was a well thought out plan, or an opening gambit in negotiations. 'The comments last night were, of course, very concerning,' said Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin. 'I always adopt the approach when it comes to the U.S. administration of: judge them based on what they do and not what they say.' Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told state-run Anadolu Agency that Trump's proposal on 'deportations from Gaza is not something that either the region or we would accept.' 'Even thinking about it, in my opinion, is wrong and absurd,' Fidan said. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the United Nations to 'protect the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights,' saying that what Trump wanted to do would be 'a serious violation of international law.' Hamas, which sparked the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, said Trump's proposal was a 'recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region.' 'Instead of holding the Zionist occupation accountable for the crime of genocide and displacement, it is being rewarded, not punished,' the militant group said in a statement. In its attack on Israel, Hamas killed some 1,200 people, primarily civilians, and took about 250 hostages. Israel's ensuing air and ground war has has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities who do not say how many of the dead were fighters. The war has left large parts of several cities in ruins and displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people. In the U.S., opposition politicians quickly rejected Trump's idea, with Democratic Sen. Chris Coons calling his comments 'offensive and insane and dangerous and foolish.' The idea 'risks the rest of the world thinking that we are an unbalanced and unreliable partner because our president makes insane proposals,' Coons said, noting the irony of the proposal coming shortly after Trump had moved to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development. 'Why on earth would we abandon decades of well-established humanitarian programs around the world, and now launch into one of the world’s greatest humanitarian challenges?' Coons said. Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American member of Congress from Michigan, accused Trump in a social media post of 'openly calling for ethnic cleansing' with the idea of resettling Gaza's entire population. ___ Rising reported from Bangkok.

UK foreign secretary visits Ukraine as Zelenskyy discloses troop ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday, bringing a new support package for Ukraine a day after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 45,000 of his country’s troops had died in the almost three-year war with Russia. Lammy was due to announce 55 million pounds ($69 million) in new support, including 3 million pounds to send Ukrainian grain to war-ravaged Syria through the World Food Program. British officials say the goal is to replace grain Syria received from Russia when it was ruled by deposed President Bashar Assad, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.K. says much of that grain was stolen from Ukrainian land occupied by Russia’s invading army. Lammy is also pledging 17 million pounds to help repair Ukraine’s energy system, which Russia has repeatedly pounded. Lammy’s trip followed last month’s visit by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, when the U.K. and Ukrainian leaders signed what they called a '100-year partnership.' It was part of a European show of support for Ukraine as the return of U.S. President Donald Trump brought questions about continued backing for the country by Washington. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said in an interview broadcast Tuesday night that the war has killed 45,100 Ukrainian troops. The fighting also has injured close to 390,000 troops, he told Piers Morgan Uncensored on YouTube. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-top-uk-diplomat-visits-ukraine-as-president-zelenskyy-discloses-troop-losses/	2025-02-05T03:02:57-08:00	
The Gaza Strip has long been a powder keg. Here's a look at the h...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Gaza has long been a powder keg, and it exploded after Hamas fighters stormed southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and began killing and abducting people, sparking a crushing Israeli military operation there that's only recently reached an uneasy ceasefire. President Donald Trump 's suggestion Tuesday that that displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and the U.S. take 'ownership' may spark new tension over the enclave on the Mediterranean Sea. Here’s a look at the troubled modern history of the Gaza Strip: 1948 - 1967: Egyptian rule of Gaza Before the war surrounding Israel's establishment in 1948, present-day Gaza was part of the large swath of the Middle East under British colonial rule. After Israel defeated the coalition of Arab states, the Egyptian army was left in control of a small strip of land wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean. During the war, some 700,000 Palestinians either fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel — a mass uprooting that they call the Nakba, or 'catastrophe.' Tens of thousands of Palestinians flocked to the strip. Under Egyptian military control, Palestinian refugees in Gaza were stuck, homeless and stateless. Egypt didn't consider them to be citizens and Israel wouldn't let them return to their homes. Many were supported by UNWRA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, which has a heavy presence in Gaza to this day. Meanwhile, some young Palestinians became 'fedayeen' — insurgency fighters who conducted raids into Israel. 1967 - 1993: Israel seizes control Israel seized control of Gaza from Egypt during the 1967 Mideast war, when it also captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem — areas that remain under Israeli control. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, which administers semi-autonomous areas of the occupied West Bank, seeks all three areas for a hoped-for future state. Israel built more than 20 Jewish settlements in Gaza during this period. It also signed a peace treaty with Egypt at Camp David — a pact negotiated by U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi has referenced this 40-year old treaty when he declined to permit Palestinian refugees from Gaza into Egypt, saying the potential entrance of militants into Egypt would threaten longstanding peace between Israel and Egypt. The first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation erupted in Gaza in December 1987, kicking off more than five years of sustained protests and bloody violence. It was also during this time that the Islamic militant group Hamas was established in Gaza. 1993 - 2005: The Palestinian Authority takes charge For a time, promising peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders made the future of Gaza look somewhat hopeful. Following the Oslo accords — a set of agreements between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat that laid the groundwork for a two-state solution — control of Gaza was handed to the fledgling Palestinian Authority. But the optimism was short lived. A series of Palestinian suicide attacks by Hamas militants, the 1995 assassination of Rabin by a Jewish ultranationalist opposed to his peacemaking and the election of Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister the following year all hindered U.S.-led peace efforts. Another peace push collapsed in late 2000 with the eruption of the second Palestinian uprising. As the uprising fizzled in 2005, then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon led a unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, uprooting all of Israel's troops and roughly 9,000 settlers in a move that bitterly divided Israel. 2005 - 2023: Hamas seizes power Just months after Israel's withdrawal, Hamas won parliamentary elections over Fatah, the long-dominant Palestinian political party. The following year, after months of infighting, Hamas violently seized control of Gaza from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority. Israel and Egypt imposed a crippling blockade on the territory, monitoring the flow of goods and people in and out. For nearly two decades, the closure has crippled the local economy, sent unemployment skyrocketing, and emboldened militancy in the region, which is one of the most densely populated places on the planet. Through previous wars and countless smaller battles with Israel that devastated Gaza, Hamas has only grown more powerful. In each subsequent conflict, Hamas has had more rockets that have traveled farther. The group has displayed a growing array of weapons. Its top leaders have survived, and ceasefires have been secured. In the meantime, it has built a government, including a police force, ministries and border terminals equipped with metal detectors and passport control. 2023 Hamas attack sparks the Israel-Hamas war The Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw around 250 people taken hostage. Over 100 hostages were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, eight have been rescued alive and dozens of bodies have been recovered by Israeli forces. Israel’s air and ground war has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many of the dead were fighters. The war has left large parts of several cities in ruins and displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people. Under the first phase of the latest ceasefire, which went into effect on Jan. 19, Hamas is to release a total of 33 hostages, eight of whom Hamas says are dead, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most areas and allowed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to devastated northern Gaza while aid flows in. Negotiations on the second phase, which would end the war and see the remaining 60 or so hostages returned, are set to begin Monday. If mediators the United States, Qatar and Egypt are unable to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas, the war could resume in early March. ___ The Associated Press is republishing this story from Oct. 21, 2023, to update with the ceasefire and President Donald Trump’s comments about the Gaza Strip.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-the-gaza-strip-has-long-been-a-powder-keg-heres-a-look-at-the-history-of-the-embattled-region/	2025-02-05T01:08:36-08:00	
Inside the operations that took captive 2 North Korean soldiers f...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — When Ukrainian soldiers captured two North Korean prisoners of war last month, it provided the first undeniable proof of Pyongyang’s direct involvement in the war against Ukraine. It also shed some light on the mindset and training of the conscripted North Korean soldiers sent to fight Russia’s war a continent away from their home. Highly disciplined, ready to die but also very young and with little battlefield experience they elicited curiosity and even some pity from the Ukrainian soldiers who captured them during two separate missions on Jan. 9. Their capture confirmed what Ukraine, South Korea and the U.S. had been saying for months: Thousands of North Korean troops were fighting alongside Kremlin forces in the battle for Russia’s Kursk border region — something Moscow had never confirmed. ‘You will live,’ one North Korean captive is assured Capturing a North Korean prisoner had long been an objective for the Ukrainian special forces, even as the North Koreans seemed willing to kill themselves or a wounded comrade to elude capture. Only one had been taken captive, in December, but he died of his wounds. Then intelligence came about three soldiers stranded in the so-called gray zone — a dangerous no-man’s-land on the front line controlled by neither side. The soldiers were identified as North Koreans because they, not Russians, were operating in that sector of Kursk. 'They were likely abandoned,' said a Ukrainian soldier who participated in the mission and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because special forces members are not authorized to reveal their names. The team advanced through a barren winter forest toward the coordinates where a drone had spotted the three lost soldiers. 'Koreans are incredibly tough,' the soldier said. 'We’ve seen them carrying enormous loads: one soldier as small as a child, with a heavy backpack and a machine gun, yet sprinting.' As they closed in, the Ukrainians came under enemy fire, and two of the North Koreans were killed in the firefight. The third soldier was wounded in his legs. When the Ukrainians reached him, his only remaining weapon was a single grenade. Disoriented, he didn’t resist as the group began providing first aid and their commander discreetly removed the grenade. The North Korean, unaware of this, continued searching his pockets for it afterward. The Ukrainian soldier said he tried to communicate with the captured man. He first spoke in Russian, eliciting a faint response. Then he heard the soldier muttering phrases in English and switched to his own broken English. He asked the soldier's age and how long he had been serving. The soldier said he was 21 years old and had already spent four years in the military. 'He said conscription starts at 16 and lasts eight years,' the Ukrainian soldier said. Despite his own 12 years of service and being a father of three, the soldier felt an unexpected wave of compassion. 'I looked at him, and honestly, I felt sorry for him,' he said. 'He asked for water, and we gave him some. Then he asked for a cigarette, and we gave him one. He called us ‘brothers.’' The team bandaged the North Korean soldier's legs and were carrying him toward Ukrainian-controlled territory when they were detected by a Russian reconnaissance drone, prompting a barrage of enemy fire. 'They must have realized we’d captured him and were desperate to take him out,' the soldier said. The team eventually reached a Ukrainian evacuation vehicle. They loaded the wounded North Korean into it. Only then, noticing the blue armbands on their sleeves, did he grasp he was in Ukrainian hands. He began searching frantically for his grenade again. 'When I handed him over to the medics, he looked terrified that I wasn’t going with him,' the soldier said. 'I told him, ‘Everything will be fine, you will live.’' With that, the vehicle drove off, concluding the operation after eight tense hours. 'I do feel sorry for him, but damn, they came to our land,' the soldier said. 'Still, I’d like to meet him again someday.' A North Korean soldier attempts suicide rather than be captured On the same day, soldiers from an airborne unit captured another North Korean soldier, this time by chance and without initially realizing who they were taking prisoner. It all began around 5 a.m., when a North Korean assault struck their position. 'The battle was intense and dragged on for hours,' recalled 27-year-old paratrooper Maksym Didorchuk. The air thundered with explosions, and the sky buzzed with drones. The North Koreans attacked relentlessly. 'Their assaults are massive, but they’re treated as expendable,' Didorchuk said. 'They’re tough because they rely on sheer numbers' 'They follow orders,' and never retreat, he said. 'They’re likely being used as training material.' Around noon, a reconnaissance drone spotted a lone soldier moving erratically from the Russian side toward the rear of the Ukrainian position. 'He was zigzagging, moving left and right,' Didorchuk said. 'Nobody knew who he was. The order was to intercept him, provide medical assistance if necessary, and decide what to do next.' Didorchuk and another paratrooper set off toward the soldier, guided by a Ukrainian reconnaissance drone. They eventually reached an area near destroyed Russian weaponry, where they saw the soldier sitting, his face hidden from view. The paratroopers approached cautiously, asking in Ukrainian if the soldier needed help. No response. They tried Russian. The soldier glanced at them but remained silent. Switching to English also yielded no reaction. Finally, as they drew closer, they saw his features clearly — and realized he was North Korean. The soldier’s arm was wounded, and his jaw bandaged, likely before he was separated. His movements were slow and uncoordinated, possibly the result of a concussion, Didorchuk said. 'He didn’t seem to know where he was going.' Attached to his armor were a grenade and a knife. The paratroopers gestured for him to remove them, but he appeared confused. 'He didn’t know if we were allies or enemies,' Didorchuk said. After repeated gestures, the soldier dropped the grenade and the knife. The paratroopers motioned for him to follow, and he complied. They maintained a cautious distance, aware that Russian drones could spot them and attack to prevent the North Korean from being captured. 'From what I understand, they don’t want Koreans taken prisoner. They quickly evacuate their wounded and dead to erase all traces,' Didorchuk said. As they waited in a trench for transport, the North Korean asked for a cigarette, then another, while the paratroopers kept a vigilant eye not only on him but on the skies for Russian drones. When the vehicle arrived, the North Korean soldier grew nervous. Suddenly he lunged at a concrete pillar, striking his head against it. 'I saw it as an attempt at self-destruction,' Didorchuk said. The soldiers secured him in the vehicle to be transferred to the authorities. Ukraine’s SBU security service, which interrogated the POWs, said one had no documents, while the other carried a Russian military ID in the name of a man from Tuva, a Russian region bordering Mongolia. It said one of the soldiers claimed he was told he was going to Russia for training, not to fight against Ukraine. He said his combat unit only received one week of training alongside Russian troops before being sent to the front.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-inside-the-operations-that-took-captive-2-north-korean-soldiers-fighting-ukraine/	2025-02-04T21:04:06-08:00	
Trump floats US taking over Gaza Strip	President Trump on Tuesday floated the idea of the U.S. taking over the Gaza Strip, saying America should be responsible for clearing the territory of rubble and unexploded bombs and proposing an 'economic development.' Trump’s remarks are some of his most extreme rhetoric regarding the future of the territory where nearly 2 million Palestinians live and hope to be part of a future Palestinian state. Trump also suggested the U.S. would develop the land but gave no details on who would be allowed to live there. The president said he envisioned Palestinians will live there but seemed to describe the territory as an international hub where 'the world’s people' would use it for access to the Mediterranean coast. The idea appears to build on Trump’s 2020 peace plan that envisioned Gaza’s coastline developed for commercial and leisure resorts. The plan was developed by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose background is in real estate development. 'I think you'll make that into an international, unbelievable place… I don't want to be cute, I don't want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle East… this could be so magnificent.' Asked about the possibility of sending U.S. troops to Gaza, Trump said the U.S. will 'do what is necessary' as he laid out plans for the U.S. to take the area over, and suggested he would visit the territory. 'As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that,' Trump said. 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job — whether we'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out,' Trump said. 'Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area, do a real job, do something different.' Trump made the statements during his opening remarks at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. 'I do see a long-term ownership position,' Trump continued. 'This was not a decision made lightly. Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent in a really magnificent area that nobody would know, nobody can look because all they see is death and destruction and rubble and demolished buildings falling all over.' Earlier, Trump said Palestinians in Gaza could be relocated and settled elsewhere, and that they should not want to return to Gaza. Trump called for countries 'of interest with humanitarian hearts' to build 'various domains' that could 'be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza.' Netanyahu praised Trump as a leader who thinks outside the box. 'You say things others refuse to say and after the jaws drop, people scratch their heads and they say, ‘You know, he’s right,’' Netanyahu said. Asked if he supports Trump's proposal, Netanyahu said 'President Trump is taking it to a much higher level. ... He sees a different future for that piece of land.' Arab nations have publicly rejected displacing Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. 'Palestinians do not want to leave their land,' a senior Palestinian official and the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio this week. 'We support their position unequivocally,' they wrote in the letter, which called for Palestinians to 'live in their land and help rebuild it.' Trump later in his remarks from the White House reiterated that the U.S. would rebuild the strip. 'As far as Gaza’s concerned, we will do what’s necessary. … We’re going to take over that piece and we’re going to develop it. Create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it’s going to be something that [the] entire Middle East can be proud of,' Trump said. 'I think we’ll be a great keeper of something that is very, very strong,' he said, adding that jobs created in Gaza will be 'for everybody.' Alex Gangitano contributed to this story.

Trump and Netanyahu hold talks as US president warns 'no guarante...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet Tuesday as the Israeli prime minister faces competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want the remaining hostages home and the 15-month conflict to end. Trump is guarded about the long-term prospects for the truce, even as he takes credit for pressuring Hamas and Israel into the hostage and ceasefire agreement that went into effect the day before he returned to office last month. 'I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,' Trump told reporters on Monday. The leaders' talks are expected to touch on a long-sought Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization deal and concerns about Iran's nuclear program, but hammering out the second phase of the hostage deal will be at the top of the agenda. Netanyahu's arrival in Washington for the first foreign leader visit of Trump's second term comes as the prime minister's popular support is lagging. Netanyahu is in the middle of weekslong testimony in an ongoing corruption trial that centers on allegations he exchanged favors with media moguls and wealthy associates. He has decried the accusations and said he is the victim of a 'witch hunt.' Being seen with Trump, who is popular in Israel, could help distract the public from the trial and boost Netanyahu’s standing. It's Netanyahu's first travel outside Israel since the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in November for him, his former defense minister and Hamas’ slain military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza. The U.S. does not recognize the ICC's authority over its citizens or territory. Netanyahu and Trump's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff on Monday began the daunting work of brokering the next phase of a ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu said in a statement that the meeting with Witkoff and U.S. national security adviser Michael Waltz was 'positive and friendly.' The Israeli leader said he would send a delegation to Qatar to continue indirect talks with Hamas that are being mediated by the Gulf Arab country, the first confirmation that those negotiations would continue. Netanyahu also said he would convene his security Cabinet to discuss Israel’s demands for the next phase of the ceasefire when he returns to Israel at the end of the week. Netanyahu is under intense pressure from hard-right members of his governing coalition to abandon the ceasefire and resume fighting in Gaza to eliminate Hamas. Bezalel Smotrich, one of Netanyahu’s key partners, vows to topple the government if the war isn’t relaunched, a step that could lead to early elections. Hamas, which has reasserted control over Gaza since the ceasefire began last month, has said it will not release hostages in the second phase without an end to the war and Israeli forces’ full withdrawal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, maintains that Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war. Mira Resnick, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli and Palestinian affairs, said Trump may 'have little patience for political woes of Netanyahu if it gets in the way of the broader goals of this administration.' 'The president started his term by saying that he wanted the ceasefire to be in place by Jan. 20. That's what he got,' Resnick said. 'He is invested in this because he was able to take credit for it.' Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among the hostages, called on Trump to use American leverage to keep Netanyahu committed to the agreement. Matan, 24, is among those who are expected to be included in the second phase of the deal, when all remaining living hostages — including men under the age of 50 and male soldiers — are to be exchanged for a yet-to-be-determined number of Palestinian prisoners. The second phase is also expected to include the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. 'I want President Trump to know there are certain extreme elements from within Israel who are trying to torpedo his vision,' said Zangauker, who traveled to Washington from Israel to join a planned Tuesday rally outside the White House. 'We are representative of the vast, vast majority of Israel. The ultra-extremists are blackmailing the prime minister to do their bidding.' Since returning to office, Trump has called for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, even as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II have rejected it. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League have joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Yet Trump insists he can persuade Egypt and Jordan to come around to accept displaced Palestinians because of the significant aid that the U.S. provides Cairo and Amman. Hard-line right-wing members of Netanyahu's government have embraced the call to move displaced Palestinians out of Gaza. Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, said the push by Trump to move Palestinians out of Gaza is helpful to Netanyahu. But he added that it undercuts Trump and Netanyahu's desire to land a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis, the biggest Arab power in the Middle East, have said they would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank. 'This push by Trump doesn’t square with the idea of a Palestinian state as we know it,' Telhami said. 'It's hard to see the Saudis going along with it.' Netanyahu on Monday met with Trump’s pick to serve as ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and evangelical leaders. Huckabee has long rejected a Palestinian state in territory previously seized by Israel. The prime minister is also expected to press Trump to take decisive action on Iran. Tehran has faced a series of military setbacks, including Israeli forces significantly degrading Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon as well as an operation that decimated Iran's air defenses. The moment, Netanyahu believes, has created a window to decisively address Tehran's nuclear program. 'This is one of the most important and critical meetings between an American president and an Israeli prime minister,' said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. 'What’s at stake here is not just bilateral relations between Israel and the United States but the reshaping of the Middle East.' ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

US aid freeze puts at risk Ukraine’s wartime help for frontline e...	PAVLOHRAD, Ukraine (AP) — In what used to be the concert hall in this town in eastern Ukraine, cots are arranged on stage. Instead of music, the room is filled with the muffled sobs of local people driven from their homes by fighting in the country’s almost three-year war with Russia. The Russian army’s recent advances have engulfed towns and villages in the area. The Pavlohrad concert hall was requisitioned as a temporary center for local civilians fleeing the relentless Russian bombardment. 'It’s good here. There’s food, warmth, and a place to wash,' said 83-year-old Kateryna Odraha, who lived through the Nazi German occupation of her village during World War II. That refuge may now be in peril. The shelter costs the equivalent of $7,000 a month to run, and 60% of that was being covered by U.S. funds sent to help Ukraine. President Donald Trump’s decision last week to freeze for 90 days the humanitarian aid that the United States provides to countries overseas was felt in places far from Washington, including here, a few kilometers (miles) from the front line in eastern Ukraine. Trump’s decision immediately halted thousands of U.S.-funded humanitarian, development and security programs. The consequences have rippled across the world. 'This news was abrupt and unexpected,' said Illia Novikov, the coordinator of the Pavlohrad transit center, which is run by the charity organization Relief Coordination Center. 'At this moment, we have no idea what the future holds.' The U.S. funding covered fuel for evacuation vehicles, salaries for aid workers, legal and psychological support, and tickets to help evacuees reach safer locations, he said. Usually about 60 people pass through the shelter each day, but when the Russian bombardment worsens, that can climb to more than 200, according to Novikov. Many people heading here have spent months living in their basement without electricity, running water or enough food. Vasyl Odraha, 58, remained in his local village for months, even as artillery fire and Russian guided bomb strikes became more frequent as the war moved closer. He said he initially believed that Trump would stop the war within 24 hours of taking office, as he had promised during his election campaign. 'We pinned our hopes on Trump’s election,' he said, sitting on a cot beside his 83-year-old mother. When the fighting didn’t stop, and the front line moved to within less than 3 kilometers (2 miles) of where they lived, they fled at dawn. 'If we hadn’t left, we would have died that very night,' said Kateryna Odraha. Across Ukraine, many other sectors are reeling from the aid freeze, which places additional strain on Ukraine’s stretched wartime finances. Energy projects, veteran support programs, psychological helplines, cybersecurity, healthcare, independent media, and even border infrastructure projects have been affected. The aid was intended to help cushion the war’s impact. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his government expects $300-400 million in aid to be cut. Most of that was for the energy sector that has been targeted by Russia. Ukraine hopes to make up the shortfall from European sources of aid or internal ones, Zelenskyy said. The World Health Organization, a U.N. agency which Trump wants the U.S. to leave, launched an emergency appeal Tuesday to raise $110 million for its humanitarian response in Ukraine where it said almost 13 million people are 'in dire need' of assistance. 'The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine has reached a scale of undeniable severity,' the WHO said in a statement. In the latest devastating Russian attack on a civilian area, authorities said a ballistic missile smashed into an administrative building in downtown Izium, a city in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region, killing five people and injuring 50 others, including three children. U.S. military aid has not been frozen, according to Zelenskyy, but Ukraine has received only about 42% of the money approved by Congress. There is no clear sign the war might be close to ending, and that means Ukrainian civilians will need more help. 'Evacuations will continue for a long time,' Novikov, the transit center’s coordinator, said. 'There may be new front lines, new affected communities, so we must be prepared to keep providing assistance.' ___ Associated Press journalists Samya Kullab, Susie Blann and Illia Novikov in Kyiv contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-aid-freeze-puts-at-risk-ukraines-wartime-help-for-frontline-evacuees/	2025-02-04T07:09:53-08:00	
Trump wants rare earth elements from Ukraine in exchange for mili...	(The Hill) - President Trump indicated Monday he wants a deal for rare earth elements and other items from Ukraine in exchange for continued military aid in the nation’s war against Russia. 'We're handing them money hand over fist. We're giving them equipment,' Trump said Monday. 'We're looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they're going to secure what we're giving them with their rare earth and other things,' he told reporters in the Oval Office. 'I want to have security of rare earth,' he added, appearing to refer to rare earth elements, which refers to a specific group of materials that are only deposited in relatively small quantities and can be used in a variety of applications including electronics, health care and batteries. It’s not clear whether Trump’s desired deal would refer only to the elements that are considered rare earths, or if he is also interested in minerals like lithium and titanium, of which Ukraine has a significant supply. In Ukraine’s existing 'Victory Plan,' the country said it would work to supply its strategic partners with 'natural resources and critical metals worth trillions of U.S. dollars' including uranium, titanium, lithium and graphite. Ukraine may not be the only foreign supplier in Trump’s sights. Mike Waltz, who Trump has tapped as national security adviser, has said that Trump’s quest for Greenland is about minerals and other natural resources.

Middle East latest: At least 6 injured in attack in Israel-occupi...	At least six people were injured in a shooting attack at a checkpoint in the Israeli-occupied West Bank early Tuesday morning, according to the Israeli military and area hospitals. The Israeli military said an attacker fired at soldiers at a checkpoint in the village of Tayasir, which is in the northern West Bank. In a tense exchange, soldiers returned fire and the attacker was killed, the military added. Israeli hospitals said they had received a total of six people injured in the shooting attack. Israeli media reported the injured are soldiers and at least two of them were critically injured. Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group praised the attack but neither claimed responsibility for it. Israel has carried out an extensive operation in nearby Jenin over the past weeks to clamp down on what Israel said is militant activity in the city, as soldiers and armored bulldozers have caused widespread damage and destroyed scores of homes. Palestinian health officials have not released a total death toll, but say Israeli fire has killed at least 20 Palestinians since the start of the raid. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip ignited the war there. ___ Here's the latest: Turkey will host 15 Palestinian prisoners released as part of ceasefire ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey’s state-run news agency says the country will host 15 Palestinian prisoners who were released and deported as part of the ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel. The Turkish intelligence organization, MIT, is taking steps to 'facilitate' the arrival of the 15 Palestinians from Egypt, the Anadolu Agency said Tuesday. Arrangements were made to ensure the Palestinians can live 'peacefully and securely' in Turkey, Anadolu said. The news agency did not name the Palestinians that Ankara was preparing to take in. Those who were deported have been convicted of serious crimes. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Sunday that Turkey was prepared to support the Palestinian people, including providing medical treatment for those wounded in the conflict and taking in released prisoners who would be deported from the region. Unlike its Western allies, Turkey does not consider Hamas to be a terror organization. A strong critic of Israel’s military actions in Gaza, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has hosted several Hamas officials over the years. Family members of Thai hostages released by Hamas visit them in Israeli hospital JERUSALEM — Family members of Thai hostages released by Hamas last week after over 15 months of captivity in the Gaza Strip have visited them at the Israeli hospital where they are recuperating. The Thai Embassy in Israel said the family members flew in on Tuesday and met with the freed hostages at the Shamir Medical Center. Hamas released five Thai hostages last week along with three Israeli captives who were freed as part of a ceasefire agreement in exchange for 110 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas militants kidnapped 31 Thai nationals along with scores of Israelis and a few other foreigners during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel that ignited the war. Tens of thousands of Thai farmers work in Israel, where they can make higher wages than they can at home. Many lived in compounds on the outskirts of southern Israeli farming communities and towns that were overrun by Hamas-led militants. During an earlier ceasefire in November 2023, 23 Thai nationals were released in a deal negotiated between Thailand and Hamas, with assistance from Qatar and Iran. According to Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 46 Thais have been killed during the conflict, including two Thai citizens who were killed on Oct. 7, 2023 and their bodies taken into Gaza.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-at-least-6-injured-in-attack-in-israel-occupied-west-bank-assailant-is-killed/	2025-02-04T05:00:59-08:00	
Middle East latest: Hostages freed from Gaza rarely saw sunlight,...	The families of hostages freed from Gaza over the weekend, the latest release in the ceasefire deal, described difficult conditions — including rarely seeing the sun — during their captivity. The six-week first phase of the truce calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 prisoners, as well as the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory. Israel and Hamas are beginning to negotiate a second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached. ___ Here's the latest: More than 545,000 Palestinians have crossed in northern Gaza, UN says UNITED NATIONS — More than 545,000 Palestinians are estimated to have crossed from southern Gaza to northern Gaza in the past week since the Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect, the United Nations says. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Monday that the U.N. and its humanitarian partners also report that over 36,000 people have been observed moving from northern Gaza to the south during the same period. In North Gaza, U.N. partners said three temporary sites that have been established in Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and Jabalya, each capable of holding 5,000 people. As more humanitarian aid enters Gaza and the ceasefire continues to hold, Dujarric said U.N. partners report that prices have started to fall, though they remain about pre-conflict levels. 'One-third of households reportedly have better access to food, but consumption remains significantly below levels prior to the escalation of hostilities,' he said. 'For most households, the primary obstacle is just lack of cash.' Meanwhile, U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher arrived Monday for a weeklong visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories, Dujarric said. He is expected to visit the West Bank and Gaza Strip and meet with senior officials to see first-hand 'and get a better understanding of the obstacles facing aid partners, and also look at how to best and improve our humanitarian operations.' Hostage endured ‘psychological torture,’ sister says JERUSALEM — The family of Yarden Bibas, a hostage who was released from captivity Saturday, said he was held in very difficult conditions and subject to 'ongoing psychological torture,' according his sister said Monday from the hospital where he is recovering in Tel Aviv. He has lost significant weight and muscle mass because of the conditions, including rarely seeing the sun, Ofri Bibas-Levy said. Yarden Bibas was kidnapped separately from his wife, Shiri Bibas, and his two children, Ariel and Kfir, who were 4 years old and 9 months old when they were kidnapped. Kfir was the youngest of about 30 children taken hostage Oct. 7, and the infant with red hair and a toothless smile become a symbol across Israel. 'Since he was released, he has asked just one question: Where are Shiri and the children?' said Dana Silberman-Sitton, the sister of Shiri Bibas. Bibas-Levy also pleaded for Israel and the US to continue the negotiations for the second stage of the ceasefire. Weapons storage facilities hit in Lebanon, Israeli military says JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said it had located and destroyed several weapons storage facilities in southern Lebanon on Monday, where troops are continuing to operate as a fragile ceasefire enters its third month. Israel said soldiers had found mortar shells, missiles, rockets, explosives, firearms and a large amount of military equipment belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, without providing evidence. The military said it also killed a number of Hezbollah militants located close to Israeli troops. The ceasefire deal for Lebanon gave both sides 60 days to remove their forces from southern Lebanon and for the Lebanese army to move in and secure the area. Israel says Hezbollah and the Lebanese army haven’t met their obligations, while Lebanon accuses the Israeli army of hindering the Lebanese military from taking over. The 60-day deadline expired at the end of January. Israel said the agreement is progressing but, in some sectors, 'it has been delayed and will take slightly longer.' American-Israeli hostage spent long periods in isolation, daughter says JERUSALEM — American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, 65, who was released from captivity Saturday, spent long periods of time alone, rarely saw sunlight and was given very little food, causing him to lose a drastic amount of weight, his daughter said Monday night from the hospital in Tel Aviv where her father is recuperating. Shir Siegel added that her father insisted Monday on knowing what happened to Kibbutz Kfar Aza during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. 'We had to go over a cruel and long list of 64 people, dear to us and loved, and he could not understand that so many of his friends were murdered,' Siegel said. Aviva Siegel, Keith Siegel's wife, who was also kidnapped and released in the weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, thanked U.S. President Donald Trump for help negotiating the ceasefire and pleaded with him to ensure the next stage of the ceasefire will take place. 'The hardest part is ahead of us, and I trust you to see this deal through, because it’s the road to healing for all of us,' she said, in a message to both the Israeli and American governments. Opposition leader says ceasefire won't bring down Netanyahu government JERUSALEM — Israel’s opposition leader says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government will not fall over the continuation of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that brings about the return of more hostages. Yair Lapid spoke Monday, the day before Netanyahu was to meet with Trump at the White House to discuss the truce. His remarks aimed at preventing Netanyahu from citing domestic political pressure as a reason for resuming the war. Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners have vowed to quit the government if he does not resume the war after the first phase ends in early March. Their departure would significantly raise the chances of early elections in which Netanyahu could be voted out. Lapid, speaking from an Israeli community near the border that was devastated in Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, 2023, said 'Netanyahu has a political safety net from the opposition for the deal, for every stage.' 'The deal has the overwhelming support of the people of Israel, and the deal has the overwhelming support of the Knesset of Israel,' he added, referring to Israel’s parliament. Russian diplomat meets with Hamas envoy MOSCOW — A senior Russian diplomat met a visiting Hamas envoy Monday to discuss the ceasefire deal in Gaza. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, President Vladimir Putin’s envoy for the Middle East and Africa, held talks with Hamas’ Musa Abu-Marzouq. The ministry said they discussed the progress of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza 'with an emphasis on the importance of increasing the volume of humanitarian aid to the affected Palestinian population.' The ministry’s statement noted that the Russian side once again 'particularly emphasized the need to fulfill the promises made by the Hamas leadership' regarding the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip. Syria's interim president to meet with Turkish officials ANKARA, Turkey — Syria’s interim president is set to visit Ankara on Tuesday, making his second international trip after his visit to Saudi Arabia, a top Turkish presidential aide has announced. Ahmad al-Sharaa, the newly installed former rebel leader who headed the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham militant group, is scheduled to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other Turkish officials. Talks would focus on steps that can be taken toward Syria’s economic recovery as well as the country’s security and stability, Fahrettin Altun, the aide, announced on the X social media platform Monday. Discussions would also center on how various countries and international organizations can offer assistance to Syria’s transitional administration and its people, he added. Turkey was a strong backer of groups opposed to ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad during the country’s civil war and is considered to be one of the new administration’s key allies.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-hostages-freed-from-gaza-rarely-saw-sunlight-families-say/	2025-02-03T18:13:41-08:00	
ACLU sues University of Michigan over campus bans for pro-Palesti...	LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Jonathan Zou, a second-year student at the University of Michigan, was among the thousands of students who joined pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses nationwide this past year. Although the campus protests have subsided, the repercussions for students like Zou remain. Since his arrest by university police last Oct. 7 after using a megaphone during a pro-Palestinian march, Zou has been banned from all University of Michigan campuses, except for attending class or seeking medical care. Zou is one of five individuals facing similar bans who the American Civil Liberties Union is representing in a lawsuit that accuses the University of Michigan of violating their right to free speech. The lawsuit, filed Monday by the ACLU in federal court, also argues that the university 'abused its authority to ban people from public property.' 'The university says it appreciates this history of activism, but it will arrest students, ban students, surveil students and repress them through legal or school disciplinary means,' Zou said in an interview before the lawsuit was filed. In response to a request for comment, a University of Michigan spokesperson said the university has not been served with the lawsuit and has no comment at this time. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations swept college campuses last spring, with activists setting up tent encampments and, in some cases, escalating their protests further. Thousands were arrested; while many had their cases dismissed, others remain in legal limbo as they pursue their education. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for aggressive action to fight antisemitism on college campuses and promising to prosecute offenders and revoke visas for international students found to be what he called 'Hamas sympathizers.' Michigan has been deeply affected by tensions over the Israel-Hamas war, with metro Detroit home to the nation’s largest Arab American community and a significant Jewish population. These dynamics have sparked unrest on University of Michigan campuses, resulting in police clashes with protesters and demonstrators targeting university regents for protests. Last week, the University of Michigan suspended a pro-Palestinian group for two years and pulled its funding after accusing the group of violating the university’s standards of conduct. The ACLU's lawsuit was brought on behalf of Zou and one other current student, two recent graduates and an Ann Arbor community member. According to the lawsuit, the individuals were each issued trespass bans after being accused of misconduct during protests, but never formally charged for it. Zou was participating in a march on the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus on the one-year anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and another 250 were taken hostage. The 2023 attack sparked a war that has devastated the Hamas-ruled Gaza strip. Zou was arrested after using a megaphone during the march, but never formally charged. The trespass bans have upended individuals 'daily lives, disrupted their, education and work, and are blocking their ability to speak and protest freely on the University’s vast campus,' according to the lawsuit. The individuals are asking the federal court to lift their bans and prevent the university from issuing broad trespassing bans in the future. A ceasefire took effect last month between Hamas and Israel, leading to hostage-for-prisoner swaps and a flood of aid into the Gaza Strip after a 15-month ground war marked by devastation, hunger and mass displacement in the territory. Looming large is the possibility that fighting will resume if the ceasefire breaks down after the six-week first phase.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-aclu-sues-university-of-michigan-over-campus-bans-for-pro-palestinian-protesters/	2025-02-03T15:48:00-08:00	
Ukraine strikes a major Russian oil refinery for a second time in...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian long-range drones struck one of Russia’s biggest oil refineries for the second time in three days, a senior Kyiv official said Monday, as Ukraine tries to slow the Russian army’s push along parts of the front line and the third anniversary of the war approaches. The attack late Sunday hit a refinery in the Volgograd region, which is one of Russia’s 10 biggest refining facilities, processing close to 6% of the country’s oil, an official in Ukraine’s Security Service told The Associated Press. Russian authorities acknowledged only a brief fire at the Volgograd refinery during the drone attack. Ukrainian defenses are creaking under a monthslong Russian drive to occupy more land, especially in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, before the possible start of peace negotiations steered by U.S. President Donald Trump. Ukraine, though heavily dependent on Western military aid, has been developing its own arms industry, including drones that can fly increasingly long ranges with bigger payloads. Ukrainians authorities said they attacked the same Volgograd refinery on Friday, but no further details were immediately available. The Sunday night attack by Ukrainian drones also targeted a major natural gas processing plant in Russia’s Astrakhan region, the security service official said on condition of anonymity to discuss classified operations. The official said that the attack was the security service’s fifth successful operation behind the front lines this year as it looks to disrupt the Russian war machine. The Volgograd refinery is located around 480 kilometers (300 miles) behind the front line. The Astrakhan plant is even further away, roughly 800 kilometers (500 miles) from Ukraine. The Russian military said that it destroyed 70 Ukrainian drones over six Russian regions during the night. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that the Volgograd region and the Astrakhan region on the Caspian Sea coast were targeted, as were sites in the Belgorod, Kursk and Voronezh regions on the border with Ukraine. Authorities temporarily suspended flights in and out of nine Russian airports in different regions. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/business/ap-business/ap-ukraine-strikes-a-major-russian-oil-refinery-for-a-second-time-in-3-days-an-official-says/	2025-02-03T05:56:41-08:00	
Aid is surging into Gaza under the ceasefire. Is it helping?	JERUSALEM (AP) — Two weeks after the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel took effect, aid is flooding into the Gaza Strip, bringing relief to a territory suffering from hunger, mass displacement and devastation following 15 months of war. But Palestinians and aid workers say it’s still an uphill battle to ensure the assistance reaches everyone. And looming large is the possibility that fighting will resume if the ceasefire breaks down after the six-week first phase. As part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel said it would allow 600 aid trucks into Gaza each day, a major increase. Israel estimates that at least 4,200 trucks have entered each week since the ceasefire took hold. Humanitarian groups say aid distribution is complicated by destroyed or damaged roads, Israeli inspections and the threat of unexploded bombs. On Saturday, Samir Abu Holi, 68, watched over a food-distribution point in Jabaliya, an area in northern Gaza razed to the ground during multiple Israeli offensives, the most recent of which cut off nearly all aid for over a month. 'I have more than 10 children. All of them need milk and food. Before the ceasefire, we used to provide food with difficulty,' he said. 'Today there is a little relief.' Here’s a closer look at the aid situation. A surge of aid The main U.N. food agency, the World Food Program, said it dispersed more food to Palestinians in Gaza during the first four days of the ceasefire than it did, on average, during any month of the war. Over 32,000 metric tons of aid have entered Gaza since the ceasefire, the agency said last week. Aid is now entering through two crossings in the north and one in the south. Aid agencies said they are opening bakeries and handing out high-energy biscuits, and Hamas police have returned to the streets to help restore order. Before the ceasefire, aid organizations said delivery was complicated by armed gangs looting the trucks, attacks on aid workers, arduous Israeli inspections and difficulties coordinating with COGAT, the Israeli military body charged with facilitating aid. Israel blamed the U.N. and humanitarian organizations for failing to deliver aid once it reached Gaza. There’s now the 'political will to make everything else work,' said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement. 'COGAT is fast-tracking responses to coordination requests. It’s allowing two crossings instead of one to operate in the north. The ceasefire is allowing Hamas forces to operate freely to stop looting … and the lack of hostilities allow aid agencies to move freely and safely,' Hary said. Food prices are still a challenge Nadine Jomaa, a young woman in Bureij in central Gaza, said the aid is not freely available, and she needs to buy goods in the market, where they are resold for inflated prices. Though prices are coming down, flour and cooking gas still cost roughly triple the amount they did before the war, according to the World Food Program. Her family is eating only cheap canned goods. 'We need more food, water, household items for the kitchen and bathroom and women’s items,' she said. Although humanitarian officials have long said the best way to prevent extortion is to flood Gaza with aid, Palestinians in the north say that, so far, the influx appears to have only boosted shadowy middlemen. Residents complain that there are not nearly enough tents entering Gaza while non-essential items such as chocolate, nuts and soda are suddenly ubiquitous. Ahmed Qamar, 34, who returned to live in the ruins of his former home in Jabaliya, said his area has seen just a few dozen aid trucks. 'Hundreds of families here are sleeping in the open and in the cold,' he said. 'We need electricity and shelter, and meanwhile markets are flooded with chocolate and cigarettes.' Though aid workers say the Israeli inspection process has accelerated, getting certain types of aid into Gaza is still challenging. Some items are deemed 'dual-use,' barring them from Gaza because of concerns they could be diverted by militants for military purposes. Some hospitals and desalination plants still have fuel shortages. And Hamas on Sunday accused Israeli officials of obstructing the delivery of medical supplies and reconstruction machinery. According to a list circulated to humanitarian groups by COGAT and shared with The Associated Press, desalination and water-collection devices, storage units, tools, tent kits, ovens, water-resistant clothing and equipment for shelter construction teams all require 'pre-approval' before entering Gaza. Large tents, sleeping bags, portable toilets, heating pads and vaccines are cleared to enter the strip without Israeli approval. 'While aid is getting in in higher numbers, we also know that those restrictions on essential items are persisting,' said Sophie Driscoll, head of communications for the International Rescue Committee in the Palestinian territories. COGAT acknowledged keeping certain items on the dual-use list but said it is still permitting them into Gaza after screening. The agency said tents are not considered dual-use, and Israel has allowed tens of thousands into Gaza in recent weeks 'without restriction.' It also said Israel has extended the hours crossings are open and allowed road repairs inside Gaza. 'Regarding the distribution of aid inside Gaza, Israel does not control the situation inside,' COGAT said. Destroyed roads, unexploded ordnance Roads have been heavily damaged by the war, and unexploded bombs litter the landscape. The U.N. estimates that 5% to 10% of all ammunition dropped in Gaza has failed to detonate, making the territory potentially perilous for civilians and aid workers. UNMAS, the U.N. agency handling unexploded ordnance, said that since the ceasefire took hold, humanitarian convoys and civilians have reported finding large aircraft bombs, mortars and rifle grenades. As they return home, many Palestinians are living in areas where the water network has been destroyed. That makes dehydration and the spread of disease due to poor sanitary conditions and limited medical care a threat. Speaking from southern Gaza, Jonathan Crickx, chief of communications at UNICEF, recalled being on a road where 'thousands and thousands of children and families were walking.' 'I was seeing them with nothing,' he said, 'only the clothes they’re wearing on their back.' ___ Associated Press writer Isabel DeBre contributed to this report from Ramallah, West Bank.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-aid-is-surging-into-gaza-under-the-ceasefire-is-it-helping/	2025-02-03T03:51:35-08:00	
The Gaza war is paused, but Israel and Hamas keep up a fierce bat...	LONDON (AP) — Arbel Yehoud is achingly close to freedom, but her face is a study of shadow and terror. She is dwarfed by dozens of masked Hamas fighters — and beyond them, a heaving mob of chanting men who surround her and fill the frame. In the next, Yehoud looks up at her captors, pleading. But video suggests they're on the edge themselves, barely able to hold back the people impeding Yehoud's dash to safety under the terms of a ceasefire deal. Cut to photos of her friends and family in Israel, watching the handover live — hands over their mouths, breathless. Yehoud makes it into waiting vehicles, and then to Israel. Cue the government's images of her joyous reunion with her parents. The visuals out of Israel and Gaza during recent hostage-for-prisoner swaps were part of a choreographed battle of optics waged in parallel to the 16-month ground war between Israel and Hamas. Each side uses the light and shadow of images to make themselves look virtuous and strong — and each other monstrous and weak. It's propaganda. But some images also tell the truth: The chaos during Yehoud's release in Gaza on Thursday, for example, reflected the fragility of the ceasefire deal that took effect Jan. 19. 'All of this was filmed and intentionally shared,' said Danielle Gilbert, an expert on hostage-taking at Northwestern University. 'Social scientists talk about the idea of a collapse of compassion. Audience pay more attention and are willing to take more of a risk to recover, or help, individual victims.' Throughout history, both sides of hostage standoffs and POW releases have tried to capitalize on the plight of those in captivity by focusing on details of the names, faces, families and conditions of captivity. Even in war, branding is a potent force. Proof of life, or lack of it, injects urgency into negotiations Since at least the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh's baby son in 1932, images of hostages have been pivotal elements of negotiations because they carry an intense emotional charge. We can’t, for example, unsee images of bound and blindfolded Americans taken captive in Iran in 1979. Or the photo of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl holding up a newspaper, a sign of life, before his Islamic militant captors killed him in 2002. Or the image of a masked Arab commando, captured in black-and-white in 1972, on the balcony of the Munich Olympic Village building. Inside, a Palestinian group called Black September killed 11 Israeli team members. The Israel-Hamas media duel, waged heavily on social media, exploded the moment thousands of Hamas fighters defeated Israel’s borders on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and dragging about 250 back to Gaza. Cameras anchored to the militants themselves, as well as phones hoisted by the Israelis under attack, captured the killing-and-hostage-taking spree in such detail that some viewers reported a type of trauma — called vicarious or secondary trauma — just from seeing them. Billions of American dollars and other aid have been influenced at least in part by public opinion, which has fluctuated over the course of the conflict. Anti-Israel protests raged around the world, antisemitism surged and disinformation about the conflict proliferated. The International Criminal Court last year issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ late military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the Gaza war. The embattled Israeli leader has vowed to fight the allegations. Israel has used images to argue that it was Hamas that waged crimes against humanity. Within a month of the attacks, the army compiled a film of the grisliest moments of the Hamas attack called 'Bearing Witness' in English and 'The Film of Horrors' in Hebrew. The Israeli government invited select journalists, diplomats and Hollywood executives to watch it at screenings in several countries. In Tel Aviv, a briefing on the film came as Israel cut off vital supplies to the Gaza Strip and pounded the territory with airstrikes. The film has provided a justification of sorts for Israel's fierce tactics. Spectacles of strength, chaos and smiles Since the ceasefire began, Hamas has turned each round of hostage releases into a spectacle with large crowds, flags and smiling, waving hostages on stages. For the militants, it’s a chance to show off their survival as a fighting force and ongoing control of Gaza after 15 months of heavy fighting. At least 47,000 people have been killed by Israel’s bombardment of the enclave, according to local health officials, and nearly all of Gaza’s population has been displaced. The destruction has quieted under the ceasefire, but people in Gaza have little to return to after the airstrikes reduced much of the territory to rubble. The images of hostages being led through the crowds Thursday raised the question of whether Hamas is really in control. Netanyahu condemned the 'shocking scenes' and called on international mediators to ensure the safety of hostages in future releases — a commitment he said he later received. Saturday's hostage release proceeded smoothly, providing strong evidence that Hamas remains firmly in charge, and images of the handovers told more of the story. Hamas let three Israeli hostages go while on camera with certificates reading, 'release order.' Ahead of the third release, seven masked men stood on a stage decorated with pictures of dead Hamas leaders and the sign 'Zionism will not win.' Across the border, Israeli TV stations have filmed the emotional reunions, in which family and friends watching their loved ones' releases on live television, shifting from tense quiet to excited cheers and, often, tears. 'There he is!' shouted the wife of Keith Siegel, watching a TV screen as he was released. The government follows up with photos and videos of the traumatized ex-captives reuniting with their families in person, smiles hugs and tears on Israeli TV for hours in a recurring loop. Those scenes are only the start of long and difficult roads toward recovery for the hostages and the families. But the exuberant moments serve a purpose in a country where one stated goal of the war is to bring the hostages home, and where Israelis are bitterly divided over the slow pace of their return. Many hostage families have accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war for his own political survival. In this conflict, the absence of images also tells a story. Yarden Bibas, 35, was one of the three hostages released with full choreography on Saturday. But there's been no word on the fate of his family. Their abduction, filmed by Hamas, has become a symbol of the brutality of the siege. In it, Shiri Bibas tearfully clutches her two red-haired sons — Ariel, then 3, and Kfir, 9 months — as Hamas fighters surround her. In November 2023, Hamas released a video of the boys' father, Yarden, weeping on camera as he is told his family is dead. Israel has not confirmed their condition. On Saturday, Israel aired footage of Yarden in Israel, appearing weary with his eyes closed, stepping into the arms of his waiting family. ___ Associated Press writer Josef Federman contributed from Jerusalem.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-the-gaza-war-is-paused-but-israel-and-hamas-keep-up-a-fierce-battle-of-optics-over-hostage-releases/	2025-02-02T16:31:56-08:00	
Israel's Netanyahu heads to US to discuss 'victory over Hamas' wi...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he will discuss 'victory over Hamas,' countering Iran and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries in his meeting with President Donald Trump. Tuesday's meeting at the White House will be Trump's first with a foreign leader since returning to office. It comes as U.S. and Arab mediators begin the daunting work of brokering the next phase of a ceasefire agreement to wind down the 15-month war in Gaza. Hamas, which has reasserted control over Gaza since the ceasefire began last month, has said it will not release hostages in the second phase without an end to the war and Israeli forces' full withdrawal. Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from far-right governing partners to resume the war after the first phase ends in early March. He has said Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages captured in the militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. It's unclear where Trump stands. He has been a staunch supporter of Israel, but has also pledged to end wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire agreement. The deal has led to the release of 18 hostages as well as hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to Al-Awda Hospital. Israel's military said it fired on the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu embraces Trump's call for ‘peace through strength’ Ahead of his departure, Netanyahu said he and Trump would discuss 'victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis in all its components,' referring to Iran's alliance of militant groups across the region, including Hamas. He said they could 'strengthen security, broaden the circle of peace and achieve a remarkable era of peace through strength.' The war began when thousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Over 100 were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, eight have been rescued alive and dozens of bodies have been recovered by Israeli forces. Israel's air and ground war has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities who do not say how many of the dead were fighters. The war has left large parts of several cities in ruins and displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million. Under the ceasefire's first phase, Hamas is to release 33 hostages, eight of whom Hamas says are dead, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most areas and allowed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to devastated northern Gaza while aid flows in. Negotiations on the second phase, which would end the war and see the remaining 60 or so hostages returned, are set to begin Monday with mediators the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. 'We started already engaging with the parties in order to define the agenda and to start engaging in those discussions,' Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani said Sunday, adding that 'we hope that we start to see some movement in the next few days.' Aspirations for a bigger deal Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, joined the yearlong ceasefire negotiations last month and helped push the agreement over the finish line. He met with Netanyahu in Israel last week and they were expected to formally begin talks on the second phase on Monday. Trump, who brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term, is believed to be seeking a wider agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia. But the kingdom has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. On Sunday, Jordan said its king had been invited to meet with Trump at the White House on Feb. 11. Jordan also supports Palestinian statehood and has rejected Trump's suggestion to relocate Palestinians from Gaza there and to Egypt. Netanyahu's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood, and a key partner, far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to leave the governing coalition if the war is not resumed next month. That would raise the likelihood of early elections in which Netanyahu could be voted out. Relatives of hostages and many other Israelis are impatient. 'The suffering that the families are going through as this drags on is inhuman,' the brother of newly released hostage Ofer Kalderon, Nissan Kalderon, said Sunday. Violence in the West Bank While the Gaza ceasefire has held for two weeks, Israel has increased operations in the occupied West Bank. On Sunday, the military said it was expanding an operation focused on the volatile city of Jenin to the town of Tamun and said it has killed over 50 'terrorists' so far. The Palestinian Health Ministry said a 73-year-old man was shot dead by Israeli troops in Jenin early Sunday. The military said a suspect was approaching soldiers as they operated in a combat zone and was 'stopped,' and the incident was under review. The ministry earlier reported five killed, including a 16-year-old, in Israeli airstrikes overnight. The military said it killed two militants — one of whom had been freed as part of the Gaza ceasefire in 2023 — in an airstrike on a village near Jenin. It said the two were planning an imminent attack, and that additional strikes targeted two other militant cells. Israeli forces on Sunday also carried out a wave of controlled demolitions that destroyed at least a dozen buildings in Jenin, taking down several multi-story residential structures. The military said it destroyed buildings used by militants. The U.N. humanitarian agency last week said Israeli forces have severely damaged or demolished 120 houses in their ongoing raid, and Palestinian security forces have wrecked another 50.

Takeaways from the AP interview with Ukraine’s Zelenskyy	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The Associated Press interviewed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday at a crucial juncture of the nearly three-year war against Russia’s full-scale invasion. U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to end the war within six months of his inauguration, but both sides are far apart, and it is unclear how a ceasefire deal could take shape. Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops continue to lose territory in eastern Ukraine, and the country faces near-daily Russian attacks targeting homes and infrastructure. That raises fears that Russian President Vladimir Putin prefers to wait out the war because he believes he will triumph. Here are some takeaways from AP’s interview with Zelenskyy: He says talks between Moscow and Washington must not exclude Ukraine Zelenskyy said talks between the U.S. and Russia about the war in his country that exclude Ukraine would be 'dangerous,' and he seeks more communication between the Trump administration and Kyiv. His remarks followed comments Friday by Trump, who said American and Russian officials were 'already talking' about ending the war. Trump said his administration has had 'very serious' discussions with Russia, but he did not elaborate. Zelenskyy said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a 'general level,' and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements. A planned visit by Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellog was postponed. Zelenskyy said it will be rescheduled. He also said he and Trump discussed meeting to develop a plan for a ceasefire. Zelenskyy hoped that would led to conversations with Russian officials. He says Trump can force Russia to make concessions A key question underlying any ceasefire proposal will be Russia’s willingness to engage in talks, especially now that its forces appear to have the upper hand on the battlefield. Zelenskyy said Putin interprets negotiating directly with Kyiv as losing. He said Trump could bring Putin to the table through the threat of sanctions targeting Russia’s energy and banking system, as well as continued support of the Ukrainian military. NATO is the 'cheapest' security guarantee option Zelenskyy said NATO membership is the 'cheapest' option for Ukraine's allies, and it would strengthen Trump geopolitically. Other scenarios that involve arming and training Ukraine’s 800,000-strong army would be expensive for U.S. and European allies to maintain over time, Zelenskyy said. He also said Ukraine’s armed forces would be a bonus for the alliance, especially if Trump seeks to bring back home overseas U.S. troops. Approving Ukraine’s NATO bid would be 'a great victory' for Trump, Zelenskyy added, in an apparent appeal to the president’s penchant for winners and business deals. Skepticism about putting European troops in Ukraine Zelenskyy said a French proposal to put European forces in Ukraine as a deterrent force is taking shape, but he expressed skepticism, saying many questions remained about the command-and-control structure and the number of troops and their positions. Zelenskyy said he told both French President Emmanuel Marcon and Trump that the option of putting European troops in Ukraine was welcome, but it would not be a sufficient security guarantee alone. He added: 'Imagine, there is a contingent. The question is who is in charge? Who is the main one? What will they do if there are Russian strikes? Missiles, disembarkation, attack from the sea, crossing of the land borderline, offensive. What will they do? What are their mandates?'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-takeaways-from-the-ap-interview-with-ukraines-zelenskyy/	2025-02-01T14:10:33-08:00	
Middle East latest: Hamas frees 3 hostages, Israel releases Pales...	Hamas freed three hostages in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday and Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners in the fourth round of exchanges during the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The six-week phase one truce calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 prisoners, as well as the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory. Israel and Hamas are set next week to begin negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached. Palestinian health authorities in Gaza also announced that the long-shuttered Rafah border crossing with Egypt would reopen on Saturday for thousands of Palestinians who desperately need medical care — a breakthrough that signals the ceasefire agreement continues to gain traction. —— Here's the latest: Family of Bibas rejoice at his freedom TEL AVIV, Israel — The family of Yarden Bibas says 'there are no words to describe the relief of holding Yarden in our hands, embracing him, and hearing his voice,' after his release from Hamas' captivity on Saturday. Bibas, 35, was taken hostage from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oc. 7, 2023. His wife, Shiri, and their two young boys, Ariel and Kfir, were also taken that day and are still captive in Gaza. It is unknown if they are still alive. 'Yarden has returned home, but the home remains incomplete,' the family wrote. 'Yarden is a father who left his safe room to protect his family, bravely survived captivity, and returned to an unbearable reality.' The family said it 'continues with hope' and made a plea to the public to keep pressing for the release of all remaining hostages. Argentinian officials celebrate the release of an Israeli-Argentine hostage JERUSALEM — Argentinian officials are celebrating the release of Israeli-Argentine Yarden Bibas from Hamas captivity after almost 16 months of the war in Gaza. President Javier Milei of Argentina, a staunch supporter of Israel, posted a stream of emotional videos all morning Saturday on X showing Bibas greeting his relatives after his release with long and tearful hugs. The Israeli Embassy in Argentina says that Bibas obtained Argentine citizenship through his wife, Shiri, and their two small children, Ariel and Kfir, are also Argentinian. The condition of Shiri and their two sons, the youngest hostages to be abducted during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, remains unclear. Hamas claimed last year that they had been killed by an Israeli airstrike, but Israeli officials never confirmed that. Axel Wahnish, a Sephardic rabbi and the Argentine ambassador to Israel, said that Argentine authorities were following Bibas’ release in the exchange closely. He expressed hope that 'all the kidnapped people can return safely to their homes.' Wahnish also praised Milei for his strong condemnations of Hamas, which he said stood in contrast to the 'silence of some leaders of the free world.' Released Palestinians describe harsh prison conditions in Israel RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinians who were sentenced to years in prison over deadly attacks against Israelis and released into the occupied West Bank described harsh conditions, beatings and other abuse in prison. Many appeared frail as they reveled in their homecoming on Saturday. Mohammad Kaskus, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison over his militancy during the second Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s, told The Associated Press that he faced beatings and intimidation during interrogations. He said that the food provisions in prison were insufficient, with meager snacks instead of full meals often leaving him hungry. The Israeli Prison Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Another released prisoner, Murad Hmeidan, who was serving a life sentence plus 25 years in a case also related to his involvement in attacks against Israelis, said 'the treatment was extremely bad.' He said that seeing the deaths of fellow prisoners in detention from wounds or illnesses over the years made him feel that 'there is a serious risk to the lives of everyone in Israeli prisons.' The Palestinian Prisoners' Society, an advocacy group, has recorded the deaths 54 Palestinians inside Israeli prison since Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Israel has previously said that military prosecutors are investigating Palestinian deaths in custody and did not offer further comment on Saturday. Arab nations reject Trump’s suggestion to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan CAIRO — Powerful Arab nations have rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan. Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League released a joint statement on Saturday following a meeting of foreign ministers. They said they reject any plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Yarden Bibas seen arriving in Israeli hospital after release from Gaza TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli army released footage of Yarden Bibas arriving at a hospital in central Israel and meeting his mother for the first time after his release earlier Saturday from 15 months of captivity in Gaza. The two are seen locked in a silent embrace. Bibas, 35, returned to Israel without his wife, Shiri Bibas, or his two young sons, Kfir and Ariel, who remain in captivity. Hamas claims the three were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel has not confirmed their deaths but says it is gravely concerned for their welfare. Ariel was 4 years old and Kfir was 9 months old when they were taken with their mother during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza. In a post on X, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed Bibas along with Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegal, who were also freed on Saturday. He added, 'Our thoughts are now with Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas and all our hostages. We will continue to work to bring them home.' Freed hostage Keith Siegel arrives in hospital in Israel JERUSALEM — Newly released hostage Keith Siegel looked frail and appeared to be walking slowly in footage released by the Israeli military shortly after his release from captivity in Gaza. Still, in Associated Press footage the 65-year-old Israeli-American refused a wheelchair upon landing at the hospital where doctors will check his medical condition. Wrapped in an Israeli flag, we waved to people in nearby balconies waving back at him. Siegel was injured in the Hamas attack October 7, 2023, his ribs broken and hand bleeding when he was dragged into Gaza, according to his wife Aviva Siegel, who was taken hostage with him but released in November 2023. Watching the first moments of her husband’s release on television in a southern border community near Gaza as she waited to reunite with him, Aviva Siegel said, 'There he is, Keith, there he is, wow!' 'They’ve put a hat on him!' she exclaimed. Released hostage thanks the Israeli people for their support JERUSALEM - Israel’s military published a photo of recently freed hostage Yarden Bibas in a military helicopter shortly after his release Saturday, holding a sign thanking Israelis for their support. 'I thank all the people of Israel for the support and help. I’ve heard from my family that you fought for me,' read the message Bibas held up to the camera. Bibas, 35, returns to Israel without his wife, Shiri Bibas, or his two boys, Kfir and Ariel, who remain in captivity. The family’s plight — and the two boys with their shocks of ginger hair — have captivated Israelis, and Yarden’s release dims hopes that the three others are alive. Family of Keith Siegal says they can ‘breathe again’ as he returns to Israel JERUSALEM — The family of Keith Siegel said they could breathe again as he returned to Israel after being released by Hamas. Siegel, an American Israeli from North Carolina, was captured from the communal farming village by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023. 'Finally, after 484 long, terrifying days and nights, full of immense worry for our father, we can breathe again,' his family wrote in a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters. Siegel’s family also thanked U.S. President Donald Trump, the American and Israeli governments, and the Israeli military for securing his return. Israel says all 183 Palestinian prisoners set for release are now free RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Israeli Prison Authority says that all 183 Palestinian prisoners slated for release on Saturday have been freed. Most of them, including 111 arrested after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, were released to Gaza. Just over two dozen returned to cheering crowds in the occupied West Bank. Another seven serving life sentences were transferred to Egypt ahead of their deportation. That concludes the fourth prisoner-for-hostage swap in the six-week initial phase of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Sick and wounded children leave Gaza for treatment as border crossing reopens RAFAH CROSSING, Egypt — A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing to Egypt for treatment through Gaza’s Rafah crossing on Saturday, in the first opening of the border since Israel captured it nearly nine months ago. The reopening of the Rafah crossing represents a significant breakthrough that bolsters the ceasefire deal Israel and Hamas agreed to earlier this month. Israel agreed to reopen the crossing after Hamas released the last living female hostages in Gaza. Egyptian television showed an Palestinian Red Cross ambulance pulling up to the crossing gate, and several children were brought out on stretchers and transferred to ambulances on the Egyptian side. Prisoners released by Israel include aid worker jailed in controversial case RAMALLAH, West Bank — One of the most prominent Palestinians being released on Saturday is aid worker Mohammed el-Halabi, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison in a high-profile case that drew criticism from rights groups. El-Halabi had worked as the Palestinian manager of the Gaza branch of World Vision, a major Christian aid organization. He was was arrested in 2016 and accused of diverting tens of millions of dollars to Hamas. Both el-Halabi, 47, and World Vision vigorously denied the allegations and independent investigations found no proof of wrongdoing. Rights groups say el-Halabi was denied a fair and transparent trial, as he and World Vision had no chance to review the evidence against them. His prolonged detention sent a chill through nongovernmental groups providing aid to Palestinians in Gaza. Israel begins freeing Palestinian prisoners OFER MILITARY PRISON, West Bank — Israel has begun freeing 183 Palestinian prisoners due for release after Hamas freed three hostages as part of the ceasefire deal that has halted 15 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip. A bus departed Ofer Military Prison with some 32 prisoners headed for the West Bank. About 150 other prisoners were being sent to Gaza or deported. According to Palestinian authorities, a total of 183 Palestinian prisoners are to be released, including dozens serving lengthy or life sentences and 111 people from the Gaza Strip who were arrested after Oct. 7, 2023, and held without trial. Palestinian Authority says Israel will begin releasing Palestinians held without trial after Oct. 7 attack RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Palestinian Authority’s commission of prisoners’ affairs says that a total of 183 Palestinian prisoners are slated for release Saturday in exchange for the three Israeli hostages held in Gaza. In a sign that the ceasefire agreement is progressing, this release departs from the previous formula of 30 Palestinian prisoners for each Israeli hostage to include more Palestinian detainees who were rounded up in Gaza after the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that began the war. As part of the ceasefire deal, Israel has agreed to release about 1,000 Palestinians from Gaza who were detained on suspicion of militancy and have been held without trial since the day after the Oct. 7 attack. The Palestinian Authority said that on Saturday, Israel will release 111 of these Palestinians from Gaza on the condition that they did not participate in the Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7, 2023, the first of what will be several such releases staggered over the six weeks of the Phase 1 ceasefire deal. The other 72 Palestinians set to be released Saturday were serving long or life sentences on national security charges connected to their involvement in deadly attacks against Israelis. Of that group, 32 hail from the occupied West Bank, where families and friends on Saturday were anxiously awaiting their return, and another 39 come from Gaza. Seven of the prisoners serving life sentences will be transferred to Egypt before further deportation under the terms of the ceasefire agreement. Freed hostage reunites with father and sister TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military published footage of released hostage Yarden Bibas reuniting with his father and sister at a military base outside of Gaza, where he is undergoing initial medical checks immediately after entering Israel. He closed his eyes as his father, Eli, and sister Ofri hugged him fiercely. 'Sweetheart,' his father said, as the family embraced and cried. Bibas, 35, is the father of the two youngest hostages in Gaza, whose plight has become a rallying cry for Israelis. The Bibas sons — 4 years old and 9 months old at the time of their abduction — and their mother, Shiri, are still in captivity, and feared dead. Shiri Bibas and the two children are the last woman and children held in captivity in Gaza who have not been confirmed dead by Israel. In November 2023, Yarden Bibas was filmed by Hamas as he was told that Shiri Bibas and the children were kidnapped and killed in an Israeli airstrike. In the video, filmed under duress, Yarden is sobbing and pleading with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring their bodies to Israel for burial. Israel dismissed the video as 'psychological terror' and said there was no concrete information about the status of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas, but there have been no signs of life from the three in the past year. Siegel returns to Israel Israel confirmed that American Israeli hostage Keith Siegel had crossed the border from Gaza after being handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross at a ceremony in Gaza City. The Israeli military said in a statement that he was headed to a reception point at a military base, where he would be met by family members before heading to a hospital. Family of French Israeli hostage celebrates his return PARIS — The family of Ofer Kalderon said they were 'overwhelmed with joy, relief and emotion' after his release by Hamas. Kalderon, a 54-year-old French-Israeli citizen, was one of three male hostages released Saturday as part of a ceasefire deal that halted fighting in Gaza after more than 15 months of war. Kalderon was kidnapped by Hamas from the Nir Oz kibbutz on Oct. 7, along with his daughter Sahar and son Erez. The children were released in November 2023 during a temporary ceasefire. 'Today, we finally embrace Ofer, seeing and truly comprehending that he is here with us,' his family said in a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters. 'We have witnessed how, through extraordinary mental strength, he survived this hell. Ofer endured months in a nightmare, and we are proud of his ability to survive and hold onto the hope of embracing his children again.' The family added a note of support for the remaining hostages still being held by Hamas. 'In the midst of this emotional moment, we must remember all the hostages who remain behind. We have no right to stop until all 79 hostages return home — whether for rehabilitation or for burial,' the family said. Kibbutz members cheer as their neighbor is released There were sighs of relief and cheers in the living room where members of Kibbutz Kfar Aza watched Hamas militants hand over hostage Keith Siegel to the Red Cross. Siegel, an American Israeli from North Carolina, was captured from the communal farming village by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023. His neighbors gathered anxiously in front of the television as they watched footage of Siegel, looking thin, emerging from a vehicle and walking through a crowd in Gaza city, flanked by Hamas militants. Many of those in the room were family friends. They applauded upon seeing Siegel’s face. Some teared up. Siegel is one of the highest-profile hostages, now a household name in Israel after his wife Aviva Siegel, also captured in the Hamas attack, mounted a public campaign to bring him home after her own release from captivity in November 2023. Hamas hands over U.S.-Israeli hostage Hamas has handed American Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, 65, over to the Red Cross, the third hostage to be released Saturday as part of a ceasefire deal with Israel. Siegel walked onto a stage set up by the sea in Gaza City before militants handed him over to waiting Red Cross officials. Earlier, the militants released Yarden Bibas, 35, and French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54, to the Red Cross in similar scenes in the town of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. All three had been abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war. Macron hails release of French citizen French President Emmanuel Macron has hailed the release of French-Israeli citizen Ofer Kalderon, while noting that another French citizen remains a hostage. 'Ofer Kalderon is free! We share the immense relief and joy of his family after 483 days of unimaginable hell,' Macron posted on X. Our thoughts are with Ohad Yahalomi, still in the hands of Hamas, and his family. France is doing everything in its power to secure his immediate release.' Red Cross vehicles arrive in Gaza City for planned hostage release Red Cross vehicles have arrived in Gaza City where Hamas is set to release American Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, 65, as part of the fourth round of hostage releases in its ceasefire deal with Israel. Two other hostages — Yarden Bibas, 35, and French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54 — were released earlier Saturday in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. In return for the three, Israel is to release dozens of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-2-freed-hostages-are-back-in-israel/	2025-02-01T07:16:10-08:00	
Russian drone and missile attacks kill 8 in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — At least eight people died overnight as Russian drone and missile strikes pounded Ukraine’s towns and cities, local officials said Saturday. Meanwhile, Moscow’s troops continued their grinding advance through the country’s east. A Russian missile strike on an apartment block in the Ukrainian city of Poltava killed at least seven people and injured 14 more, including three children, Ukraine's Interior Ministry said. Some 22 people were rescued from the five-story building, which partially collapsed following the attack, said the Poltava region’s acting governor, Volodymyr Kohut. He also announced that the region would observe three days of mourning for the victims of the attack. Rescue teams remain at the site. Elsewhere, a 60-year-old woman was killed by falling debris from a downed drone in the Kharkiv region, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov wrote on social media. The bombardment comes as Russian forces continue their monthslong campaign to capture the key Donetsk strongholds of Pokrovsk and nearby Chasiv Yar, fighting their way across farm fields and woodland and engulfing small rural settlements. Russia's Ministry of Defense said Saturday that its troops had taken control of Krymske, a suburb to the north of the contested frontline town of Toretsk in Ukraine's Donetsk region. Russian troops have been fighting for the settlement in a grinding assault throughout the winter of 2024. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said last week that it expected the Russians to take full control of Toretsk 'within days.' 'Last night, Russia launched an attack on our cities using various types of weapons: missiles, attack drones, and aerial bombs,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on social media Saturday. 'Every such act of terror proves that we need greater support in defending against Russian terror. Every air defense system, every interceptor missile, means a life saved.' Ukraine's southern metropolis of Odesa also came under attack late Friday, with Russian missiles falling on the city's historic center, designated a world heritage site by the U.N. cultural organization UNESCO. Seven people were injured in the attack, which also saw debris fall close to the city's ornate 19th-century opera house. Norwegian diplomatic representatives were also in the area during the strike, said local Gov. Oleh Kiper. The full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine, which began nearly three years ago and shows no signs of ending, has killed more than 10,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the United Nations. Many have been evacuated from areas along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line where Ukrainian defenses are straining to hold the bigger Russian army at bay. Civilians have endured hardship caused by Russian attacks on the power grid that have denied them heating and running water. Saturday’s missile attack prompted emergency power grid shutdowns in seven Ukrainian regions, including Poltava, state energy company Ukrenergo said. Ukrainian strikes also hit Russia, with air defenses intercepting nine drones across the country’s Bryansk, Belgorod and Saratov regions, Russia’s Defense Ministry said in a statement Saturday morning. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russian-drone-and-missile-attacks-kill-4-in-ukraine/	2025-02-01T06:37:27-08:00	
Trump says he and Putin could do something 'significant' toward e...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday said his administration has already had 'very serious' discussions with Russia about its war in Ukraine and that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon take 'significant' action toward ending the grinding conflict. 'We will be speaking, and I think will perhaps do something that’ll be significant,' Trump said in an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office. 'We want to end that war. That war would have not started if I was president.' Trump did not say who from his administration has been in contact with the Russians but insisted the two sides were 'already talking.' Asked if he has already spoken directly with Putin, Trump was coy: 'I don't want to say that.' Trump has said repeatedly he wouldn’t have allowed the conflict to start if he had been in office, even though he was president as fighting grew in eastern Ukraine between Kyiv’s forces and separatists backed by Moscow, ahead of Putin sending in tens of thousands of troops in 2022. Trump since returning to office has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying he should have made a deal with Putin to avoid the conflict. The president in a Fox News interview earlier in January ridiculed Zelenskyy as 'talking so brave,' when Ukraine was so dependent on U.S. aid to fight its war. 'They were brave, but we gave them billions of dollars,' Trump said. In a recent interview with Russian state television, Putin praised Trump as a 'clever and pragmatic man' who is focused on U.S. interests. 'We always had a business-like, pragmatic but also trusting relationship with the current U.S. president,' Putin said. 'I couldn’t disagree with him that if he had been president, if they hadn’t stolen victory from him in 2020, the crisis that emerged in Ukraine in 2022 could have been avoided.' The Russian's president's statement was also a blunt endorsement of Trump’s refusal to accept his defeat in the 2020 election. Numerous federal and local officials, a long list of courts, top former campaign staffers and even his own attorney general have all said there is no evidence of the fraud he alleges. Trump in his 2024 campaign vowed to bring a quick end to the war, and repeatedly criticized President Joe Biden's administration for spending billions in U.S. taxpayer money on military and economic aide for Kyiv to help it fight back against Russia. Trump’s relationship with Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. Trump publicly sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence officials on whether Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to help him, and Trump has praised the Russian leader and even called him 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-trump-says-he-and-putin-could-do-something-significant-toward-ending-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-31T14:49:18-08:00	
Middle East latest: Militants in Gaza release 8 Thai and Israeli ...	Militants in the Gaza Strip released eight hostages on Thursday, handing them over to the Red Cross amid chaotic crowds as part of a swap that is set to see 110 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons later in the day. Agam Berger, a 20-year-old soldier, was handed over first at a site in the heavily destroyed urban refugee camp of Jabaliya in northern Gaza, followed hours later by two more Israelis and five Thai farm workers who were handed over amid a chaotic crowd in the city of Khan Younis. It's the third such exchange since a ceasefire took hold in the Gaza Strip earlier this month. The tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is aimed at ending the war in Gaza and securing the release of dozens of hostages held by the militant group, as well as hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned or detained by Israel. Under the ceasefire, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have jubilantly returned to northern Gaza over the past three days. However, their homecoming has been bittersweet as nearly everyone has friends or relatives who died, and many northern neighborhoods have been transformed into an apocalyptic landscape of devastation by more than 15 months of war. ___ Here's the latest: Israeli president thanks Thai government for support JERUSALEM — Israel’s president thanked the Thai government for its support as he met with the Thai ambassador Thursday, ahead of the release of five Thai hostages from captivity in Gaza. The Thai government confirmed Thursday that five Thai hostages were released from Gaza. The hostages, who were pulled from the farming communities in southern Israel where they worked as agricultural laborers on Oct. 7, 2023, were among 31 Thais taken by Hamas. President Isaac Herzog said in a statement posted to X that he told Pannabha Chandraramya, the ambassador of Thailand to Israel, that 'the people of Israel are very moved by the release of our Thai brothers from the hell of captivity.' He thanked the Thai government for its support and vowed to continue trying to secure the release of Thai hostages who remain in Gaza. Twenty-three others were already released. Another two have been confirmed dead, and the status of one remaining person is not clear. Netanyahu puts Palestinian prisoners’ release on hold Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has put the release of Palestinian prisoners on hold until the 'safe release' of hostages is assured after a chaotic handover in Gaza. Netanyahu demanded that mediators intervene after some hostages released Thursday were led through a rowdy crowd of thousands by masked militants. Israel was supposed to release 110 Palestinian prisoners later Thursday, including around 30 serving life sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis. Agam Berger reunites with family at military base TEL AVIV, Israel — 'We’re here and we’re never leaving you,' Agam Berger’s mother, Merav, told her daughter in the moments of their initial reunion on Israeli soil after Agam’s release on Thursday from Hamas captivity. Berger, 20, was among five young female soldiers abducted when militants overran the Nahal Oz military base in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killing over 60 soldiers there. The other four were released Saturday. The family was reunited at a specially prepared reception area in a military base near the Gaza border. A pale looking Berger wiped away tears as she sat on her mother’s lap and held her father’s hand, as seen in footage released by the Israeli army. From the military base, Berger was flown to a hospital in central Israel, where she will meet her fellow released soldiers. Netanyahu condemns chaos during the release of hostages TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the chaotic scenes at the site of a second hostage release in Gaza on Thursday. Seven hostages were handed over to the Red Cross in Khan Younis and were then transferred to Israeli forces, the Israeli military said. Their release was delayed after armed militants struggled to contain the large Palestinian crowds that gathered around the Red Cross cars. The hostages were eventually led through the crowd surrounded by a ring of gunmen. 'I view with utmost severity the shocking scenes during the release of our hostages,' Netanyahu said in a statement released by his office shortly after the handover was completed. He said he 'demands that the mediators make certain that such terrible scenes do not recur and guarantee the safety of our hostages.' Israeli Red Cross says it has received 7 more hostages JERUSALEM — The Israeli army said the Red Cross has reported receiving seven more hostages, including two Israelis and five Thais, hours after an Israeli soldier was handed over at another location. Israel protests chaotic scenes surrounded hostage release JERUSALEM — Israeli officials have filed an angry complaint to international mediators over chaotic scenes surrounding the release of hostages. An Israeli official confirmed the protest, speaking on condition of anonymity because the release was still taking place. Militants lead second hostage through crowd ahead of release Militants led Israeli hostage Arbel Yehoud through a chaotic crowd in Gaza ahead of her release, hours after Hamas handed a captive Israeli soldier over to the Red Cross in the Gaza Strip. Yehoud was at the center of the dispute about the sequence of releases that briefly rocked the ceasefire over the weekend. Israel says she was supposed to have been freed Saturday and delayed the opening of crossings to northern Gaza when she was not. Israelis watch anxiously as friend nears departure from Gaza CARMEI GAT, Israel — A group of friends of Arbel Yehoud, a hostage set to be released Thursday, watched in tears and worried silence as the Israeli hostage appeared to be freed, surrounded by a large crowd of Palestinians. The friends sat in anxious silence at a private home in southern Israel as they watched a TV showing the large crowd of Palestinians gathered at the release point in Gaza. Some cried, others had their hands over their eyes or mouths. When a news anchor said the situation appeared dangerous, one yelled at her to 'shut up.' People began crying when Yehoud was seen walking through the crowd, escorted by gunmen, followed by reports that she had been turned over to the Red Cross. Most of the 20 or so people were survivors of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, including three former hostages released in a November 2023 ceasefire. The Associated Press was granted access to the event. Thai ambassador says she's ‘holding her breath’ BEER YAAKOV, Israel — Thailand’s ambassador to Israel said she was 'holding her breath' along with the entire country of Israel for the release of five Thai agricultural workers who were kidnapped on Oct. 7. 'We have nothing to do with this conflict, they just happened to be there, and they are working tirelessly on the farms and kibbutzes,' said Ambassador Pannabha Chandraramya as she watched footage from Gaza at the Israeli hospital where the Thai workers will be brought upon their return to Israel. She added that despite the war, Thai agricultural workers are continuing to come to Israel. Prior to the attack, less than 30,000 Thai workers were in Israel, mostly in the agricultural sector, and that number has grown to 38,000 today. Chandraramya said the Thai government had notified the families of all six surviving Thai hostages, because they are not sure which five will be released. The bodies of another two Thai hostages who were killed on Oct. 7, 2023 are also being held in Gaza. The Shamir Medical Center, outside of Tel Aviv, has a number of Thai-speaking social workers and psychologists to assist the hostages being released. Emir of Qatar meets with Syria's new interim leader DAMASCUS — The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, visited Syria on Thursday and met with newly installed interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa. He was the first head of state to visit Syria since the fall of former President Bashar Assad in a lighting rebel offensive last month. Qatari Minister of State Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al Khulaifi told journalists that the wealthy Gulf country 'will continue to provide the required support at all economic and service levels, as well as in terms of infrastructure and electricity' to Syria. Qatar had cut off relations with Damascus and backed rebel groups seeking to overthrow Assad in Syria’s nearly 14-year civil war. On Wednesday, the Syrian factions that toppled Assad named al-Sharaa, an Islamist former rebel leader who headed the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham militant group, as the country‘s interim president. Qatar was among the first countries to welcome al-Sharaa’s appointment. Israel says it intercepted Hezbollah surveillance drone JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it has intercepted a surveillance drone launched toward Israeli airspace by the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah reached a ceasefire in late November that ended some 14 months of fighting. Under the deal, both sides were to withdraw forces from southern Lebanon within 60 days. The deadline passed this week with Israeli troops still in Lebanon. But the U.S. said the sides had agreed to extend the ceasefire through Feb. 18 while Israel continues its withdrawal. Israel and Hezbollah have repeatedly accused each other of violating the deal. Red Cross arrives at site of second hostage handover KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Red Cross vehicles arrived at a location in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis where hostages are set to be released. The second handover site is in front of the destroyed home of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Hundreds of militants from Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group arrived earlier with a convoy in a show of force, and thousands of people gathered to watch, some from the tilted rooftops of bombed-out buildings. Israeli soldier Agam Berger released in Gaza Strip DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Hamas handed captive Israeli soldier Agam Berger over to the Red Cross at a ceremony in the heavily destroyed urban refugee camp of Jabaliya in northern Gaza. Berger, 20, was abducted alongside four other female soldiers, who were freed on Saturday. At a gathering in Tel Aviv, people cheered, clapped and whistled as they saw images of Berger being released on a TV screen, next to a large clock that’s counted the days the hostages have been in captivity. Some held signs saying 'Agam we’re waiting for you at home.' A short time later, Israel confirmed that Berger was with its military. Red Cross arrives at site of hostage release DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Red Cross vehicles arrived at the northern refugee camp of Jabaliya, where hundreds of masked militants and onlookers had gathered ahead of a planned release of hostages held in Gaza. Hamas set up two locations for the release, one in Jabaliya and the other in the southern city of Khan Younis in front of the destroyed home of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Video shows hostages set to be released JERUSALEM — The Islamic Jihad militant group has released a brief video of two hostages set to be released Thursday as part of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The video, without sound, shows Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Gadi Moses, 80, smiling and embracing one another. They were among scores of people abducted in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war. Islamic Jihad is a smaller and more extreme militant group allied with Hamas. It took part in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack. Mother of Thai hostage hears he's about to be freed BANGKOK — Khammee Lamnao, the mother of Thai hostage Surasak Lamnau, said the Thai embassy in Israel had called her Wednesday to let her know her son was one of the five who were to be released. 'I cannot wait to see my son,' the 53-year-old said. 'I’ve been waiting for him.' Surasak had been working in the agricultural sector in Israel for 15 months when he was taken hostage during the October 2023 attack. Thirty-one Thai nationals are believed to have been taken hostage when Hamas attacked Israel in October, 2023. Of those, 23 have been released, and two of the remaining hostages have been confirmed dead. Five surviving hostages are due to be released, and it is not clear at the moment what the status of the sixth person is. There were about 30,000 Thai workers — mostly laborers in the agricultural sector — in Israel prior to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, when militants stormed through a border fence and killed hundreds of Israelis and foreign nationals, including 41 Thai workers. At least 7,000 Thai workers are known to have returned home on government evacuation flights, but many others decided to stay for the opportunity to earn wages far higher than at home. Who's set to be released today? DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — The Israelis set to be released are Agam Berger, 20, a female soldier; Arbel Yehoud, a 29-year-old civilian woman; and Gadi Moses, an 80-year-old man. The names of the Thai hostages who were set to be freed were not released. Yehoud was at the center of the dispute about the sequence of releases that briefly rocked the ceasefire over the weekend. Israel says she was supposed to have been freed Saturday and delayed the opening of crossings to northern Gaza when she was not. Berger was abducted alongside four other female soldiers, who were freed on Saturday. Of the 110 people set to be released from prisons in Israel, 30 are serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis. Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent former militant leader and theater director who took part in a dramatic jailbreak in 2021 before being rearrested days later, is also among those set to be released. Ceasefire holds for now but next phase will be harder DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Today's exchange is part of a deal that paused fighting in Gaza on Jan. 19. Israeli forces have pulled back from most of Gaza, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remains of their homes and humanitarian groups to surge assistance. It calls for Hamas to release a total of 33 hostages, including women, children, older adults and sick or wounded men, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the hostages to be released in this phase are dead. The initial Phase One ceasefire paused fighting for six weeks, calling for the sides to use that time to negotiate a second phase in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages and the ceasefire would continue indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached. Negotiating a phase two deal could be difficult. Hamas says it won’t release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, after reasserting its rule over Gaza within hours of the truce. Meanwhile, Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, and a key far-right partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition is already calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase. ___ Corrects that 41, not 38, Thai workers were killed during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack and its aftermath.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-hostages-and-prisoners-set-to-be-released-as-ceasefire-holds/	2025-01-30T05:43:00-08:00	
Hamas frees 8 more hostages but Israel puts prisoner release on h...	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas-led militants freed eight hostages on Thursday as part of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, but the chaotic handover of some of the captives, who were shuttled through a rowdy crowd of thousands by masked militants, drew an angry protest from Israel. Israel was supposed to release 110 Palestinian prisoners later in the day, including around 30 serving life sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that was put on hold until the 'safe release' of hostages can be assured and called on mediators to intervene. Hamas released seven of the hostages in front of the destroyed home of its slain leader, Yahya Sinwar, as thousands pressed in. Hamas called it a 'message of determination,' but it triggered the latest in a series of disputes that have sent U.S. and Arab mediators scrambling to patch up the truce. The ceasefire is aimed at eventually ending the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas, and securing the release of dozens of hostages abducted in the militant group's Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. A show of force as hostages are released The first hostage — female soldier Agam Berger, 20 — was released after Hamas paraded her in front of a smaller crowd in the heavily destroyed urban Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza. Hours later, a chaotic scene unfolded at a handover of the other seven in the southern city of Khan Younis. Hundreds of militants from Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group arrived with a convoy, and thousands of people gathered to watch, some from the tilted rooftops of bombed-out buildings. Footage showed hostage Arbel Yehoud, 29, looking stunned as masked militants hustled her through the shouting crowd, pushing people back. Also released were Gadi Moses, an 80-year-old Israeli man, and five Thai laborers, identified by Israel as Watchara Sriaoun, 33; Pongsak Tanna, 36; Sathian Suwankam, 35; Bannawat Seathao, 27; and Surasak Lamnau, 32. A number of foreign workers were taken along with dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers during Hamas’ attack. Twenty-three Thais were among more than 100 hostages released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israel says three Thais remain in captivity, two of whom are believed to be dead. Yehoud had been at the center of a dispute earlier this week over the sequence in which the hostages would be released. The United States, Egypt and Qatar, which brokered the ceasefire after a year of tough negotiations, resolved it with an agreement that Yehoud would be released with the others on Thursday. About 20 friends of Yehoud gathered in southern Israel watched as the tense scene unfolded on live television. Some cried. Others had their hands over their eyes or mouths. The crowd then burst into tears after she was turned over to the Red Cross. Netanyahu condemned the 'shocking scenes' and called on international mediators to ensure the safety of hostages in future releases. Ceasefire holds for now but next phase will be harder In the first phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is set to release a total of 33 Israeli hostages, including women, children, older adults and sick or wounded men, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the hostages to be released in this phase are dead. Among those set to be released from prisons is Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent former militant leader and theater director who took part in a dramatic jailbreak in 2021 before being rearrested days later. Palestinians have cheered the release of the prisoners, who they widely see as heroes who have sacrificed for the cause of ending Israel’s decades-long occupation of lands they want for a future state. Israeli forces have meanwhile pulled back from most of Gaza, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remains of their homes and humanitarian groups to surge assistance. The deal calls for Israel and Hamas to negotiate a second phase in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages and the ceasefire would continue indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached. Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the truce. A key far-right partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition is already calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase. Hamas says it won't release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Tens of thousands killed Hamas started the war when it sent thousands of fighters storming into Israel. The militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Israel’s ensuing air and ground war was among the deadliest and most destructive in decades. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants. The Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence, and that it went to great lengths to try to spare civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in dense residential neighborhoods and put military infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques. The Israeli offensive has transformed entire neighborhoods into mounds of gray rubble, and it’s unclear how or when anything will be rebuilt. Around 90% of Gaza’s population has been displaced, often multiple times, with hundreds of thousands of people living in squalid tent camps or shuttered schools. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

A Russian drone strikes an apartment building in Ukraine, killing...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian drone blasted a hole in an apartment building in northeastern Ukraine during a nighttime attack, killing at least four people and injuring nine others, officials said Thursday. The Shahed drone blew out a wall and surrounding windows in the apartment block in Sumy, a major city, just after 1 a.m., the Sumy regional administration said. Four people were rescued from the rubble, and a child was among the injured, it said, adding that 120 people were evacuated. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it 'a terrible tragedy, a terrible Russian crime.' The war between Russia and Ukraine, which enters its fourth year next month and shows no signs of ending, has killed more than 10,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the United Nations. Civilians have also endured hardship caused by Russian attacks on the power grid that have denied them heating and running water. Many have been evacuated from areas along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line where Ukrainian defenses are straining to hold the bigger Russian army at bay. The fighting has been especially fierce in recent times in the eastern Donetsk region, which Russian forces partly occupy and appear bent on capturing completely in coming months. A Russian artillery strike on the Donetsk city of Kramatorsk injured eight people, including two young children, Donetsk regional head Vadym Filashkin wrote on his Telegram channel Thursday. 'Anyone who still remains in the Donetsk region is putting themselves in mortal danger,' Filashkin said. 'Take care of yourself! Evacuate.' Russia launched more than 80 drones at Ukraine overnight, the air force reported, in what are common nighttime barrages. Most of the drones were shot down or stopped by electronic jamming, it said. In Ukraine’s southern Odesa region, Russian drones damaged a hospital and two apartment buildings, regional head Oleh Kiper wrote on Telegram. No one was injured, he said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-a-russian-drone-strikes-an-apartment-building-in-ukraine-killing-at-least-4/	2025-01-30T04:12:52-08:00	
How did so many Thai farmers end up held hostage by Hamas?	BANGKOK (AP) — Five Thai nationals held hostage by Hamas since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel were released on Thursday. They were among 31 Thais taken by the militant group, of whom 23 have already been released. Another two have been confirmed dead, and the status of one remaining person is not clear. According to Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 46 Thais have been killed during the conflict, including the two who died in Hamas captivity. They were among tens of thousands of Thai workers in Israel. Here’s a look at what they were doing there. Why are there so many Thais in Israel? Israel once relied heavily on Palestinian workers, but it started bringing in large numbers of migrant workers after the 1987-93 Palestinian revolt known as the first Intifada. Most came from Thailand, and Thais remain the largest group of foreign agricultural laborers in Israel today, earning considerably more than they can at home. Thailand and Israel implemented a bilateral agreement a decade ago to ease the way for workers in the agriculture sector. Israel has come under criticism for the conditions under which the Thai farm laborers work. In a 2015 report, Human Rights Watch said they often were housed in makeshift and inadequate accommodations and 'were paid salaries significantly below the legal minimum wage, forced to work long hours in excess of the legal maximum, subjected to unsafe working conditions and denied their right to change employers.' A watchdog group found more recently that most were still paid below the legal minimum wage. How many Thais work in Israel? There were about 30,000 Thai workers, primarily working on farms, in Israel prior to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas. In the wake of the attack, some 7,000 returned home, primarily on government evacuation flights, but higher wages have continued to attract new arrivals. Thai ambassador to Israel Pannabha Chandraramya said Thursday that there are now more than 38,000 Thai workers in the country. What happened after they left? Faced with a labor shortage in the wake of the exodus after the Hamas attack, Israel’s Agriculture Ministry announced incentives to try and attract foreign workers back to evacuated areas. Among other things, it offered to extend work visas and to pay bonuses of about $500 a month. Thailand's Labor Ministry granted 3,966 Thai workers permission to work in Israel in 2024, keeping Israel in the top four destinations for Thais working abroad last year. Thai migrant workers generally come from poorer regions of the country, especially the northeast, and even before the bonuses the jobs in Israel paid many times what they could make at home. ___ Chalida Ekvitthayavechnukul contributed to this story.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-how-did-so-many-thai-farmers-end-up-held-hostage-by-hamas/	2025-01-30T03:32:43-08:00	
Hamas will free 3 Israelis and 5 Thais in next hostage release Th...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Hamas will release three Israelis, including two women and an 80-year-old man, as well as five Thai nationals during the next hostage release set for Thursday, Israel and Hamas said Wednesday as their tenuous ceasefire moves ahead. The Israeli women are Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Agam Berger, 20, and the man is Gadi Moses. The identities of the Thai nationals were not immediately known. A number of foreign workers were taken captive along with dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack that set off the war in Gaza. Twenty-three Thai hostages were released in the first ceasefire in November 2023. Israel says eight remain. Thursday's release would keep up the momentum of the ceasefire that began earlier this month and paused the 15-month war in Gaza. Hamas is releasing hostages in phases in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The prisoners range from individuals detained over minor offenses in recent months to senior militants serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks on Israeli civilians. Some have been held without charge or trial. Hostages and prisoners will be released twice this week The deal had been negotiated for months under the Biden administration but was finally sealed after incoming President Donald Trump threatened there would be 'hell to pay' if the hostages weren't returned. Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Israel on Wednesday and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who heads to Washington next week as the first foreign leader to meet Trump in his second term. The White House meeting on Feb. 4 comes a day after talks on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, aimed at ending the war, are meant to resume. Thursday's hostage release wasn't originally scheduled but came as a result of a standoff between Israel and Hamas over the identities of the hostages released last weekend. Israel had demanded that Yehoud, a civilian, be part of that group. When she wasn't freed, it held up the return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to war-battered northern Gaza. International mediation efforts brought about the plan for an additional release on Thursday and cleared the way for Palestinians to stream north. Another release occurs Saturday, which Netanyahu's office said would free male hostages. Dozens of Palestinian prisoners are set to be freed both Thursday and Saturday. Among the prisoners slated for release Thursday is Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent former militant leader and theater director whose dramatic jailbreak in 2021 thrilled Palestinians and stunned the Israeli security establishment. Egypt rejects Trump's suggestion that it take in Palestinians The pause in fighting has exposed the vastness of the destruction to Gaza's urban landscape, prompting Trump's suggestion over the weekend that neighboring Jordan and Egypt take in displaced Palestinians so that 'we just clean out that whole thing,' calling the territory 'a demolition site.' Egypt and Jordan, important U.S. allies, have rejected the suggestion, defying a U.S. president who has shown little patience for dissent from international partners. The Palestinians also rejected it amid fears it would undermine the notion of Palestinian statehood. In his first public comments on the issue, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi on Wednesday called the idea 'an injustice' and said the transfer of Palestinians 'can’t ever be tolerated or allowed.' He said the solution is the establishment of a Palestinian state. Trump has said he would urge the leaders of both countries, which are major recipients of U.S. aid, to accept the idea, saying the resettlement could be temporary or long term. It is not clear if Trump could force Egypt or Jordan to agree, but he has threatened hefty tariffs against other American allies to get his way. Egypt and Jordan receive billions of dollars in American aid each year. Military assistance to Egypt and Israel was exempted from a U.S. funding freeze to global aid programs. Palestinians fear they may never return if they leave The war has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their count. The fighting has obliterated vast areas of Gaza, displacing some 90% of its 2.3 million population, often multiple times. During its attack, Hamas took 250 people hostage and killed roughly 1,200. The theme of displacement has been recurrent in Palestinian history, and the idea of staying on one's land is integral to the Palestinian identity. Palestinians fear that if they leave, they may never be allowed to return. Those fears have been compounded by far-right members of Israel's government who support rebuilding Jewish settlements in Gaza, from which Israel withdrew troops and settlers from in 2005. Netanyahu says that idea is unrealistic. Egypt and Jordan have each made peace with Israel but support the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem. They fear that the permanent displacement of Gaza’s population could make that impossible. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Middle East latest: 2 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in occu...	The Palestinian Health Ministry says two Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in the occupied West Bank overnight and into Wednesday. A 23-year-old man was shot dead in Tulkarem and a 25-year-old man was killed in a strike on Jenin, where Israel launched a large operation earlier this month. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its reports. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip ignited the war there. The ministry says over 800 Palestinians have been killed. Most appear to have been militants killed in battle during Israeli arrest raids, but the dead also include people killed during violent protests, as well as civilian bystanders. There has also been an uptick in settler violence against Palestinians and Palestinian attacks on Israelis since the start of the war. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. ___ Here's the latest: Kremlin says Russian visit to Syria was important for building dialogue MOSCOW — Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that a Russian delegation’s visit to Damascus the day before, the first since the fall of former President Bashar Assad, an ally of Russia, was 'an important trip' for building dialogue with Syrian authorities. Peskoy refused to comment on reports that the Syrian authorities demanded that Moscow pay some kind of compensation to Syria or on unnamed sources claiming another demand was to extradite Assad, who fled to Russia and was granted asylum there. 'I am leaving this without any comment. We will continue the dialogue with the Syrian authorities,' Peskov said in a response to a reporter's question. Syrian state-run news agency SANA reported Wednesday that the discussions had included 'Russia’s role in rebuilding trust with the Syrian people through concrete measures such as reparations, reconstruction and recovery.' It said the talks were also on 'transitional justice mechanisms aimed at ensuring accountability and justice for the victims of the brutal war waged by the Assad regime.' Israeli authorities say they arrested 12 Palestinians in east Jerusalem JERUSALEM — Israeli authorities say they have arrested 12 Palestinians in east Jerusalem who celebrated the release of prisoners under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal. Israel’s internal Shin Bet security service and the police said they arrested the men late Tuesday after videos taken earlier in the week showed the men celebrating the release of the prisoners by waving Hamas flags and firing guns into the air. They say the Palestinians who celebrated the release had violated the ban on 'expressions of joy' and 'identification with Hamas' that Israel has imposed since the ceasefire took hold. They said a search revealed Hamas flags, posters, fireworks, a BB gun and cash. Under the first phase of the deal, Hamas is releasing 33 hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war in exchange for the release for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including some serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. Palestinians generally view the prisoners as heroes imprisoned for fighting against Israel’s decades-long occupation of lands they want for a future state.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-2-palestinians-killed-by-israeli-fire-in-occupied-west-bank-officials-say/	2025-01-29T03:40:35-08:00	
Western officials warn Ukraine over weapons procurement dispute	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Western officials have warned Ukraine that an escalating rift between the defense minister and procurement chief may jeopardize trust in the country and urged the government to resolve the situation quickly so as not to disrupt weapons supplies. The conflict began last week when the Defense Procurement Agency’s board unanimously voted to extend director Maryna Bezrukova’s contract for another year. However, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov overruled the decision, refusing to renew her contract. He accused her of poor performance and failing to deliver weapons and ammunition to front-line troops. The decision provoked an outcry from lawmakers and anti-corruption watchdogs who said the minister's move was illegal because Bezrukova had her contract extended by the agency’s supervisory board in January. They also came to Bezrukova’s defense, saying she has been instrumental in creating greater transparency and reforms within the DPA, which has long faced corruption allegations. Under Ukrainian law, Umerov’s decision to go ahead with her dismissal is illegal. The incident comes at a politically sensitive time for Ukraine as the country’s leadership is eagerly watching the Trump administration’s next moves, and as Ukrainian troops continue to face challenges in holding the line in the east amid fierce Russian attacks. In a statement posted Monday on social media platform X, the ambassadors representing Group of Seven nations urged the government to resolve the situation 'expeditiously and focus on keeping defense procurement going.' 'Consistency with good governance principles and NATO recommendations is important to maintain the trust of the public and international partners,' they said. Following Umerov's decision, the Anti-Corruption Action Center filed a complaint urging the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) to investigate him for alleged abuse of power. Local media reported that NABU opened proceedings against Umerov at the Anti-Corruption Action Center's request. Anastasiia Radina, a lawmaker and head of the Committee on Anti-Corruption Policy, called for Umerov’s dismissal, a decision that ultimately will fall to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 'What I see as a parliamentarian and as an observer is that his actions do not strengthen the agency and its independence. And that is just unacceptable for a country at war,' she told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine exchanged drone barrages overnight in an attempt to strike deeper into their enemy’s territory. The Russian military said Wednesday it intercepted and destroyed 104 Ukrainian drones over nine Russian regions in one of the biggest drone attacks on Russia this year. No casualties or significant damage was reported. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 57 Shahed and other drones overnight. Moscow also attacked with missiles overnight. In southern Mykolaiv, a Russian ballistic missile struck a food enterprise Tuesday night, killing two female workers, regional head Vitalii Kim said. Odesa authorities said Russian drones attacked port infrastructure in the Ismail district of the region that borders NATO member Romania Romania’s Ministry of National Defense said two F-16 fighter jets were dispatched at 3:20 a.m. to monitor airspace for about two hours, and emergency authorities issued text alerts to some residents living in Tulcea county, which is across the Danube river near Ukrainian ports. The ministry condemned the Russian attacks, calling them 'unjustified and in serious contradiction with the norms of international law,' and said NATO allies have been informed. Since the war next door started in February 2022, Romania has reported multiple airspace violations and confirmed drone fragments in its territory on several occasions. ___ Associated Press reporter Stephen McGrath in Sighisoara, Romania contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-western-officials-warn-ukraine-over-weapons-procurement-dispute/	2025-01-29T02:40:16-08:00	
Israeli father says even in Hamas captivity, his daughter heard h...	RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) — For more than 470 days, Eitan Gonen publicly pleaded with his daughter to stay alive while in Hamas captivity. He didn't know if she would hear him, but he ended every interview he gave with the same hopeful message: Romi is coming home alive. When he finally got to speak to his daughter for the first time in 15 months after she and two other women were freed Jan. 19, he got his answer. 'She said, ’Dad, I came home alive,'' Eitan Gonen told The Associated Press on Tuesday in his first interview with an international news outlet since her release. 'I know that my interview back then gave Romi a lot of strength, a lot of hope, something to cling on,' he said. Romi Gonen, 24, was among the first hostages to be freed from Gaza and one of seven women so far released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners as part of the ceasefire, a long and uncertain process aimed at eventually ending the war. Some 250 people were kidnapped during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. About 90 hostages remain in Gaza, although at least a third of them are believed to be dead. During the ceasefire's first phase, Hamas agreed to gradually release 33 hostages in exchange for Israel freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Six more hostages are expected to be released this week in exchange for hundreds of prisoners. Israel has been preparing for the hostages to return, with the expectation that after more than a year in captivity, many would likely be dealing with life-threatening health issues or other physical and psychological problems. This week, Dr. Ami Benov, who is working with the hostages, told reporters that the women were in poor physical condition and would face a lengthy recovery process, as they suffered from 'mild starvation' and vitamin deficiencies. Sitting in a complex in central Israel where his daughter and some of the other freed hostages are staying, Eitan Gonen wouldn't comment on Romi's health but said there's a long road ahead. 'The rehabilitation status just started,' he said. Because she spent so long in captivity, the family isn't pressuring her to speak. Instead, they are trying to give her autonomy and control, and to let her take things at her own pace, he said. Like many others, Romi was taken captive at the Nova music festival. That morning, her sister and mother, Merav Leshem Gonen, spent nearly five hours speaking to Romi as militants marauded through the festival grounds. Romi told her family that she would try to hide in the bushes, as the roads being clogged with abandoned cars made escape impossible. For nearly two months, her family had no idea if she was dead. They only learned she was alive from other hostages who were freed during a weeklong ceasefire a month after the attack, Eitan Gonen said. Praising his daughter's strength, he said she survived in part by learning Arabic, as it was the only way to communicate with her captors. 'Human beings will do anything to survive. Anything. And since the terrorists don’t speak any other language other than Arabic, she didn’t have any chance in order to communicate with them — to start learning their language,' he said, noting that she has even spoken it at times since being freed, likely out of habit. Something else that helped her stay alive was the support from other hostages, Eitan Gonen said. For a period, Romi was held with Emily Damari, a British-Israeli hostage who was released along with her. 'I believe God set it up somehow that Emily and Romi ... had each other to survive. ... It’s a dynamic duo,' he said. Other released hostages expressed similar sentiments about their own time in captivity. Israeli soldier Naama Levy, who was released Saturday, wrote in an Instagram post that after spending 50 days mostly alone, she was given strength when she was reunited with other kidnapped soldiers. Being held hostage with someone can provide strength through a shared fight for survival in the face of unimaginable adversity, said Dr. Einat Yehene, a psychologist who specializes in trauma and loss and who is head of rehabilitation at the Hostages Families Forum. Even though he finally got his daughter back, Eitan Gonen is still urging the Israeli government to keep working to bring home all of the remaining hostages. And he urges the families of hostages to keep giving interviews in all languages and mediums, to maintain the pressure and let their relatives know they haven't been forgotten. But he's mostly focusing on spending time with his daughter. 'I just enjoy being with her even in silence, touching, hugging, watching her,' he said. 'I missed it so much.' ___ Associated Press reporter Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israeli-father-says-even-in-hamas-captivity-his-daughter-heard-his-pleas-to-come-home-alive/	2025-01-29T00:25:24-08:00
