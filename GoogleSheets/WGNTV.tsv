Middle East latest: Released Israeli hostage says she has 'return...	One of the Israeli hostages freed on the first day of the Gaza ceasefire said Monday in her first comments since being released that she has 'returned to life.' Emily Damari, 28, was one of three hostages freed Sunday after spending 471 days in captivity. Officials at a hospital that received them said their condition was stable. Officials tout Gaza ceasefire, hostage deal as Israel says details still in flux In an Instagram story, which was shared by Israeli media, Damari thanked her family and the large protest movement that coalesced to advocate for the release of the hostages. 'Thank you thank you thank you I’m the happiest in the world,' she said. Damari, a dual Israeli-British citizen, returned from captivity with a bandage on one hand, and authorities said she had lost two fingers during Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, 2023. As she arrived to a hospital on Sunday, she waved at a crowd that had gathered and footage later showed her joyfully reuniting with her family. WATCH: Video of 3 Israeli hostages held by Hamas released on first day of ceasefire. Who are they? Her mother, Mandy Damari, said in a statement later Monday that Damari was 'doing much better than any of us could ever have anticipated.' The three Israeli hostages left Hamas captivity on Sunday and returned to Israel, and dozens of Palestinian prisoners walked free from Israeli jail, leaving both Israelis and Palestinians torn between celebration and trepidation as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took hold. Palestinians trek across rubble to return to their homes as Gaza ceasefire takes hold Here's the latest: Israeli soldier killed in West Bank JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says a soldier was killed and another was seriously wounded in the West Bank. The military declined to provide further details. Israeli media reported Monday that the soldiers’ vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb in the northern West Bank overnight. Israel has been battling Palestinian militants in the northern part of the occupied West Bank for years. The violence escalated after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip ignited the war there. The deadly blast came hours after a long-awaited ceasefire took hold in Gaza. Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want an independent state encompassing all three territories. Turkey reopens consulate in Aleppo ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey reopened its consulate in Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, raising its flag at the building for the first time in 12 years, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The opening on Monday comes weeks after the Turkish Embassy resumed its operations in the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Dec. 14. Turkey had closed down its diplomatic missions in Syria in 2012 due to security concerns amid the civil war, during which Turkey supported forces opposed to the government of former President Bashar Assad. Prior to the Syria conflict, Aleppo, located some 31 miles from the Turkish border, was an important center for trade between Turkey and Syria. Yemen’s Houthis say they’ll limit attacks DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels have signaled they will limit their attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships as a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip took hold. The Houthis made the announcement in an email sent to shippers and others on Sunday. The Houthis separately planned a military statement on Monday, likely about the decision. The Houthis, through their Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center, made the announcement by saying it was 'stopping sanctions' on the other vessels it has previously targeted since it started attacks in November 2023. The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023, after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Freed Palestinian med student: 'Joy is limited’ BEITUNIA, West Bank — Bara’a Al-Fuqha, 22, hugged her family as she stepped off the white Red Cross bus and into the sea of cheering Palestinians welcoming the 90 Palestinians freed by Israel early Monday. A medical student at Al-Quds University in East Jerusalem before her arrest, she had spent around six months in Damon Prison. She said she was held under administrative detention — a policy of indefinite imprisonment without formal charge or trial that Israel almost exclusively uses against Palestinians. Israel says that the cases of Palestinians released as part of the exchange with Hamas for Israeli hostages all relate to state security charges. Al-Fuqha said her conditions in Israeli prison were 'terrible,' her access to food and water limited. 'It was like, when we tried to hold our heads high, the guards would do their best to hold us down,' she said. But now, reunited with her family, al-Fuqha displayed a sense of relief and defiance. 'Thank God, I am here with my family, I’m satisfied,' she said. 'But my joy is limited, because so many among us Palestinians are being tortured and abused. Our people in Gaza are suffering. God willing, we will work to free them, too.' That reflected a wider feeling in the crowd, with many saying this release offered a small, if fleeting, moment of joy, tempered by the 15 months of death and destruction in Gaza. UN: Trucks with aid have entered Gaza Strip JERUSALEM — United Nations humanitarian officials say that more than 630 trucks of humanitarian aid have entered the besieged Gaza Strip, in implementation of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. In a post on social media platform X, Tom Fletcher, the United Nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs said that over 630 trucks entered Gaza on Sunday, with at least 300 of them bringing humanitarian assistance into the north. 'There is no time to lose,' Fletcher wrote. 'After 15 months of relentless war, the humanitarian needs are staggering.' The Gaza ceasefire deal, which began Sunday with an initial phase lasting six weeks, calls for the entry into Gaza of 600 trucks carrying humanitarian relief daily. Over the course of the deal’s first stage, 33 Israeli hostages in Hamas captivity in Gaza will also be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Aid workers have been scrambling to address Gaza’s dire humanitarian needs after 15 months of devastating war and tough Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries and the movement of convoys within Gaza. Lawlessness and looting by armed gangs has also been a major obstacle to aid distribution. Before this latest Israel-Hamas war began, Gaza was under a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade that allowed the entry of some 500 trucks a day carrying commercial supplies and humanitarian aid. Hamas: Delay in release of Palestinian prisoners result of conflict over list of names JERUSALEM — Hamas’ office of prisoner affairs has issued a statement saying the delay in Israel’s release of Palestinian prisoners was the result of a last-minute conflict over the names on the list. Seven hours after three Israeli hostages were released from Hamas captivity in Gaza on Sunday, Palestinian crowds gathered outside Israel’s Ofer prison near the West Bank city of Ramallah were still waiting for the release of 90 Palestinians. The Hamas statement said: 'During the process of checking the names of the prisoners being released from Ofer prison, there was found to be one female prisoner missing.' Hamas said that its officials were in communication with mediators and the Red Cross in hopes of pressuring Israel 'to adhere to the agreed-upon list of prisoners.' It said that the issue was being resolved and it expected the buses of the released prisoners to soon depart. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the delay. Israeli military fires projectiles, moves journalists The Israeli military fired projectiles and moved journalists waiting to cover the release of Palestinian prisoners as part of the ceasefire that began Sunday. That’s according to AP video, which showed smoke trailing from objects landing nearby.

Nearly seven hours had passed since the first three hostages were released from Gaza shortly after the ceasefire began.

WATCH: Video of 3 Israeli hostages held by Hamas released on firs...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Three hostages held by Hamas were released Sunday after 471 days in captivity as part of a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group. A gradual release of dozens of captives over the next several weeks has been agreed on. The truce and release of hostages sparked hope and trepidation among Israelis. Many fear that the three-phase deal could collapse before all the hostages return, or that they will arrive in poor health. Others worry that the number of captives who have died is more than predicted. THE LATEST: Gaza ceasefire takes hold and the first handover of hostages is underway Some 250 people were kidnapped during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered 15 months of war. Around 100 hostages still remain in Gaza, after the rest were released, rescued, or their bodies were recovered. Hours before Sunday's ceasefire, which many hope is the first step to end the war, Israel announced that it had retrieved the body of Oron Shaul, a soldier who was killed in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war and whose remains have been held by the militants since then. Here's a look at the three hostages released Sunday (see video player attached to story): Romi Gonen, 24 Romi Gonen was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That morning, Gonen's mother, Merav, and her eldest daughter spent nearly five hours speaking to Gonen as militants marauded through the festival grounds. Gonen told her family that roads clogged with abandoned cars made escape impossible and that she would seek shelter in some bushes. Then she said words that continue to echo in her mother’s head every day. 'Mommy I was shot, the car was shot, everybody was shot. ... I am wounded and bleeding. Mommy, I think I’m going to die,' she recounted Romi as saying, in a press conference a few weeks after the abduction. At a loss for what to do, Merav Gonen tried to convince her daughter that she wasn’t going to die, to start breathing and treat her wounded friends. According to Merav, Romi's last word during the call was a shriek of 'Mommy!' as approaching gunfire and the men’s shouts drowned out everything. Then the phone shut off. Israeli authorities identified her phone's location in Gaza. Over the past 15 months, Merav Gonen has been one of the most outspoken voices advocating for the return of the hostages, appearing nearly daily on Israeli news programs and traveling abroad on missions. 'We are doing everything we can so the world will not forget,' she told The Associated Press on the six-month anniversary of Hamas' attack. 'Every day we wake up and take a big breath, deep breath, and continue walking, continue doing the things that will bring her back.' Emily Damari, 28 Emily Damari is a British-Israeli citizen kidnapped from her apartment on Kibbutz Kfar Aza, a communal farming village hit hard by Hamas' assault. She lived in a small apartment in a neighborhood for young adults, the closest part of the kibbutz to Gaza. Militants broke through the border fence of the kibbutz and ransacked the neighborhood. Damari's mother, Mandy, said she loves music, traveling, soccer, good food, karaoke and hats. Kibbutz Kfar Aza said that Damari was often the 'glue that held her close-knit friend group together' and she was always organizing gatherings of friends around the best barbecue corner in the entire kibbutz. On Sunday, Mandy released a statement of thanks for supporters 'who never stopped saying her name.' 'After 471 days Emily is finally home,' she said. Doron Steinbrecher, 31 Doron Steinbrecher is a veterinary nurse who loves animals, and a neighbor to Damari in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Steinbrecher holds both Israeli and Romanian citizenship. At 10:20 a.m. on Oct. 7, 2023, Steinbrecher called her mother. 'Mom, I’m scared. I’m hiding under the bed and I hear them trying to enter my apartment,' her brother, Dor, recalled. She was able to send a voice message to her friends. 'They’ve got me! They’ve got me! They’ve got me!' in the moments of her abduction. That message was key in helping her family understand that Doron had been kidnapped. Steinbrecher was featured in a video released by Hamas on Jan. 26, 2024, along with two female Israeli soldiers. Her brother said the video gave them hope that she was alive but sparked concern because she looked tired, weak, and gaunt. In total, militants killed 64 people and 22 soldiers, and kidnapped 19 people from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on Oct. 7. With the return of Steinbrecher and Damari, there are still three members of the kibbutz held in Gaza: American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65, and twins Gali and Ziv Berman, 27. Remains of Oron Shaul, 20 Oron Shaul was a soldier killed on July 20, 2014, during fighting between Israel and Hamas. His body and that of another soldier, Hadar Goldin, had been held by militants since then despite a public campaign to return them by their families. The Hostages Families Forum, which represents relatives of the captives, called the Shaul family an 'inseparable part' of the group. Militants still hold the bodies of Goldin as well as two Israelis who crossed into Gaza in 2014 and 2015 on their own.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-who-are-the-israelis-released-or-recovered-on-the-first-day-of-the-ceasefire/	2025-01-19T09:12:07-08:00	
Gaza ceasefire takes hold after another delay, raising hopes of e...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took hold in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, ushering in an initial six-week period of calm and raising hopes for the release of dozens of militant-held hostages and an end to a devastating 15-month conflict. A last-minute delay by Hamas put off the start of the truce by nearly three hours and highlighted its fragility. What to know about the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas But even before the truce officially took effect, celebrations erupted across the war-ravaged territory and some Palestinians began returning to their homes. Israel, meanwhile, announced the names of the first hostages expected to return home later Sunday, in exchange for the planned release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners. The truce, which started at 11:15 a.m. local time, is just the first step toward ultimately ending the conflict and returning nearly 100 hostages abducted in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack. An Israeli official confirmed that Romi Gonen, 24, Emily Damari, 28, and Doron Steinbrecher, 31, were set to be released later Sunday. Gonen was abducted from the Nova music festival, while the other two were kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Damari is an Israeli-British dual citizen. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said the families had approved the publication of the names. Hamas was supposed to provide the three names before the start of the ceasefire, originally planned for 8:30 a.m. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early Sunday that the militants had not lived up to that commitment and that the Israeli military would keep fighting until they did. Hamas eventually released the names about two hours later, citing technical reasons and saying it was still committed to the agreement. In the interim between 8:30 a.m. and when the ceasefire took hold, Israeli fire killed at least 26 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It did not say whether they were civilians or fighters. The military has warned people to stay away from Israeli forces as they retreat to a buffer zone. Israel’s hardline national security minister meanwhile said his Jewish Power faction was quitting the government in protest over the ceasefire agreement. Itamar Ben-Gvir’s departure weakens Netanyahu’s coalition but will not affect the truce. Who is Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right minister who resigned from Netanyahu’s Cabinet? In a separate development, Israel announced that it had recovered the body of Oron Shaul, a soldier who was killed in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war, in a special operation in Gaza. The bodies of Shaul and another soldier, Hadar Goldin, remained in Gaza after the 2014 war and had not been returned despite a public campaign by their families. Fragile agreement The ceasefire deal was announced last week after a year of intensive mediation by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. The 42-day first phase of the ceasefire should see a total of 33 hostages returned from Gaza and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees released. Israeli forces should pull back into a buffer zone inside Gaza, and many displaced Palestinians should be able to return home. There is also supposed to be a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, with hundreds of trucks entering daily, far more than Israel allowed before. The United Nations' World Food Program said trucks had started entering Gaza through two crossings after the ceasefire took hold. This is just the second ceasefire in the war, longer and more consequential than a weeklong pause in November 2023, with the potential to end the fighting for good. Negotiations on the far more difficult second phase of this ceasefire should begin in just over two weeks. Major questions remain, including whether the war will resume after the first phase and how the rest of the hostages in Gaza will be freed. Palestinians celebrate Across the Gaza Strip, celebrations erupted early Sunday as people hoped for respite after 15 months of war that killed tens of thousands, destroyed large areas of the territory and displaced most of its population. Masked militants appeared at some of the celebrations, where the crowds chanted slogans in support of them, according to Associated Press reporters in Gaza. The Hamas-run police began deploying in public after mostly lying low due to Israeli airstrikes. Gaza City residents said they had seen them operating in parts of the city, and an AP reporter in Khan Younis saw a small number out on the streets. Palestinian residents began returning to their homes in parts of Gaza City early Sunday, even as tank shelling continued to the east, closer to the Israeli border, overnight. Families could be seen making their way back on foot, with their belongings loaded on donkey carts, residents said. 'The sound of shelling and explosions didn’t stop,' said Ahmed Matter, a Gaza City resident. He said he saw many families leaving their shelters and returning to their homes. 'People are impatient. They want this madness to end,' he said. Israelis divided Reactions in Israel were more varied, as people hoped for the safe return of the hostages but remained divided over the agreement. 'It’s a new day,' Nissan Kalderon, the brother of hostage Ofer Kalderon, 54, told Israeli Channel 12. 'Don’t stop. Bring all the hostages home.' Asher Pizem, 35, from the Israeli city of Sderot near Gaza, said he eagerly awaited the return of the captives. But he said the deal had merely postponed the next confrontation with Hamas and criticized Israel for allowing aid into Gaza, saying it would contribute to the revival of the militant group. 'They will take the time and attack again,' he said while overlooking smoldering ruins in Gaza from a hillock in southern Israel with other Israelis who had gathered there. Israel’s Cabinet approved the ceasefire early Saturday in a rare session during the Jewish Sabbath, more than two days after mediators announced the deal. The warring sides were under pressure from both the outgoing Biden administration and President-elect Donald Trump to achieve a deal before the U.S. presidential inauguration on Monday. It’s inauguration eve and Trump is ready to revel in his return to power Immense toll The toll of the war has been immense, and new details on its scope will now emerge. Over 46,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the fatalities but does not distinguish between civilians and fighters. The Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that sparked the war killed over 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants abducted around 250 others. More than 100 hostages were freed during the weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Read more: Latest Chicago news and headlines Some 90% of Gaza’s population has been displaced. The United Nations says homes, the health system, road networks and other vital infrastructure have been badly damaged. Rebuilding — if the ceasefire reaches its final phase — will take several years, at least. Major questions about Gaza’s future, political and otherwise, remain unresolved. Magdy reported from Cairo and Goldenberg from Tel Aviv, Israel. Associated Press reporters Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Mohammad Jahjouh in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-netanyahu-warns-again-that-gaza-ceasefire-will-not-begin-until-hamas-provides-a-hostage-list/	2025-01-19T04:11:30-08:00	
Gaza is in ruins, and it's unclear how it will be rebuilt	Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are eager to leave miserable tent camps and return to their homes if a long-awaited ceasefire agreement halts the Israel-Hamas war, but many will find there is nothing left and no way to rebuild. Israeli bombardment and ground operations have transformed entire neighborhoods in several cities into rubble-strewn wastelands, with blackened shells of buildings and mounds of debris stretching away in all directions. Major roads have been plowed up. Critical water and electricity infrastructure is in ruins. Most hospitals no longer function. And it's unclear when — or even if — much will be rebuilt. The agreement for a phased ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas-led militants does not say who will govern Gaza after the war, or whether Israel and Egypt will lift a blockade limiting the movement of people and goods that they imposed when Hamas seized power in 2007. The United Nations says that it could take more than 350 years to rebuild if the blockade remains. Two-thirds of all structures destroyed The full extent of the damage will only be known when the fighting ends and inspectors have full access to the territory. The most heavily destroyed part of Gaza, in the north, has been sealed off and largely depopulated by Israeli forces in an operation that began in early October. Using satellite data, the United Nations estimated last month that 69% of the structures in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, including over 245,000 homes. The World Bank estimated $18.5 billion in damage — nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022 — from just the first four months of the war. Israel blames the destruction on Hamas, which ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were fighters. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The military has released photos and video footage showing that Hamas built tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas, and often operated in and around homes, schools and mosques. Mountains of rubble to be moved Before anything can be rebuilt, the rubble must be removed — a staggering task in itself. The U.N. estimates that the war has littered Gaza with over 50 million tons of rubble — roughly 12 times the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza. With over 100 trucks working full time, it would take over 15 years to clear the rubble away, and there is little open space in the narrow coastal territory that is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians. Carting the debris away will also be complicated by the fact that it contains huge amounts of unexploded ordnance and other harmful materials, as well as human remains. Gaza's Health Ministry says thousands of people killed in airstrikes are still buried under the rubble. No plan for the day after The rubble clearance and eventual rebuilding of homes will require billions of dollars and the ability to bring construction materials and heavy equipment into the territory — neither of which is assured. The ceasefire agreement calls for a three- to five-year reconstruction project to begin in its final phase, after all the remaining 100 hostages have been released and Israeli troops have withdrawn from the territory. But getting to that point will require agreement on the second and most difficult phase of the deal, which still must be negotiated. Even then, the ability to rebuild will depend on the blockade, which critics have long decried as a form of collective punishment. Israel says it is needed to prevent Hamas from rebuilding its military capabilities, noting that cement and metal pipes can also be used for tunnels and rockets. Israel might be more inclined to lift the blockade if Hamas were no longer in power, but there are no plans for an alternative government. The United States and much of the international community want a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern the West Bank and Gaza with the support of Arab countries ahead of eventual statehood. But that's a nonstarter for Israel's government, which is opposed to a Palestinian state and has ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed authority. International donors are unlikely to invest in an ungoverned territory that has seen five wars in less than two decades, which means the sprawling tent camps along the coast could become a permanent feature of life in Gaza. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-palestinians-in-gaza-are-eager-to-return-home-in-a-ceasefire-but-many-will-find-nothing-left/	2025-01-17T04:37:58-08:00	
Israel's security Cabinet meets to vote on a ceasefire to pause t...	JERUSALEM, Israel (AP) — Israel’s security Cabinet convened Friday to vote on a ceasefire deal after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed an agreement had been reached that would pause the 15-month war with Hamas in Gaza and release dozens of hostages held by militants there. Mediators Qatar and the U.S. announced the ceasefire on Wednesday, but the deal hung in limbo for more than a day as Netanyahu insisted there were last-minute snags he blamed on Hamas. The militants maintained they were 'committed' to the deal, while residents of Gaza and families of the hostages anxiously waited to see if it would materialize. If the Cabinet approves it, the deal will then go to the government for final sign-off. Both bodies are expected to OK the ceasefire, which could start as soon as Sunday, even though it has drawn fierce resistance from Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners. Their objections could destabilize his government, however. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack into Israel that killed some 1,200 people and left some 250 others captive. Israel responded with a devastating offensive that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half of those killed. Beyond the death and destruction in Gaza, the conflict has also destabilized the Middle East and sparked worldwide protests. On Thursday, Israeli strikes killing at least 72 people in Gaza. In previous conflicts, both sides have stepped up military operations in the final hours before ceasefires as a way to project strength. A three-phase deal Netanyahu instructed a special task force to prepare to receive the hostages returning from Gaza, and said that their families were informed a deal had been reached. The prime minister’s office said that if the deal passes, the ceasefire could start Sunday and the first hostages could be freed then too. Under the deal, 33 of some 100 hostages who remain in Gaza are set to be released over six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israeli forces will pull back from many areas, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians would be able to return to what’s left of their homes, and there would be a surge of humanitarian assistance. The remainder of the hostages, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second — and much more difficult — phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal, while Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it dismantles the group and to maintain open-ended security control over the territory. Jaher Jabareen, head of Hamas’ office responsible for prisoners, said on Friday that the names of those expected to be released from Israeli jails will be published, but didn’t say when. Longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee the daunting task of reconstruction. An Egyptian official and a Hamas official confirmed that the last-minute issues were over the list of Palestinian prisoners to be released from Israeli jails during the first phase of the deal, but those have now been resolved. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private negotiations. The Hamas official said mediators showed the group Israel's approval. The Egyptian official added that an Israeli delegation from the military and Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency arrived in Cairo on Friday to discuss the reopening of the Rafah crossing, a key link between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. An Israeli official who also spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations confirmed a delegation was going to Cairo to discuss the crossing. Objections to the deal in Israel On Thursday, Israel’s hard-line national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, threatened to quit the government if Israel approved the ceasefire. He reiterated that on Friday, writing on social media platform X: 'If the ‘deal’ passes, we will leave the government with a heavy heart.' Ben-Gvir’s resignation would not bring down the government or derail the ceasefire deal, but the move would destabilize the government at a delicate moment and could eventually lead to its collapse if Ben-Gvir were joined by other key Netanyahu allies.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israels-security-cabinet-convenes-to-approve-deal-to-release-hostages-and-pause-the-15-month-war/	2025-01-17T03:50:16-08:00	
AP Exclusive: Egypt's chief diplomat urges Israel and Hamas to en...	NEW ADMINISTRATIVE CAPITAL, Egypt (AP) — Egypt’s chief diplomat on Thursday called on Israel and Hamas to implement a Gaza ceasefire plan 'without any delay,' raising pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the deal. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty delivered the message at a sensitive time in efforts to end a devastating 15-month conflict. A day after President Joe Biden and other international mediators announced the ceasefire agreement, Netanyahu was still insisting there was no deal. However, a pre-dawn statement on Friday appeared to have cleared the way for the deal to be voted on by Israel's security cabinet. If approved Israel said the deal could go into effect on Sunday. In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, Abdelatty said a deal had been reached thanks to 'deep involvement' by American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators, including officials from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. 'We have a deal. What’s very important is to start implementation,' Abdelatty said from the foreign ministry's headquarters in The New Administrative Capital, a newly built sprawling city about 45 kilometers (28 miles) east of Cairo that houses government offices. 'What we are doing now is to push for final approval and implementation, without any delay.' Egypt, which has a peace agreement with Israel and shares a border with Hamas-ruled Gaza, has been a key mediator between the enemies for years and a leading player in ongoing ceasefire negotiations. Cairo is supposed to be the location for continued talks between the U.S., Qatar and Egypt on implementing the deal. Abdelatty said the talks were set to begin soon, and that the mediators would have an 'operation room' overseeing the deal in the Egyptian capital. 'We are fully committed to fulfill our own commitments and we are expecting that others to fulfill their own commitments,' he said. Egyptian and Israeli officials said an Israeli delegation from the military and its Shin Bet internal security agency were going to Cairo Friday to discuss the reopening of the Rafah crossing. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations. Hamas has suffered heavy losses during the war, but the group appears to remain intact. Its fighters have continued to stage deadly attacks against Israeli troops and its government continues to provide some basic services. Abdelatty declined to discuss Hamas' capabilities, but signaled it will not play a role in governing Gaza after the war. He said the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, which governs from the occupied West Bank after being ousted by Hamas in 2007, is the proper Palestinian entity to lead postwar Gaza. 'We have to empower the Palestinian Authority,' he said, adding that Egypt is ready to work with the U.S. 'to empower the Palestinians and the Palestinian police in order to provide security in Gaza.' He said the only solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the establishment of an independent Palestinian state that includes the West Bank and Gaza. The outgoing Biden administration has called for a revitalized Palestinian Authority to return to post-war Gaza, an idea Netanyahu and his far-right partners reject. Under the emerging deal, hundreds of truckloads of desperately needed humanitarian aid are expected to flow into Gaza through Egypt’s Rafah border crossing. The crossing, Gaza’s main gateway to the outside world, has been closed since the Israeli army took over the area last May. Abdelatty said Egypt aims to open the crossing as soon as possible to allow in 600 trucks a day 'because people are starving on the ground.' He said arrangements are still being worked out, but that Egypt would welcome the return of civilian observers from the European Union. An EU operation helped run the crossing, in coordination with Israel and the Palestinian Authority, for two years until Hamas seized control of Gaza. In Brussels, European Commission spokesman Anouar El Anouni confirmed Thursday that the EU is considering a return to the crossing. Egyptian officials said an EU mission is expected in Cairo next week. 'The EU presence would be of great importance,' Abdelatty said. Egypt has also been harmed by the ongoing war, with seaborne attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen halting much of the shipping traffic through the Suez Canal. Abdelatty said Egypt has lost about $600 million in revenue each month as a result of the ongoing tensions. He said the presence of an estimated 10 million refugees and migrants – including tens of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza — has created an additional burden.

Blinken defends US policy on Gaza as his final State Department b...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday defended Biden administration policies on Israel’s war with Hamas after a ceasefire agreement in Gaza was reached, facing protests that interrupted his final news conference at the State Department. He said he expected the deal — announced by President Joe Biden and Qatar on Wednesday — to be implemented over the weekend. He called it 'a moment of historic possibility for the region and well beyond' even as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a last-minute dispute with Hamas was holding up Israeli approval. 'It’s going to take tremendous effort, political courage, compromise to realize that possibility, to try to ensure that the gains that have been achieved over the past 15 months at enormous, excruciating cost are actually enduring,' Blinken said. As he touted the deal, two people in the room accused him of complicity in Israeli violence against Palestinian civilians in loud outbursts that forced him to pause. One shouted, 'Why aren’t you in the Hague?' referring to the International Criminal Court based in the Dutch city, and the other called him 'a monster.' Blinken asked them to 'respect the process.' Both men were physically removed by Diplomatic Security officers. While protests are common in large public gatherings, including just this week when Blinken delivered an address on the Middle East at a Washington-based think tank, they are rare, if not unprecedented, in the State Department briefing room. After recovering from the interruptions, Blinken said in response to other questions that the U.S. has had 'real differences' with Israel in how it has gone about defending its people and has 'expressed those clearly at various points.' But 'we’ve mostly done it privately, precisely because we didn’t want to feed into Hamas’ clearly held views that if that pressure was mounting, and if there was daylight, they could do nothing,' Blinken said. That 'they could refuse to engage on the negotiations, hold back on a ceasefire and releasing the hostages, and thus perpetuate the suffering, the loss for the people that they purport to represent.' Blinken and other members of the Biden administration have faced severe criticism for not imposing meaningful restrictions on the supply of weapons to Israel or pushing its key ally hard enough to ease a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel's military offensive against Hamas militants — who triggered the war with their Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attacks that killed some 1,200 people — has leveled vast swaths of Gaza and pushed around 90% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Hundreds of thousands are struggling with hunger and disease in squalid tent camps on the coast. The campaign has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half of those killed. Blinken said the administration was acutely aware of the civilian suffering in Gaza, but said it had stopped short of accusing Israel of war crimes because of the 'uniquely challenging situation' in the territory. 'Uniquely in Gaza, besides having a population that’s been trapped there that has nowhere else to go, you have an enemy that embeds itself in and amongst civilians, houses, hospitals, mosques, schools, and getting a clear picture and a clear understanding of whether any one incident in that context constitutes a violation of international law — it's an incredibly complicated thing to do, especially to do it in real time,' he said. Blinken traveled to the Mideast 12 times in a bid to halt the fighting. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump are both claiming credit for the ceasefire deal after the White House brought Trump’s Middle East envoy into the stalled negotiations. ___ AP reporter Ellen Knickmeyer contributed from Washington.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-blinken-interrupted-by-shouting-journalists-in-state-department-briefing-room/	2025-01-16T12:13:03-08:00	
UK leader Starmer signs '100-year partnership' agreement with Ukr...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, part of a European show of support and promises to keep helping Ukraine endure in its nearly three-year war with Russia. The announcement came days before Donald Trump is sworn in as U.S. president with skepticism of America’s military burden in Europe and what he says is a plan to end the continent’s biggest conflict since World War II. 'We are with you not just today or tomorrow, for this year or the next, but for 100 years — long after this terrible war is over and Ukraine is free and thriving once again,' Starmer told Zelenskyy during a visit to Kyiv, promising that the U.K. would 'play our part' in guaranteeing Ukraine's post-war security. Starmer said that the landmark century-long agreement commits the two sides to cooperate on defense — especially maritime security against Russian activity in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov — and on technology projects including drones, which have become vital weapons for both sides in the war. The treaty also includes a system to help track stolen Ukrainian grain exported by Russia from occupied parts of the country. Ukraine’s alignment with the West, and potential future membership in NATO, have angered Russian President Vladimir Putin, who still wants to exert influence over the independent nation. While Starmer was meeting with Zelenskyy at the presidential palace, debris from Russian drones shot down by Ukraine’s air defenses fell in at least four districts of Kyiv, according to city administration chief Tymur Tkachenko. One was close to the Baroque presidential palace where the two men met. Starmer said that the drones were 'a reminder' of what the Ukrainian people are up against and their resolve. Starmer’s unannounced visit is his first trip to Ukraine since he took office in July, though he said that it was his seventh meeting with Zelenskyy. The Italian defense chief was also in Kyiv on Thursday, two days after Germany’s defense minister visited and three days after Zelenskyy talked by phone with French President Emmanuel Macron. The flurry of diplomatic activity came in the days leading up to Trump’s inauguration on Monday, which is expected to bring a departure from the outgoing U.S. administration’s pledge to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes to defeat Russia. Trump has also indicated that he wants Europe to shoulder more of the burden for helping Ukraine. Kyiv’s allies have rushed to flood Ukraine with as much support as possible before Trump’s inauguration, with the aim of putting Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations to end the full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022. Ukrainians worry that Trump’s plan will demand unpalatable concessions, such as giving up territory. Zelenskyy has also said that he wants security guarantees to deter Russia from invading again in the future. 'We must look at how this war could end, the practical ways to get a just and lasting peace … that guarantees your security, your independence and your right to choose your own future,' Starmer said at a joint news conference. Zelenskyy said that the two leaders had discussed an idea floated by Macron for Western troops to monitor a future ceasefire, but said that it’s 'a bit too early to talk about details.' Starmer left the door open to U.K. participation, telling Ukraine's leader that 'we will work with you and all of our allies on steps that would be robust enough to guarantee Ukraine’s security.' 'Those conversations will continue for many months ahead,' Starmer said. Zelenskyy has previously discussed a potential peacekeeping force with Baltic countries, France and Poland. But he said that it could only be part of the security solution and noted that 'we do not consider security guarantees without the United States.' Starmer agreed that Washington's role in Ukraine is 'vital.' The United States is the biggest provider of military support and advanced weaponry to the country. 'We will continue to work with the U.S. on this,' Starmer said. Starmer said that in 2025, the U.K. will give Ukraine 'more military support than ever before.' He said that his country has already committed 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) for military aid this year, including 150 more artillery barrels and a U.K.-designed mobile air defense system named Gravehawk. The U.K. has pledged 12.8 billion pounds ($15.6 billion) in military and civilian aid since the war broke out. During the daylong visit, Starmer and Zelenskyy laid flowers at a wall of remembrance for those killed in the war. The wall outside St. Michael’s Golden-Domed Monastery, a Kyiv landmark, is covered in photos of the slain, stretching for a city block. It has become a place of pilgrimage for families paying tribute to their lost loved ones. Starmer also visited a Kyiv hospital specializing in burns treatment and an exhibition of drone technology. As the grinding war nears the three-year mark, both Russia and Ukraine are pushing for battlefield gains before possible peace talks. Ukraine has started a second offensive in Russia’s Kursk region, where it is struggling to hang onto a chunk of territory it captured last year, and has stepped up drone and missile attacks on weapons sites and fuel depots inside Russia. Moscow is slowly taking territory at the cost of high casualties along the 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line in eastern Ukraine and launching intense barrages at Ukraine’s energy system, seeking to deprive Ukrainians of heat and light in the depths of winter. A major Russian ballistic and cruise missile attack on regions across Ukraine on Wednesday compelled authorities to shut down the power grid in some areas. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-uks-starmer-arrives-in-ukraine-for-security-talks-with-zelenskyy-days-before-trump-is-sworn-in/	2025-01-16T10:06:40-08:00	
Middle East latest: Netanyahu says Cabinet won't meet over ceasef...	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Thursday his Cabinet won’t meet to approve the agreement for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of dozens of hostages until Hamas backs down, accusing the group of reneging on parts of the agreement in an attempt to gain further concessions. Netanyahu said a 'last-minute crisis' with Hamas was holding up Israeli approval of the long-awaited ceasefire agreement. His office did not elaborate. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 72 people since the ceasefire deal was announced, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Palestinians in Gaza reported heavy Israeli bombardment overnight as people were celebrating the ceasefire deal. In previous conflicts, both sides have stepped up military operations in the final hours before ceasefires go into effect as a way to project strength. Gaza’s Health Ministry said the 48 bodies of people killed since midday Wednesday were brought to several hospitals. Around half of the dead were women and children, Zaher al-Wahedi, head of the ministry’s registration department, told The Associated Press. Under the deal reached Wednesday, 33 hostages are set to be released over the next six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The remainder, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Israel’s offensive has killed over 46,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were militants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the latest: At least 72 killed in Israeli strikes since ceasefire deal announced, Gaza officials say Gaza’s Health Ministry says Israeli strikes have killed at least 72 people since a ceasefire deal was announced on Wednesday. In previous conflicts, both sides have stepped up military operations in the final hours before ceasefires take effect as a way to project strength. The ministry says the toll from Thursday’s strikes only includes bodies brought to two hospitals in Gaza City, and that the actual toll is likely higher. 'Yesterday was a bloody day, and today is bloodier,' said Zaher al-Wahedi, head of the ministry’s registration department. Israeli group holds demonstration against ceasefire deal JERUSALEM — A group representing some families of soldiers killed fighting in Gaza held a demonstration Thursday against a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The Gvura Forum opposes the deal, saying it won’t lead to Hamas’ destruction and that it will free Palestinians convicted of deadly crimes against Israelis. The agreement could also leave some Israeli hostages behind in Gaza if it collapses, the group said. The group set up rows of mock coffins draped in the Israeli flag in Jerusalem to symbolize the price Israel will pay if it agrees to the deal. 'It’s a very dangerous deal,' said Yehoshua Shani, whose son Ori Mordehai Shani was killed in battle in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. He believed the incoming Trump administration could exert more pressure on Hamas and secure better terms. Many Israelis support a ceasefire deal that would bring the hostages home and end the war in Gaza. But some families of fallen soldiers and of hostages oppose any agreement that they perceive grants too many concessions to Hamas. Russia voices hope that ceasefire can secure lasting stability in Gaza MOSCOW — Russia’s Foreign Ministry voiced hopes Thursday that the long-awaited agreement to pause the fighting in the Gaza Strip will help secure lasting stability in Gaza. Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova praised 'the patient and persistent work of Qatari and Egyptian mediators' who helped broker the agreement and noted that 'at the final stage, representatives of the new American administration also joined the negotiating marathon.' 'We expect that the implementation of the agreement reached now will contribute to the sustainable stabilization of the situation in Gaza and create conditions for the return of all internally displaced persons ... and allow Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners released as a result of the deal to join their families,' Zakharova said at a briefing. She specifically mentioned Russian citizen Alexander Trufanov, who was held in the Gaza Strip along other hostages. 'We believe that the conclusion of this agreement will contribute to the formation of the necessary conditions for establishing a process of a comprehensive political settlement of the Palestinian problem on a generally accepted international legal basis,' Zakharova added. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also welcomed the deal. 'Any settlement that would result in a ceasefire and end the suffering of the people of Gaza while helping ensure security of Israel can only be welcomed,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Families mourn 4 killed in Israeli strike in southern Gaza Mourners held a Muslim funeral service on Thursday for a Palestinian journalist who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Gaza the previous day. The strike hit a food charity known as Tikia in the Muwasi area in the city of Khan Younis Wednesday evening as people were waiting for the announcement of the ceasefire deal, according to the Naser hospital and the journalists’ relatives. The journalist, Ahmed al-Shaiyah, was killed in the strike along with three other people, according to the hospital, which received the bodies. 'Instead of receiving news of the truce, we received news of his martyrdom,' the journalist’s brother, Ismail al-Shaiyah, told the AP. 'We were waiting to rest and get rid of this nightmare, but my son was martyred in the last hour. He was gone from me,' said Nagat Moammar, the mother of one of those killed. China welcomes Gaza ceasefire, hopes it is ‘comprehensive and permanent’ TAIWAN — Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Thursday that Beijing welcomes the ceasefire deal and hopes it can be 'effectively implemented so a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza can be achieved.' China will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza and make 'positive efforts' for post-war reconstruction, he added. 'We also sincerely hope that the relevant parties will take the Gaza ceasefire as an opportunity to promote the easing of local tensions. China is willing to work with the international community to make unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East,' Guo said. Iran-backed militia will suspend operations against Israel, its leader says Baghdad — The leader of the Iran-backed Iraqi militia Harakat al-Nujaba, Akram al-Kaabi, announced Thursday the suspension of the group’s operations against Israel following the declaration of a Gaza ceasefire agreement but warned they could start again if there were violations of the truce. In a statement, al-Kaabi congratulated the Palestinian people and 'freedom-loving' individuals worldwide on 'this important development.' 'We will suspend our military operations against (Israel) in solidarity with the halt of operations in Palestine and to support the continuation of the ceasefire in Gaza, but let the occupying entity know that any foolishness from them in Palestine or the region will be met with a harsh response,' he added. Al-Kaabi said the group's missiles and drones 'remain on permanent standby.' During the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Iraqi militias launched a series of drone attacks targeting U.S. bases in Syria and Iraq as well as sites in Israel. Syria's foreign minister calls for lifting of sanctions ANKARA, Turkey — Syria’s new foreign minister has called for a lifting of sanctions that were imposed on his country during former President Bashar Assad’s rule. In an interview with Turkish state broadcaster TRT that aired Thursday, Asaad al-Shibani also said Syria’s new leadership wanted to 'open a new page' in its diplomatic relations with countries that had cut diplomatic ties with Damascus during the Syrian civil war. 'The economic sanctions are one of the problems that the old regime left us,' al-Shibani said in the interview, which aired a day after he met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other Turkish officials in Ankara. 'We are saying that there is no longer any need for them. The old regime is gone.' 'These sanctions must be lifted in order for people to live in better economic conditions and for security and economic stability to be achieved,' he added. Indonesia calls for the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state as it welcomes the ceasefire JAKARTA — Indonesia’s Foreign Affairs Ministry has welcomed the ceasefire and called for its immediate implementation, along with the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state. 'Peace in Palestine cannot be achieved without the end of Israel’s occupation and the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state, in accordance with the two-state solution based on agreed international parameters,' it said in a statement on Thursday. Muslim-majority Indonesia has long been a strong supporter of Palestinians. Iran's Revolutionary Guard says ceasefire is a ‘great victory’ for Hamas TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s Revolutionary Guard has applauded the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas and called it a 'great victory' for Hamas and the resistance front. 'This great victory, like the ‘al-Aqsa storm,’ which was a multifaceted and irreparable defeat for the Zionists, did not bring any gains for the Zionist regime, and the resistance remained alive, thriving and strong,' the Guard said in a statement on Thursday, referring to the Oct. 7, 2023 surprise attack that sparked the war. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei later said in a post on social platform X that the patience of the resistance front forced Israel to retreat. 'It will be written in books that there was a mob who once killed thousands of children & women in Gaza! Everyone will realize it was the patience of the people & steadfastness of Palestinian Resistance & Resistance Front that forced Zionist regime to retreat,' he wrote in a post on the social platform X on Thursday. Pakistan hails ceasefire but criticizes Israel for ‘unprecedented loss of lives’ ISLAMABAD — Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that Islamabad welcomes the ceasefire deal reached between Israel and Hamas and calls for its immediate and full implementation. 'Indiscriminate use of force by Israeli occupation forces has caused unprecedented loss of lives and property and displacement of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilian Palestinians. Israel’s expansionist designs have destabilized the entire region,' the ministry said in a statement on Thursday. It added that Pakistan hopes the truce will lead to a permanent ceasefire and help scale up humanitarian assistance. Japan and South Korea welcome Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza TOKYO — Japan and South Korea have separately welcomed the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza as a key step toward improving humanitarian conditions and calming the situation in the territory. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, speaking to reporters in Tokyo on Thursday, urged Israel and Hamas to implement the agreement 'sincerely and steadily' and he praised the United States, Egypt and Qatar for their work to achieve the deal. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, called for a 'thorough and swift implementation' of the agreement so that 'all hostages are released and the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip improves.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-netanyahu-says-cabinet-wont-meet-over-ceasefire-until-hamas-drops-new-demands/	2025-01-16T04:36:43-08:00	
Netanyahu says 'last-minute crisis' with Hamas holding up approva...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that a 'last-minute crisis' with Hamas was holding up Israeli approval of a long-awaited ceasefire that would pause the fighting in the Gaza Strip and release dozens of hostages. Israeli airstrikes, meanwhile, killed at least 72 people in the war-ravaged territory. Netanyahu began signaling there were issues with the deal just hours after U.S. President Joe Biden and key mediator Qatar announced it was complete. The objection created a dual reality: War-weary Palestinians in Gaza, the relatives of hostages held there and world leaders all welcomed an agreement, expected to begin Sunday, even as Netanyahu said it was not yet finalized. Chicagoland Palestinians celebrate ceasefire agreement in Gaza Strip It was not yet clear if Netanyahu’s statements merely reflected jockeying to keep his fractious coalition together or whether the deal was at risk. Netanyahu's office said his Cabinet won’t meet to approve the deal until Hamas backs down, accusing it of reneging on parts of the agreement in an attempt to gain further concessions, without elaborating. Izzat al-Rishq, a senior Hamas official, said the militant group 'is committed to the ceasefire agreement, which was announced by the mediators.' The deal announced Wednesday would see a scores of hostages held in Gaza released and a pause in fighting with a view to eventually wind down a 15-month war that has destabilized the Middle East and sparked worldwide protests. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack into Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Gaza truce gives Israelis and Palestinians hope but may not end their suffering Israel responded with a fierce offensive that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half of those killed. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The military campaign has also leveled vast swaths of Gaza, and pushed around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people from their homes. Hundreds of thousands are struggling with hunger and disease in squalid tent camps on the coast, according to United Nations officials. Netanyahu faces heavy internal pressure Netanyahu’s office earlier accused Hamas of backtracking on an understanding that he said would give Israel a veto over which prisoners convicted of murder would be released in exchange for hostages. The Israeli prime minister has faced great domestic pressure to bring home the scores of hostages, but his far-right coalition partners have threatened to bring down his government if he makes too many concessions. He has enough opposition support to approve an agreement even without those partners, but doing so would weaken his coalition. One of his far-right allies, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, has already come out against the deal. Another, Bezalel Smotrich, posted on X late Wednesday that he was demanding 'absolute certainty' that Israel can resume the war later, calling the current deal 'bad and dangerous' for Israel. The departure of both of their factions would seriously destabilize the government and could lead to early elections. A night of heavy Israeli strikes Palestinians in Gaza reported heavy Israeli bombardment overnight as people were celebrating the ceasefire deal. In previous conflicts, both sides have stepped up military operations in the final hours before ceasefires as a way to project strength. 'We were expecting that the occupation would intensify the bombing, like they did every time there were reports on progress in the truce (negotiations),' said Mohammed Mahdi, who fled his home a few months ago and is sheltering in Gaza City. Ahmed Mattar, who lives near the city’s Al-Ahly hospital, said he heard 'massive airstrikes' overnight. Gaza’s Health Ministry said Israeli strikes have killed at least 72 people since the ceasefire deal was announced. It said the toll from Thursday’s strikes only includes bodies brought to two hospitals in Gaza City, and that the actual toll is likely higher. 'Yesterday was a bloody day, and today is bloodier,' said Zaher al-Wahedi, head of the ministry’s registration department. An Associated Press reporter on the Israeli side of the border near Gaza heard more airstrikes and artillery fire on Thursday. A phased withdrawal and hostage release with potential pitfalls Under the deal reached Wednesday, 33 of some 100 hostages who remain in Gaza are set to be released over the next six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israeli forces will pull back from many areas, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians would be able to return to what’s left of their homes, and there would be a surge of humanitarian assistance. Biden gives farewell address from Oval Office as he prepares to cede power to Trump The remainder of the hostages, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second — and much more difficult — phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal, while Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it dismantles the group and to maintain open-ended security control over the territory. Ceasefire leaves questions about Gaza's future unanswered Mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the U.S. are expected to meet in Cairo on Thursday for talks on implementing the agreement, which came after a year of intensive talks with repeated setbacks. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy joined the talks in the final weeks, and both the outgoing administration and Trump’s team are taking credit for the breakthrough. Many longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee the daunting task of reconstruction. Israel has come under heavy international criticism, including from its closest ally, the United States, over the civilian toll in Gaza. It also blames Hamas for the civilian casualties, accusing it of using schools, hospitals and residential areas for military purposes. Read more: Latest Chicago news and headlines Hamas, a militant group that does not accept Israel’s existence, has come under overwhelming pressure from Israeli military operations, including the invasion of Gaza’s largest cities and towns and the takeover of the border between Gaza and Egypt. Its top leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who was believed to have helped mastermind the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, have been killed. But its fighters have regrouped in some of the hardest-hit areas after the withdrawal of Israeli forces, raising the prospect of a prolonged insurgency if the war continues.

Chicagoland Palestinians celebrate ceasefire agreement in Gaza St...	BRIDGEVIEW, Ill. (WGN) — Palestinians from the Chicagoland area gathered in Bridgeview Wednesday following the announcement of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The deal puts a pause on the conflict after 16 months of war. Those who spoke to WGN News at the rally called the ceasefire announcement 'a victory.' The Jewish United Fund in Chicago shared similar sentiments to Palestinians in the southwest suburbs on Wednesday, expressing relief that more hostages will finally be able to come home. In his address Wednesday afternoon, President Joe Biden said it was the toughest negotiations he has experienced in reaching a deal, which will be a three-phase plan that's set to release dozens of hostages over the next six weeks. In Chicago, the plan has local organizations applauding the work, but still holding their breath for Sunday when the first group of hostages are set to be released. 'It doesn't happen until it happens, right?' U.S. Palestinian Network's Muhammad Sankari said. 'I think the other reason people are holding their breath, to be frank, is there's a history of Israel violating the ceasefire agreements. If we just look at Lebanon, there was a ceasefire that was signed in November. Since the end of November, Israel has committed over 1,000 violations of that ceasefire.' According to the Soufan Center on Tuesday, in a complaint to the United Nations Security Council, Lebanon — which deals with the international community on behalf of Hezbollah — accused Israel of more than 800 land and air attacks since the ceasefire came into effect on Nov. 27, 2024. Israel has repeatedly accused Hezbollah, a United States-designated terrorist group based mostly in southern Lebanon, of maintaining fighters and weapons, including rockets, in the south that threaten its security and violate the ceasefire. Officials tout Gaza ceasefire, hostage deal as Israel says details still in flux 'Americans and Israelis are holding our breaths that hopefully, as many as possible of those who will be returned will be breathing and not in coffins,' said Jay Tcatch, Executive Vice President of the Jewish United Fund. 'That demonstrates part of Hamas’ inhumanity – holding innocence and not letting families finally grieve those already murdered.' According to the American Jewish Committee, Hamas continues to hold more than 90 hostages, including at least 34 deceased individuals, following the abduction of approximately 251 people during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The deal between Israel and Hamas is expected to deliver an initial six-week halt to fighting that will be accompanied by the opening of negotiations on ending the war completely.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/chicagoland-palestinians-celebrate-ceasefire-agreement-in-gaza-strip/	2025-01-15T15:40:29-08:00	
Israel and Hamas agree to a Gaza ceasefire, officials say	Video above: Hundreds in Jerusalem protest against expected Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal on Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025. DOHA, Qatar (AP) — Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal, mediators announced Wednesday, pausing a devastating 15-month war in the Gaza Strip and raising the possibility of winding down the deadliest and most destructive fighting between the bitter enemies. The deal, coming after weeks of painstaking negotiations in the Qatari capital, promises the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas in phases, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel and would allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to return to what remains of their homes. It also would flood badly needed humanitarian aid into a devastated territory. Three officials from the U.S. and one from Hamas confirmed that a deal had been reached, while a senior Israeli official said details are still being ironed out. All three U.S. officials requested anonymity to discuss the contours of the deal before the official announcement by mediators in Doha. President Joe Biden was preparing to address the breakthrough agreement later Thursday, officials said. Any agreement still needs to be approved by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet, but is expected to go into effect in the coming days. The deal is expected to deliver an initial six-week halt to fighting that is to be accompanied by the opening of negotiations on ending the war altogether. Over six weeks, 33 of the nearly 100 hostages are to be reunited with their loved ones after months in in captivity with no contact with the outside world, though it’s unclear if all are alive. It remained unclear exactly when and how many displaced Palestinians would be able to return to what remains of their homes and whether the agreement would lead to a complete end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza — key Hamas demands for releasing the remaining captives. Many longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee the daunting task of reconstruction. Still, the announcement offered the first sign of hope in months that Israel and Hamas may be winding down the most deadly and destructive war they’ve ever fought, a conflict that has destabilized the broader Middle East and sparked worldwide protests. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack, which killed some 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a fierce offensive that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s population and sparked a humanitarian crisis. More than 100 hostages were freed from Gaza in a weeklong truce in November 2023. The U.S., along with Egypt and Qatar, have brokered months of indirect talks between the bitter enemies that finally culminated in this latest deal. It comes after Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire in November, after more than a year of conflict linked to the war in the Gaza. Israel responded with a brutal air and ground offensive that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials. They do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half of those killed. U.N. and international relief organizations estimate that some 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times. They say tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed and hospitals are barely functioning. Experts have warned that famine may be underway in northern Gaza, where Israel launched a major offensive in early October, displacing tens of thousands of residents. 'The best day in my life and the life of the Gaza people,' Abed Radwan, a Palestinian father of three, said of the ceasefire deal. 'Thank God. Thank God.' Radwan, who has been displaced from the town of Beit Lahiya for over a year and shelters in Gaza City, said he will try to return to his hometown, and 'rebuild my house, and rebuild Beit Lahiya.' He spoke to AP over the phone. His voice has been overshadowed by celebrations. 'People are crying here. They don’t believe it’s true.' Biden, who has provided crucial military aid to Israel but expressed exasperation over civilian deaths, announced the outline of the three-phase ceasefire agreement on May 31. The agreement eventually agreed to followed that framework. He said the first phase would last for six weeks and include a 'full and complete ceasefire,' a withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, older adults and wounded people, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Humanitarian assistance would surge, with hundreds of trucks entering Gaza each day. The second and most difficult phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. The third phase calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war. Hamas had been demanding assurances for a permanent end to the war and complete withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza. Israel, meanwhile, has repeatedly said it would not halt the war until it destroys Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. The various players have conducted months of on-again, off-again negotiations. But with Biden’s days in office numbered and President-elect Donald Trump set to take over, both sides had been under heavy pressure to agree to a deal. Trump celebrated the soon-to-be-announced agreement in a posting on his Truth Social social media platform: 'WE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!' Hezbollah’s acceptance of a ceasefire in Lebanon after it had suffered heavy blows, and the overthrow of President Bashar Assad in Syria, were both major setbacks for Iran and its allies across the region, including Hamas, which was left increasingly isolated. Israel has come under heavy international criticism, including from its closest ally, the United States, over the civilian toll. Israel says it has killed around 17,000 militants — though it has not provided evidence to support the claim. It also blames Hamas for the civilian casualties, accusing the group of using schools, hospitals and residential areas for military purposes. The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations brought by South Africa that Israel has committed genocide. The International Criminal Court, a separate body also based in The Hague, has issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense minister and a Hamas commander for war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the war. Israel and the United States have condemned the actions taken by both courts. Netanyahu also faced great domestic pressure to bring home the hostages, whose plight has captured the nation’s attention. Their families have become a powerful lobbying group with wide public support backed by months of mass protests urging the government to reach a deal with Hamas. Israeli authorities have already concluded that more than a third of the roughly 100 remaining people held captive are dead, and there are fears that others are no longer alive. A series of videos released by Hamas showing surviving hostages in distress, combined with news that a growing number of abducted Israelis have died, put added pressure on the Israeli leader. Hamas, a militant group that does not accept Israel’s existence, has come under overwhelming pressure from Israeli military operations, including the invasion of Gaza’s largest cities and towns and the takeover of the border between Gaza and Egypt. Its top leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who was believed to have helped mastermind the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, have been killed. But its fighters have regrouped in some of the hardest-hit areas after the withdrawal of Israeli forces, raising the prospect of a prolonged insurgency if the war continues. Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But it has never been clear what that would entail or if it’s even possible, given the group’s deep roots in Palestinian society, its presence in Lebanon and the occupied West Bank, and its exiled leadership. If the ceasefire takes hold, both sides face many difficult and unanswered questions. As the war winds down, Netanyahu will face growing calls for postwar investigations that could find him at least partially responsible for the security failures of Oct. 7 — the worst in Israel’s history. His far-right governing partners, who opposed a ceasefire deal, could also bring down the coalition and push the country into early elections. There is still no plan for who will govern Gaza after the war. Israel has said it will work with local Palestinians not affiliated with Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. But it is unclear if such partners exist, and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with Israeli forces. The United States has tried to advance sweeping postwar plans for a reformed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza with Arab and international assistance. As part of those plans, the U.S. hope Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel in return for U.S. security guarantees and aid in setting up a civilian nuclear program. But those plans depend on credible progress toward the creation of a Palestinian state, something Netanyahu and much of Israel’s political class oppose. Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control over Gaza as well as the occupied West Bank, territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war that the Palestinians want for their future state. In the absence of a postwar arrangement with Palestinian support, Hamas is likely to remain a significant force in Gaza and could reconstitute its military capabilities if Israeli forces fully withdraw.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/israel-and-hamas-agree-to-a-gaza-ceasefire-officials-say/	2025-01-15T09:13:56-08:00	
Hope and dread as Israelis and Palestinians await a Gaza truce th...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — With a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas tantalizingly close, families of hostages in the Gaza Strip are afraid to get their hopes up and agonizing over the unknown. 'These days are horrible for us,' Yafit Zailer said Wednesday, breaking down into sobs over the thought of her relatives — Shiri and Yarden Bibas and their two small children, Ariel and Kfir — being released after 15 months of captivity. 'I want to know already if they’re coming back,' Zailer said. 'I want to know already if they’re OK or not. I want to hold my cousin in my arms and celebrate the biggest celebration.' The United States, Egypt and Qatar have spent the past year trying to mediate an end to the war sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel and the release of dozens of hostages captured that day. Officials now say they are closer than ever to announcing an agreement. Even if a deal is reached, the torment experienced by families of the hostages and war-weary Palestinians in Gaza could be far from over. Families of the hostages do not know whether their loved ones are alive or dead, and many will have to wait for a subsequent phase of the agreement that has yet to be negotiated. In war-ravaged Gaza, many displaced Palestinians do not know if their homes are still standing, thousands are still buried under rubble and dozens are missing after encounters with Israeli forces. Vast areas appear uninhabitable, and it could take decades to rebuild. If talks over the second — and more difficult — phase of the emerging ceasefire deal break down, the war could resume, bringing even more death, destruction and displacement to Gaza and an even longer wait for families of the hostages. Do we plan for a funeral or a celebration? Shiri and Yarden Bibas and their two red-haired sons, 5-year-old Ariel and Kfir — who will turn 2 on Saturday — were among the roughly 250 hostages dragged into Gaza in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war, in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. Kfir, who was then 9 months old, was the youngest to be taken captive. The infant with red hair and a toothless smile, who has been in captivity for almost two thirds of his life, has become a symbol across Israel for the helplessness and anger over the hostages’ plight. Shiri, Ariel and Kfir were supposed to be released with other women and children during a ceasefire in November 2023, but it fell apart after a week. All four members of the family were on a list obtained by The Associated Press that named 33 hostages who could be released in the initial six-week phase of the draft agreement. 'I want to tell all the parties involved in the negotiations, it’s time to end this,' Zailer said, tears streaming down her face. 'It’s time to bring home our people, it’s time to end this war.' Daniel Lifshitz' 84-year-old grandfather, Oded, is being held captive in Gaza along with many of his friends. His grandmother was released shortly after the initial attack. As he waits for news, Lifshitz scrolls through his phone looking for updates and reaches out to the hostage negotiators for positive signs. The less they respond, the more optimistic things look, he said of his experience with them. But even the announcement of a deal would provide only some relief. 'Another roller coaster is coming — is he alive or not? Should I prepare (for) a funeral or should I prepare (for) a celebration?' said Lifshitz. It's something his family doesn't want to discuss. Some 100 hostages remain captive inside Gaza, a mix of civilians and soldiers, as well as around a dozen foreign nationals from Thailand, Nepal and Tanzania. The military believes at least a third of the remaining hostages — and up to half of them — are dead. The three-phased agreement would begin with the release of 33 women, children, older adults and wounded civilians in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian women and children imprisoned by Israel. Soldiers and other male captives would be released in the second phase. Herut Nimrodi's son, Tamir, was abducted from his army base on Oct. 7. The now 20-year-old soldier won't be included in the deal's first phase, and she worries that if the ceasefire doesn't hold, pressure to release the remaining hostages will decline because there will be fewer of them. Hamas says it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive until Hamas' military and governing abilities are destroyed. If no agreement is reached on the second phase, the war could resume this spring. 'We have no strength left’ For hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians living in squalid tent camps and fearing Israeli airstrikes, the end of the war cannot come soon enough. Previous breakdowns in the talks have been followed by renewed Israeli offensives. 'The best thing right now, immediately, without any delay, would be to stop everything and announce a truce,' said Sulaiman Qasem, a coordinator with a medical charity in Gaza City. 'Last night the shelling and bombing here didn’t stop for a moment ... It's absolute madness.' The war has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between fighters and civilians, but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. Israel’s offensive has reduced large areas of the strip to rubble and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million, leaving many at risk of famine. Rola Saqer's daughter was born on the first day of the war, and nearly every day since has been a struggle to find safety, food and health care. The family fled their apartment and was forced to live in a cramped tent with other relatives. Saqer said her daughter, Massa Zaqout, has difficulty walking and worries the lack of proper nutrients will affect her development. The proposed ceasefire deal includes a surge of humanitarian aid, and would allow Palestinians to start returning to their homes, assuming they still exist. 'We have no strength left,¨ said Rami Abu Shera, who was displaced from his home in Khan Younis. 'We are waiting for there to be no blood, no killings, no wounded, no destruction, no displacement. It is enough,' he said. ——- Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip.

US steps up Russia sanctions, placing threat of more sanctions on...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Treasury Department said Wednesday that it's expanding the web of sanctions on companies and institutions supporting Russia's war efforts in Ukraine, re-designating about 100 entities for sanctions and placing sanctions on 15 new entities. A senior Treasury Department official said that under the sanctions any company that does meaningful business with parts of Russia's military industrial complex would also face the risk of penalties. The official insisted on anonymity to preview the announcement on a call with reporters. The official said that removal of the sanctions would require congressional notification. That step could potentially make it harder for the incoming Republican Trump administration to adjust and change sanctions without drawing public scrutiny. The official stressed that there are new sanctions on 15 companies related to Russia and China that have worked together to avoid existing sanctions. Treasury is sanctioning the following Russian companies as being involved in this scheme: Herbarium Office Management, Atlant Torg, Sigma Partners, Tranzaktsii I Raschety, Arctur and Paylink Limited. It's also sanctioning Russian national Andrei Prikhodko, the general director of Herbarium. There are also sanctions on China-based companies: Anhui Hongsheng International Trade, Qingyuan Fo Feng Leda Supply Chain Service, Heilongjiang Shunsheng Economic And Trade Development, Qingdao Hezhi Business Service, Xinjiang Financial Import And Export, Hangzhou Xianghe Trading, Shaanxi Hongrun Jinhua Trading, Fujian Xinfuwang International Trade, and Jilin Province Shunda Trading Company. Separately, the Keremet Bank in Kyrgyzstan is being sanctioned for coordinating with Russian officials and a U.S. bank to evade sanctions. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, an assault that led to aggressive sanctioning by the U.S. and its allies and efforts by Russia and its partners to get around the financial restrictions. The Democratic Biden administration sees recent changes in the global oil market as making it easier to crack down on Russia's oil revenues without hurting global supplies. The Treasury Department announced last week that it was expanding sanctions against the Russian energy sector for its nearly 3-year-old war in Ukraine.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-steps-up-russia-sanctions-placing-threat-of-more-sanctions-on-businesses-partnering-with-russia/	2025-01-15T07:37:27-08:00	
Russian missile attack forces Ukraine to shut down power grid	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia on Wednesday launched a major ballistic and cruise missile attack on regions across Ukraine, targeting energy production and compelling authorities to shut down the power grid in some areas despite freezing winter weather, officials said. The Russian Defense Ministry said that it launched a strike on 'critically important facilities of gas and energy infrastructure that ensure the functioning of Ukraine’s military industrial complex.' It didn't give the target locations or other details. The barrage came a day after the Russian Defense Ministry vowed a response to what it said was an attack on Russian soil using multiple Western-supplied missiles. Kyiv hasn't confirmed that attack, though it said Tuesday that it hit an oil refinery and a fuel storage depot, a chemical plant producing ammunition and two anti-aircraft missile systems, in a missile and drone attack that reached around 1,100 kilometers (almost 700 miles) into Russia. Long-range attacks have been a feature of the nearly three-year war, where on the front line snaking about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from northeast to southern Ukraine, the armies have been engaged in a war of attrition. Russia has been advancing on the battlefield over the past year, though its progress has been slow and costly. Ukraine's defenses have been under severe pressure for months in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces are bent on capturing the key stronghold of Pokrovsk. The situation there is 'critically bad' as Russian forces are intent on cutting off the Dnipro highway, which is a vital supply route for Pokrovsk, Serhii Filimonov, commander of the 108th Separate Mechanized Battalion, told The Associated Press on Wednesday. Russia attacked Ukraine with 43 missiles and 74 drones before dawn Wednesday, the Ukrainian Air Force said. A total of 30 missiles and 47 drones were shot down, and 27 drones failed to reach their target, it said. The Russian missiles sought out targets from the Lviv region in western Ukraine near Poland to Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine bordering Russia. The state energy company Ukrenergo reported emergency power outages in six regions. It often shuts down production during attacks as a precaution. 'The enemy continues to terrorize Ukrainians,' Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. Electricity supplies resumed to households in some areas by the middle of the day, but Ukrenergo urged customers to avoid using power-hungry electrical appliances. Russia has repeatedly tried to cripple Ukraine’s power grid, denying the country heat, electricity and running water in an effort to break the Ukrainian spirit. The attacks have also sought to disrupt Ukraine’s defense manufacturing industry. Last September, the U.N. refugee agency reported that Ukraine had lost more than an estimated 60% of its energy generation capacity. Ukrainian authorities try to rebuild their power generation after the attack, though the barrages have eroded production. Western partners have been helping Ukraine rebuild. 'It is the middle of the winter, and Russia’s goal remains unchanged: our energy infrastructure,' Zelenskyy said on Telegram. He urged Western partners to accelerate the delivery to Ukraine of promised air defense weapons, emphasizing that 'promises have been made but not yet fully realized.' Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine each exchanged 25 prisoners of war under the latest swap brokered by the United Arab Emirates, officials said. ___ Samya Kullab contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russian-missile-attack-forces-ukraine-to-shut-down-power-grid/	2025-01-15T06:12:49-08:00	
Middle East latest: Palestinian prime minister says Palestinian A...	The Palestinian prime minister says it's unacceptable for any entity other than the Palestinian Authority to run the Gaza Strip in the future, as Israel and Hamas appear to be at the closest point yet to sealing a deal to end 15 months of war. 'While we’re waiting for the ceasefire, it’s important to stress that it will not be acceptable for any entity to govern Gaza Strip but the legitimate Palestinian leadership and the government of the State of Palestine,' Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa said Wednesday. He was visiting Norway, one of three European countries that formally recognized a Palestinian state in May. Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007, confining the Western-backed Palestinian Authority’s limited self-rule to parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The U.S. has called for a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern both the West Bank and Gaza ahead of eventual statehood, which the Israeli government opposes. Mustafa said 'any attempt to consolidate the separation between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, or creating transitional entities, will be rejected.' Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when militants stormed into southern Israel and killed about 1,200 people and abducted around 250. A third of the 100 hostages still held in Gaza are believed to be dead. The Israel Hamas-war has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to health authorities there. The Health Ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians, but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. Here's the latest: Norway says a ceasefire for Gaza is only the beginning of a long recovery OSLO, Norway — Norway’s foreign minister says it’s important to look ahead to the longer-term future as hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza rise. Espen Barth Eide said at an event in Oslo Wednesday attended by Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa that 'that it’s really the moment to deep dive into what will then happen next.' He cautioned that 'just the ceasefire can easily create the sense of vacuum, of unfulfilled hope. And the problems in Gaza would not be over. The divisions will not be over. The hatred would not be laid to rest if it was only a ceasefire.' Barth Eide said the international community expects 'that Israel understands that it’s time to move on and to help solve the long outstanding issue of Palestine. And of course, that our friends in Palestine also work effectively together to build a strong government and a strong capacity that all the Palestinian territories are united, so that both sides have a good partner in building peace.' Norway is one of three European countries that formally recognized a Palestinian state in May.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-palestinian-prime-minister-says-palestinian-authority-should-run-gaza-in-future/	2025-01-15T02:41:13-08:00	
Russia's top diplomat praises Trump's views on Ukraine conflict	MOSCOW (AP) — Russia’s top diplomat said Tuesday that Moscow is open for talks with President-elect Donald Trump and praised him for pointing to NATO's plan to embrace Ukraine as a root cause of the nearly 3-year-old conflict. Any prospective peace talks should involve broader arrangements for security in Europe, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at his annual news conference, while adding that Moscow is open to discussing security guarantees for Kyiv. Lavrov specifically praised Trump's comments earlier this month in which he said that NATO’s plans to open its doors to Ukraine had led to the hostilities. Trump said Russia had it 'written in stone' that Ukraine's membership in NATO should never be allowed, but the Biden administration had sought to expand the military alliance to Russia's doorstep. Trump added that, 'I could understand their feelings about that.' Trump's comments echoed Moscow’s rhetoric which has described its 'special military operation' in Ukraine launched in February 2022 as a response to planned NATO membership for Kyiv and an effort to protect Russian speakers. Ukraine and its allies have denounced Russia's action as an unprovoked act of aggression. 'NATO did exactly what it had promised not to do, and Trump said that,' Lavrov said. 'It marked the first such candid acknowledgement not only from a U.S. but any Western leader that NATO had lied when they signed numerous documents. They were used as a cover while NATO has expanded to our borders in violation of the agreements.' The West has dismissed that assessment. Before the conflict, Russia had demanded a legal guarantee that Ukraine be denied NATO entry, knowing the alliance has never excluded potential membership for any European country but had no immediate plan to start Ukraine down that road. Russia said NATO expansion would undermine its security, but Washington and its allies argued the alliance didn’t threaten Moscow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged his Western allies to invite Kyiv to join NATO, or, at the very least, offer comprehensive security guarantees that would prevent any future Russian attacks. The alliance’s 32 member countries say Ukraine will join one day, but not until the fighting ends. Trump has reaffirmed his intention to broker peace in Ukraine, declaring earlier this month that 'Putin wants to meet' and that such a meeting is being set up. In the past, he has criticized U.S. military aid for Ukraine and even vowed to end the conflict in a single day if elected. Lavrov emphasized that Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly declared his openness for talks with Trump, adding that Moscow looks forward to hearing Trump’s view on Ukraine after he takes office. Lavrov also praised comments by Trump's pick for national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who said Sunday it's unrealistic to expect that Ukraine could drive Russian forces 'from every inch of Ukrainian soil.' 'The very fact that people have increasingly started to mention the realities on the ground deserves welcome,' Lavrov said during his annual news conference un Moscow. In its final days, the Biden administration is providing Kyiv with as much military support as it can, aiming to put Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations. The U.S. also introduced new sanctions on Russia's oil industry. Lavrov described those efforts as an attempt by the Biden administration to 'slam the door' and leave a difficult legacy for Trump. 'The Democrats have a way of screwing things up for the incoming administration,' he said. He emphasized that any prospective peace talks must address Russia's security concerns and reflect a broad European security environment. 'Threats on the western flank, on our western borders, must be eliminated as one of the main reasons (of the conflict),' he said. 'They can probably be eliminated only in the context of some broader agreements.' He added that Moscow is also open to discuss security guarantees for Kyiv, 'for the country, which is now called Ukraine.' Lavrov was asked about Trump's comments in which he wouldn't rule out using force or economic pressure to make Greenland — a semiautonomous territory of Denmark — a part of the United States. Lavrov emphasized that the people of Greenland must be asked what they want. 'For a start, it's necessary to listen to the Greenlanders,' Lavrov said, noting that they have the right for self-determination if they believe that their interests aren't duly represented by Denmark.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russias-top-diplomat-praises-trumps-views-on-ukraine-conflict/	2025-01-14T10:56:49-08:00	
A look at the terms -- and tensions -- in the Israel-Hamas draft ...	CAIRO (AP) — If the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal goes according to the current draft, then fighting will stop in Gaza for 42 days, and dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be freed. In this first phase, Israeli troops will pull back to the edges of Gaza, and many Palestinians will be able to return to what remains of their homes as stepped-up aid flows in. The question is if the ceasefire will survive beyond that first phase. That will depend on even more negotiations meant to begin within weeks. In those talks, Israel, Hamas, and the U.S, Egyptian and Qatari mediators will have to tackle the tough issue of how Gaza will be governed, with Israel demanding the elimination of Hamas. Without a deal within those 42 days to begin the second phase, Israel could resume its campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas – even as dozens of hostages remain in the militants’ hands. Hamas has agreed to a draft of the ceasefire deal, two officials confirmed, but Israeli officials say details are still being worked out, meaning some terms could change, or the whole deal could even fall through. Here is a look at the plan and potential pitfalls in the draft seen by the Associated Press. Swapping hostages for imprisoned Palestinians During the first phase, Hamas is to release 33 hostages in exchange for the freeing of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. By the end of the phase, all living women, children and older people held by the militants should be freed. Some 100 hostages remain captive inside Gaza, a mix of civilians and soldiers, and the military believes at least a third them are dead. On the first official day of the ceasefire, Hamas is to free three hostages, then another four on the seventh day. After that, it will make weekly releases. Which hostages and how many Palestinians will be released is complicated. The 33 will include women, children and those over 50 – almost all civilians, but the deal also commits Hamas to free all living female soldiers. Hamas will release living hostages first, but if the living don’t complete the 33 number, bodies will be handed over. Not all hostages are held by Hamas, so getting other militant groups to hand them over could be an issue. In exchange, Israel will free 30 Palestinian women, children or elderly for each living civilian hostage freed. For each female soldier freed, Israel will release 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 serving life sentences. In exchange for bodies handed over by Hamas, Israel will free all women and children it has detained from Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. Dozens of men, including soldiers, will remain captive in Gaza, pending the second phase. Israeli pullbacks and the return of Palestinians During the proposed deal's first phase, Israeli troops are to pull back into a buffer zone about a kilometer (0.6 miles) wide inside Gaza along its borders with Israel. That will allow displaced Palestinians to return to their homes, including in Gaza City and northern Gaza. With most of Gaza’s population driven into massive, squalid tent camps, Palestinians are desperate to get back to their homes, even though many were destroyed or heavily damaged by Israel’s campaign. But there are complications. During the past year of negotiations, Israel has insisted it must control the movement of Palestinians to the north to ensure Hamas does not take weapons back into those areas. Throughout the war, the Israeli military has severed the north from the rest of Gaza by holding the so-called Netzarim Corridor, a belt across the strip where troops cleared out the Palestinian population and set up bases. That allowed them to search people fleeing from the north into central Gaza and bar anyone trying to return. The draft seen by the AP specifies that Israel is to leave the corridor. In the first week, troops would withdraw from the main north-south coastal road – Rasheed Street – which would open one route for Palestinians returning. By the 22nd day of the ceasefire, Israeli troops are to leave the entire corridor. Still, as talks continued Tuesday, an Israeli official insisted the military will keep control of Netzarim and that Palestinians returning north would have to pass inspections there, though he declined to provide details. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss closed negotiations. Working out those contradictions could bring frictions. Throughout the first phase, Israel will retain control of the Philadelphi Corridor, the strip of territory along Gaza’s border with Egypt, including the Rafah Crossing. Hamas dropped demands that Israel pull out of this area. Humanitarian aid In the first phase, aid entry to Gaza is to be ramped up to hundreds of trucks a day of food, medicine, supplies and fuel to alleviate the humanitarian crisis. That is far more than Israel has allowed in throughout the war. For months, aid groups have struggled to distribute to Palestinians even the trickle of aid entering Gaza because of Israeli military restrictions and rampant robberies of aid trucks by gangs. An end to fighting should alleviate that. The need is great. Malnutrition and diseases are rampant among Palestinians, crammed into tents and short on food and clean water. Hospitals have been damaged and short of supplies. The draft deal specifies that equipment will be allowed in to build shelters for tens of thousands whose homes were destroyed and to rebuild infrastructure like electricity, sewage, communications and road systems. But here, too, implementation could bring problems. Even before the war, Israel has restricted entry of some equipment, arguing it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. Another Israeli official said arrangements are still being worked out over aid distribution and cleanup, but the plan is to prevent Hamas from having any role. Further complicating matters, Israel's government is still committed to its plan to ban UNRWA from operating and to cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. The UN agency is the major distributor of aid in Gaza and provides education, health and other basic services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region, including in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The second phase If all of that works out, the sides must still tackle the second phase. Negotiations over it are to begin on Day 16 of the ceasefire. Phase two's broad outlines are laid out in the draft: All remaining hostages are to be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But that seemingly basic exchange opens up much bigger issues. Israel has said it will not agree to a complete withdrawal until Hamas’ military and political capabilities are eliminated and it cannot rearm – ensuring Hamas no longer runs Gaza. Hamas says it will not hand over the last hostages until Israel removes all troops from everywhere in Gaza. So the negotiations will have to get both sides to agree to an alternative for governing Gaza. Effectively, Hamas has to agree to its own removal from power – something it has said it is willing to do, but it may seek to keep a hand in any future government, which Israel has vehemently rejected. The draft agreement says a deal on the second phase must be worked out by the end of the first. Pressure will be on both sides to reach a deal, but what happens if they don’t? It could go in many directions. Hamas had wanted written guarantees that a ceasefire would continue as long as needed to agree on phase two. It has settled for verbal guarantees from the United States, Egypt and Qatar. Israel, however, has given no assurances. So Israel could threaten new military action to pressure Hamas in the negotiations or could outright resume its military campaign, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened. Hamas and the mediators are betting the momentum from the first phase will make it difficult for him to do that. Relaunching the assault would risk losing the remaining hostages – infuriating many against Netanyahu – though stopping short of destroying Hamas will also anger key political partners. The third phase is likely to be less contentious: the bodies of remaining hostages would be returned in exchange for a 3- to 5-year reconstruction plan to be carried out in Gaza under international supervision.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-a-look-at-the-terms-and-tensions-in-the-israel-hamas-draft-ceasefire-deal/	2025-01-14T09:27:52-08:00	
Hamas has accepted a draft agreement for a Gaza ceasefire and the...	CAIRO (AP) — Hamas has accepted a draft agreement for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of dozens of hostages, two officials involved in the talks said Tuesday. Mediator Qatar said the negotiations were at the 'closest point' yet to sealing a deal. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the proposed agreement, and an Egyptian official and a Hamas official confirmed its authenticity. An Israeli official said progress has been made, but the details are being finalized. The plan would need to be submitted to the Israeli Cabinet for final approval. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have spent the past year trying to mediate an end the 15-month war and secure the release dozens of hostages captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered it. Some 100 Israelis are still captive inside Gaza, and the military believes at least a third them are dead. Officials have expressed mounting optimism that they can conclude an agreement ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose Mideast envoy has joined the negotiations. Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said at a weekly briefing Tuesday that the ongoing negotiations are positive and productive, while declining to get into the details of the sensitive talks. 'Today, we are at the closest point ever to having a deal,' he said. Hamas, meanwhile, said in a statement that the ongoing negotiations had reached their 'final stage.' The offensive has reduced large areas of the territory to rubble and displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, with hundreds of thousands packed into tent camps along the coast where hunger is widespread. Israeli strikes across Gaza overnight and into Tuesday killed at least 18 Palestinians, including two women and four children, while Yemen's Houthi rebels fired two missiles at Israel, setting off sirens and sending people racing into shelters. No one was wounded by the projectiles. A three-phase agreement The three-phase agreement — based on a framework laid out by U.S. President Joe Biden and endorsed by the U.N. Security Council — would begin with the gradual release of 33 hostages over a six-week period, including women, children, older adults and wounded civilians in exchange for potentially hundreds of Palestinian women and children imprisoned by Israel. Among the 33 would be five female Israeli soldiers, each of whom would be released in exchange for 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 convicted militants who are serving life sentences. By the end of the first phase, all civilian captives — living or dead — will have been released. During this first, 42-day phase, Israeli forces would withdraw from population centers, Palestinians would be allowed to start returning to their homes in northern Gaza and there would be a surge of humanitarian aid, with some 600 trucks entering each day. Details of the second phase still must be negotiated during the first. Those details remain difficult to resolve — and the deal does not include written guarantees that the ceasefire will continue until a deal is reached. That leaves the potential for Israel to resume its military campaign after the first phase ends. The three mediators, however, have given Hamas verbal guarantees that negotiations will continue as planned and that they will press for a deal to implement the second and third phases before the end of the first, the Egyptian official said. The deal would allow Israel throughout the first phase to remain in control of the Philadelphi Corridor, the band of territory along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas had initially demanded Israel withdraw from. But Israel would pull out from the Netzarim Corridor, a belt across central Gaza where it had sought a mechanism for searching Palestinians for arms when they return to the territory's north. In the second phase, Hamas would release the remaining living captives, mainly male soldiers, in exchange for more prisoners and the 'complete withdrawal' of Israeli forces from Gaza, according to the draft agreement. But Hamas has said it will not free the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in the past vowed to resume fighting unless Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are eliminated. Unless an alternative government for Gaza is worked out in those talks, it could leave Hamas in charge of the territory. In a third phase, the bodies of remaining hostages would be returned in exchange for a three- to five-year reconstruction plan to be carried out in Gaza under international supervision. Growing pressure ahead of Trump's inauguration Israel and Hamas have come under renewed pressure to halt the conflict in the lead-up to Trump's inauguration next week. His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, recently joined U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators in the Gulf country’s capital, Doha. Trump said late Monday that a ceasefire was 'very close.' 'I understand ... there’s been a handshake and they are getting it finished -- and maybe by the end of the week,' he told the American cable channel Newsmax. Hamas has blamed Israel for the repeated setbacks in the negotiations, saying that on more than one occasion, the militant group had accepted a proposal from mediators only to see Israel reject it or launch a new military operation immediately afterwards. Israel and its close ally the United States have blamed setbacks on Hamas. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted another 250. Around half those hostages were freed during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Strikes in Gaza continue Two strikes in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah overnight and into Tuesday killed two women and their four children, who ranged in age from 1 month to 9 years old. One of the women was pregnant and the baby did not survive, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. Another 12 people were killed in two strikes on the southern city of Khan Younis, according to the European Hospital. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel says it only targets militants and accuses them of hiding among civilians in shelters and tent camps for the displaced. Yemeni rebels fire missiles at Israel The war has rippled across the region, igniting over a year of fighting between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militants that ended with a tense ceasefire in November. Israel has also traded direct fire with Iran, which backs Hamas, Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthis. The Israeli military said it made several attempts to intercept the missile launched from Yemen early Tuesday and that 'the missile was likely intercepted.' It said an earlier missile fired from Yemen was also intercepted. Police said several homes were damaged outside Jerusalem and released a photo of a missile casing that had crashed into a roof. The Houthis, who captured Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and much of the country's north in 2014, have launched a series of missile and drone attacks on Israel and have attacked international shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis say they are fighting in solidarity with the Palestinians, but the vast majority of the targeted ships have no connection to the conflict. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip.

Middle East latest: Israeli strikes kill 18 in Gaza, medics say, ...	Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 18 people overnight, including women and children, health officials said Tuesday, as Israel and Hamas appeared to be narrowing in on a ceasefire deal to end the 15-month war and release dozens of hostages. Two officials involved in the talks told The Associated Press that Hamas has accepted a draft agreement for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of dozens of hostages. An Israeli official said progress has been made, but the details are being finalized. Two strikes in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah killed two women and their four children, who ranged in age from 1 month to 9 years old.

Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when militants stormed into southern Israel and killed about 1,200 people and abducted around 250. A third of the 100 hostages still held in Gaza are believed to be dead. The Israel Hamas-war has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to health authorities there. The Health Ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians, but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. ___ Here’s the latest: Qatar says Israel and Hamas are their ‘closest point’ yet to a ceasefire deal in Gaza CAIRO — Qatar says Israel and Hamas are at the 'closest point' yet to agreeing on a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of dozens of hostages. Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said at a weekly briefing Tuesday that the ongoing negotiations are positive and productive, while declining to get into the details of the sensitive talks. Qatar has been a key mediator with Hamas in over a year of indirect talks and is currently hosting the negotiations. Hamas has accepted a draft agreement for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of dozens of hostages, two officials involved in the talks told The Associated Press. An Israeli official said progress has been made, but the details are being finalized. Trump says a possible ceasefire deal for Gaza is ‘very close’ President-elect Donald Trump has described a possible ceasefire for Gaza as being 'very close.' 'I understand ... there’s been a handshake and they are getting it finished -- and maybe by the end of the week,' Trump told the American cable channel Newsmax Monday night. He added that part of the deal would see 'bodies' brought out of the Gaza Strip, without elaborating. Israel and Hamas are under renewed pressure to halt the conflict in the lead-up to Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. The phased deal would be based on a framework laid out by President Joe Biden in May and endorsed by the U.N. Security Council. A missile fired by Houthi rebels targets central Israel JERUSALEM — A missile fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted central Israel early Tuesday, causing sirens to blare and people to flee into bomb shelters. Several Israeli strikes also hit the Gaza Strip overnight and early on Tuesday. The Israeli military said it made several attempts to intercept a missile launched from Yemen and 'the missile was likely intercepted.' The Magen David Adom emergency service in Israel said there were no injuries from the missile or falling debris, but some people suffered injuries when running to shelters. Israeli police said several homes outside Jerusalem were damaged by fallen debris and released a photo of what appeared to be a missile casing on the roof of a house. Israel’s military also said an earlier missile was intercepted before it entered Israeli territory. Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who have held Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, since 2014, have launched direct attacks on Israel and some 100 commercial ships as part of their campaign over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis acknowledged the attack early Tuesday.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-strikes-kill-18-in-gaza-including-women-and-children-medics-say/	2025-01-14T03:05:57-08:00	
Zelenskyy, Macron discuss Western troop deployment in Ukraine bef...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he has held further discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron about the possibility of Western troops deploying in Ukraine to safeguard any peace deal ending the nearly three-year war with Russia. Zelenskyy’s disclosure came before an official visit to Kyiv on Tuesday by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. He arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit following a meeting in Warsaw on Monday with his counterparts from France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Poland. Germany and the four other countries are Europe’s five top military spenders. Pistorius told German news agency dpa that his visit to Kyiv aims to underscore Germany’s strong support for Ukraine at a time when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s term beginning next week looks set to bring deep changes to Washington’s policy on the war. Pistorius said that his visit 'is a signal that Germany, as the biggest NATO country in Europe, stands by Ukraine — not alone, but with the group of five and many other allies.' Trump has criticized the cost of the war for U.S. taxpayers through major military aid packages for Ukraine, and vowed to bring the conflict to a swift end. He also has made it clear that he wants to shift more of the Ukraine burden onto Europe. Macron prompted an outcry from other leaders, and he appeared isolated on the European stage, after his remarks almost a year ago floated the possibility of putting Western troops in Ukraine. Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine needs security guarantees to bolster any peace agreement — an issue he said late Monday that he discussed with the French leader. 'As one of these guarantees, we discussed the French initiative to deploy military contingents in Ukraine,' Zelenskyy said. 'We considered practical steps for its implementation, possible expansion and involvement of other countries in this process.' Potentially sending European troops as peacekeepers to Ukraine is fraught with risk. Such a move may not deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again in the future, which is the fear of Ukrainian officials, and could drag European countries into a direct confrontation with Moscow. That, in turn, could pull NATO — including the United States — into a conflict. Russia’s bigger army has largely pinned Ukrainian forces on the defensive along the around 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. Ukraine’s defenses are creaking in the eastern Donetsk region amid a Russian onslaught. Ukraine has built up a domestic arsenal of long-range drones and missiles that it uses to hit targets on Russian soil far behind the front line. The targets are usually infrastructure that supports the Russian war effort, such as arms depots, oil refineries and manufacturing plants. Two industrial facilities in Russia’s western Saratov region were damaged after a 'massive' Ukrainian drone attack, regional Gov. Roman Busargin said Tuesday. He claimed that Russian air defenses downed 'a large number' of drones and said that there were no casualties, offering no further details. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-zelenskyy-macron-discuss-western-troop-deployment-in-ukraine-before-german-defense-chief-visits/	2025-01-14T02:39:46-08:00	
Some Israeli soldiers refuse to keep fighting in Gaza	JERUSALEM (AP) — Yotam Vilk says the image of Israeli soldiers killing an unarmed Palestinian teenager in the Gaza Strip is seared in his mind. An officer in the armored corps, Vilk said the instructions were to shoot any unauthorized person who entered an Israeli-controlled buffer zone in Gaza. He saw at least 12 people killed, he said, but it is the shooting of the teen that he can’t shake. 'He died as part of a bigger story. As part of the policy of staying there and not seeing Palestinians as people,' Vilk, 28, told The Associated Press. Vilk is among a growing number of Israeli soldiers speaking out against the 15-month conflict and refusing to serve anymore, saying they saw or did things that crossed ethical lines. While the movement is small — some 200 soldiers signed a letter saying they’d stop fighting if the government didn't secure a ceasefire — soldiers say it’s the tip of the iceberg and they want others to come forward. Their refusal comes at a time of mounting pressure on Israel and Hamas to wind down the fighting. Ceasefire talks are underway, and both President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have called for a deal by the Jan. 20 inauguration. Seven soldiers who've refused to continue fighting in Gaza spoke with AP, describing how Palestinians were indiscriminately killed and houses destroyed. Several said they were ordered to burn or demolish homes that posed no threat, and they saw soldiers loot and vandalize residences. Soldiers are required to steer clear of politics, and they rarely speak out against the army. After Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel quickly united behind the war launched against the militant group. Divisions here have grown as the war progresses, but most criticism has focused on the mounting number of soldiers killed and the failure to bring home hostages, not actions in Gaza. International rights groups have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide in Gaza. The International Court of Justice is investigating genocide allegations filed by South Africa. The International Criminal Court is seeking the arrests of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. Israel adamantly rejects genocide allegations and says it takes extraordinary measures to minimize civilian harm in Gaza. The army says it never intentionally targets civilians, and investigates and punishes cases of suspected wrongdoing. But rights groups have long said the army does a poor job of investigating itself. The army told AP it condemns the refusal to serve and takes any call for refusal seriously, with each case examined individually. Soldiers can go to jail for refusing to serve, but none who signed the letter has been detained, according to those who organized the signatures. Soldiers' reactions in Gaza When Vilk entered Gaza in November 2023, he said, he thought the initial use of force might bring both sides to the table. But as the war dragged on, he said he saw the value of human life disintegrate. On the day the Palestinian teenager was killed last August, he said, Israeli troops shouted at him to stop and fired warning shots at his feet, but he kept moving. He said others were also killed walking into the buffer zone — the Netzarim Corridor, a road dividing northern and southern Gaza. Vilk acknowledged it was hard to determine whether people were armed, but said he believes soldiers acted too quickly. In the end, he said, Hamas is to blame for some deaths in the buffer zone — he described one Palestinian detained by his unit who said Hamas paid people $25 to walk into the corridor to gauge the army's reaction. Some soldiers told AP it took time to digest what they saw in Gaza. Others said they became so enraged they decided they'd stop serving almost immediately. Yuval Green, a 27-year-old medic, described abandoning his post last January after spending nearly two months in Gaza, unable to live with what he’d seen. He said soldiers desecrated homes, using black markers meant for medical emergencies to scribble graffiti, and looted homes, looking for prayer beads to collect as souvenirs. The final straw, he said, was his commander ordering troops to burn down a house, saying he didn’t want Hamas to be able to use it. Green said he sat in a military vehicle, choking on fumes amid the smell of burning plastic. He found the fire vindictive — he said he saw no reason to take more from Palestinians than they’d already lost. He left his unit before their mission was complete. Green said that as much as he loathed what he witnessed, 'the cruelty was at least in part provoked by the havoc wreaked by Hamas on Oct. 7, which people can forget.' He said he wants his actions in refusing to serve to help break the vicious cycle of violence on all sides. The soldiers' refusal as an act of protest Soldiers for the Hostages — the group behind the letter troops signed — is trying to garner momentum, holding an event this month in Tel Aviv and gathering more signatures. A panel of soldiers spoke about what they'd seen in Gaza. Organizers distributed poster-size stickers with a Martin Luther King Jr. quote: 'One has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.' Max Kresch, an organizer, said soldiers can use their positions to create change. 'We need to use our voice to speak up in the face of injustice, even if that is unpopular,' he said. But some who fought and lost colleagues call the movement a slap in the face. More than 830 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the war, according to the army. 'They are harming our ability to defend ourselves,' said Gilad Segal, a 42-year-old paratrooper who spent two months in Gaza at the end of 2023. He said everything the army did was necessary, including the flattening of houses used as Hamas hideouts. It’s not a soldier’s place to agree or disagree with the government, he argued. Ishai Menuchin, spokesperson for Yesh Gvul, a movement for soldiers refusing to serve, said he works with more than 80 soldiers who have refused to fight and that there are hundreds more who feel similarly but remain silent. Effects on soldiers Some of the soldiers who spoke to AP said they feel conflicted and regretful, and they're talking to friends and relatives about what they saw to process it. Many soldiers suffer from 'moral injury,' said Tuly Flint, a trauma therapy specialist who's counseled hundreds of them during the war. It's a response when people see or do something that goes against their beliefs, he said, and it can result in a lack of sleep, flashbacks and feelings of unworthiness. Talking about it and trying to spark change can help, Flint said. One former infantry soldier told AP about his feelings of guilt — he said he saw about 15 buildings burned down unnecessarily during a two-week stint in late 2023. He said that if he could do it all over again, he wouldn’t have fought. 'I didn’t light the match, but I stood guard outside the house. I participated in war crimes,' said the soldier, speaking on condition of anonymity over fears of retaliation. 'I’m so sorry for what we’ve done.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-some-israeli-soldiers-refuse-to-keep-fighting-in-gaza/	2025-01-13T18:10:17-08:00	
Russian forces bypass a key stronghold in a bid to cut off its su...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces are bypassing a key stronghold in eastern Ukraine that they have fought for months to capture and are focusing instead on cutting supply lines to it, a Ukrainian official said Monday. Russian troops are going around the vital logistics hub of Pokrovsk, where a steadfast Ukrainian defense has kept them at bay, and are taking aim at a highway that leads from there to the central Ukraine city of Dnipro, Maj. Viktor Trehubov, a local Ukrainian army spokesperson, told The Associated Press. That route is crucial for supplies feeding Ukrainian forces in the entire region. Cutting the highway traffic would also severely weaken Pokrovsk. 'So far, they have not achieved their goal and (Ukrainian forces) are working to ensure that they do not achieve it in the future — just as they have not been successful in other attempts to bypass the city,' Trehubov said in a WhatsApp message. Ukraine’s army is under severe strain along parts of the approximately 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where Pokrovsk is located. After almost three years of war, Ukrainian units are depleted and are outnumbered by Russian forces. Though its battlefield progress has been slow and costly, momentum in the war is in Russia’s favor and its onslaught has gradually swallowed up towns and villages, especially in Donetsk. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Monday its forces had seized the village of Pishchane. In his daily video address to the nation late Sunday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said fighting around Pokrovsk was 'the most intense' in recent days. In separate comments to local medida, Trehubov, the army spokesperson, speculated that Russia's heavy losses of troops and armor in the Donetsk operation had prompted it to alter its strategy. 'Now they are acting more cautiously,' he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin is pressing his advantage ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s arrival in the White House next week. Trump says he wants to bring a swift end to the war, though he hasn’t publicized details of his plans. In 2022, Moscow illegally annexed the Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk regions, which make up the economically important Donbas industrial area, together with the southeastern provinces of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. But Russian forces don’t fully control any of them. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russian-forces-bypass-a-key-stronghold-in-a-bid-to-cut-off-its-supplies-a-ukrainian-officer-says/	2025-01-13T07:36:05-08:00	
Middle East latest: Gaza ceasefire talks press on in Qatar	Israel and Hamas appear to be inching closer to a phased ceasfire agreement, officials said Monday. But a deal hasn't been reached yet, and there are a number of obstacles that could still scupper the talks in Qatar. The war in Gaza has ground on for more than 15 months, starting on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel and killed about 1,200 people, and abducted around 250. A third of the 100 hostages still held in Gaza are believed to be dead. More than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza health authorities, which don't distinguish between fighters and civilians. Here's the latest: Woman protests against Israel at campaign event in Germany BIELEFELD, Germany — A woman protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza has briefly disrupted an election campaign event by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, standing up and smearing her face and hood with a blood-colored substance. Germany is a staunch ally of Israel. Scholz responded to the disruption on Monday by saying: 'The answer is that it was a terrible terrorist attack by Hamas on Israeli citizens over a year ago. It is right that the state of Israel can defend itself against this attack.' He said that Germany has always been clear in its support for a two-state solution and that international law must be adhered to. The woman was escorted out of the hall in the western city of Bielefeld, shouting 'genocide,' 'Free Palestine' and 'Over 200 dead journalists.' Potential obstacles to a Israel-Hamas agreement Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect talks for more than a year aimed at ending the war in Gaza and returning scores of militant-held hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. There has been intensive mediation by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. But the talks have repeatedly stalled over several key issues. They include details of the exchange, whether the ceasefire would be permanent and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. The war has ground on as each side has accused the other of backtracking. — By Joseph Krauss. ___ Progress made in ceasefire talks and hostage release, officials say CAIRO — U.S. and Arab mediators made significant progress overnight toward brokering a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of scores of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, but a deal hasn’t been reached yet, officials said Monday. Three officials acknowledged that progress has been made and said the coming days would be critical for ending more than 15 months of fighting that has destabilized the Middle East. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the talks. One of the three officials and a Hamas official said that there were still a number of hurdles to clear. On several occasions over the past year, U.S. officials have said that they were on the verge of reaching a deal, only to have the talks stall. — By Victoria Eastwood and Samy Magdy in Cairo, and Josef Federman in Jerusalem. ___ UAE delegation in Lebanon for embassy talks BEIRUT — The state news agency of the United Arab Emirates says a high-level delegation from the oil-rich nation is in Beirut to undertake all necessary arrangements to reopen the UAE Embassy in Lebanon. Monday’s move came days after Lebanon’s army commander, Gen. Joseph Aoun, was elected president ending a 26-month vacuum in the country’s top job. The UAE withdrew its diplomats from Lebanon in October 2021 in protest to comments by a Lebanese Cabinet minister about the war in Yemen. Aoun spoke by telephone with the president of the UAE over the weekend who told him the embassy will resume work in Beirut, according to Aoun’s office. His election is likely to improve Lebanon’s cold relations with oil-rich gulf Arab nations. Ties have been tense for years because of Iran’s influence in the small Mediterranean nation.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-gaza-ceasefire-talks-press-on-in-qatar/	2025-01-13T04:26:14-08:00

Seoul's spy agency says North Korean soldiers captured in Ukraine...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers on Monday that two North Korean soldiers who were captured by Ukrainian forces while fighting alongside Russian forces in Russia’s Kursk border region haven’t expressed a desire to seek asylum in South Korea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he’s willing to hand over the soldiers to North Korea if the country’s authoritarian leader, Kim Jong Un, arranges for an exchange with Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russia. Zelenskyy said one of the North Korean soldiers wishes to stay in Ukraine while the other wants to return to his country, which was consistent with interview videos released by his government. 'If Kim Jong Un even remembers these citizens of his and is capable of organizing an exchange for our warriors being held in Russia, we are ready to transfer such soldiers. Undoubtedly there will be more POWs from North Korea,' Zelenskyy said in an address late Sunday. He said in a separate posting on the social media platform X that 'there may be other options' for North Korean prisoners who don't wish to go back. In a closed-door briefing at South Korea’s National Assembly, the National Intelligence Service confirmed its participation in the questioning of the North Korean soldiers by Ukrainian authorities. The agency said the soldiers haven’t expressed a request to resettle in South Korea, according to two lawmakers who attended the meeting. The agency said it was willing to discuss the matter with Ukrainian authorities if the soldiers eventually do ask to go to South Korea. About 34,000 North Koreans have defected to capitalist rival South Korea to avoid economic hardship and political suppression at home, mostly since the late 1990s. Koo Byoungsam, spokesperson of South Korea’s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said facilitating the asylum of the North Korean soldiers would require 'legal reviews, including on international law, and consultations with related nations.' 'There’s nothing we can say at the current stage,' Koo said. Seoul says about 300 North Korean troops killed in combat Seoul’s spy agency believes that about 300 North Korean soldiers have died and another 2,700 have been injured while fighting against Ukrainian forces, in what represents North Korea's first involvement in large-scale conflict since the 1950-53 Korean War. The agency assessed that the North Koreans are struggling to adapt to drones and other elements of modern warfare. They are further disadvantaged by the crude tactics of their Russian commanders, who have thrown them in assault campaigns without providing rear-fire support, according to Lee Seong Kweun, a lawmaker who attended the agency’s briefing. The agency said memos found on dead North Korean soldiers indicated that they had been ordered to commit suicide before being captured, according to Lee. The agency said one North Korean soldier, facing the threat of being captured by Ukrainian forces, shouted 'General Kim Jong Un' and tried to detonate a hand grenade before he was shot and killed. Zelenskyy confirmed the capture of the North Korean soldiers on Saturday, days after Ukraine, facing a slow Russian onslaught in the east, began pressing new attacks in Kursk to retain ground captured in a lightning incursion in August — the first occupation of Russian territory since World War II. Moscow’s counterattack has left Ukrainian forces outstretched and demoralized, killing and wounding thousands and retaking more than 40% of the 984 square kilometers (380 square miles) of Kursk that Ukraine had seized. North Koreans struggle to adapt to Kursk terrain, modern warfare Moon Seong Mook, a retired South Korean brigadier general, said the high death toll for North Korean soldiers was predictable, as they would not have been sufficiently prepared for an unfamiliar mission in the terrain of the Kursk region, which is vastly different from North Korea’s mountainous landscape. Another disadvantage for the North Koreans is that they are not conducting independent operations but are being thrust into combat under Russian commanders, possibly struggling with unfamiliar tactics and communication issues due to language barriers, said Moon, who has taken part in numerous military talks with North Korea. The North Korean forces could be operating special surveillance teams to arrest or execute attempted deserters, he said. 'The current battlefield environment, combined with drones and other technologies, have created situations North Korean soldiers have never encountered before,' Moon said. 'They are also being deployed in large numbers in wide-open fields, where there is no place to hide, in continuous battles to retake the area, and that seems to be where the casualties are coming from.' North Korea’s decadeslong financial troubles, which have forced many soldiers to grow their own food or spend long hours deployed in construction and other work to sustain the national economy, could also have impacted the quality of training they receive at home, Moon said. Still, there are concerns in Seoul that North Korea’s participation in the Ukraine crisis poses a significant threat to South Korea, as North Korean forces may gain crucial combat experience and Russia may provide technology transfers that could enhance North Korea’s nuclear-armed army. __ Associated Press writer Samya Kullab in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-seouls-spy-agency-says-north-korean-soldiers-captured-in-ukraine-havent-shown-desire-to-defect/	2025-01-13T02:39:49-08:00	
Progress made in talks over Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage re...	CAIRO (AP) — U.S. and Arab mediators made significant progress overnight toward brokering a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of scores of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, but a deal hasn't been reached yet, officials said Monday. Three officials acknowledged that progress has been made and said the coming days would be critical for ending more than 15 months of fighting that has destabilized the Middle East. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the talks. One of the three officials and a Hamas official said that there were still a number of hurdles to clear. On several occasions over the past year, U.S. officials have said that they were on the verge of reaching a deal, only to have the talks stall. One person familiar with the talks said there had been a breakthrough overnight and that there was a proposed deal on the table. Israeli and Hamas negotiators will now take it back to their leaders for final approval, the person said. The person said that mediators from the Gulf country of Qatar had put renewed pressure on Hamas to accept the agreement, while U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, was pressing the Israelis. Witkoff recently joined the negotiations and has been in the region in recent days. The person said that the mediators had handed off the draft deal to each side and that the next 24 hours would be pivotal. An Egyptian official said that there had been good progress overnight, but that it would likely take a few more days, and that the sides were aiming for a deal before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. A third official said that the talks were in a good place, but hadn't been wrapped up. That official also assessed that a deal was possible before the inauguration. Asked about the talks at a press conference, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said 'progress has been made, and I hope that within a short time we will see things happening. But it is still to be proved.' A Hamas official said a number of contentious issues still need to be resolved, including an Israeli commitment to ending the war and details about the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the hostage-prisoner exchange. The official wasn't authorized to brief media and spoke anonymously. The Egyptian official confirmed that those issues were still being discussed. Months of negotiations have repeatedly stalled The Biden administration, along with Egypt and Qatar, has spent more than a year trying to broker an agreement to end the deadliest war ever fought between Israelis and Palestinians and secure the release of scores of hostages captured in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the conflict. But the sides have been divided over the details of the planned exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, as well as the nature of the ceasefire itself. Hamas has said that it won't release the remaining captives without an end to the war, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the campaign until 'total victory' over the militant group. Under discussion now is a phased ceasefire. Netanyahu has repeatedly signaled that he is committed only to the first phase, a partial hostage release in exchange for a weekslong halt in fighting. The possibility of a lasting ceasefire and other issues would be negotiated after the first phase begins. Hamas has demanded a full withdrawal and complete end to the war, and is hoping that this first phase will lead to that outcome. A deal could weaken Netanyahu’s coalition, which includes two far-right factions that have threatened to leave the government if Israel makes too many concessions. Members of the opposition have promised to give Netanyahu the support that he needs to approve a hostage release, but the hardliners' anger could be a source of instability down the road. Netanyahu is hoping that the prospect of a Trump administration — which includes allies of the West Bank settler movement — will persuade his partners to remain in the government. U.S. President Joe Biden, who hopes to wrap up a deal before leaving office next week, spoke with Netanyahu about the talks on Sunday. The head of Israel’s Mossad foreign intelligence agency, David Barnea, and Biden’s top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, were both in the Qatari capital, Doha. Barnea’s presence meant high-level Israeli officials who would need to sign off on any agreement are once again involved in the talks. McGurk has been working on final details of a text to be presented to both sides, Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CNN’s 'State of the Union.' But he said that he would not predict whether a deal can be reached by Jan. 20. 'We are very, very close,' he said. 'Yet being very close still means we’re far, because until you actually get across the finish line, we’re not there.' Palestinians and families of the hostages hope for a deal Just one brief ceasefire has been achieved during the war, and that was in the earliest weeks of fighting. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that a deal is 'very close' and he hoped to complete it before handing over diplomacy to the incoming Trump administration. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, the majority women and children, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, whose count doesn't give a breakdown between fighters and civilians. Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others in the attack that ignited the war. Families of the roughly 100 hostages still held in Gaza are pressing Netanyahu to reach a deal to bring their loved ones home. Israelis rallied again Saturday night in Tel Aviv, with photos of hostages on display. In Gaza, Palestinians were tempering their hopes for a stop to Israel’s campaign, which has devastated much of the territory and driven around 90% of its 2.3 million people from their homes. 'We hear that there are negotiations every day, but we see nothing,' said Mazen Hammad, a resident of the southern city of Khan Younis. 'When we see it on the ground, then we believe that there is a truce.' ___ Josef Federman reported from Jerusalem.

Biden and Netanyahu discuss the latest in the effort to reach an ...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden spoke Sunday about efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in the Israel-Hamas war, a sign of the intensifying push to reach a deal before Donald Trump’s inauguration next week. Talks mediated over the past year by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly stalled at moments when they seemed close to a deal. Still, in recent days, U.S. officials have expressed hope of sealing an agreement. Sunday’s call between Biden and Netanyahu came as the head of Israel’s Mossad foreign intelligence agency, David Barnea, and Biden’s top Mideast adviser, Brett McGurk, were both in the Qatari capital Doha. Barnea’s presence, confirmed by Netanyahu’s office, meant high-level Israeli officials who would need to sign off on any agreement are now involved in talks. McGurk has been working on final details of a text to be presented to both sides, Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CNN’s 'State of the Union.' But he said he would not predict whether a deal can be reached by Jan. 20, the day of the inauguration. 'We are very, very close,' he said. 'Yet being very close still means we’re far because until you actually get across the finish line, we’re not there.' The White House and Netanyahu’s office both confirmed the phone call between the two leaders without providing details. Just one brief ceasefire has been achieved in 15 months of war, and that was in the earliest weeks of fighting. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week a deal is 'very close' and he hoped to complete it before handing over diplomacy to the incoming Trump administration. Under discussion now is a phased ceasefire, with Netanyahu signaling he is committed only to the first phase, a partial hostage release in exchange for a weekslong halt in fighting. Hamas has insisted on a full Israeli troop withdrawal from the largely devastated territory, but Netanyahu has insisted on destroying Hamas’ ability to fight in Gaza. Issues in the talks have included which hostages would be released in the first part of a phased ceasefire deal, which Palestinian prisoners would be released and the extent of any Israeli troop withdrawal from population centers in Gaza. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, the majority women and children, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, whose count does not give a breakdown between fighters and civilians.

Ukraine says it captured 2 North Korean soldiers fighting for Rus...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s forces have captured two North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Russia’s Kursk border region, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday, the first such claim by Kyiv since North Korea sent thousands of troops to shore up Moscow's war effort on the other side of the world. Zelenskyy made the comments days after Ukraine, facing a slow Russian onslaught in the east, began pressing new attacks in Kursk to retain ground captured in a lightning incursion in August — the first occupation of Russian territory since World War II. Moscow’s counterattack has left Ukrainian forces outstretched and demoralized, killing and wounding thousands and retaking more than 40% of the 984 square kilometers (380 square miles) of Kursk Ukraine had seized. 'Our soldiers have captured North Korean soldiers in Kursk. These are two soldiers who, although wounded, survived, were taken to Kyiv, and are communicating' with Ukrainian security services, Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. He shared photos of two men resting on cots in a room with bars over the windows. Both wore bandages, one around his jaw and the other around both hands and wrists. Zelenskyy said capturing the soldiers alive was 'not easy.' He asserted that Russian and North Korean forces fighting in Kursk have tried to conceal the presence of North Korean soldiers, including by killing wounded comrades on the battlefield to avoid their capture and interrogation by Kyiv. Ukraine's security service SBU on Saturday said one of the soldiers had no documents at all, while the other had been carrying a Russian military ID card in the name of a man from Tuva, a Russian region bordering Mongolia. According to the SBU, one of the soldiers claimed he had been told he was going to Russia for training, rather than to fight against Ukraine. He said his combat unit, made up of North Koreans, only received one week of training alongside Russian troops before being sent to the front. A senior Ukrainian military official said last month that a couple hundred North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Kursk have been killed or wounded in battle. Ukraine estimates that 10,000 to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia. The White House and Pentagon said the North Korean forces have been battling on the front lines in largely infantry positions. They have been fighting with Russian units and, in some cases, independently around Kursk. Its full-scale invasion three years ago left Russia holding a fifth of Ukraine, and Zelenskyy has hinted that he hopes controlling Kursk will help force Moscow to negotiate an end to the war. But multiple Ukrainian and Western officials in Kyiv last month told The Associated Press that they fear gambling on Kursk will weaken the whole 1000-kilometer (621-mile) front line, and Ukraine is losing precious ground in the east. Zelenskyy welcomes new US sanctions against Russia Zelenskyy spoke to U.S. President Joe Biden following the announcement of a new U.S. sanctions package on Russia's critically important energy sector, according to Zelenskyy's Telegram account. The sanctions target more than 180 oil-carrying vessels that are suspected to be part of a shadow fleet utilized by the Kremlin to evade oil sanctions, as well as Russian energy majors, traders, oil field service firms and energy officials. Several of the vessels targeted are also suspected of shipping sanctioned Iranian oil, according to the Treasury Department. 'It is very important that America has now struck at Russia’s shadow tanker fleet and at companies such as Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, which accumulate money for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin personally. He must feel the price of his war, losing from his wallets,' Zelenskyy said, referencing two Russian energy giants blacklisted along with dozens of subsidiaries. In response to the sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that 'Washington’s hostile actions will not go unanswered' but did not provide details of any planned countermeasures. High number of Ukranian drones hints at improved arms industry Meanwhile in Russia, Ukrainian drones overnight slammed into apartment blocks in western Tambov province, blowing out windows and damaging balconies in two five-story blocks, acting regional Gov. Yegveniy Pervyshov said. There were injuries, he said, without giving details. Russia shot down 85 Ukrainian drones, mostly targeting the south and west, the Defense Ministry reported Saturday. At the same time, Russia attacked its neighbor with 74 drones overnight into Saturday, according to Ukraine’s air force. The relatively high number of Ukrainian drones, as cited by Russian officials, appeared to hint at Kyiv's efforts to ramp up domestic weapons production with the likely goal of inflicting damage comparable to that wrought by Moscow. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraine-says-it-captured-2-north-korean-soldiers-fighting-for-russia/	2025-01-11T08:39:07-08:00	
Middle East latest: Body recovered in Gaza confirmed to be 23-yea...	Israel’s army confirmed Friday that one of the bodies recovered from Gaza earlier this week was that of 23-year-old hostage Hamzah AlZayadni. His body was retrieved with that of his father, Yosef AlZayadni, who were taken together when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel 15 months ago. His father was quickly identified, while his son’s remains were sent for verification. In recent weeks, Israel and Hamas have appeared to inch closer to an agreement for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. Palestinians and family members of hostages who were killed in captivity have been imploring the Israeli government and world leaders for a ceasefire deal. Gaza's Health Ministry said Thursday that 46,006 Palestinians have been killed and 109,378 wounded in the Israel-Hamas war, with no end in sight. It has said women and children were more than half the fatalities but does not say how many of the dead were fighters or civilians. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. It blames Hamas for civilian deaths because it says militants operate in residential areas. Israel's air and ground operations have driven hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into sprawling tent camps along the coast with limited access to food and other essentials. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and abducting around 250. A third of the 100 hostages still held in Gaza are believed to be dead. Here's the latest: 3 killed in a stampede outside a mosque in Damascus DAMASCUS — Three women were killed and five children injured in a stampede outside the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus on Friday, the Syrian civil defense known as the White Helmets said in a statement. The stampede came about as a result of 'severe congestion due to an event organized by civilians,' the statement said. An Associated Press photographer at the scene said the swell in the numbers of people was caused by a food distribution event after the Friday afternoon prayers. Massive crowds were also trying to go into the packed mosque for prayers, leading security guards to lock the gates and fire in the air to disperse the crowd, he said. Italy says suspending EU sanctions on Syria could help encourage transition ROME — Italy's foreign minister says a moratorium on European Union sanctions on Syria could help encourage the country's transition the ouster of President Bashar Assad by Islamist insurgents. Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani visited Syria on Friday and expressed Italy’s keen interest in helping Syria recover from civil war, rebuild its broken economy and help stabilize the region. Tajani, who met with Syria’s new de facto leaders, said a stable Syria and Lebanon was of strategic and commercial importance to Europe. He said the fall of Assad's regime, as well as the Lebanon parliament's vote on Thursday to elect army commander Joseph Aoun as president, were signs of optimism for Middle East stability. He said Italy wanted to play a leading role in Syria’s recovery and serve as a bridge between Damascus and the EU, particularly given Italy’s commercial and strategic interests in the Mediterranean. 'The Mediterranean can no longer just be a sea of death, a cemetery of migrants but a sea of commerce a sea of development,' he said. On the eve of his visit, Tajani presided in Rome over a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and officials from Britain, France and Germany as well as the EU foreign policy chief. He said that meeting of the so-called Quintet on Syria was key to begin the discussion about a change to the EU sanctions. 'The sanctions were against the Assad regime. If the situation has changed, we have to change our choices,' Tajani said, adding that a moratorium could be the way forward. Turkey has no ‘secret agenda’ in Syria, minister says ISTANBUL — Turkey 'does not have any secret agenda' in Syria and wants to construct a 'new culture of cooperation,' Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Friday. One of Turkey’s priorities in the upcoming year is to clear the region of terrorism, Fidan said, referring to Kurdish militants based in northeast Syria. 'The extensions of the separatist group in Syria are now facing destruction and the old order is no longer going to continue,' he told a news conference in Istanbul. Fidan also criticized the United States’ support for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as the U.S. seeks to prevent a revival of the Islamic State group. 'This kills the spirit of alliance and solidarity,' Fidan said. He said Turkey is 'not going to shy away from taking the necessary steps' in terms of military action. Turkey views the SDF as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which is listed as a terror organization by Turkey and other states. Referring to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s comments that U.S. troops should stay in Syria, Fidan dismissed the views of the outgoing U.S. administration. 'This is the problem of the new government and the old government does not have a say in this,' he said. The SDF is currently involved in fighting the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army. Fidan also backed suggestions for Syrian Kurds to join a new national military but said all non-Syrians fighting for the SDF –- a reference to those with ties to the PKK -– should leave the country. President of Cy prus to meet Lebanon's new president NICOSIA, Cyprus — The president of Cyprus says he will be the first head of state to meet with the newly elected president of Lebanon, Joseph Aoun. President Nikos Christodoulides told reporters Friday that he would be meeting Aoun when he departs for Lebanon around midday Friday. Christodoulides said he knows Aoun 'well' from his tenure as chief of Lebanon’s armed forces. He said the meeting is indicative of the role that Cyprus, as a European Union member closest to the Middle East, can play in helping to 'meet the challenges that have arisen in the region.' In a written statement, Cyprus government spokesman Constantinos Letymbiotis said Christodoulides will also discuss with Aoun Lebanon’s internal issues and to convey Cyprus’ readiness to provide any needed assistance and to strengthen relations with its neighbor. Cyprus is less than 200 kilometers (130 miles) from the Lebanese capital Beirut and has provided the country with military assistance to prop up its armed forces. Body of hostage Hamzah AlZayadni identified after recovery in Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel’s army confirmed Friday that one of the bodies recovered from Gaza earlier this week was that of 23-year-old hostage Hamzah AlZayadni. The army said Friday that the identification was made by the National Institute of Forensic Medicine and Israel’s police and the family has been notified. The army said its forces recovered the bodies of Hamzah and his father from an underground tunnel in the Rafah area and returned them to Israel. His father, Yosef AlZayadni, had been identified earlier this week. The father and son were thought to still be alive before this week’s announcement. They were kidnapped together from Kibbutz Holit, when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The news comes as Israel and Hamas are considering a ceasefire deal that would free remaining hostages and halt the fighting in Gaza. Israel says about a third of the remaining 100 hostages have died, but believes as many as half could be dead. Their fates could ramp up pressure on Israel to move forward with a deal. The Hostages Families Forum, which represents families of the hostages, said Hamzah was a nature lover who had deep affection for animals and was beloved by his friends. He leaves behind a wife and two children. Oil tanker that threated Red Sea spill has been salvaged DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — An oil tanker that burned for weeks and threatened a massive oil spill in the Red Sea has been salvaged, a security firm said Friday. The Sounion had been a disaster-in-waiting in the waterway, with 1 million barrels of crude oil aboard that had been struck and later sabotaged with explosives by Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. It took months for salvagers to tow the vessel away, extinguish the fires and offload the remaining crude oil. The Houthis initially attacked the Greek-flagged Sounion tanker on Aug. 21 with small-arms fire, projectiles and a drone boat. A French destroyer rescued its crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, and took them to nearby Djibouti. The Houthis later released footage showing they planted explosives on board the Sounion and ignited them in a propaganda video, which the rebels have done before. The Houthis have targeted some 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. The rebels maintain they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-body-recovered-in-gaza-confirmed-to-be-23-year-old-hamzah-alzayadni/	2025-01-10T04:20:41-08:00	
In their final meeting, Zelenskyy and Austin say military aid to ...	RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin used their final meeting Thursday to press the incoming Trump administration to not give up on Kyiv’s fight, warning that to cease military support now 'will only invite more aggression, chaos and war.' 'We’ve come such a long way that it would honestly be crazy to drop the ball now and not keep building on the defense coalitions we’ve created,' Zelenskyy said. 'No matter what’s going on in the world, everyone wants to feel sure that their country will not just be erased of the map.' Austin also announced the U.S. would send another $500 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including missiles for fighter jets, sustainment equipment for F-16s, armored bridging systems and small arms and ammunition. The weapons are funded through presidential drawdown authority, meaning they can be pulled directly from U.S. stockpiles, and the Pentagon is pushing to get them into Ukraine before the end of the month. Ukraine is in the midst of launching a second offensive in Russia’s Kursk region and is facing a barrage of long-range missiles and ongoing advances from Russia as both sides seek to put themselves in the strongest negotiating point possible before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Zelenskyy called the Kursk offensive 'one of our biggest wins' that has cost Russia and North Korea, which sent soldiers to help Russia in Kursk, thousands of troops. Zelenskyy said the offensive resulted in North Korea suffering 4,000 casualties, but U.S. estimates put the number lower at about 1,200. Zelenskyy said Ukraine will continue to need air defense systems and munitions to defend against Russia's missile attacks. The latest U.S. package leaves about $3.85 billion in funding to provide future arms shipments to Ukraine. If the Biden administration makes no further announcements, that balance will be available to Trump to send if he chooses. 'If Putin swallows Ukraine, his appetite will only grow,' Austin told the approximately 50 member nations who have been meeting over the last three years to coordinate weapons and military support for Ukraine. 'If autocrats conclude that democracies will lose their nerve, surrender their interests, and forget their principles, we will only see more land grabs. If tyrants learn that aggression pays, we will only invite even more aggression, chaos, and war.' Austin leaves a consortium that now has more than a half dozen independent coalitions of those countries who are focused on Ukraine's longer-term security capabilities and who have committed to continuing to stand up those needs through 2027. In the months since Trump's election victory, Europe has grappled with what that change will mean in terms of their fight to keep Russia from further advancing, and whether the post-World War II western alliance will hold. In recent days, Trump has threatened to take Greenland, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark — a NATO member — by military means if necessary. Such action would upend all norms of the historic NATO alliance and possibly require members to come to the defense of Denmark due to U.S. aggression. Germany's Defense Minister Boris Pistorius called Trump's comments 'diplomatically astonishing.' 'Alliances are alliances, to stay alliances. Regardless of who is governing countries,' he said. 'I'm quite optimistic that remarks like that won't really influence U.S. politics after the 20th of January.' There are also questions as to whether there will be a future meeting of the 50-member Ukraine Defense Contact Group, or whether it will assume a new shape under one of its major European contributors, such as Germany. If the U.S., does not come back to the table to assist Ukraine, Pistorius said Germany and several other European countries are discussing options. Pistorius said he intends to travel to the U.S. shortly after the inauguration to meet his new counterpart to discuss the issue. 'It’s clear a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world just 11 days from now,' Zelenskyy said. 'A time when we will have to cooperate even more, rely even more on one another even more and achieve even greater results together.' Globally, countries including the U.S. have ramped up domestic weapons production as the Ukraine war exposed that all of those stockpiles were woefully unprepared for a major conventional land war. The U.S. has provided about $66 billion of the total aid since February 2022 and has been able to deliver most of that total — between 80% and 90% — already to Ukraine. 'Retreat will only provide incentives for more imperial aggression,' Austin told the group. 'And if we flinch, you can count on Putin to push further and punch harder. Ukraine’s survival is on the line. But so is the security of Europe, the United States, and the world.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-in-their-final-meeting-zelenskyy-and-austin-say-military-aid-to-ukraine-must-continue-under-trump/	2025-01-09T05:39:06-08:00	
More than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israel-Hama...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — More than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war, Gaza's Health Ministry said Thursday, with no end in sight to the 15-month conflict. The ministry said a total of 46,006 Palestinians have been killed and 109,378 wounded. It has said women and children make up more than half the fatalities, but does not say how many of the dead were fighters or civilians. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. It says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths because the militants operate in residential areas. Israel has also repeatedly struck what it claims are militants hiding in shelters and hospitals, often killing women and children. In recent weeks, Israel and Hamas have appeared to inch closer to an agreement for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week that a deal is 'very close' and he hopes to complete it before handing over U.S diplomacy to the incoming Trump administration. But he and other U.S. officials have expressed similar optimism on several occasions over the past year, only to see the indirect talks stall. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza. Israeli authorities believe at least a third of them were killed in the initial attack or have died in captivity. The war has flattened large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its 2.3 million people, with many forced to flee multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into sprawling tent camps along the coast with limited access to food and other essentials. 'What we are living is not a life. Nobody could bear the situation we’re experiencing for a single day,' Munawar al-Bik, a displaced woman, told The Associated Press in an interview this week. 'We wake up at night to the sounds of men crying, because of the bad situation,' she said. 'The situation is unbearable. We have no energy left: we want it to end today.' Al-Bik spoke on a dusty road in the southern city of Khan Younis next to a destroyed building. Behind her, a sea of makeshift tents filled with displaced families stretched into the distance. On Thursday, dozens of people took part in funeral prayers outside the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah for people killed in Israeli strikes the day before. In the hospital morgue, a man could be seen kneeling and bidding farewell to a relative before slamming a refrigerator door in an outburst of grief. Palestinian health officials said Israeli airstrikes killed at least nine people in Gaza on Wednesday, including three infants — among them a 1-week-old baby — and two women. ___ Khaled reported from Cairo. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-gazas-health-ministry-says-the-palestinian-death-toll-from-the-war-has-surpassed-46000/	2025-01-09T05:02:23-08:00	
Trump threatens Hamas to release hostages by inauguration	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) -- President-elect Donald Trump is threatening the terror group Hamas to release its remaining hostages in Gaza before his inauguration Jan. 20. 'If they're not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East,' Trump said. However, Trump would not elaborate on what actions he would take. 'It will not be good for Hamas and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone,' he said. Israel announced Wednesday that troops recovered the remains of more hostages. Officials said roughly 100 hostages remain in Hamas hands, but as many as half are presumed dead. 'Please don't let any hostage stay behind,' said Merav Leshem Gonen, the mother of hostage Romi Gonen. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is part of the effort to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Witkoff said the negotiations are making progress. 'So hopefully it'll all work out and we'll save some lives,' Witkoff said. Trump and President Joe Biden are urging Israel and Hamas to accept a deal before the inauguration. Israel wants assurances that the hostages are still alive, but Hamas said it doesn't know who is alive or dead. 'We're very close to a ceasefire and hostage agreement,' said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Blinken said if negotiations do slide past Jan. 20, his team has already made arrangements for Trump's team to take over. 'The world doesn't stop because we have a transition,' Blinken said. A growing group of Israeli soldiers is refusing to continue fighting in Gaza. The troops said they disagree with the way Israel is conducting the war and don't think it will bring home the hostages. The group said it hopes to pressure the Israeli government into a ceasefire.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/trump-threatens-hamas-to-release-hostages-by-inauguration/	2025-01-08T13:50:10-08:00	
Body of an Israeli hostage is found in Gaza, possibly alongside h...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli soldiers recovered the body of a 53-year-old hostage in an underground tunnel in southern Gaza, the military said Wednesday, and the army was determining if another set of remains belongs to the man's son. The discovery of Yosef AlZayadni's body comes as Israel and Hamas are considering a ceasefire deal that would free the remaining hostages in Gaza and could halt the fighting. Israel has declared that about a third of the remaining 100 hostages have died, but believes as many as half could be dead. Yosef and his son Hamzah AlZayadni were thought to still be alive before Wednesday’s announcement, and news about their fate could ramp up pressure on Israel to move forward with a deal. The military said it found evidence in the tunnel that raised 'serious concerns' for the life of Hamzah AlZayadni, 23, suggesting he may have died in captivity. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said the circumstances behind Yosef AlZayadni's death were being investigated. AlZayadni and three of his children were among 250 hostages taken captive after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people. AlZayadni had a total of 19 children and had worked for 17 years at the dairy farm of a kibbutz that was among the communities attacked, said the Hostages Families Forum, a group representing the relatives of captives. AlZayadni’s teenage children, Bilal and Aisha, were released along with about 100 hostages in a weeklong ceasefire deal in November 2023. The bodies of around three dozen hostages have been recovered in Gaza and eight hostages have been rescued by the army. The Hostages Families Forum said the ceasefire deal being negotiated 'comes far too late for Yosef - who was taken alive and should have returned the same way.' 'Every day in captivity poses an immediate mortal danger to the hostages,' the group said in a statement. The deaths of previous high-profile hostages have sparked large protests in Israel calling for a deal. Yosef AlZayadni appeared on a list of 34 hostages shared by a Hamas official with The Associated Press earlier this week who the militant group said were slated for release. Israel said this was a list it had submitted to mediators last July, and that it has received nothing from Hamas. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas is 'very close' and he hopes 'we can get it over the line' before handing over U.S. diplomacy to President-elect Donald Trump’s administration later this month. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed sorrow at the news of AlZayadni's death, and said in a statement he had 'hoped and worked to bring back the four members of the family from Hamas captivity.' Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz earlier said the bodies of both Yosef and Hamzah AlZayadni had been recovered, but the military said the identity of some remains were not yet determined. The AlZayadni family are members of the Bedouin community, part of Israel’s Palestinian minority who have Israeli citizenship. The traditionally nomadic community is particularly impoverished in Israel and has suffered from neglect and marginalization. Palestinians make up some 20% of Israel’s 10 million population, and millions more live in Gaza and under Israeli military occupation in the West Bank. Eight members of Israel’s Bedouin minority were abducted in the October 2023 attacks. 'We expected to bring them back alive,' said Talal Alkernawi, mayor of the city of Rahat, where the men were from. 'Instead of returning them alive to their families, to raise their children, we receive them dead.' Many of the families fear their loved ones' fate is at risk as long as the war in Gaza rages on. Israeli forces are pressing their air and ground war against Hamas, and Palestinian health officials said Israeli airstrikes killed at least nine people in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, including three infants — among them a 1-week-old — and two women. Israel’s military says it only targets militants, accusing them of hiding among civilians. The war has killed over 45,800 Palestinians, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says women and children make up over half the fatalities. The military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israel has destroyed vast areas of the impoverished territory and displaced some 90% of its population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. The fighting has also spilled over into the broader Middle East, including a war between Israel and Hezbollah now contained by a fragile ceasefire, and direct conflict between Israel and Iran. Iran-backed rebels in Yemen have targeted shipping in the Red Sea for more than a year and recently ramped up missile attacks on Israel, saying they seek to force an end to the war in Gaza. And on Wednesday, the U.S. military said it carried out a wave of strikes against underground arms facilities of the Houthi rebels. ___ Lidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-bodies-of-2-israeli-hostages-recovered-by-soldiers-in-gaza-defense-minister-says/	2025-01-08T12:19:10-08:00	
US will announce $500M in weapons to be sent to Ukraine	RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany (AP) — The U.S. is set to provide Ukraine an additional $500 million in weapons quickly pulled from its existing stockpiles as the Biden administration works to get Kyiv in a stronger negotiating position before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, two U.S. officials said. The announcement is expected during Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s final trip to meet with the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a consortium of about 50 partner nations that Austin brought together months after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 to coordinate weapons support. The meeting on Thursday is the 25th and potentially last gathering of the U.S.-led group, as the participating countries wait to see whether it will be continued under Trump. 'Our focus will be on maintaining momentum, delivering results, and sending a clear message: The international community stands resolute in its support for Ukraine,' Austin told reporters traveling with him. The weapons are funded through presidential drawdown authority, meaning they can be pulled directly from U.S. stockpiles. A senior defense official who briefed reporters traveling with Austin said the goal was to get those munitions into Ukraine before the end of the month. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet publicly announced. To date the U.S. has provided Ukraine about $66.5 billion in weapons assistance since Russia invaded nearly three years ago. There is now a little less than $4 billion remaining in congressionally authorized funding for Ukraine and much of that is expected to roll over to the Trump administration to determine whether to continue the weapons support. ___ Lee reported from Washington.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-to-announce-500m-in-weapons-to-be-sent-to-ukraine/	2025-01-08T07:52:54-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes kill at least 5 in Gaza, incl...	Israeli airstrikes killed at least five people in the Gaza Strip, including two infants and a woman, Palestinian medics said Wednesday. One strike hit a home in the central city of Deir al-Balah, killing two men and a woman, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the casualties. It also received a 4-month-old boy who was killed in a strike on his family house in the nearby built-up Bureij refugee camp. An Associated Press journalist saw the four bodies in the hospital morgue. In Gaza City, an airstrike hit a home in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood, killing a 3-week-old baby, according to the Health Ministry’s emergency service. Israel’s military says it only targets militants, accusing them of hiding among civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed over 45,800 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says women and children make up over half the fatalities. The military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Here's the latest: US military carries out airstrikes against Yemen's Houthi rebels DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The U.S. military says it carried out a wave of strikes against underground arms facilities of Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels. U.S. Central Command said in a statement that Wednesday’s strikes targeted weapons used by the rebels to attack ships in the Red Sea. The Houthis said seven strikes targeted sites in the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, and the northern Amran province, without providing further details. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The United States and its allies have carried out repeated strikes on the Houthis, who have continued to target shipping. The rebels say they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-airstrikes-kill-at-least-5-in-gaza-including-2-babies-palestinians-say/	2025-01-08T04:53:48-08:00	
Ukraine claims it struck a key military fuel depot deep inside Ru...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The Ukrainian military said Wednesday that it struck a fuel storage depot deep inside Russia, causing a huge blaze at the facility that supplies an important Russian air base. Russian officials acknowledged a major drone attack in the area, and said that authorities had set up an emergency command center to fight the fire. Ukraine’s General Staff said that the assault hit the storage facility near Engels, in Russia’s Saratov region, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of the Ukrainian border. The depot supplied a nearby airfield used by aircraft that launch missiles across the border into Ukraine, a statement on Facebook said. Ukraine has been developing its arsenal of domestically produced long-range missiles and drones capable of reaching deep behind the front line as it faces restrictions on the range that its military can fire its Western-supplied missiles into Russia. The attacks have disrupted Russian logistics in the almost three-year war, which began on Feb. 24, 2022, and embarrassed the Kremlin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last year that his country has developed a weapon that could hit a target 700 kilometers (400 miles) away. Some Ukrainian drone attacks have hit targets more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) away. The governor of the Saratov region, Roman Busargin, said that an unspecified industrial plant in Engels sustained damage from the falling drone debris that sparked a fire, but nobody was hurt. Engels, which has a population of more than 220,000, is located on the left bank of the Volga River, and is home to multiple industrial plants. Saratov, a major industrial city of about 900,000, faces Engels across the river. 'The damage to the oil base creates serious logistical problems for the strategic aviation of the Russian occupiers and significantly reduces their ability to strike peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilian objects. To be continued,' the statement from Ukraine’s General Staff said. Russian authorities restricted flights early Wednesday at the airports of Saratov, Ulyanovsk, Kazan and Nizhnekamsk, in an apparent response to the Ukrainian attack. The main base of Russia’s nuclear-capable strategic bombers is located just outside Engels. It has come under Ukrainian drone attacks since the early stages of the war, forcing the Russian military to relocate most of the bombers to other areas. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraine-claims-it-struck-a-key-military-fuel-depot-deep-inside-russia/	2025-01-08T03:27:22-08:00	
Hostages in Gaza endure another winter as their families plead fo...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — When Luis Har was kidnapped by Hamas-led militants on the warm morning of Oct. 7, 2023, he was forced into Gaza wearing shorts and a T-shirt. As his captivity stretched into weeks and then months, the cold, wet winter set in, bringing along with it a dread he had never endured before. 'I felt a penetrating cold in my bones,' said Har, 71, who was rescued in mid-February in an Israeli military raid. With no heating in the apartment where he was held, the cold from the floor permeated his thin mattress at night. Fighting outside shattered the apartment windows, sending in rain and wind. While Har is spending this winter warm and free, dozens of hostages still in captivity are not. Their families and supporters are desperate for a ceasefire deal to bring an end to their 15-month-long nightmare. 'Winter makes it much harder, much more complicated,' said Har. 'They must return as quickly as possible.' The hostages often experience the same dire circumstances as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, whether it be food scarcity, the dangers from Israeli bombardments or the winter. The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas’ attack, has displaced most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population, many of whom are weathering a second winter in tents that are barely holding up against the wind, rain and temperatures that can drop below 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) at night. Israel and Hamas are considering a deal that would free some hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and a halt to the fighting in Gaza. But despite reports of progress, the families of hostages have been shattered by previous rounds of promising talks that have suddenly collapsed. They fear the same could happen now. 'It is a dagger in our hearts,' said Ofri Bibas Levy, about the rollercoaster of hope and despair the families have lived throughout the war. Bibas Levy’s brother, Yarden Bibas, along with his wife Shiri and sons Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 1, are being held in Gaza. 'Either it happens now or it doesn’t happen at all,' she told Israeli Army Radio. During its attack on southern Israel, Hamas killed 1,200 people and kidnapped about 250, more than 100 of whom were freed in a brief ceasefire in the early weeks of the war. Since then, Israel has killed more than 45,000 people in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its count. Of the roughly 100 hostages who remain in Gaza, one third are said to be dead, some killed during Hamas’ initial attack and others killed or having died in captivity. Israel has rescued eight hostages and has recovered the bodies of dozens. The hostages range in age from 1 to 86, and are believed to be scattered throughout the Gaza Strip. They have been held in apartments or in Hamas’ web of underground tunnels, which are cramped, damp and stifling, according to testimony from freed hostages. Many families have no idea what conditions their loved ones face, uncertainty that heightens their concern. 'You see a rainy day, or a cold day or whatever is going on outside, a storm, and it kills you,' said Michael Levy, whose brother Or, 34, was captured from an outdoor music festival after his wife was killed by militants, leaving their now 3-year-old son, Almog, without his parents. Yehonatan Sabban, a spokesperson for the Hostages Families Forum, said the hostages are undernourished, with low fat reserves and weakened immune systems, making them more vulnerable to complications from illness in winter. 'Everyone is in a life-threatening situation that demands their immediate release,' Sabban said. Har said the conditions of his captivity worsened during winter. For weeks, he had been held with four members of his family who had also been kidnapped — along with a Shih Tzu smuggled in by one of them. Three of them and the dog were freed in the first and only ceasefire agreement in late November. That left Har and his relative Fernando Marman alone with their captors in a second-floor apartment in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Har pled with his captors, who wore heavy coats, to bring them warmer clothes. They did — although they were ridden with holes. Every 10 days or so, they washed themselves with water from a bucket. A shattered window was sealed with a tarp. In the first few weeks of captivity, there was food. Ingredients were delivered and Har took on the role of chef. When there were tomatoes, he made tomato soup with some rice. With canned peas, he made pea soup. But as the war dragged on and the temperature dropped, food became scarce. They were delighted when a captor brought one egg for them to share. For weeks, he and Marman split a single pita a day. When he was rescued in a nighttime operation in mid-February, he ran shoeless out of the apartment and into a nearby greenhouse. Soldiers gave him a pair of shoes and a coat and spirited him home. The raid killed about 70 Palestinians, according to local authorities. The families of the remaining hostages are pinning their hopes on the latest round of ceasefire talks. 'All I have is to pray that he’s somehow OK,' Levy said of his brother’s fate, 'and know that the human spirit is stronger than anything.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hostages-in-gaza-endure-another-winter-as-their-families-plead-for-a-ceasefire/	2025-01-07T21:05:33-08:00	
Trump: 'All hell will break out' if Hamas hostages not released b...	(The Hill) - President-elect Trump repeated his warnings that all hell will break loose in the Middle East if hostages kidnapped from Israel and held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip are not released before his inauguration on Jan. 20. 'It will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone,' Trump said during a press conference at his residence in Florida, Mar-A-Lago. 'All hell will break out. I don't have to say anymore, but that's what it is.' President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2024, in Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, said at the same press conference that there's been a lot of progress on efforts to release about 100 hostages held in the Gaza Strip, saying he’s hopeful a deal is achieved ahead of the inauguration. Witkoff said he had just returned from discussions in Doha, Qatar on the hostage release deal and was planning to head back to the region on Wednesday or Thursday. 'I believe we've been on the verge of it. I don't want to discuss sort of what's delayed it,' he said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had earlier said he hoped the Biden administration could conclude a hostage release and ceasefire deal before the end of President Biden’s term in office.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/trump-all-hell-will-break-out-if-hamas-hostages-not-released-by-inauguration/	2025-01-07T10:02:55-08:00
