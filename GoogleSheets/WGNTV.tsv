What's known about the brazen bombing that killed a top Russian g...	The killing of a senior Russian general in a bombing outside his apartment building in Moscow was the boldest assassination yet of a top military officer and again brought the war in Ukraine to the streets of the capital. Some things to know about the attack and who is suspected of being behind it: What happened? Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov was killed Tuesday morning by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter parked near the entrance of his apartment block in southeastern Moscow as he left for his office. Kirillov’s assistant also died in the attack. The bomb was triggered remotely, according to Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB. The explosion was caught on video from a camera mounted inside a car, showing the men walking out of the building and the fiery blast. Who were the victims? Kirillov, 54, was the chief of Russia's Radiation, Biological and Chemical Protection Forces. These special troops are tasked with protecting the military from the enemy’s use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and ensuring operations in a contaminated environment. He was under sanctions from several countries, including the U.K. and Canada, for his actions in Moscow’s war in Ukraine. On Monday, Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, opened a criminal investigation against him, accusing Kirillov of directing the use of banned chemical weapons. Russia has denied using any chemical weapons in Ukraine and has accused Kyiv of using them. Kirillov, who took his post in 2017, was one of the highest profile figures to level those accusations. He held numerous briefings to accuse the Ukrainian military of using toxic agents and planning to launch attacks with radioactive substances — claims Kyiv and its Western allies rejected as propaganda. His assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, was also killed in the attack. Who has claimed responsibility? An SBU official said Tuesday that the agency was behind the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information, described Kirillov as a 'war criminal and an entirely legitimate target.' The SBU official provided the video of the bombing. Who has been detained? The FSB said Wednesday that it has detained a suspect but has not identified him. He was described as a citizen of the Central Asian nation of Uzbekistan, born in 1995. According to a statement by the FSB, the suspect said he was recruited by Ukrainian special services. The Associated Press could not confirm the conditions under which the suspect made the statement to the security services. The FSB said the suspect had been promised $100,000 and permission to move to a European Union country in exchange for killing Kirillov. The agency said that acting on instructions from Ukraine, the suspect traveled to Moscow, where he obtained a homemade bomb, placed it on an e-scooter and parked it at the entrance to Kirillov's apartment building. The suspect rented a car to monitor the location and set up a camera that livestreamed the scene to his handlers in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, detonating the bomb when Kirillov left the building, the FSB said. The suspect faces a sentence of up to life imprisonment, the FSB said. Russian media reports said the FSB tracked the suspect by studying video from surveillance cameras and cellphone calls. What's still not known? Besides not releasing his name, the FSB has not said how the suspect was recruited. He was detained in a village in the Moscow region, according to Ministry of Internal Affairs official Irina Volk, who was quoted by the Tass news agency. It is not known where he is being held or when he will appear in court. That is expected in the coming days, to hear the terms of his pre-trial detention. Under Russian law, a person may only be remanded in custody for 48 hours before a court order is made. What has Russia said about the attack? Russian officials have described the bombing as a 'terrorist act.' The Kremlin said Wednesday it was 'obvious' that Ukraine was behind Kirillov’s killing, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Kyiv 'does not shy away from terrorist methods.' While President Vladimir Putin has not publicly spoken about the attack, Peskov said he expressed his condolences on Kirillov's death. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, described the attack as an attempt by Kyiv to distract public attention from its military failures and vowed that its 'senior military-political leadership will face inevitable retribution.' Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of parliament, called Kirillov 'a professional military man, an intellectual, a Russian patriot.' He 'did a lot to increase the effectiveness of the radiation, chemical and biological defense forces, to ensure the security and sovereignty of our country,' Volodin said. —- Illia Novikov contributed to this report from Kyiv, Ukraine.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-whats-known-about-the-brazen-bombing-that-killed-a-top-russian-general-in-moscow/	2024-12-18T07:31:50-08:00	
Families of hostages endure uncertainty even as hopes rise for a ...	KIRYAT GAT, Israel (AP) — Ilana Gritzewsky is fighting a battle against time to save her boyfriend from Hamas captivity. While there appears to be progress toward a deal to free the remaining captives in phases, Matan Zangauker would likely not be released in the first stage since he is a young man. Gritzewsky is terrified a deal could break down or he could die in captivity before he’s freed. Gritzewsky knows first-hand the perils facing her boyfriend, who turned 25 on Wednesday. She was kidnapped and held hostage for 55 days before being released during the only previous ceasefire deal a year ago. 'All the hostages need to get out,' said Gritzewsky. 'If we don’t release all of the hostages — all the hostages in captivity — they will be dead.' Many relatives of people held in Gaza find no reprieve in reports that negotiations toward a deal are progressing. The renewed ceasefire talks are just the latest twist in what’s been more than 14 months of anguish, despair and uncertainty about their loved ones’ fates. Still, they dedicate themselves to lobbying for their loved ones’ freedom, even as the world moves on to other crises. 'I gave my promise to my friends from the kibbutz in the tunnels before I went home. I told them I will do everything, everything I have to, to take them out from that hell. And I ask all the time: Am I doing everything I can?' said Gritzewsky, 31. Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and abducting roughly 250, dragging them into Gaza. The attack sparked an Israeli invasion of Gaza. More than 45,000 people have been killed in the ongoing war, according to local health authorities, who say more than half are women and children but do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count. About 100 hostages were freed in a brief truce in November 2023, while others have been rescued or their bodies have been retrieved by the Israeli military. Around another 100 have not been released, though Israel believes at least a third of them are dead. In the deal under discussion, mostly women and older people are expected to be freed in the first six-to-eight-week phase, but many families of hostages are lobbying for all of the hostages to be freed at once. Zangauker and Gritzewsky were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where they lived together, and then held separately in Gaza. Just before her release from a tunnel under Gaza, Gritzewsky heard from other hostages that Zangauker was nearby. She begged to be able to see him but was not allowed. Two weeks ago, Hamas released a video of Zangauker, filmed under duress, where he described difficult conditions in Gaza and pleaded with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to strike a deal to end the war. 'He spoke quietly, but his eyes were screaming for help,' Gritzewsky said of the footage. While it was a relief to see Zangauker, the video is no guarantee that he’s still alive today, she said. 'I don’t want a photo. I don’t want a video. I want him here. I want all the hostages here,' she said. The video brought back some of the worst memories of her captivity: the middle of the night interrogations, the filthy conditions, the lack of medical help for the injuries she suffered during the kidnapping. Gritzewsky's pelvis and jaw were broken and she has burns on her legs. She suffered hearing loss in one ear. 'What they are going through is physically, psychologically, and emotionally torture, day and night,' said Gritzewsky, wearing a hat that belonged to Zangauker that she rescued from their destroyed home. 'I know the psychology that they use, how you don’t have water, how you don’t have food, how you don’t see the light, you don’t know what day or hour it is.' Gritzewsky said she hates being in front of the cameras, telling her story over and over, reliving the worst days of her life, in a desperate attempt to raise awareness of the plight of the hostages and bring her boyfriend home. Nonetheless, Gritzewsky has been a constant presence at protests and demonstrations across the country along with Zangauker’s mother, who has emerged as one of the most vocal activists for the hostages. Einav Zangauker, who used to support Netanyahu, has virulently opposed his handling of the war and is furious at the government for not yet reaching a ceasefire deal, accusing it of forsaking the hostages in its bid to topple Hamas. Netanyahu has said that the war must continue until Hamas is crushed and unable to rearm, but critics point out that Israel has already assassinated the top leadership and destroyed large swaths of Gaza. Einav Zangauker, a single mother, has been relentless in her crusade, attending demonstrations daily, speaking repeatedly to every major Israeli media outlet, and even climbing into a cage that was hoisted high above a protest to hammer home the idea of her son in captivity. She has demanded that politicians pursue a ceasefire that will release all the hostages at once. 'If my son returns in a body bag or body parts, I will not put you on trial, I will take the law into my own hands!' she screamed at lawmakers during a parliamentary committee meeting Monday. While Gritzewsky is no longer captive in Gaza, she said she can’t begin to heal until the hostages, including her boyfriend, come home. 'Since Oct. 7, it’s like time stopped,' she said. 'You see the world running in front of your eyes, but your life is crushed like little pieces of dust.' ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-families-of-hostages-endure-uncertainty-even-as-hopes-rise-for-a-ceasefire-in-gaza/	2024-12-18T06:20:53-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli military orders another Gaza evacuati...	The Israeli military on Wednesday ordered another evacuation in central Gaza ahead of an offensive in the area, even as Israel and the militant group Hamas appeared to inch closer to a ceasefire in the 14-month war. 'This is an advance warning ahead of an offensive,' Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee posted on X. The order included four residential block areas in the urban refugee camp of Bureij, where Adraee claimed that Palestinian militants fired rockets toward Israel. He asked the residents to move to a 'humanitarian zone' in the Muwasi area. The Israeli media have issued frequent evacuation orders for different parts of Gaza throughout the war, displacing more than 90% of the population, most of them multiple times. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he will meet Wednesday with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's Mideast envoy, Adam Boehler, at his home in Jerusalem. Boehler, a former aid to Jared Kushner, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week. Talks to broker the ceasefire and hostage release deal have restarted after a monthslong pause. The deal on the table includes a six week pause in fighting in which Hamas would release 30 hostages, including three of four dual Israeli-U.S. citizens, in exchange for Israel releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Trump has said he wants a quick end to the war. Israeli bombardment and offensives in Gaza have killed more than 45,000 Palestinians over the past 14 months, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry’s tally does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but it says more than of half the dead were women and children. Israel launched its campaign in retaliation for Hamas’ October 2023 attack on southern Israel in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others, around 100 of whom remain in captivity. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli settlers briefly crossed into Lebanon, the military says JERUSALEM — A group of Israeli settlers have briefly crossed the border into Lebanon before they were removed by troops, the military acknowledged Wednesday. The civilians who crossed the border came from the Uri Tzafon movement, a group calling for Israeli settlement of southern Lebanon. Photos posted by the group online Saturday showed a small group of activists holding signs and erecting tents inside Lebanon while Israeli soldiers were present. After first denying the reports to Israeli media, the military said Wednesday that civilians had crossed the border 'by a few meters' and were removed by troops. The military called the border breach a 'serious incident' and said it was investigating. 'Any attempt to approach or cross the border into Lebanese territory without coordination poses a life-threatening risk and interferes with the IDF’s ability to operate in the area and carry out its mission,' the military said, using the acronym for the Israel Defense Forces. The settler group Uri Tzafon, which means 'Awaken the North' in Hebrew, crossed the border in the area of the Lebanese village of Maroun A Ras. In the past, the movement has said the area is home to an old Hebrew settlement. Groups of settler activists also have breached the Gaza border more than once since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, at one point erecting small wooden tents before they were evacuated by troops. Daniela Weiss, the leader of the movement to resettle Gaza, claims she has entered Gaza twice since the start of the war. Israel’s settler movement has been emboldened by its current government -- the furthest-right in Israeli history -- and is now seeking to expand to parts of southern Lebanon and the north of the Gaza. UN envoy says Syria needs a credible and inclusive transition DAMASCUS, Syria — The U.N. envoy to Syria said after concluding a visit to Damascus and meeting the new administration that the country needs a ' a political transition that will be credible, inclusive and include the broadest range of the Syrian society and Syrian parties.' Geir Pedersen said Wednesday that the process should take place under a U.N. resolution adopted in 2015 to help negotiate a political solution between the government of now-deposed President Bashar Assad and the opposition. 'There is a lot of hope. We can all see the beginning of a new Syria ... that in line with Security Council Resolution 2254 will adopt a new constitution that will ensure that there is a new social contract for all Syrians and that we will have free and fair elections when that time comes after a transitional period, also in line with Security Council Resolution 2254,' Pedersen said. It is not yet clear if Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, will pursue such a process. The group has set up an interim administration comprising members of its 'salvation government' that had ruled its former stronghold in northern Syria. It will oversee the country until March, but the new ruler have not made clear how the transition to a new, fully empowered government would take place. Pedersen also warned of ongoing violence in parts of the country, particularly in the northeast, where Kurdish forces and Turkish-backed armed groups have clashed, and called for humanitarian assistance and for starting a process to end Western sanctions on Syria. Israeli students walk out of class to call for release of hostages JERUSALEM — Hundreds of Israeli students walked out of school Wednesday to call for an immediate deal to release the remaining hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza strip as there appears to be progress in ceasefire talks. From Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, students headed for central junctions, blocking roads and holding signs with the faces of the captives remaining in Gaza after 14 months of war. There are 100 hostages in Gaza, a third of whom Israel’s government says are dead. Hamas militants dragged them to Gaza in their Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered the war. At the high school in central Israel attended by hostages Naama Levy and Guy Illouz, who Israel’s military says was killed in the Oct. 7 attack, students crammed the auditorium with signs reading 'Bring them Home Now.' In Tel Aviv, high school students chanted 'Their time is up. There’s a deal on the table.' Netanyahu takes the stand on Day 4 of corruption trials TEL AVIV, Israel — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the stand on the fourth day of testimony in his corruption trials Wednesday, saying the accusations against him are 'idiotic.' Netanyahu, the first sitting Israeli leader to take the stand as a criminal defendant, is on trial on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. Netanyahu was supposed to testify on Tuesday, but it was canceled after he requested a postponement due to 'security reasons.' Netanyahu toured the summit of Mount Hermon, part of the Syrian buffer zone that Israeli forces seized after President Bashar Assad was ousted by rebels last week. It appeared to be the first time an Israeli leader had set foot that far into Syria. The testimony, set to take place six hours a day, three days a week for several weeks, will take up a significant chunk of Netanyahu’s working hours, prompting critics to ask if he can capably manage a country embroiled in a war on one front, containing the fallout from a second, and keeping tabs on other potential regional threats, including from Iran. Damascus airport reopens DAMASCUS, Syria — The Damascus airport reopened Wednesday for the first time since the fall of the government of Bashar Assad, and the first civilian plane took off from Damascus and landed in the northern city of Aleppo. The airport is currently open only to domestic flights, but Syrian airspace is open to international traffic. Airport officials have not yet specified when international flights will resume at the Damascus airport, but Saad Khair Bec, technical supervisor, called Wednesday’s reopening 'an important day in the life of the Syrian people ... after the fall of the former shabby regime.' State institutions have been gradually returning to work in recent days, including the main port in the coastal city of Latakia. UN migration agency head says interim Syria leaders recognize challenges ahead GENEVA — The head of the U.N. migration agency said she was reassured by commitments she heard from Syria’s new caretaker government in meetings in Damascus, as the country seeks to rebuild after more than a half-century of rule under the Assad family. Amy Pope, director-general of the International Organization for Migration, said in a phone interview Wednesday that Syria’s new leaders 'recognize the job they have ahead of them is enormous and that they need the support of the international community.' IOM estimates about 100,000 people — many looking to return to their former homes — have entered Syria from neighboring countries since Dec. 8, the day former President Bashar Assad fled the country as opposition fighters swarmed into the capital. 'We are also seeing about 85,000 people come out' into Lebanon through established border crossing points, she said. 'It’s a rough figure: There’s certainly people who cross informally and so they’re not counted.' Most of those found to be leaving are Shiite Muslims, she said. The armed groups who took control of Syria are primarily from the country’s majority Sunni Muslim community, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the terrorist-designated group that led the coalition of armed opposition groups that drove Assad from power and into asylum in Russia. 'There’s no question to me that at this moment in time, they are looking for ways to make this work, to be more inclusive, to build partnerships across the international community, to build partnerships with other governments,' Pope said of the caretaker government. 'It’s just going to be a question of whether they can deliver.' IOM said Pope was one of the first heads of a U.N. agency to visit Syria since Assad’s ouster, and she met with unspecified members of the caretaker government on Tuesday, as well as U.N. officials and advocacy groups. She reaffirmed the IOM's commitment to Syria. The organization has been providing assistance to people in the country since 2014 and is seeking $30 million in urgent aid funding for the next four months to try to help nearly 685,000 people in the northwest of the country.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-military-orders-another-gaza-evacuation-ahead-of-an-offensive/	2024-12-18T04:12:48-08:00

Russia says suspect detained in the killing of a senior general i...	Russia's security service said Wednesday that it has detained a suspect in the killing of a senior general in Moscow. The suspect was described as an Uzbek citizen recruited by Ukrainian intelligence services. Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov was killed Tuesday by a bomb hidden in a scooter outside his apartment building in Moscow, a day after Ukraine’s security service leveled criminal charges against him. His assistant also died in the attack. A Ukrainian official said the service carried out the attack. Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, didn't name the suspect, but said he was born in 1995. According to a statement by the FSB, the suspect said himself that he was recruited by Ukrainian special services. AP can’t confirm the conditions under which the suspect spoke to the security services. The FSB said the suspect had been promised a reward of $100,000 and permission to move to a European Union country in exchange for killing Kirillov. The agency stated that acting on instructions from Ukraine, the suspect traveled to Moscow, where he picked up a homemade explosive device. He placed the device on an electric scooter and parked it at the entrance to the residential building where Kirillov lived. The suspect then rented a car to monitor the location and set up a camera that livestreamed the scene to his handlers in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Once Kirillov was seen leaving the building, the suspect detonated the bomb. The suspect faces a sentence of up to life imprisonment, the FSB said. The suspect was detained in a village in the Moscow region, according to Ministry of Internal Affairs official Irina Volk, who was quoted by Russian state news agency TASS. Kirillov, 54, was the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces and was under sanctions from several countries, including the U.K. and Canada, for his actions in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. On Monday, Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, opened a criminal investigation against him, accusing him of directing the use of banned chemical weapons. Russia has denied using any chemical weapons in Ukraine and has accused Kyiv of using toxic agents in combat. Kirillov, who took his current job in 2017, was one of the most high-profile figures to level those accusations. He held numerous briefings to accuse the Ukrainian military of using toxic agents and planning to launch attacks with radioactive substances — claims that Ukraine and its Western allies rejected as propaganda. An official with the SBU said Tuesday that the agency was behind the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information, described Kirillov as a 'war criminal and an entirely legitimate target.' The SBU official provided video that they said was of the bombing. It shows two men leaving a building shortly before a blast fills the frame. Russia’s top state investigative agency said it’s looking into Kirillov’s death as a case of terrorism, and officials in Moscow vowed to punish Ukraine. The Kremlin said Wednesday that it was 'obvious' that Ukraine was behind Kirillov's killing. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Kyiv 'does not shy away from terrorist methods.' ___ Illia Novikov contributed to this report from Kyiv, Ukraine. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-says-suspect-detained-in-killing-of-senior-general-in-moscow/	2024-12-18T03:07:51-08:00	
Netanyahu says Israeli troops will occupy a buffer zone inside Sy...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israeli forces will stay in a buffer zone on the Syrian border, seized after the ouster of Syria's President Bashar Assad, until another arrangement is in place 'that ensures Israel's security.' Netanyahu made the comments from the summit of Mount Hermon — the highest peak in the area — inside Syria, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with the Israel-held Golan Heights. It appeared to be the first time a sitting Israeli leader had set foot that far into Syria. Netanyahu said he had been on the same mountaintop 53 years ago as a soldier, but the summit’s importance to Israel’s security has only increased given recent events. Israel seized a swath of southern Syria along the border with the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights days after Assad was ousted by rebels last week. Israel’s capture of the buffer zone, a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized area in Syrian territory, has sparked condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating a 1974 ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria in the wake of Assad's ouster to make a land grab. 'We will stay ... until another arrangement is found that ensures Israel’s security,' said Netanyahu who had traveled to the buffer zone on Tuesday with Defense Minister Israel Katz. Katz said he instructed the Israeli military to quickly establish a presence, including fortifications, in anticipation of what could be an extended stay in the area. 'The summit of the Hermon is the eyes of the state of Israel to identify our enemies who are nearby and far away,' he said. An Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said there is no plan to evacuate the Syrians living in villages within the buffer zone. The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. A U.N. force of about 1,100 troops had patrolled the area since then. A U.N. spokesman said Tuesday that the advance of Israeli troops, however long it lasts, violates the deal that set up the buffer zone. That agreement 'needs to be respected, and occupation is occupation, whether it lasts a week, a month or a year, it remains occupation,' spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. There was no immediate comment from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the insurgent group that led the ouster of Assad, or from Arab states. Israel still controls the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed — a move not recognized by most of the international community. Mount Hermon's summit is divided between the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, Lebanon, and Syria. Only the United States recognizes Israel’s control of the Golan Heights. With Assad gone, a top U.N. official said Tuesday that militant leaders who have taken over Syria have committed to 'an ambitious scaling-up of vital humanitarian support' for millions in desperate need of food and other aid. The leader of the insurgent HTS — Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Mohammed al-Golani — and the country's caretaker prime minister, Mohammed al-Bashir, pledged to support the movement of aid from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and other neighboring countries 'for as long as humanitarian operations are required,' said Tom Fletcher. Fletcher, who heads the the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA, spoke to the U.N. Security Council members from Damascus via a video link. Germany said Tuesday that its diplomats had also met with insurgent leaders to discuss Syria's political transition and 'our expectations regarding the protection of minorities and women’s rights.' German officials, who have noted the rebel group's history of links to al-Qaida, said they will measure the group and the new government based on its actions. The United States has previously said that its officials have been in direct contact with HTS insurgents who ousted Assad. Also Tuesday, U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces proposed that the Kurdish-majority town of Kobani in northern Syria become a demilitarized zone, and that there be a 'redistribution of security forces under American supervision and presence.' Turkey, which backs the Syrian insurgents who toppled Assad, is also battling the Syrian Kurdish militia, considering it a terror group allied with the Kurdish insurgency within its own borders. Syrian Kurdish forces were a key U.S. ally in the fight against the extremist Islamic State group. In other developments, bodies of more than 30 Syrians who vanished under Assad's rule were uncovered in a mass grave on Monday. Forensic teams and rebels worked together to unearth the remains in the village of Izraa, north of the city of Daraa, as families of the missing stood by. The relatives said they had initially hoped to find their loved ones in prison. 'But we didn’t find anyone and it broke our hearts. They were burned alive here after being doused in fuel,' said Mohammad Ghazaleh, who was waiting at the mass grave site. Some of the bodies recovered showed evidence that they had been shot in the head or burned, said Moussa Al-Zouebi, head of Izraa’s health directorate. Syria's new authorities have set up a hotline for reporting missing persons and secret detention sites. In the Syrian capital of Damascus, Qatar officially reopened its embassy on Tuesday — nearly 13 years after it severed diplomatic relations with Assad's government. Qatar had reaffirmed its 'categorical rejection of the regime’s repressive policies against the Syrian people' in a statement earlier. Most foreign embassies in Syria have been shut down since after the country’s civil war erupted in 2011. The French Embassy in Damascus raised its flag Tuesday in a 'symbolic gesture' to show support for the Syrian people during the transition. It's reopening is pending ongoing evaluation of political and security conditions, French Foreign Minister French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said. The Turkish Embassy in Damascus also recently reopened. ___ Associated Press writer Edith M.

The killing of a Russian general is one of several that Moscow bl...	Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, has claimed responsibility for killing Lt. General Igor Kirillov, head of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, in a bombing Tuesday in Moscow. Kirillov, 54, was killed alongside his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, when a bomb planted on a scooter exploded outside an apartment block. An official with the SBU said the agency was behind the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information, described Kirillov as a 'war criminal and an entirely legitimate target.' On Monday, Kirillov was charged in absentia by the SBU for 'ordering the use of banned chemical weapons against Ukraine’s Defense Forces.' Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out other high-profile attacks throughout the nearly 3-year-old war. Kyiv has hinted at its involvement but Ukrainian officials have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility. Other high-profile attacks that Russia has blamed on Ukraine: Darya Dugina TV commentator Darya Dugina, 29, was killed in August 2022 when a remote-controlled bomb planted in her SUV blew up as she drove on Moscow's outskirts. Her father, Alexander Dugin, was widely believed to be the intended target. The philosopher, writer and political theorist is an ardent supporter of the war and a prominent proponent of the ideology that emphasizes traditional values, the restoration of Russia’s power and the unity of all ethnic Russians. Ukraine denied responsibility for the attack, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying Dugina is 'not our responsibility. She is not a citizen of our country. We are not interested in her.' Russia’s Federal Security Agency, the FSB, publicly identified two suspects, Ukrainian citizens. Vladlen Tatarsky Military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky was killed in April 2023 when a bomb tore through a cafe in central St Petersburg where he had been speaking. Tatarsky, 40, supported the war in Ukraine and filed regular reports from the front for his Telegram followers. Born in the Donbas region, Ukraine’s industrial heartland, the former coal miner was convicted of bank robbery and escaped after a Russia-backed separatist rebellion engulfed the region in 2014. He joined the rebels and fought on the front line before turning to blogging. Darya Trepova, 26, was convicted of the bombing and sentenced to 27 years in prison after she was seen on camera presenting a small statue to Tatarsky that exploded shortly afterward. Trepova testified she didn’t know the gift contained a bomb. Zakhar Prilepin Nationalist Russian writer Zakhar Prilepin narrowly avoided death in a car bombing in Russia’s Nizhny Novgorod region in May 2023. His driver was killed, while Prilepin was hospitalized with broken bones, bruised lungs and other injuries. Prilepin, known for support of the war, was sanctioned by the European Union. A Ukrainian, Alexander Permyakov, was found guilty of the attack in a Russian court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Russia’s Investigative Committee accused him of working under orders from Kyiv. Stanislav Rzhitsky Former submarine commander Stanislav Rzhitsky was gunned down in July 2023 while jogging in Krasnodar, Russia. Ukrainian media reported that Rzhitsky was one of six submarine commanders able to launch the long-range missiles that hit Vinnytsia, Ukraine, a year earlier, killing 23 people and wounding over 100. When he died, Rzhitsky was deputy head of a military mobilization office in Krasnodar. Russian media outlets reported that the 42-year-old regularly used a fitness app that could have been used to track his movements, Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s main intelligence directorate, denied Kyiv's involvement in the death. However, the agency also released details about the killing, including the time of the attack and the number of shots fired. A 64-year-old Ukrainian-born man, Sergei Denisenko, was later arrested. Illia Kyva Illia Kyva, a Ukrainian lawmaker who fled to Russia shortly after the full-scale invasion, was found dead near Moscow in December 2023 with a gunshot wound to the head. A controversial political figure in Ukraine before the war, Kyva, 46, often appeared on pro-Kremlin TV talk shows and discussions. A month before his death, a Ukrainian court found him guilty in absentia of treason and sentenced him to 14 years in prison. Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence, said after Kyva’s death that 'the same fate will befall other traitors of Ukraine.' He did not say who was behind the killing. Russia’s state Investigative Committee opened a probe, but no charges have been made. Sergei Yevsyukov Sergei Yevsyukov, the former head of a prison that housed Ukrainian POWs, was killed Dec. 9 after a bomb exploded under a car in the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk, Ukrainian media reported. One other person was injured in the blast. Yevsyukov had run the Olenivka Prison, where dozens of POWs died in a missile strike in July 2022. He later was charged in absentia by Ukrainian authorities with 'mass torture.' Russian authorities said Saturday they had detained a suspect in the attack. Mikhail Shatsky Ukrainian media reported Dec. 12 that Russian missile designer Mikhail Shatsky was gunned down in a suburban Moscow park. Shatsky worked at the Moscow Experimental Design Bureau Mars, where he reportedly oversaw the modernization of cruise missiles. Several Ukrainian media outlets reported that Shatsky had been shot while walking in the Kuzminsky forest, near his home. Russian news media reported on a disturbance in the same area on the day of Shatsky’s reported death, but did not elaborate.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-the-killing-of-a-russian-general-is-one-of-several-that-moscow-blames-on-ukraine/	2024-12-17T09:15:36-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strike in Gaza kills at least 8 from ...	An Israeli strike in Gaza killed at least eight people from the same family, most of them women and children, Palestinian medics said Tuesday. The strike late Monday hit a house in Gaza City’s central neighborhood of Daraj, according to the Health Ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. Among the bodies recovered from the rubble were a father and his three children, and the children’s grandmother, according to a casualty list obtained by The Associated Press. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike. Israeli bombardment and offensives in Gaza have killed more than 45,000 Palestinians over the past 14 months, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry’s tally does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but it says more than of half the dead were women and children. Israel launched its campaign in retaliation for Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others, around 100 of whom remain in captivity. ___ Here's the latest: Israeli imports from Asia-Pacific not significantly hurt by Houthi attacks on shipping JERUSALEM — Israel’s Central Bank says imports from Asia and the Pacific have not been significantly impacted by Yemen’s Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea. A study issued by the bank found that imports to Israel in general have decreased since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. But it said the decrease was not noticeably larger for imports from the Asia-Pacific, which reach Israel via the Red Sea. The Houthis say their attacks on shipping aim to show support for Palestinians and hurt Israel. The attacks, which began in November 2023, caused a drop in cargo traffic through the Red Sea and Suez Canal, a vital route connecting Asia and Europe. Shipping companies responded by rerouting much of the traffic to the longer and more costly voyage around Africa. Egypt has reported a 24% drop in its revenues from the canal. The report released last week, by researchers Haggayi Etkes of the Bank of Israel and Nitzan Feldman, found that the value of worldwide maritime imports fell by about 35% in January compared to the period before Houthi attacks started in November 2023. But it found that the rate had recovered by May as shipping adjusted to the new routes. It said imports from Asia to Mediterranean countries including Greece, Turkey, Italy, France and Spain were harder hit than Israel by the slowdown. It said that could be because Israel imports less from Asia than those countries. It did not provide figures on the amount of the drop in trade for Israel. The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign, which also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well. Turkey says developments in Syria shouldn't distract from the war in Gaza ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey said developments in Syria should not divert attention away from what it described as the 'genocide' being committed by Israel in Gaza. A Turkish Foreign Ministry statement on Tuesday accused Israel of intensifying its attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, including on school buildings and refugee camps and of using 'starvation and infectious diseases as a weapon against the Palestinian people.' 'We reiterate our call for the necessary pressured to be exerted on Israel to ensure an immediate ceasefire agreement and uninterrupted humanitarian access to the region,' the ministry said. Iran's leader says Hezbollah and ‘axis of resistance’ will not be eradicated TEHRAN, Iran — Iran's supreme leader said that Israel is wrong to believe that it can eradicate Hezbollah in Lebanon and that an 'axis of resistance' of Tehran's allies in the region was finished. State TV quoted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as saying during a recent meeting on the occasion of Women’s Day that 'the Zionist regime, in its delusion, believes it is preparing itself through Syria to encircle and eradicate Hezbollah forces, but the one that will be eradicated is Israel.' Khamenei also added that Israel and the United States'thought the issue of resistance was over. They are gravely mistaken.' Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei meanwhile said Iran will use every opportunity to mobilize regional and international community to stop what he called Israeli aggression against neighboring countries like Syria, Yemen and others. He also said that the Syrian people are the only who can decide on their country's future after the fall of President Bashar Assad, a Tehran ally. 'Naturally, the regional countries should assist in this process without any destructive interference or any form of pressure and threats against the political actors in Syria.' Baghaei urged regional countries to put pressure on the U.N. Security Council to stop Israel’s occupation in Syria and said, 'Ultimately, the entire occupied Golan Heights of Syria must be liberated.' Israeli troops have seized a border buffer zone, sparking condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating the 1974 ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria for a land grab. Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it, though the international community except for the U.S. regards it as occupied. EU head announces an additional 1 billion euros for Turkey to help Syrian refugees ANKARA, Turkey — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Tuesday an additional 1 billion euros for Turkey to help it support millions of Syrian refugees. Speaking after a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Turkish capital, von der Leyen said the funding would help with health care and education for refugees, as well as migration and border management, including voluntary returns of Syrian refugees. She said the funds could be adjusted to meet needs that may arise as the situation in Syria evolves. Erdogan said both Turkey and the EU agree on the need to establish an inclusive government in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar Assad. 'We saw that we agree on the establishment of a participatory administration, especially on the preservation of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,' Erdogan said. He reiterated Turkey’s strong opposition to the presence in Syria of the Islamic State group or of Syrian Kurdish militia that Ankara considers to be terrorists. 'We will absolutely not allow these organizations to grow. There is no place for either the IS or the PKK and its derivatives in the future of our region,' Erdogan said, in reference to Syrian Kurdish groups that are linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, PKK. Von der Leyen emphasized the need to stay alert against the 'real' threat of the reemergence of IS in Syria. She acknowledged Turkey’s security concerns but said it was important to ensure that all minorities are safe, an apparent reference to Syrian Kurds. The Turkish leader accused the international community of failing to provide adequate support to Syrians during the long civil war. 'It is now possible to compensate for this. The way to do this is to support Syria’s construction and development efforts,' he said. UN investigators want to to preserve evidence of atrocities in Syria GENEVA — A U.N.-backed team investigating years of crimes in war-torn Syria says it has reached out to its new government and hopes to deploy to help gather and preserve evidence on the ground -- in hopes of bringing torturers, killers and other war criminals to justice one day. Robert Petit, head of the international, impartial and independent mechanism on Syria, said its team has reason to believe that mass graves exist across Syria, but exhumation, DNA collection and tests for cause of death require 'a lot of resources.' He provided no further details about any such mass graves. Petit said the government of former President Bashar Assad, who fled Syria on Dec. 8, didn’t cooperate with his team, and the change of authority offers a chance to establish the fates of 'tens of thousands of people' who died and suffered under his rule. The investigators, following Assad’s downfall, have told Syrian authorities of 'our willingness to engage and to go to Syria to fulfill our mandate,' he said. 'We are awaiting a response. And as soon as that response is forthcoming, we will deploy.' A 'monitoring cell' on the U.N.-backed team has collected recent images from social media, he said, while its sources on the ground have been able to collect new evidence and testimonies in the wake of Assad’s ouster. The mechanism was created in 2016 by the U.N. General Assembly to collect, preserve, consolidate and analyze evidence of 'serious crimes' committed in Syria since the civil war erupted in March 2011, Petit said. A U.N.-backed Commission of Inquiry is doing similar work. EU plans to reopen its office in Damascus BRUSSELS — The European Union plans to reopen its office in Damascus following 'constructive first contacts' between an envoy and Syria’s new representatives, the bloc’s top diplomat said on Tuesday. 'We are ready to reopen our delegation, which is the European embassy, and we want this to be fully operational,' EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told EU lawmakers. A diplomat from Beirut was dispatched to Damascus on Monday for talks with representatives of the new leadership and civil society in Syria. Kallas described it as 'a very important step' that would allow for 'really constructive engagement and to have the input and information from the ground as well.' After talks in Turkey with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU also wants to 'enhance our engagement in early recovery, including basic services like electricity and water and infrastructure.' British diplomats meet leader of militant group that toppled Assad LONDON — British diplomats have met the leader of the militant group that toppled Syrian leader Bashar Assad. Photographs posted by the group on social media showed senior officials, including the U.K. special representative for Syria, Ann Snow, meeting Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Mohammed al-Golani, in Damascus on Monday. Foreign Secretary David Lammy confirmed Monday that Britain had sent 'a delegation of senior U.K. officials to Damascus this week for meetings with the new Syrian authorities and members of civil society groups.' Britain, along with the U.S. and other countries, classifies HTS, a former al-Qaida affiliate, as a terrorist organization. U.K. officials have suggested they may reconsider that designation, but have not given a timeline. They say British officials can still talk to HST in the meantime. In an interview with the Times of London newspaper, Al-Sharaa urged the West to lift sanctions and said Israel should stop its strikes on Syria. 'We do not want any conflict whether with Israel or anyone else and we will not let Syria be used as a launchpad for attacks,' he was quoted as saying. 'The Syrian people need a break, and the strikes must end and Israel has to pull back to its previous positions.' An Israeli strike in Gaza kills at least 8 from same family, Palestinians say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike in Gaza killed at least eight people from the same family, most of them women and children, Palestinian medics said Tuesday. The strike late Monday hit a house in Gaza City’s central neighborhood of Daraj, according to the Health Ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. Rescuers recovered the bodies of eight people including two women and four children from under the rubble, it said. Among the dead were a father and his three children, and the children’s grandmother, according to a casualty list obtained by The Associated Press. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike. German diplomats will hold their first talks with the new Syrian government BERLIN — Germany says its diplomats will hold their first talks on Tuesday with the new Syrian government installed by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS. The Foreign Ministry in Berlin said the talks will center on an 'inclusive transition process' in Syria and the protection of minorities. The German delegation also plans to sound out the possibility of a German diplomatic presence in Damascus, and will meet representatives of Christian communities among others. The ministry said in a statement that 'we know where HTS comes from and know its origins in al-Qaida ideology,' and said that Germany is watching the activities of the group and the interim government closely. 'As far as can be said at all at this point, they are acting prudently so far,' it added. 'Like our international partners, we will measure them by their actions. Any cooperation requires that ethnic and religious minorities be protected and women’s rights respected.' The U.S. has already said that its officials have been in direct contact with HTS. Germany has been a leading destination for Syrian refugees over the past decade. Mediation efforts in northern Syria fail to reach a permanent truce, US-backed force says DAMASCUS, Syria — A U.S.-backed force in Syria says U.S.-led mediation efforts have failed to reach a permanent truce in Syria's north between the force's fighters and Turkish-backed gunmen. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said the failure to end the fighting in the northern areas of Manbij and Kobani were unsuccessful due to Turkey’s unwillingness to accept key points. 'Despite U.S. efforts to stop the war, Turkey and its mercenary militias have continued to escalate over the last period,' the SDF said. The failure of the mediation is expected to lead to a new round of fighting between the SDF and the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army in the areas of Kobani. US military says it bombed a Houthi military facility in Yemen’s capital CAIRO — The U.S. military on Tuesday said it bombed a Houthi military facility in Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, the latest U.S.-led attack on the Iranian-backed rebels. The Houthi media office said the strike hit part of the sprawling complex that houses the rebels’ Defense Ministry. There were no immediate reports of casualties. U.S. Central Command said the strike late Monday targeted a key command and control facility that was 'a hub for coordinating Houthi operations,' including attacks on U.S. Navy and merchant vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza started in October last year. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign, which has killed four sailors. The rebels have maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. Monday’s U.S. strike came hours after the Houthis said they fired a hypersonic ballistic missile toward Israel. The Houthi missile triggered sirens across the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. The Israeli military said it intercepted the missile outside Israel’s borders. However, shrapnel that the military said was likely from an Israeli interceptor missile fell on the roof of a home in east Jerusalem.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-us-military-says-it-bombed-a-houthi-military-facility-in-yemens-capital/	2024-12-17T05:30:39-08:00	
A top Russian general is killed in a Moscow bombing claimed by Uk...	A senior Russian general was killed Tuesday by a bomb hidden in a scooter outside his apartment building in Moscow, a day after Ukraine’s security service leveled criminal charges against him. A Ukrainian official said the service carried out the attack. Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed as he left for his office. Kirillov’s assistant also died in the attack. Kirillov, 54, was under sanctions from several countries, including the U.K. and Canada, for his actions in Moscow’s war in Ukraine. On Monday, Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, opened a criminal investigation against him, accusing him of directing the use of banned chemical weapons. An official with the SBU said the agency was behind the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information, described Kirillov as a 'war criminal and an entirely legitimate target.' The SBU has said it recorded more than 4,800 occasions when Russia used chemical weapons on the battlefield since its full-scale invasion in February 2022. In May, the U.S. State Department said that it had recorded the use of chloropicrin, a poison gas first deployed in World War I, against Ukrainian troops. Russia has denied using any chemical weapons in Ukraine and, in turn, has accused Kyiv of using toxic agents in combat. Kirillov, who took his current job in 2017, was one of the most high-profile figures to level those accusations. He held numerous briefings to accuse the Ukrainian military of using toxic agents and planning to launch attacks with radioactive substances — claims that Ukraine and its Western allies rejected as propaganda. The bomb used in Tuesday's attack was triggered remotely, according to Russian news reports. Images from the scene showed shattered windows and scorched brickwork. The SBU official provided video that they said was of the bombing. It shows two men leaving a building shortly before a blast fills the frame. Russia’s top state investigative agency said it's looking into Kirillov’s death as a case of terrorism, and officials in Moscow vowed to punish Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council chaired by President Vladimir Putin, described the attack as an attempt by Kyiv to distract public attention from its military failures and vowed that its 'senior military-political leadership will face inevitable retribution.' In the past year, Russia has been on the front foot in the war, grinding deeper into the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine despite heavy losses. Ukraine tried to change the dynamic with an incursion into Russia's Kursk region, but it has continued to slowly lose ground on its own territory. Since Russia invaded, several prominent figures have been killed in targeted attacks believed to have been carried out by Ukraine. Darya Dugina, a commentator on Russian TV channels and the daughter of Kremlin-linked nationalist ideologue Alexander Dugin, died in a 2022 car bombing that investigators suspected was aimed at her father. Vladlen Tatarsky, a popular military blogger, died in April 2023, when a statuette given to him at a party in St. Petersburg exploded. A Russian woman, who said she presented the figurine on orders of a contact in Ukraine, was convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison. In December 2023, Illia Kiva, a former pro-Moscow Ukrainian lawmaker who fled to Russia, was shot and killed near Moscow. The Ukrainian military intelligence lauded the killing, warning that other 'traitors of Ukraine' would share the same fate. On Dec. 9, a bomb planted under a car in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Donetsk killed Sergei Yevsyukov, the former head of the Olenivka Prison where dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war died in a missile strike in July 2022. One other person was injured in the blast. Russian authorities said they detained a suspect in the attack. ___ Associated Press writer Illia Novikov contributed from Kyiv, Ukraine.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-the-head-of-russias-nuclear-defense-forces-has-been-killed-in-an-explosion-in-moscow/	2024-12-17T05:28:00-08:00	
Grassroots funding for Ukraine's military declines as groups look...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The concert took place in an old movie studio in Kyiv, the location kept secret until the final moment in case it was the target of a Russian attack. More than 1,000 soldiers and young people gathered to listen to the artists who joined forces with a military brigade in an innovative effort to raise funds for Ukraine’s embattled troops. This was the first and only live performance of the charity album 'Epoch,' a collaboration between the 3rd Assault Brigade and eight Ukrainian bands. The project’s ambitious target is to raise 50 million hryvnias (about $1.2 million) to buy an M113 armored personnel carrier to help get infantry to the front and evacuate the wounded for medical treatment. Since it launched on streaming platforms a month ago, the initiative has raised 9 million hryvnias (around $214,000). Grassroots fundraising for Ukrainian fighters dates back to 2014, the year Russia first annexed the southern region of Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists launched an uprising in eastern Ukraine. At that time, Ukraine’s defense was made up of a regular army supported by volunteer battalions who weren't financially supported by Kyiv’s government. Self-funding was critical. Now, advertisements pasted along the sidewalk in Kyiv ask for donations to help fill financial gaps across the military. By scanning a QR code, people can help buy anything from body warmers and drones to armored cars for soldiers defending the nearly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line. But some charities are seeing a decline in individual donations in part because of the economic situation in the country. Oleksandr Borodyn, one of the project's organizers, says the idea for the collaboration came from the challenge of continuing to drum up funds to support troops as the war is on the cusp of marking a three-year milestone. 'To raise the same amount of money as at the beginning of the war, you need much more effort. That’s why we came up with the idea that a musician could donate his or her art, and that art would earn money for the army,' said Borodyn, a press officer for the 3rd Assault Brigade. The initiative comes as U.S. President Joe Biden is rushing out billions of dollars more in military aid before Washington's support for Kyiv’s defenses is thrown into question when Donald Trump takes office next month. Monobank, one of the largest platforms to process donations, says that in the first 1,000 days of war, nearly 10.5 million unique users made donations totaling around 77 billion hryvnias (about $1.8 billion) to various fundraising organizations. But some charity groups are finding that voluntary funding isn't what it was in the first year of the full-scale invasion. The Come Back Alive foundation supports troops with anything from military training to buying drones and electronic warfare to repel attacks. In the first year of the conflict, they raised more than 5.7 billion hryvnias ($184 million). So far in 2024, the figure is nearly 3.6 billion hryvnias ($89 million). 'Many people report a worsening financial situation, which limits their ability to contribute to supporting the military,' said Oleh Karpenko, deputy director of the Come Back Alive Foundation. Three years of war has had a devastating impact on Ukraine’s economy. According to a World Bank report released in May, the number of Ukrainians living in poverty has grown by 1.8 million since 2020 to about 9 million, or 29% of the population. To help the most vulnerable, the government launched a winter support program at the beginning of December and within days, around 6.5 million people had applied to receive the one off 1,000 hryvnia ($24) payment to help cover utilities, medical services and cellphone costs. According to Karpenko, local initiatives and smaller-scale fundraising efforts mean many people direct their contributions toward helping specific soldiers or military units they know personally. That reduces the amount received by larger organizations, which he says can promptly address urgent battlefield needs that the government can't meet. 'International support also plays a significant role in donation levels,' Karpenko said. 'When aid from international partners decreases, it strongly demotivates Ukrainian society. People lose motivation to donate when they perceive a lack of willingness from partners to actively supply weapons.' Staring up at the large monitors set up on either side of the stage in the form of the three diagonal line symbol of the 3rd Assault Brigade, 26-year-old Oksana Kalenchenko thinks that events like the concert are hugely important in continuing to generate support. 'It’s a reminder to somebody that there is a war going on in Ukraine, let’s keep donating, let’s keep doing everything we can,' Kalenchenko said. The collaboration album features young artists from Ukraine’s rock, rap and alternative scene, and many of the lyrics reflect events and the reality of living through the conflict. 'We want to show the reflection of contemporary artists to the situation in Ukraine, and in general to Ukraine at war … That’s why the project is called ‘Epoch,’ because it is a transmission of the era we are living in,' Borodyn said. What also unites all the songs is language. Since the start of the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, Ukrainian music has experienced somewhat of a revival with many artists shunning the traditional Russian pop scene that dominated the post-Soviet era. 'People did not pay attention to Ukrainian music in such a large number,' says Iryna Panchuk, singer and songwriter for 'Renie Cares,' one of the bands on the album. 'This is separation, because this is what makes us different from Russia and this needs to be emphasized very strongly — emphasized and strengthened,' she added. ___ Alex Babenko contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-grassroots-funding-for-ukraines-military-declines-as-groups-looks-for-creative-ways-to-raise-money/	2024-12-16T21:04:22-08:00	
Trump says it was 'stupid' for Biden to let Ukraine use US weapon...	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he may reverse President Joe Biden's recent decision to allow Ukrainian forces to use American long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory. Trump called the decision made by Biden last month 'stupid.' He also expressed anger that his incoming administration was not consulted before Biden made the move. With the loosening of the restrictions, Biden gave Ukraine long-sought permission to use the Army Tactical Missile System provided by the U.S. to strike Russian positions hundreds miles from its border. 'I don’t think that should have been allowed, not when there’s a possibility — certainly not just weeks before I take over,' Trump said during at a wide-ranging news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort. 'Why would they do that without asking me what I thought? I wouldn’t have had him do that. I think it was a big mistake.' Trump's withering criticism of the Biden administration's move comes as the Democratic administration aims to push every last dollar already designated for Ukraine out the door to help repel Russia's invasion before Trump takes office on Jan. 20, with future aid uncertain. But even as Biden tries to surge weaponry and other aid to Ukraine in his final five weeks in office, the moment underscored that it's Trump who holds the most significant influence over how Ukraine can use its U.S.-provided arsenal in the long run. It’s a critical piece of leverage he could use to try to follow through on his campaign pledge to bring about a swift end to the conflict. Asked if he would consider reversing the Biden administration decision, Trump responded: 'I might. I think it was a very stupid thing to do.' The White House pushed back on Trump’s criticism, noting that the decision was made after months of deliberations that started before last month’s election. 'All I can assure you is that in the conversations we’ve had with them since the election, and we’ve had at various levels, we have articulated to them the logic behind it, the thinking behind it, why we were doing it,' White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said of the current administration's coordination with the outgoing administration. Trump's relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. Trump publicly sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence officials on whether Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to help him, and Trump has praised the Russian leader and even called him 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine. Vice President-elect JD Vance has said that while the U.S. has differences with Russia, it was counterproductive to approach Moscow as an enemy. Trump on Monday reiterated his call on both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war, calling the death and despair caused by the conflict 'carnage.' But Trump also appeared to acknowledge that finding an immediate endgame to the war — something he has previously said he could get done within 24 hours of taking office — could be difficult. 'I think the Middle East will be in a good place,' Trump said, referring to the conflict in Gaza and an unsettled Syria following the ouster of Bashar al-Assad. 'I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation.' Trump declined to say whether he has spoken with Putin since the election. Zelenskyy met with Trump in Paris earlier this month, while the president-elect was visiting France for the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials have been making a forceful effort to get Trump to maintain support for Ukraine. But the situation on the ground in Ukraine continues to remain complicated as both sides wrestle for a battlefield advantage that will give them leverage in any negotiations to end the nearly three-year war. The Pentagon last week unveiled U.S. intelligence that predicts Russia could again launch its lethal new intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine soon. Putin deployed the missile for the first time last month days after Biden loosened the restrictions on Ukraine. Putin warned the West that Russia's next use could be against Ukraine’s NATO allies who allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Biden agreed to loosen the restrictions after Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters had pressed Biden for months. They argued that the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids. The outgoing president ultimately made the decision last month amid concerns about Russia deploying thousands of North Korean troops to help it claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-trump-says-it-was-stupid-for-biden-to-let-ukraine-use-us-weapons-to-strike-deeper-into-russia/	2024-12-16T15:58:04-08:00	
Negotiators say Israel and Hamas are inching toward a ceasefire d...	After months of deadlock, Israel and Hamas appear to be moving closer toward a ceasefire to end their 14-month war. Top officials from the U.S., Qatar and Egypt have resumed their mediation efforts in recent weeks and reported greater willingness by the warring sides to wrap up a deal. In a key concession, Hamas officials say they are prepared to show more 'flexibility' on the timing of an Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza, and Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, said Monday that a deal is closer than ever. Officials on all sides have cautioned that key details must still be worked out. But there is a general sense of optimism that has been lacking for many months. The changing sentiment appears to be the result of several factors. Israel has inflicted heavy damage on Hamas over the course of the war. The group is more isolated after Hezbollah’s ceasefire with Israel, and Iran, a key backer of both militant groups, has suffered a number of setbacks, highlighted by the downfall of its close ally, Syria’s Bashar Assad. In the U.S., both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump have signaled they want a deal completed before the Jan. 20 inauguration. According to Egyptian and Hamas officials, the agreement would take place in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of captive Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. Israel says Hamas is holding 100 hostages — over one-third of whom are believed to be dead. Here is a closer look at the emerging deal, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing closed negotiations. Preliminary ceasefire The first phase would last from six to eight weeks. During that time, Hamas would release some 30 hostages – roughly half of those believed alive. They include three or four dual U.S.-Israeli citizens. Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including as many as 100 who are serving long sentences for alleged involvement in bloody attacks. Increased aid The deal calls for a massive increase in aid to Gaza, which has plunged into a humanitarian crisis during the 14-month war. An estimated 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced, in many cases multiple times, and aid workers report severe hunger across the territory. This is expected to include a reopening of the territory’s Rafah crossing with Egypt, which has been closed since Israeli ground troops invaded the southern border town in May. The crossing is especially important because it is the primary exit point for Palestinians in Gaza who want to travel abroad, and the only one not controlled by Israel. Mediators say they are considering a return to a 2005 agreement that allowed the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority to operate the crossing with European Union observers. That agreement collapsed when Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 and expelled the Palestinian Authority forces. Israeli troop withdrawals During the first phase, Israeli troops would withdraw from some Palestinian population centers, allowing many Palestinians to begin returning home. But Israeli troops wouldn't leave Gaza altogether at this stage. They would remain along the Philadelphi corridor – a strategic strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Ending the war During the initial ceasefire, the sides would continue negotiations on a permanent agreement, to include an end to the war, full withdrawal of Israeli troops, and release of remaining hostages and bodies held by Hamas. Talks would begin on final arrangements for Gaza, including who would govern the territory and plans for rebuilding the destruction.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-negotiators-say-israel-and-hamas-are-inching-toward-a-ceasefire-deal-this-is-what-it-may-look-like/	2024-12-16T14:13:34-08:00	
Ukraine: Around 30 North Korean troops killed, wounded in Russia'...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s military intelligence agency claimed Monday that around 30 North Korean troops were killed or wounded in fighting against the Ukrainian army at the weekend in Russia’s Kursk border region. This is the first reported casualties since the Pentagon and Ukraine announced North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia to help it in the almost 3-year war. The casualties occurred around three villages in Kursk, where Russia has for four months been trying to quash a Ukrainian incursion, the agency, known by its acronym GUR, said in a public post on the Telegram messaging app. At least three North Korean servicemen went missing around another Kursk village, GUR said. It was not possible to independently verify the Ukrainian claims. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred related questions to the Russian Defense Ministry, which didn’t immediately comment. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has pledged unwavering support for Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor under a mutual defense pact. The alliance gave a jolt to international relations, and Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that the planned deployment of U.S. intermediate-range missiles to Europe and Asia has brought new threats. 'In view of rising geopolitical tensions, we must take additional measures to ensure the security of Russia and our allies,' Putin told a meeting with top military brass. 'We are doing it accurately and in a balanced way to avoid being drawn into a full-scale arms race.' However, military analysts say the language barrier has bedeviled combat coordination between Russian and North Korean troops. 'The poor integration and ongoing communication problems between Russian and North Korean forces will likely continue to cause friction in Russian military operations in Kursk … in the near term,' the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said late Sunday. On Nov. 5, Ukrainian officials said that their forces had for the first time engaged with North Korean units that had been recently deployed to help Russia. Ukraine seized land in Russia’s Kursk border region last August in what was the first occupation of Russian territory since World War II. The operation embarrassed the Kremlin and aimed to counter unceasingly glum news from the front line. The incursion hasn’t significantly changed the war’s dynamics. Over the past year, Russia has been on the front foot, with the exception of Kursk, and has been grinding deeper into eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region despite heavy losses. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said Monday the military has been making steady gains in Ukraine, claiming that they have accelerated recently, with Russian forces capturing about 30 square kilometers (11.5 square miles) of territory a day.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ukraine-around-30-north-korean-troops-killed-wounded-in-russias-kursk-region/	2024-12-16T07:18:45-08:00

Death toll in Gaza Strip from Israel-Hamas war tops 45,000, Pales...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 14-month war between Israel and Hamas militants has topped 45,000 people, Palestinian health officials said Monday, with 52 dead arriving at hospitals across the bombed-out strip over the past 24 hours. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. With the death toll mounting ever higher, efforts to reach a ceasefire have picked up in recent weeks after repeatedly faltering. Qatar, Egypt and the United States have renewed their efforts to broker a deal at senior levels in recent days. Mediators have said there appears to be more willingness from both sides to conclude a ceasefire. The Health Ministry said 45,028 people have been killed and 106,962 have been wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are still buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. The latest war has been by far the deadliest round of fighting between Israel and Hamas, with the death toll now amounting to roughly 2% of Gaza’s entire prewar population of about 2.3 million. A family is among the dead as another airstrike hits a shelter Among the dead reported in the overall toll were 10 people, including a family of four, who were killed in an overnight Israeli strike in Gaza City, Palestinian medics said. The strike late Sunday hit a house in Gaza City’s eastern Shijaiyah neighborhood, according to the Health Ministry’s emergency service. Rescuers recovered the bodies of 10 people from under the rubble, including those of two parents and their two children, it said. Israel claims Hamas is responsible for the civilian death toll because it operates from within civilian areas in the densely populated Gaza Strip. Rights groups and Palestinians say Israel has failed to take sufficient precautions to avoid civilian deaths. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel responded by heavy bombardment and a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. A separate strike on a school on Sunday in the southern city of Khan Younis killed at least 13 people, including six children and two women, according to Nasser Hospital where the bodies were taken. The hospital initially reported the strike had killed 16 people, but it later revised the death toll as the three other bodies had been from a separate strike that hit a house. Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, the United Nations relief agency for Palestinians, said she met with children injured in Sunday’s strike on the the school turned shelter. They included a 17-year-old girl who suffered a severe leg injury and shrapnel wounds. She survived along with her twin sister and three other sisters, Wateridge said. Their mother died and Wateridge said one of the sisters described 'how their mother’s bones were crushed under the rubble. There was nothing they could do to save her.' Wateridge also met with two siblings aged 2 and 5 at Nasser Hospital where the casualties were taken. Both children have severe head and body injuries, with 2-year-old Julia losing sight in her eye. 'There is nothing we can do. We are already waiting for the next attack,' Wateridge quoted a doctor as telling her. The Israeli military said it had 'conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists who were operating inside a command and control center embedded within a compound' that had served as a school in Khan Younis. It did not provide evidence. A Palestinian journalist killed in an airstrike is mourned In central Gaza's Nuseirat urban refugee camp, mourners gathered for the funeral of a Palestinian journalist working for the Qatari-based Al Jazeera TV network who was killed Sunday in a strike on a point for Gaza's civil defense agency. They carried his body through the street from the hospital, his blue bulletproof vest resting atop. The strike also killed three civil defense workers, including the local head of the agency, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The civil defense is Gaza’s main rescue agency and operates under the Hamas-run government. Al Jazeera said Ahmad Baker Al-Louh, 39, had been covering rescue operations of a family wounded in an earlier bombing when he was killed. The International Federation of Journalists said last week that 104 journalists and media workers have been killed so far in 2024, with more than half of them perishing during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The group said that since the Oct. 7, 2023, start of the war, at least 138 had been killed, including 55 Palestinian media professionals in the calendar year. The Israeli military said its strike had targeted Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants 'who were operating in a command and control center embedded in the offices of the ‘Civil Defense’ organization in Nuseirat.' It accused the journalist of having been a member of Islamic Jihad, an accusation his colleagues in Gaza denied. Gaza's civil defense also rejected the claims that militants had been operating from the site. 'We were stunned by the Israeli occupation statement,' Mahmoud al-Lawh, the journalist’s cousin, told The Associated Press. 'These claims are lies and misleading to cover up this crime.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israeli-strikes-in-gaza-kill-at-least-10-people-including-a-family-palestinian-officials-say/	2024-12-16T03:44:23-08:00	
Israel will close its Ireland embassy over Gaza tensions as Pales...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel said Sunday it will close its embassy in Ireland as relations deteriorated over the war in Gaza, where Palestinian medical officials said new Israeli airstrikes killed over 46 people including several children. The decision to close the embassy came in response to what Israel’s foreign minister has described as Ireland’s 'extreme anti-Israel policies.' In May, Israel recalled its ambassador to Dublin after Ireland announced, along with Norway, Spain and Slovenia, it would recognize a Palestinian state. The Irish Cabinet last week decided to formally intervene in South Africa’s case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, which accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Israel denies it. 'We are concerned that a very narrow interpretation of what constitutes genocide leads to a culture of impunity in which the protection of civilians is minimized,' said Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, Micheal Martin. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar's statement on the embassy closure said 'Ireland has crossed every red line in its relations with Israel.' Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris called the decision to close the embassy 'deeply regrettable.' He added on X: 'I utterly reject the assertion that Ireland is anti-Israel. Ireland is pro-peace, pro-human rights and pro-international law.' Israeli strikes in Gaza kill a journalist and children Israeli forces continued Sunday to pound Gaza, including the largely isolated north, as the Palestinian death toll in the war approached 45,000. A large explosion lit up the southern Gaza skyline on Sunday night. An Israeli airstrike hit a school and killed at least 16 people in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital, where the bodies were taken. There was no immediate Israeli military statement. In the north, an airstrike hit the Khalil Aweida school in the town of Beit Hanoun and killed at least 15 people, according to nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital where casualties were taken. The dead included two parents and their daughter and a father and his son, the hospital said. And in Gaza City, at least 17 people including six women and five children were killed in three airstrikes that hit houses sheltering displaced people, according to Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital. 'We woke up to the strike. I woke up with the rubble on top of me,' said a bandaged Yahia al-Yazji, who grieved for his wife and daughter. 'I found my wife with her head and skull visible, and my daughter’s intestines were gone. My wife was three months pregnant.' His hand rested on a body wrapped in a blanket on the floor. Israel's military in a statement said it struck a 'terrorist cell' in Gaza City and a 'terrorist meeting point' in the Beit Hanoun area. Another Israeli airstrike killed a Palestinian journalist working for Al Jazeera, Ahmed al-Lawh, in central Gaza, a hospital and the Qatari-based TV station said. The strike hit a point for Gaza’s civil defense agency in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp, Al-Awda Hospital said. Also killed were three civil defense workers including the local head of the agency, according to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital. The civil defense is Gaza's main rescue agency and operates under the Hamas-run government. One of the bodies was covered with an orange work jacket marked 'ambulance' in English. 'We, the civil defense, are carrying out humanitarian work like in any country in the world. Why are we being targeted?' said colleague Kerem Al Dalou. Israel’s military said it struck a militant command center embedded in the civil defense offices. The war in Gaza began after Hamas and other militants from Gaza stormed southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking well over 200 hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed almost 45,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry’s count does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but it says over half of the dead have been women and children. Most of Gaza's population of over 2 million has been displaced, often multiple times. The hospitals that are still functioning say they lack medicines, fuel and other basic supplies, while aid groups warn of widespread hunger. The head of the World Food Program, Cindy McCain, told CBS on Sunday that the U.N. agency was able to get just two trucks of supplies into Gaza in November, citing insecurity there. 'We need a ceasefire, and we need it now,' she said. 'We can no longer sit by and just allow these people to starve to death.' ___ Melzer reported from Nahariya, Israel.

Ukrainian drones strike Russia as Kyiv reels from consecutive mas...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drone strikes on southern Russia killed a 9-year-old boy and set fire to a major oil terminal, officials said Saturday, the day after Moscow launched a massive aerial attack on its neighbor that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was one of the heaviest bombardments of the country’s energy sector in the nearly three-year war. The boy died when a drone struck his family’s home outside Belgorod, a Russian city near the border with Ukraine, local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported on Saturday morning on the Telegram messaging app. His mother and 7-month-old sister were hospitalized with injuries, Gladkov said. He posted photos of what he said was the aftermath of the attack, showing a low-rise house with gaping holes in its roof and front wall flanked by mounds of rubble. Elsewhere in southern Russia, Ukrainian drones overnight hit a major oil terminal in the Oryol region, sparking a blaze, Ukraine’s General Staff reported. Photos published by the General Staff and on Russian Telegram news channels showed huge plumes of smoke engulfing the facility, backlit by an orange glow. Oryol Gov. Andrey Klychkov confirmed that a Ukrainian drone strike set fire to a fuel depot. He said later the blaze had been contained and that there were no casualties. Russia’s Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces shot down 37 Ukrainian drones over the country’s south and west the previous night. Russia pummels Ukrainian energy targets The Ukrainian strikes came a day after Russia fired 93 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 drones at its neighbor, further battering Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, around half of which has been destroyed during the war. Rolling electricity blackouts are common and widespread, and Zelenskyy charged Friday that Moscow is 'terrorizing millions of people' with such assaults. According to Ukraine’s air force, Russia kept up its drone attacks on Saturday, launching 132 across Ukrainian territory. Fifty-eight drones were shot down and a further 72 veered off course, likely due to electronic jamming, it said. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces used long-range precision missiles and drones on 'critically important fuel and energy facilities in Ukraine that ensure the functioning of the military industrial complex.' The strike was in retaliation for Wednesday’s Ukrainian attack using U.S.-supplied the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, on a Russian air base, it said. Kyiv’s Western allies have provided Ukraine with air defense systems to help it protect critical infrastructure, but Russia has sought to overwhelm the air defenses with combined strikes involving large numbers of missiles and drones called 'swarms.' Russia has held the initiative this year as its military has steadily rammed through Ukrainian defenses in the east in a series of slow but steady offensives. But uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether vital U.S. military support for Kyiv will continue. North Koreans reportedly in combat in Kursk Zelenskyy said Saturday that a 'significant number' of North Korean troops were being deployed by Moscow in assaults in Russia’s southern Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have held on following a stunning cross-border incursion this summer. In a televised address, Zelenskyy said that North Korean soldiers have so far not entered the fight on Ukrainian soil, but claimed they are already taking 'noticeable' losses. Elsewhere, Ukrainian officials reported that Russian shelling on Friday and overnight killed at least two civilians and wounded 14 others in front-line areas Ukraine’s south and northeast. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukrainian-drones-strike-russia-as-kyiv-reels-from-consecutive-massive-air-attacks/	2024-12-14T08:38:42-08:00	
Russia targets Ukrainian infrastructure with a massive attack by ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a massive aerial attack against Ukraine on Friday, firing 93 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 drones, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, describing it as one of the heaviest bombardments of the country's energy sector since Russia's full-scale invasion almost three years ago. Ukrainian defenses shot down 81 missiles, including 11 cruise missiles that were intercepted by F-16 warplanes provided by Western allies earlier this year, Zelenskyy said. Russia is 'terrorizing millions of people' with such assaults, he said on his Telegram channel, renewing his plea for international unity against Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'A strong reaction from the world is needed: a massive strike – a massive reaction. This is the only way to stop terror,' Zelenskyy said. But uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether vital U.S. military support for Kyiv will continue. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry said the Russian military used long-range precision missiles and drones on 'critically important fuel and energy facilities in Ukraine that ensure the functioning of the military industrial complex.' The strike was in retaliation for Wednesday’s Ukrainian attack using U.S.-supplied the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, on a Russian air base, it said. Trump said in an interview published in TIME magazine on Thursday that he was against allowing Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil using U.S. provided weapons. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Trump’s stance 'conforms to our position.' 'In this case, we have a shared vision of causes of escalation and that is positive. Obviously, Trump realizes what escalates the conflict,' Peskov told reporters. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Friday’s attack also targeted transport networks and other key facilities. Ukraine’s biggest private energy company, DTEK, said the attack 'seriously damaged' its thermal power plants. Russia has repeatedly attempted to cripple Ukraine's electricity system in an effort to break the will of civilians left in the dark with no running water or heating and to disrupt Ukrainian defense manufacturing. Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said energy workers were doing everything necessary to 'minimize negative consequences for the energy system,' promising to release more details on damages once the security situation allowed it. Ukraine’s air force reported multiple strike drones launched at Ukraine overnight followed by swarms of cruise missiles in the country’s air space. It said Russia also used air-launched ballistic Kinzhal missiles against Ukraine’s western regions. A similar massive attack on Nov. 28 involved about 200 missiles and drones and left more than a million households without power until emergency teams restored supplies. Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia is stockpiling cruise and ballistic missiles for more attacks. On Nov. 21, Russia for the first time used an intermediate range hypersonic ballistic missile to strike an industrial plant in the city of Dnipro, in eastern Ukraine. Putin described the attack with the Oreshnik missile as retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with longer-range Western weapons. He declared that more attacks with the new weapon could follow, and U.S. officials warned Wednesday that the Oreshnik could be used again in coming days. There was no immediate sign one was launched in Friday's attack. Around half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been destroyed during the war, and rolling electricity blackouts are common and widespread.

Russia has held the initiative this year as its military has steadily rammed through Ukrainian defenses in the east in a series of slow but steady offensives. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-launches-a-massive-aerial-attack-against-ukraine-with-dozens-of-cruise-missiles-and-drones/	2024-12-13T03:32:16-08:00	
Syria faces crisis and Gaza heads toward famine, World Food Progr...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The deputy executive director of the U.N. World Food Program has been on whirlwind visits to hotspots in the Middle East and Sudan to assess dire humanitarian situations and escalating demands for food from millions of people trapped or fleeing conflicts. But Carl Skau said in an interview with The Associated Press this week that the Rome-based agency has been forced to make major cuts to the numbers of people it can help because of a lack of funding. WFP is working to diversify its funding, including targeting the private sector, but Skau said, 'it’s going to be a tough time ahead, no doubt, with increasing gaps.' 'Needs continue to rise, and the funding does not even remain stable at the levels we have currently,' he said. ‘A triple crisis’ in Syria Syria is facing the fallout from a 13-year civil war, the surge in arrivals from the recent Israel-Hezbollah war in neighboring Lebanon, and rebels unexpectedly ousting longtime leader Bashar Assad, Skau said. Even before Lebanon and the end of the Assad family’s more than 50-year rule, he said 3 million people were acutely food insecure and very hungry. But the agency was only providing food aid to 2 million because of funding cuts. Now, Skau said, 'it’s a triple crisis, and the needs are going to be massive.' While the situation in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, is 'quite calm and orderly,' he said there is still uncertainty in the capital, Damascus, where markets are disrupted, currency values have dropped, food prices are going up and transport isn’t working. This means a bigger humanitarian response in the short term. In the next phase, the U.N. will be focusing on Syria’s recovery and ultimately its reconstruction, Skau said. Gaza is heading toward famine Skau says the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza is dire but he’s equally worried about southern Gaza, 'if not even more,' because of the million or so people on the beach north of Khan Younis as winter approaches. In northern areas, where the U.N. estimates there are still 65,000 Palestinians and no aid has arrived for more than two months, Skau said Israeli military operations, lawlessness and taking of food aid have prevented access to the needy. He said some humanitarian convoys have gotten through to the broader northern area including Gaza City, where the U.N. estimates some 300,000 people are located. In the south, Skau said, WFP assisted around 1.2 million people in June, July, August and into September. In October and November, only one-third of that number — 400,000 Palestinians — got aid. At the same time, the entry of essential commercial goods was very little compared with the summer months, Skau said. He blamed the limited number of entry points and the inability to move food to WFP warehouses as well as the 'total breakdown of civil and public order.' Skau said international famine experts reported three weeks ago that if nothing changed there would be famine in Gaza, 'and I think that’s where we’re heading.' Sudan is the world’s largest humanitarian crisis The needs are overwhelming: 25 million people in war-torn Sudan are acutely food insecure, with famine declared in the huge Zam Zam camp for the displaced in western Darfur. Skau cited progress over the past month in getting clearances to deliver aid across conflict lines and the border from Chad. And with roads drying up at the end of the rainy season, WFP is able to deliver 'much more food.' One convoy reached Zam Zam camp and two others were on the way but have been held up because of fighting in the past 10 days in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, Skau said. It is the only capital in Darfur still held by Sudanese forces. The others are held by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including western Darfur. WFP reached some 2.6 million people this month, Skau said, stressing that the international community should have done more to address the Sudan crisis 'and needs to do more going forward.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-syria-faces-crisis-and-gaza-heads-toward-famine-world-food-program-official-says/	2024-12-12T15:04:10-08:00	
Israeli strike in Gaza kills 25 people as US makes new push for a...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli airstrike hit the central Gaza Strip on Thursday, killing at least 25 Palestinians and wounding dozens more, Palestinian medics said, just hours after President Joe Biden’s national security adviser raised hopes about a ceasefire deal to end the war in Gaza. Officials at two hospitals in the Gaza Strip, al-Awda Hospital in the north and al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza, reported they received a combined total of 25 bodies from an Israeli strike on a multistory residential building in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp. Palestinian medics also reported that over 40 people, most of them children, were receiving treatment at the two hospitals. The al-Aqsa Hospital said that the Israeli attack also damaged several nearby houses in Nuseirat. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the deadly strike. Israel is trying to eliminate Hamas, which led the attack on southern Israel in October 2023 that sparked the war in Gaza. The Israeli military says Hamas militants hide among Gaza’s civilian population. Photos from the site showed a completely collapsed building with people walking through its mangled and charred remains, smoke rising from piles of belongings strewn over the rubble. The bombardment came just hours after Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, told reporters in Jerusalem that Israel’s ceasefire in Lebanon has helped clear the way for another deal to end the war in Gaza. He plans to travel next to Qatar and Egypt, key mediators in the ceasefire talks, as the Biden administration makes a final push on negotiations before Donald Trump is inaugurated. Sullivan said 'Hamas’ posture at the negotiating table did adapt' after Israel decimated the leadership of its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon and reached a ceasefire there. 'We believe it puts us in a position to close this negotiation,' he said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israeli-strike-in-central-gaza-kills-at-least-25-people/	2024-12-12T12:27:38-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli airstrikes kill 28 in Gaza, including...	Palestinian medical officials say Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 28 people in the Gaza Strip, including seven children and a woman, hours after the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. One of the strikes overnight and into Thursday flattened a house in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the casualties were taken. Two other strikes killed 15 men who were part of local committees established to secure aid convoys. The committees were set up by displaced Palestinians in coordination with the Hamas-run Interior Ministry. On Wednesday, the U.N. General Assembly approved resolutions demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and expressing support for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, although they reflect world opinion. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,800 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the latest: Paraguay reopens embassy in Jerusalem in diplomatic victory for Netanyahu JERUSALEM — Paraguay reopened its embassy in Jerusalem Thursday, becoming one of a small handful of nations to recognize the city as Israel’s capital and marking a diplomatic victory for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel’s international isolation has increased as the war in Gaza drags on, and Paraguay was the first country to move its embassy to Jerusalem since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack that kickstarted the war. The United States, Honduras, Guatemala, Kosovo, and Papua New Guinea are among the few countries with Jerusalem embassies. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in 1967 but it wasn’t recognized by the international community, and most countries run their embassies out of Tel Aviv. Spirits were high at the ceremony marking the embassy’s inauguration Thursday, with Netanyahu and Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar lavishing praise on Paraguayan President Santiago Pena. 'My good friend Santiago,' said Netanyahu, addressing Pena. 'We’re a small nation. You’re a small nation. We suffered horrible things but we overcame the odds of history…we can win and we are winning.' Paraguay had an embassy in Jerusalem in 2018, under Former President Horacio Cartes. That embassy was moved back to Tel Aviv by Cartes’ successor, Mario Abdo Benitez, prompting Israel to close its embassy in Asuncion. Saar said Israel and Paraguay shared a 'friendship based not only on interests but also values and principles.' He and the Paraguayan foreign minister, Rubén Ramírez Lezcano, signed a series of bilateral agreements and Saar said he would soon visit Asunción with a delegation from the Israeli private sector. 'Israel is going to win and the countries we are standing next to Israel, we are going to win,' Pena said. US Secretary of State Blinken renews calls for inclusion, stability in Syria in Mideast visit AQABA, Jordan — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is renewing calls for Syria’s new leadership to respect women and minority rights, prevent extremists from gaining new footholds in the country and keeping suspected chemical weapons stocks secure as he makes his first visit to the Mideast since the weekend ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Making his 12th trip to the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war erupted lasted year but amid fresh concerns about security following the upheaval in Syria, Blinken emphasized Thursday to Jordan’s King Abdullah II U.S. 'support for an inclusive transition that can lead to an accountable and representative Syrian government chosen by the Syrian people,' the State Department said. Blinken also repeated the importance the outgoing Biden administration puts on respect for human rights and international law, the protection of civilians and stopping terrorist groups from reconstituting. Blinken met with the monarch and Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi in Aqaba before traveling to Turkey for talks with Turkish officials on the situation in Syria and the urgency of securing a long-elusive deal to release hostages and end the fighting in Gaza that has devastated the Palestinian territory since October 2023. Abdullah told Blinken that 'the first step to reach comprehensive regional calm is to end the Israeli war on Gaza.' UN envoy urges authorities to collect evidence from Syrian detention centers GENEVA — The U.N. envoy for Syria is calling on authorities to save evidence from detention centers that were a hub of 'unimaginable barbarity' that Syrians have faced for many years and cooperate with international investigators looking into such crimes. Geir Pederson referred to new images from the notorious Saydnaya military prison north of the capital, Damascus, after President Bashar Assad fled Syria as armed groups stormed in to overthrow his government over the weekend. 'The images from Saydnaya and other detention facilities starkly underscore the unimaginable barbarity Syrians have endured and reported for years,' Pedersen said in a statement. Documentation and testimonies 'only scratch the surface of the carceral system’s horrors,' he added. Pedersen urged authorities to cooperate with U.N. bodies like an independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria, which was created in 2011, and an independent group known as the IIIM that was set up five years later to also compile evidence of crimes. G7 leaders say they support an inclusive political transition in Syria ROME — Leaders of the Group of 7 industrialized nations offered their full support for an inclusive political transition in Syria and invited all parties to preserve the country’s territorial integrity. In a message released by Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni’s office, the leaders said they were ready to support a transition that 'leads to a credible government, inclusive and not sectarian, that guarantees respect for the state of law, universal human rights, including rights for women, (and) the protection of all Syrians, including religious and ethnic minorities.' The leaders also underlined the importance that ousted President Bashar Assad’s government is held responsible for crimes, citing 'decades of atrocities.' They said they would also cooperate with groups working to prohibit chemical weapons 'to secure, declare and destroy' remaining chemical arms in Syria. Italy currently holds the rotating presidency of the G-7, which also includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United States. Israel's military says it hit Hamas militants in two locations in southern Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it struck Hamas militants in two locations in the southern Gaza Strip who planned to hijack aid convoys. Palestinian Health officials had earlier said that the two strikes killed 15 men who were part of local committees established to secure aid deliveries. The committees have been organized in cooperation with the Hamas-run Interior Ministry in Gaza. It was not possible to independently confirm either account of the strikes, which occurred overnight into Thursday. Israel has long accused Hamas of hijacking humanitarian aid deliveries, while U.N. officials have said there is no systemic diversion of aid. U.N. agencies and aid groups say deliveries are held up by Israeli restrictions on the entry of aid and movement within Gaza, as well as the breakdown of law and order more than 14 months into the war between Israel and Hamas. Israel has repeatedly targeted the Hamas-run police force, which maintained internal security before the war. The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, the main aid provider in Gaza, said a U.N. convoy of 70 trucks carrying humanitarian aid in southern Gaza 'was involved in a serious incident,' resulting in just one of the trucks reaching its destination. It did not provide further details on the incident but said the same route had been used successfully two days earlier. Israel’s offensive, launched after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, has caused vast destruction and displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, leaving the territory heavily reliant on international food aid. American who says he crossed into Syria by foot is free after 7 months in detention DAMASCUS, Syria — An American who turned up in Syria on Thursday says he was detained after crossing into the country by foot on a Christian pilgrimage seven months ago. Travis Timmerman appears to have been among thousands of people released from the country’s notorious prisons after rebels reached Damascus over the weekend, overthrowing President Bashar Assad and ending his family’s 54-year rule. As video emerged online of Timmerman on Thursday, he was initially mistaken by some for Austin Tice, an American journalist who went missing in Syria 12 years ago. In the video, Timmerman could be seen lying on a mattress under a blanket in what appeared to be a private house. A group of men in the video said he was being treated well and would be safely returned home. There was no immediate comment from U.S. officials traveling with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Aqaba, Jordan. Timmerman later gave an interview with the Al-Arabiya TV network, saying he had illegally crossed into Syria on foot from the eastern Lebanese town of Zahle seven months ago, before being detained. He said he was treated well in detention but could hear other young men being tortured. US Secretary of State Blinken visits Mideast after Assad's ouster in Syria AQABA, Jordan — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Jordan on his 12th visit to the Mideast since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last year and his first since the weekend ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad that has sparked new fears of instability in a region wracked by three conflicts despite a ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. Blinken was meeting in Aqaba with Jordan’s King Abdullah II and Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi on Thursday before traveling to Turkey for talks with Turkish officials on Friday. The meetings will focus largely on Syria but also touch on long-elusive hopes for a deal to end the fighting in Gaza that has devastated the Palestinian territory since October 2023. Blinken is the latest senior U.S. official to visit the Middle East in the five days since Assad was deposed as the Biden administration navigates more volatility in the region in its last few weeks in office and as President-elect Donald Trump has said the U.S. should stay out of the Syrian conflict. Other include national security adviser Jake Sullivan and a top military commander who traveled there as the U.S. and Israel have launched airstrikes to prevent the Islamic State militant group from reconstituting and prevent materiel and suspected chemical weapons stocks from falling into militant hands. Blinken 'will discuss the need for the transition process and new government in Syria to respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance, prevent Syria from being used as a base of terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbors, and ensure that chemical weapons stockpiles are secured and safely destroyed,' the State Department said. The U.S. would be willing to recognize and fully support a new Syrian government that met those criteria. U.S. officials say they are not actively reviewing the foreign terrorist organization designation of the main Syrian rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, known as HTS, which was once an al-Qaida affiliate, but stressed they are not barred from speaking to its members. Netanyahu says Israeli forces will remain in Syrian buffer zone until border security is guaranteed JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israeli forces will remain in a Syrian buffer zone until a new force on the other side of the border can guarantee security. After the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad, Israeli forces pushed into a buffer zone that had been established after the 1973 Mideast war. The military says it has seized additional strategic points nearby. Israeli officials have said the move is temporary, but Netanyahu’s conditions could take months or even years to fulfill as Syria charts its post-Assad future, raising the prospect of an open-ended Israeli presence in the country. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement Thursday that Assad’s overthrow by jihadi rebels created a vacuum on the border. 'Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7th style attacks,' it said, referring to Hamas’ 2023 attack out of Gaza, which ignited the war there. 'That is why Israeli forces entered the buffer zone and took control of strategic sites near Israel’s border.' The statement added that 'this deployment is temporary until a force that is committed to the 1974 agreement can be established and security on our border can be guaranteed.' The buffer zone is adjacent to the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed. The international community, except for the United States, views the Golan as occupied Syrian territory. Attacker who fatally shot boy on a bus in the West Bank turns himself in, military says JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said Thursday that the attacker who fatally shot a 12-year-old Israeli boy in the occupied West Bank overnight turned himself in to authorities. The attacker opened fire on a bus near the Israeli settlement of Beitar Illit, critically wounding the boy, who hospital authorities pronounced dead in the early morning. Three others were wounded in the attack, paramedics said. The shooting took place just outside Jerusalem in an area near major Israeli settlements. Indonesia evacuates 37 citizens from Syria JAKARTA, Indonesia — The Indonesian government has evacuated 37 citizens from Syria following the fall of the Bashar al-Assad government, officials said Thursday. The evacuees were taken by land from Damascus to Beirut, where they boarded three commercial flights to Jakarta, said Judha Nugraha, director of citizen protection at the Foreign Affairs Ministry. The Indonesian Embassy in Damascus said all 1,162 Indonesian citizens in Syria were safe. Indonesian Ambassador to Syria Wajid Fauzi said the situation in Syria has gradually returned to normal. 'I can say that 98% of people’s lives are back to normal, shops are open, public transportation has started running,' Fauzi said, adding that most Indonesian nationals living in Syria had chosen to stay. Israeli airstrikes kill at least 28 people, including 7 children, Palestinian medical officials say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 28 people in the Gaza Strip, including seven children and a woman. One of the strikes overnight and into Thursday flattened a house in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the casualties were taken. An Associated Press reporter saw the bodies at the hospital’s morgue. Two other strikes killed 15 men who were part of local committees established to secure aid convoys. The committees were set up by displaced Palestinians in coordination with the Hamas-run Interior Ministry. The Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis received the bodies and an Associated Press reporter counted them. The hospital said eight were killed in a strike near the southern border town of Rafah and seven others in a strike 30 minutes later near Khan Younis. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,800 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis, with experts warning of famine. Israel says it allows enough aid to enter and blames U.N. agencies for not distributing it. The U.N. says Israeli restrictions, and the breakdown of law and order after Israel repeatedly targeted the Hamas-run police force, make it extremely difficult to operate in the territory. UN General Assembly demands ceasefire in Gaza and backs UN agency helping Palestinian refugees UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and backing the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban. The votes in the 193-nation world body were 158-9 with 13 abstentions to demand a ceasefire now and 159-9 with 11 abstentions to support the agency known as UNRWA. The votes culminated two days of speeches overwhelmingly calling for an end to the 14-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the assembly. Israel and its close ally, the United States, were in a tiny minority speaking and voting against the resolutions.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-airstrikes-kill-28-in-gaza-including-7-children-health-officials-say/	2024-12-12T06:02:50-08:00	
Russian forces edge closer to a key eastern Ukraine city in 'inte...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine city of Pokrovsk is 'extremely intense' after a monthslong Russian push, Ukraine’s top military commander said, with analysts estimating Russian forces are now within just a few kilometers (miles) of the city. Ukrainian troops repelled nearly 40 Russian attempts to storm defenses around Pokrovsk over the previous 24 hours, the General Staff said in a battlefield report Thursday. 'Russian occupiers are throwing all available forces forward, attempting to break through the defenses of our troops,' Ukrainian army chief Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a Facebook post late Wednesday. His forces are outnumbered, he said. Ukraine’s stretched defenses in Donetsk have been creaking since early this year under a fierce Russian drive to capture its neighbor’s entire eastern Donbas region. Russian forces are trying to overwhelm Ukraine’s battlefield defenses with sheer numbers of troops and powerful glide bombs that blast fortifications to smithereens. Pokrovsk, which had a population of about 60,000 before Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, is one of Ukraine’s main defensive strongholds and a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region. Its capture would compromise Ukraine’s defensive abilities and supply routes and would bring Russia closer to its stated goal of seizing the entire Donetsk region. But Ukraine’s dogged resistance and Western military aid have rendered the gains costly for the Kremlin in losses of troops and armor. A major worry for the Kyiv government is that tens of billions of dollars of key U.S. military support to hold Russia at bay may dry up under President-elect Donald Trump. The Institute for the Study of War estimated late Wednesday that Russian forces have moved to within about 6 kilometers (just under 4 miles) of Pokrovsk, approaching from the south. The Donetsk operation has had 'a massive cost' for Russian forces, the Washington-based think tank said. Those losses 'will temper their ability to translate these gains into more far-reaching offensive operations' in the months ahead, it said. Though the Russian push has been slow moving, it has recently accelerated in Donetsk and compelled Ukrainian defenders to make localized retreats. Major battlefield victories have eluded the Russians. Ukrainian media have reported tensions between Ukraine’s commanders as the military pressure has built. Unconfirmed reports said Syrskyi, the military chief, had personally taken charge of some brigades around Pokrovsk. A renowned Ukrainian military officer, Serhii Filimonov, commander of the 'Da Vinci Wolves' battalion of the 59th Motorized Brigade, described Pokrovsk’s defense as a 'disaster.' Senior officers are placing 'unrealistic' demands on units and are unfamiliar with circumstances on the front line, Filimonov wrote on his Telegram channel this week. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russian-forces-edge-closer-to-a-key-eastern-ukraine-city-in-intense-fighting-officials-say/	2024-12-12T02:45:26-08:00	
Rights group accuses Russian mercenaries of abuses against civili...	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Mali’s armed forces, supported by Russian mercenaries, committed abuses against civilians since the withdrawal of a U.N. peacekeeping mission late last year, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday. Malian armed forces and the Russia-backed Wagner Group deliberately killed at least 32 civilians, including seven in a drone strike, kidnapped four others, and burned at least 100 homes in towns and villages in central and northern Mali since May, the rights group said. Human Rights Watch also accused jihadi groups in the region of having summarily executed at least 47 civilians and displaced thousands of people since June. It said the groups burned thousands of houses and looted livestock, which is vital to the survival of the nomadic communities in the region. 'The Malian army with the Wagner Group and Islamist armed groups have been targeting civilians and their property in violation of the laws of war,' Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in the report. Mali, along with its neighbors Burkina Faso and Niger, has for over a decade battled an insurgency fought by jihadi groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Following military coups in all three nations in recent years, the ruling juntas have expelled French forces and turned to Russia’s mercenary units for security assistance. Wagner has been present in Mali since late 2021 following a military coup, replacing French troops and international peacekeepers to help fight the militants. At the same time, the mercenary group has been accused of helping to carry out raids and drone strikes that have killed civilians. In December last year, the United Nations ended its decade long peacekeeping mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA following the government’s request that alleged the force was inadequate to respond to the insurgency. 'Since MINUSMA left Mali a year ago, it has been extremely difficult to get comprehensive information on abuses, and we are deeply concerned that the situation is even worse than reported,' Allegrozzi said. ____ Follow AP’s Africa coverage at:	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-rights-group-accuses-russian-mercenaries-of-abuses-against-civilians-in-mali/	2024-12-11T21:07:00-08:00	
Middle East latest: UN General Assembly demands a ceasefire in Ga...	The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and expressing support for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, although they reflect world opinion. Israel has faced growing international criticism over its conduct in Gaza as it fights Hamas militants, especially when it comes to humanitarian aid for desperate people in the besieged and heavily destroyed territory. Israeli airstrikes in northern and central Gaza killed at least 33 people overnight and into Wednesday, Palestinian medical officials said. Hospital records show one Israeli strike in northern Gaza killed 19 people in a home, including a family of eight — four children, their parents and two grandparents. The Israeli military said it targeted a Hamas militant in the vicinity of the hospital, part of a blistering offensive in Gaza’s isolated and heavily destroyed north. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people, including children and older adults. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 44,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health officials. They say women and children make up more than half the dead but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians in their count. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the latest: Shooting attack on Israeli bus leaves 3 wounded, including a child JERUSALEM — Israeli hospital officials say a young boy is fighting for his life after a shooting attack in the occupied West Bank. An Israeli bus came under fire from a suspected Palestinian attacker late Wednesday, the military said, and Israeli forces are searching for the shooter. Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem says at least three people were wounded in the shooting, which took place just outside the city in an area near major Israeli settlements. The hospital says the boy, who is about 10, is in grave condition. It says two other people, ages 24 and 55, were also hurt. UN General Assembly demands ceasefire in Gaza and backs UN agency helping Palestinian refugees UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and backing the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban.

Israel and its close ally, the United States, were in a tiny minority speaking and voting against the resolutions. Israeli forces pull out of first Lebanese border town as part of ceasefire BEIRUT — Israeli forces withdrew from a strategic town in southern Lebanon and handed it back to the Lebanese army in coordination with U.N. peacekeepers, the two militaries said Wednesday, marking an important test of the recent ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah militants. It appeared to be Israel's first pullout from a Lebanese border town captured during this fall’s ground invasion, and comes as part of the initial phase of the ceasefire. The Lebanese army said Wednesday it has deployed units to five positions around the town of Khiam coinciding with the Israeli army’s withdrawal. Israel's military confirmed this was the first town it has turned over to the Lebanese army under the truce, which — if it endures — would end nearly 14 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel has said the truce deal gives it the right to use military force against perceived ceasefire violations. Israel has launched near-daily strikes, mostly in southern Lebanon, that have killed at least 28 people and wounded 25 others since the ceasefire took effect on Nov. 27. Still, the shaky truce appears to be holding. Five people were killed Wednesday by at least three Israeli strikes in different towns in the southern municipality of Bint Jbeil, Lebanon’s Health Ministry and state news agency said. The Lebanese army warned civilians to stay out of Khiam until it can clear the area of any unexploded munitions. The strategic hilltop town, located less than 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the border with Israel, saw some of the most intense fighting during the war. Thousands of Lebanese displaced by the war returned home two weeks ago after a ceasefire took hold, driving cars stacked with personal belongings and defying warnings from Lebanese and Israeli troops to avoid some areas. Russia has pulled its naval forces out of Syria, US official says WASHINGTON — All Russian naval ships that were docked at the Syrian port of Tartus have left and it appears Moscow is now looking for a new base along the coast now that its key ally, Bashar Assad, has been ousted a ruler of Syria, a U.S. official said. It’s not clear where the ships will go, but Russia may seek a new port on the Mediterranean Sea along the African shoreline, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. assessments. The official did not say how many vessels Russia had in Syria at the time Assad was overthrown. Moscow has dedicated the bulk of its military assets to the war in Ukraine. Asked about Tartus on Wednesday, Sabrina Singh, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said that the U.S. is seeing some Russian forces and naval vessels leaving Syria. 'They just had one of their key political allies, ousted,' said Singh. 'We’re seeing Russia consolidate assets.' — By Lolita C. Baldor Palestinians urge UN General Assembly to vote for an immediate Gaza ceasefire UNITED NATIONS – The Palestinians are urging United Nations member countries to vote in favor of resolutions demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and supporting the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees, which Israel has moved to ban in Palestinian territories. The Palestinian mission to the United Nations issued the urgent appeal to the 193 U.N. member nations ahead of Wednesday afternoon’s votes on the resolutions in the General Assembly, whose members have has been listening to two days of speeches overwhelmingly supporting the measures. Israel and close ally the United States have spoken against the resolutions. The Palestinians and their supporters went to the General Assembly after the U.S. vetoed a Security Council resolution last month demanding an immediate ceasefire in the war in Gaza. It was supported by the 14 other Security Councilmember nations, but the U.S. objected because the resolution did not include a link to an immediate release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The General Assembly resolution being voted on Wednesday mirrors the Security Council language: It 'demands an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire to be respected by all parties, and further reiterates its demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.' Unlike the Security Council, there are no vetoes in the General Assembly. But while council resolutions are legally binding, assembly resolutions are not, though they do reflect world opinion. The second resolution being voted on supports the mandate of the U.N. agency caring for Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA which was established by the General Assembly in 1949. It 'deplores' legislation adopted by Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, on Oct. 28 banning UNRWA’s activities in the Palestinian territories, which takes effect in 90 days. It calls on the Israeli government 'to abide by its international obligations, respect the privileges and immunities of UNRWA and uphold its responsibility to allow and facilitate full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian assistance in all its forms into and throughout the entire Gaza Strip.' Israel lifts restrictions on outdoor activities in the northern Golan Heights JERUSALEM — Israel has lifted restrictions on public gatherings and outdoor activities in areas near the Lebanese border in the northern Golan Heights, two weeks after a ceasefire with Hezbollah. The army’s Home Front Command said it was changing its public safety guidelines to 'full activity' from 'partial activity.' Israel had tightened restrictions on Nov. 25, reflecting concerns that fighting could intensify ahead of any possible cease-fire between Israel and Lebanese militants. The truce went into effect on Nov. 27. In recent days, Israeli tanks and troops have advanced out of Israeli-held territory in the Golan Heights and pushed into a buffer zone inside Syria — a move Israel said it took to prevent attacks on its citizens. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally, except by the United States. Palestinian factions in Syria form a united delegation to meet with country's new rebel rulers BEIRUT - Syria-based Palestinian factions have formed a unified delegation to meet with the country's new rebel-led authorities. The factions said in a statement after their meeting Wednesday at the Palestinian Embassy that they stand by the side of the Syrian people. The factions condemned Israel’s airstrikes on Syria over the past few days that have destroyed much of the assets of the Syrian army. The factions decided to form a joint committee to run the affairs of Palestinians in Syria as well as to be in contact with the new insurgent-led transitional government, following the ouster of President Bashar Assad. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians live in Syria, many of them refugees, and the factions that have been based in Damascus were close to Assad’s government. Hamas was based in Syria until it left in 2012 a year after the county's civil war began. UN chief pledges support for Syria's transition, says Assad’s fall brings hope to Mideast PRETORIA, South Africa — The United Nations chief says the fall of Syria’s authoritarian government has brought hope to the troubled Middle East, and pledged the global body’s support to the country's new leaders to ensure a smooth transition. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday that the U.N. wants to see 'an inclusive political process in which the rights of all minorities will be fully respected, and paving the way towards a united sovereign Syria, with its territorial integrity fully re-established.' The jihadi-led Syrian rebels took control of the capital Damascus after the Syrian army withdrew from much of southern part of the country, leaving many areas, including several provincial capitals, under the control of opposition fighters. A Kurdish-led, U.S.-backed force also controls large parts of northeastern Syria. Guterres said he fully trusts the people of Syria to be able 'to choose their own destiny'. 'I think it is our duty to do everything to support the different Syrian leaders in order to make sure that they come together and are able to guarantee a smooth transition, an inclusive transition in which all Syrians can feel that they belong,' Guterres said. 'The alternative does not make any sense.' Guterres is in South Africa to discuss the country’s role as it takes over the G20 presidency, among other issues. Israeli airstrike kills four people in central Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike in central Gaza Strip killed four people and injured 16 others Wednesday, health officials said. Those killed and injured were taken to Awda Hospital after the strike hit a house in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the press center at the hospital. Since Israel’s war in Gaza began in October last year, at least 44,805 people have been killed and 106,257 others have been injured, according to the latest update by the Gaza Health ministry. Top US military commander in the Mideast visits Lebanon for talks with army chief BEIRUT — The top U.S. military commander for the Middle East was in Lebanon on Wednesday meeting with the head of the Lebanese army. In the wake of shocking overthrow of the government in neighboring Syria, the two military leaders discussed the security situation in Lebanon, a statement from the country's army said. U.S. Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, who leads U.S. Central Command, met with the head of the Lebanese army Gen. Joseph Aoun to discuss ongoing American support for the implementation of the U.S.-and French-brokered ceasefire agreement, which ended more than a year of war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Israel has said the truce deal gives it the right to use military force against perceived ceasefire violations. Israel has launched near-daily strikes, mostly in southern Lebanon, that have killed at least 28 people and wounded 25 others since the ceasefire took effect on Nov. 27. Still, the shaky truce appears to be holding. Five people were killed Wednesday by at least three Israeli strikes in different towns in the southern municipality of Bint Jbeil, Lebanon’s Health Ministry and state news agency said. On Tuesday, Kurilla was in eastern Syria visiting U.S. military bases and meeting with members of a Kurdish-led Syrian force that is backed by the U.S. He was assessing what CENTCOM described as efforts to counter a resurgence of the Islamic State group. He also visited Baghdad for talks with Iraqi officials on regional security and counter-IS operations. Syrian rebels work to get the capital's airport up and running again DAMASCUS — With the fall of Damascus, security forces of the deposed Bashar Assad government and staff withdrew from the Damascus International airport, grounding flights and stranding passengers. The airport has not been functional since. Now, security members of the rebel alliance in control of Syria have taken control of the airport, hoping to restore security, a sense of confidence, and the legitimacy needed to restart flights out of the capital, and from one of the country’s three international airports. 'Damascus international airport is the heart of the city because it is the gateway for international delegations and missions,' Omar al-Shami, a security official with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the faction that led the shock offensive that led to the fall of Assad, told The Associated Press, calling it 'the passage for Syria to breathe.' Al-Shami said security was restored at the international airport nearly 12 hours after the fall of Damascus. The factions entered the capital before dawn, and security members of the rebel alliance took charge before sunset on Sunday. He said he hoped the airport would be operational in less than a week. On Wednesday, a handful of engineers were inspecting four planes that were on the tarmac. Cleaning staff were removing broken furniture, glass windows, and trash from ransacking by looters following the fall of Damascus. The attack, reportedly by mobs and looters from the neighboring areas, left parts of the airport halls destroyed, with smashed furniture and merchandise. 'There was a lot damage in the airport’s equipment and facilities in 90% of the sections,' Anis Fallouh, the head of the airport, told the AP. Fallouh said the operations to clean up the airport aim to convince international airlines to resume their flights to Damascus. 'Soon in the coming days, flights will resume when we reopen air traffic to Syria and inform countries that Damascus airport is operational. We may start with domestic or test flights to ensure that everything in the airport is operational and avoid any mistakes. Then we can resume international flights.' Engineers were inspecting the four planes on the tarmac, from two Syrian airlines. Some administrative staff were visiting the airport as the new administrators of Damascus work to convince state officials to return to their posts. 'We are on the Airbus 320, the technical team. Because of the security vacuum that happened on Sunday, some ill-intentioned people tried to cause damage but thank God the plane is fine — the body, the engines and its systems. Some things are missing and we are trying to fix that,' said Bassam Radi, the engineer in charge of maintenance, said. Germany says it's looking for ways to work with Syria's new rulers BERLIN — German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Wednesday addressed Berlin's reservations but also willingness to work the Syrian militant group in control of Damascus, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. 'Nobody overlooks the origins of HTS in the al-Qaeda ideology. It is therefore clear that we will measure HTS by its actions,' Baerbock told reporters in Berlin. 'Any cooperation presupposes that ethnic and religious minorities are protected, women’s rights are respected and acts of revenge are prevented.' She said that 'whether we like it or not, the HTS militia ... is one of the decisive actors for the future of Syria.' 'Together with our partners, we are therefore looking for an adequate way of dealing with HTS, with whom many have had no direct contact for good reasons,' she added. Ahmad al-Sharaa, the insurgent leader also known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has renounced longtime ties to al-Qaida and depicted himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon kills 1, state news agency says BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike near the southern Lebanese town of Bin Jbeil killed one person and wounded another, the state news agency reported. National News Agency said Wednesday’s airstrike hit a home. It gave no further details and there was no immediate comment from Israeli military. More than a dozen people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes since a ceasefire went into effect on Nov. 27, ending the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war. Blinken is returning to the Middle East WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is returning to the Middle East this week on his 12th visit since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last year but his first since the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Assad's departure has sparked new fears of instability in the region now wracked by three conflicts despite a ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. Blinken will travel to Jordan and Turkey on Thursday and Friday for talks expected to focus largely on Syria but also touch on long-elusive hopes for a deal to end the fighting in Gaza that has devastated the territory since October 2023. The State Department said Blinken would meet Jordanian officials, including King Abdullah II, in the port of Aqaba on Thursday before flying to Ankara for meetings with Turkish officials Friday. Other stops in the region are also possible, officials said. Blinken 'will reiterate the United States’ support for an inclusive, Syrian-led transition to an accountable and representative government,' department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. Insurgents set fire to Hafez Assad's tomb, a war monitor says BEIRUT — Insurgents have set on fire the tomb of Syria’s former President Hafez Assad in his hometown in the northwest, a war monitor and a local journalist said Wednesday. Hafez Assad had ruled Syria for 30 years until his death in 2000, when his son, Bashar, succeeded him. Both ruled Syria with an iron fist and were blamed for crackdowns that left tens of thousands dead, mainly in the central city of Hama in 1982, and in much of the country since the civil war in 2011. Bashar Assad was ousted over the weekend and fled to Russia where he was given political asylum. Rami Abdurrahman of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Syrian journalist Qusay Noor told The Associated Press that the tomb was set on fire Wednesday in the town of Qardaha in Latakia province. UN appeals for $4 billion for humanitarian operations in Palestinian territories JERUSALEM — The United Nations is asking donors for over $4 billion to fund humanitarian operations in the Palestinian territories, most of it earmarked for war-ravaged Gaza. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs also called for the 'lifting all impediments to the entry of aid' in its appeal issued Wednesday. U.N. agencies say aid operations in Gaza are hindered by Israeli restrictions and the breakdown of law and order. Israel says it allows enough aid to enter and blames the U.N. for not distributing it within the territory. The appeal for 2025 includes $3.6 billion for Gaza and about $450 million for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel’s offensive, launched after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, has destroyed vast areas of the besieged territory and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million. Many have been displaced multiple times and are now crammed into squalid tent camps with little in the way of food or other essentials. Most of the population relies on international aid. Paraguay's president addresses the Knesset ahead of embassy reopening in Jerusalem JERUSALEM — The president of Paraguay addressed the Israeli parliament Wednesday ahead of the reopening of the country’s embassy in Jerusalem. The decision to reopen the embassy in Jerusalem and recognize the city as the capital of Israel is a diplomatic win for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and puts Paraguay in a small group of countries that have taken the move. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in 1967 but it wasn't recognized by the international community, and most countries run their embassies out of Tel Aviv. 'Without Jerusalem, the land of Israel is a body without a soul,' President Santiago Peña said in a speech to the Knesset. 'So I say here today that without an embassy in Jerusalem, diplomatic relations with Israel do not have a real heart.' He said he hoped the move would inspire other countries to do the same. The embassy is set to open Thursday. Pena’s move was welcomed by Netanyahu, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, along with other Israeli leaders. 'Tomorrow we will inaugurate together the embassy of Paraguay in our eternal capital, and that will happen not for the first time, but for the second time,' Netanyahu said. Paraguay had an embassy in Jerusalem in 2018, under Former President Horacio Cartes. That embassy was moved back to Tel Aviv by Cartes’ successor, Mario Abdo Benitez, prompting Israel to close its embassy in Asuncion. Israel reopened its embassy in September. Russia says it's in touch with new authorities in Syria MOSCOW — Russia said Wednesday it has maintained contacts with the new authorities in Syria. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that 'we are monitoring most closely what is happening in Syria.' 'We, of course, maintain contacts with those who are currently controlling the situation in Syria,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. 'This is necessary because our bases are located there, our diplomatic mission is located there and, of course, the issue related to ensuring the security of these facilities is extremely important and of primary significance.' Peskov wouldn’t give details of those contacts, saying only that Russia has contacted 'those who are controlling the situation on the ground.' He wouldn’t give the number of Russian troops in Syria. Asked to comment about Israel’s seizure of a buffer zone on the border with Syria, Peskov called them destabilizing. 'The strikes and actions in the Golan Heights area, in the buffer zone area, are unlikely to help stabilize the situation in an already destabilized Syria,' he said. Russia has granted political asylum to ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad and his family after they fled rebels who seized Damascus over the weekend. Iran's supreme leader says fall of Syrian government was part of joint plan by US and Israel TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says the recent events in Syria, including the fall of its government, were part of a joint plan by the United States and Israel. 'There should be no doubt that what has happened in Syria is the result of a joint American and Zionist plan,' Khamenei said in a speech in Tehran on Wednesday that was broadcast on state TV. 'We have evidence, and this evidence leaves no room for doubt.' The Supreme leader added: 'A neighboring state of Syria has played a clear role in this matter, and it continues to do so. Everyone can see this.' Khamenei also rejected speculation by analysts who have said that Iran will be weakened by the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government. 'Those ignorant analysts are unaware of the meaning of resistance. They think that if resistance weakens, Islamic Iran will also weaken. But I say, with the help and power of God — by the will of Almighty Allah — Iran is powerful and it will become even more powerful,' he said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-strike-on-home-in-northern-gaza-kills-19-people-palestinian-medics-say/	2024-12-11T14:41:34-08:00	
Israeli strikes on Gaza kill at least 29, Palestinian medics say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes pounded the Gaza Strip overnight and into Wednesday, hitting a home where displaced people were sheltering in the isolated north and a built-up refugee camp. At least 29 people were killed, according to Palestinian health officials. The Israel-Hamas war has raged on with no end in sight, even after Israel reached a ceasefire with Lebanon's Hezbollah and attention shifted to the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations have said they hope to end the war before the inauguration but months of ceasefire talks have repeatedly stalled. The strike on the home killed 19 people in the northern town of Beit Lahiya near the border with Israel, according to the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, which received the bodies. Hospital records show that a family of eight was among those killed, including four children, their parents and two grandparents. The Israeli military said it targeted a Hamas militant in the vicinity of the hospital. It said reports about the number of casualties in the strike were inaccurate, without elaborating. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and accuses militants of hiding among them, putting their lives in danger. The hospital said another strike near its entrance on Wednesday killed a woman and her two children. Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the hospital director, said Israeli drones struck nearby residential blocks overnight, causing explosions that sparked panic among the more than 120 sick and wounded patients inside the facility. 'We have received distress calls from neighbors and trapped people, but we’re not able to leave the hospital because of the continued risk,' he said. 'We are witnessing a massive loss of life, with many martyrs in the targeted areas.' Another strike in the decades-old Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed at least seven people, according to the Awda Hospital. The dead included two children, their parents and three relatives, it said. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the other two strikes. Evacuation orders after rocket fire Militants in central Gaza meanwhile fired four projectiles into Israel on Wednesday, two of which were intercepted, the military said. The other two fell in open areas, and there were no reports of casualties. The military ordered the evacuation of a five-block area of the built-up Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza, saying the rockets had been fired from there. The orders indicated that Israel would soon carry out strikes in the area. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people, including children and older adults. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health officials. They say women and children make up more than half the dead but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians in their count. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Thousands more Palestinians have gone missing during the war, some after encounters with Israeli troops. UN says civilians in Gaza face an ‘utterly devastating situation’ Israel has been waging a renewed offensive against Hamas in Gaza’s isolated and heavily destroyed north since early October. Troops have surrounded Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, allowing in almost no humanitarian aid and ordering tens of thousands to flee to nearby Gaza City. Israeli officials have said the three communities are mostly deserted, but the United Nations humanitarian office said Tuesday that it believes around 65,000 to 75,000 people are still there, with little access to food, water, electricity or health care. Experts have warned that the north may be experiencing famine. Sigrid Kaag, the senior U.N. humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told reporters at the U.N. on Tuesday that civilians trying to survive all across Gaza face an 'utterly devastating situation.' She pointed to the breakdown in law and order and looting that has left the U.N. and many aid organizations unable to deliver food and other humanitarian essentials to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in need. Kaag said she and other U.N. officials keep repeatedly asking Israel for access for convoys to northern Gaza and elsewhere, to allow in commercial goods, to reopen the Rafah crossing from Egypt in the south, and to approve dual-use items. The Israeli military says it allows in enough humanitarian aid and blames U.N. agencies for not distributing it, saying large amounts of aid have accumulated just inside Gaza's borders. U.N. officials say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order and ongoing fighting make it difficult to access the aid and distribute it, and have repeatedly called for a ceasefire. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have been mediating talks between Israel and Hamas for nearly a year, and diplomats say those efforts have recently gained momentum. But Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed and all the hostages are returned and has said Israel will maintain a lasting military presence in some areas. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

2 Ukrainian women are pulled alive from rubble hours after Russia...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Rescue crews working through the night pulled two women from rubble more than seven hours after a Russian missile struck a private medical clinic in a southern Ukraine city, killing eight people and wounding 22 others, authorities said Wednesday. The women called rescue services on their cellphones to say they were buried under the rubble after the attack late Tuesday in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine’s Emergency Services said. Deadly Russian strikes on civilian areas have been a feature of the almost three-year war. Ukraine’s Western allies are sending more aid to help it keep fighting Russia’s invasion, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Zaporizhzhia strike showed that his country still needs more air defense systems. He urged Western partners to send weaponry they are holding in their arsenals. 'We currently do not have enough systems to protect our country from Russian missiles. But partners have these systems,' Zelenskyy said late Tuesday in his daily address to the nation. Air defense systems that Ukraine’s allies possess 'should save lives, and not gather dust in storage bases,' he said. Meanwhile, Ukraine kept up its long-range attacks on areas behind Russian lines that are supporting its war effort. A Ukrainian drone attack caused a blaze at an industrial facility in Russia’s Bryansk region, Gov. Alexander Bogomaz said. Air defenses downed 14 Ukrainian drones over the Bryansk region early Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Also, a Ukrainian missile attack on the city of Taganrog in the Rostov region early Wednesday damaged an industrial plant, regional Gov. Yuri Slusar said. Zelenskyy thanked Ukrainian forces for hitting what he called 'military facilities on the territory of Russia, as well as facilities of the fuel and energy complex.' 'It is precisely such long range and accuracy that step-by-step bring Russia back to reality — to the reality that the war must be ended,' he said on Telegram. It wasn't possible to verify either side's claims. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-2-ukrainian-women-are-pulled-alive-from-rubble-hours-after-russian-missile-strike/	2024-12-11T03:37:18-08:00	
Humanitarian aid to northern Gaza mostly blocked for the last 2 m...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Humanitarian aid to north Gaza, where Israel launched a ground offensive on Oct. 6, has largely been blocked for the past 66 days, the United Nations said Tuesday. That has left between 65,000 and 75,000 Palestinians without access to food, water, electricity or health care, according to the world body. In the north, Israel has continued its siege on Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya with Palestinians living there largely denied aid, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA, said. Recently, it said, about 5,500 people were forcibly displaced from three schools in Beit Lahiya to Gaza City. Adding to the food crisis, only four U.N.-supported bakeries are operating throughout the Gaza Strip, all of them in Gaza City, OCHA said. Sigrid Kaag, the senior U.N. humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told reporters after briefing the U.N. Security Council behind closed doors Tuesday afternoon that civilians trying to survive in Gaza face an 'utterly devastating situation.' She pointed to the breakdown in law and order and looting that has exacerbated a very dire situation and left the U.N. and many aid organizations unable to deliver food and other humanitarian essentials to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in need. Kaag said she and other U.N. officials keep repeatedly asking Israel for access for convoys to north Gaza and elsewhere, to allow in commercial goods, to reopen the Rafah crossing from Egypt in the south, and to approve dual-use items. Israel’s U.N. Mission said it had no comment on Kaag’s remarks. The U.N. has established the logistics for an operation across Gaza, she said, but there is no substitute for political will that humanitarians don’t possess. 'Member states possess it,' Kaag said. And this is what she urged Security Council members and keeps urging the broader international community to press for — the political will to address Gaza’s worsening humanitarian crisis.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-humanitarian-aid-to-north-gaza-mostly-blocked-for-the-last-2-months-un-says/	2024-12-10T22:39:11-08:00	
Middle East latest: Netanyahu testifies in his corruption trial a...	Israeli warplanes pounded military sites in Syria after Israeli troops seized a border buffer zone following the collapse of President Bashar Assad’s rule. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile testified in his long-running corruption trial. Israel denied its forces were advancing toward Damascus. Israeli troops on Sunday entered the buffer zone that had been established after the 1973 Mideast war and the military said it would deploy in 'several other places necessary for (Israel’s’) defense.' Netanyahu told the court in Tel Aviv that the charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust against him are 'an ocean of absurd' and promised his version would cut through the prosecution’s case. Critics have accused him of dragging out the war in Gaza and putting off a ceasefire deal that could release some 100 remaining hostages after 14 months of war triggered by the Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in the Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, according to local health authorities. They say most of the dead are women and children but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250, including older adults and children. ___ Here's the Latest: Syria’s government will gradually transfer power to interim cabinet DAMASCUS, Syria — Members of the Syrian government under ousted President Bashar Assad will gradually transfer power to a new transitional cabinet headed by Mohammed al-Bashir. The outgoing government met with al-Bashir for the first time since Assad fled Damascus over the weekend. Al-Bashir told reporters after the meeting that the ministers discussed transferring the portfolios to the interim government during the transitional period until the beginning of March. He said that in the coming days the new government will decide on each ministry. Banks and shops reopen in Damascus DAMASCUS, Syria — Banks and shops are reopening in Damascus after the chaos and confusion of the first two days following the ouster of President Bashar Assad. Sadi Ahmad, manager of Syria Gulf Bank, said life is returning to normal. A customer who came to withdraw money from an ATM was surprised to see it functioning. At the historic Hamadiyeh market, fighters who seized power were still standing guard but shops had reopened — even an ice cream stand. Resident Maysoun Al-Qurabi said she was initially 'against what happened,' referring to the insurgency, but changed her mind after seeing footage of rebels releasing inmates from the notorious Saydnaya prison. 'People are at ease and secure now,' she said. 'Before, people were hungry and scared.' Syrian Christians are cautious after insurgents seize power DAMASCUS, Syria — Minority Christians in Syria have been living in a state of uneasy anticipation since insurgents headed by the Islamic militant group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham took control after ousting President Bashar Assad. Mazen Kalash, a resident of Bab Touma, a Christian neighborhood in Damascus, said he wants to know the plans of the new government that will be formed by the rebels. 'The important thing is to feel safe, bring order, law and respect to the citizens,' he said. 'We need to be able to work whatever we want and do whatever we want without any interference from anyone.' The insurgents have so far attempted to reassure minorities that they will be protected. Large numbers of Syrian Christians, who made up 10% of the population, fled after the civil war erupted in 2011. Many of those who stayed supported Assad out of fear they might be targeted by Islamist insurgents. Netanyahu lashes out at media in his corruption trial TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at media during testimony at his corruption trial, which involves media moguls. 'There has never been such a biased media in any democracy … as there is in Israel,' Netanyahu told the court, describing his testy relationship with the press. He is accused of exchanging regulatory favors with media bosses for more positive coverage of himself and his family. He has denied wrongdoing. UN envoy says groups controlling Syria have been ‘sending good messages’ GENEVA — The U.N. envoy for Syria says armed groups that drove out President Bashar Assad have 'been sending good messages' about national unity and inclusiveness but acknowledges that a Security Council resolution still counts the leading one as a terrorist group. With Syria’s future and stability still very much in flux since Assad’s departure over the weekend, Geir Pedersen suggested that the international community needs to help the country get through this turbulent moment. 'We are still in what I would call a very fluid period. Things are not settled,' Pedersen told reporters at U.N. offices in Geneva on Tuesday. 'There are there is a real opportunity for change, but this opportunity needs to be grasped by the Syrians themselves and supported by the U.N. and the international community.' Referring to Israeli military strikes in Syria, Pedersen said it was 'extremely important that we now don’t see any action from any international country that destroys the possibility for this transformation in Syria to take place.' The insurgents are led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which grew out of an al-Qaida-affiliated called the Nusra Front that the Security Council listed as a terror group in a 2015 resolution. 'This is obviously a complicating factor for all of us,' Pedersen said. 'But we also have to be honest, we have to look at the facts and to see what has happened during the last nine years.' 'The reality so far is that the HTS and also the other armed groups have been sending good messages to the Syrian people,' he said. 'They have been sending messages of unity, of inclusiveness, and frankly speaking, also, we have seen in (the captured cities of) Aleppo and in Hama ... reassuring things on the ground.' Ahmad al-Sharaa, previously known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of the insurgency and the founder of both groups Nusra and HTS, cut ties with al-Qaida in 2016 and says he is committed to pluralism and religious tolerance. Turkey condemns Israeli seizure of a buffer zone on Syrian border ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey has 'strongly' condemned Israel’s advance into Syrian territory, saying it was in violation of a 1974 agreement on a buffer zone inside Syria. 'We strongly condemn Israel’s violation of the 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement, its entry into the separation zone between Israel and Syria, and its advance into Syrian territory,' Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The ministry accused Israel of 'displaying a mentality of an occupier' at a time when the possibility of peace and stability had emerged in Syria. The statement also reiterated Turkey’s support to Syria’s 'sovereignty, political unity, and territorial integrity.' Israeli troops on Sunday entered the buffer zone that had been established after the 1973 Mideast war and the military said it would deploy in 'several other places necessary for (Israel’s’) defense.' Netanyahu testifies he works 17-18 hours daily engulfed in meetings TEL AVIV, Israel — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he works 17 to 18 hours a day and that he is engulfed in meetings, especially during the past year that Israel has been fighting wars. Netanyahu was testifying in his long-running corruption trial. He has denied charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. 'If only I could steal away five minutes to enjoy some time with my wife,' he told the court Tuesday. Israeli military official says troops plan to seize a buffer zone inside Syria TEL AVIV, Israel — An Israeli military official says troops plan to seize a buffer zone inside Syria as well as 'a few more points that have strategic meaning.' The official spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The official dismissed reports of a larger Israeli invasion as 'rumors.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israeli forces were moving to control a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized buffer zone in Syrian territory. The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. Following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad, Israel sent troops into the buffer zone. It said the move was temporary and was aimed at preventing attacks. It said the 1974 agreement establishing the zone had collapsed and that Syrian troops had withdrawn from their positions. Israel has also carried out airstrikes across Syria in recent days targeting what it says are suspected chemical weapons and long-range rockets. Egypt and Saudi Arabia have condemned Israel’s incursion, accusing it of exploiting the disarray in Syria and violating international law. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in a move not recognized by the international community, except for the United States. The rest of the world views the strategic plateau as occupied Syrian territory. — By Joseph Krauss Israeli air force has launched hundreds of airstrikes in Syria, war monitor says DAMASCUS, Syria — Israel’s air force has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Syria as its ground forces move north of the Golan Heights along the border with Lebanon, according to an opposition war monitor. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Tuesday that since the fall of President Bashar Assad’s government, Israel’s air force has carried out more than 300 airstrikes against research centers, arms depots and military infrastructure across Syria, as well as a naval base along the Mediterranean coast. Associated Press journalists in Damascus witnessed intense airstrikes on the city and its suburbs overnight into Tuesday morning. Photographs posted online by activists showed destroyed missile launchers, helicopters and warplanes. Meanwhile, Israeli troops marched along the border with Lebanon and now control a long stretch on the Syrian side facing Lebanon’s Rashaya region, according to the war monitor's head, Rami Abdurrahman, and the Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV, which has reporters in Syria. Israeli troops are now about 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Damascus, according to the monitor. Saudi Arabia condemns Israeli incursion into a buffer zone in Syria DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Saudi Arabia has condemned Israel’s incursion into a buffer zone in Syria and a wave of Israeli airstrikes launched after the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that 'the assaults carried out by the Israeli occupation government, including the seizure of the buffer zone in the Golan Heights, and the targeting of Syrian territory confirm Israel’s continued violation of the principles of international law and its determination to sabotage Syria’s chances of restoring its security, stability and territorial integrity.' Israel sent troops into a buffer zone inside Syria that had been established after the 1973 Mideast war. It said the move was temporary and was taken to prevent any cross-border attacks after Syrian troops withdrew. Israel has also carried out heavy airstrikes that it says are aimed at preventing suspected chemical weapons and long-range rockets from falling into the hands of extremists. Saudi Arabia has been in talks with the United States in recent years over normalizing relations with Israel in exchange for a U.S. defense pact, American assistance in establishing a civilian nuclear program and a pathway to the establishment of a Palestinian state. But the kingdom has also repeatedly condemned Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip, where it is at war with the Hamas militant group. Last month, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and day-to-day ruler Mohammed bin Salman accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, allegations Israel adamantly rejects.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-netanyahu-prepares-to-testify-in-court-in-a-corruption-trial/	2024-12-10T05:12:57-08:00	
Biden is rushing aid to Ukraine. Both sides are digging in. And e...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The grinding war between Ukraine and its Russian invaders has escalated ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration, with President Joe Biden rushing out billions of dollars more in military aid before U.S. support for Kyiv’s defenses is thrown into question under the new administration. Russia, Ukraine and their global allies are scrambling to put their side in the best possible position for any changes that Trump may bring to American policy in the nearly 3-year-old war. The president-elect insisted in recent days that Russia and Ukraine immediately reach a ceasefire and said Ukraine should likely prepare to receive less U.S. military aid. On the war's front lines, Ukraine's forces are mindful of Trump's fast-approaching presidency and the risk of losing their biggest backer. If that happens, 'those people who are with me, my unit, we are not going to retreat,' a Ukrainian strike-drone company commander, fighting in Russia's Kursk region with the 47th Brigade, told The Associated Press by phone. 'As long as we have ammunition, as long as we have weapons, as long as we have some means to defeat the enemy, we will fight,' said the commander, who goes by his military call sign, Hummer. He spoke on condition he not be identified by name, citing Ukrainian military rules and security concerns. 'But, when all means run out, you must understand, we will be destroyed very quickly,' he said. The Biden administration is pushing every available dollar out the door to shore up Ukraine's defenses before leaving office in six weeks, announcing more than $2 billion in additional support since Trump won the presidential election last month. The U.S. has sent a total of $62 billion in military aid since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. And more help is on the way. The administration is on track to disperse the U.S. portion of a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, backed by frozen Russian assets, before Biden leaves the White House, U.S. officials said. They said the U.S. and Ukraine are in 'advanced stages' of discussing terms of the loan and close to executing the $20 billion of the larger loan that the U.S. is backing. Biden also has eased limits on Ukraine using American longer-range missiles against military targets deeper inside Russia, following months of refusing those appeals over fears of provoking Russia into nuclear war or attacks on the West. He's also newly allowed Ukraine to employ antipersonnel mines, which are banned by many countries. Biden and his senior advisers, however, are skeptical that allowing freer use of the longer-range missiles will change the broader trajectory of the war, according to two senior administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. But the administration has at least a measure of confidence that its scramble, combined with continued strong European support, means it will leave office having given Ukraine the tools it needs to sustain its fight against Russia for some time, the officials said. Enough to hold on, but not enough to defeat Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces, according to Ukraine and some of its allies. Even now, 'the Biden administration has been very careful not to run up against the possibility of a defeated Putin or a defeated Russia' for fear of the tumult that could bring, said retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, a former supreme allied commander of NATO. He is critical of Biden’s cautious pace of military support for Ukraine. Events far from the front lines this past weekend demonstrated the war's impact on Russia’s military. In Syria, rebels seized the country’s capital and toppled Russia-allied President Bashar Assad. Russian forces in Syria had propped up Assad for years, but they moved out of the way of the rebels’ assault, unwilling to take losses to defend their ally. Biden said it was further evidence that U.S. support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was wearing down Russia’s military. Trump, who has long spoken favorably of Putin and described Zelenskyy as a 'showman' wheedling money from the U.S., used that moment to call for an immediate ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. And asked in a TV interview — taped before he met with Zelenskyy over the weekend in Paris — if Ukraine should prepare for the possibility of reduced aid, Trump said, 'Yeah. Probably. Sure.' Trump's supporters call that pre-negotiation maneuvering by an avowed deal-maker. His critics say they fear it shows he is in Putin's sway. Zelenskyy said Monday that Russian forces’ retrenchment from outposts worldwide demonstrates that 'the entire army of this great pseudo-empire is fighting against the Ukrainian people today.' 'Forcing Putin to end the war requires Ukraine to be strong on the battlefield before it can be strong diplomatically,' Zelenskyy wrote on social media, repeating near-daily appeals for more longer-range missiles from the U.S. and Europe. In Kursk, Hummer, the Ukrainian commander, said he notices Russian artillery strikes and shelling easing up since the U.S. and its European allies loosened limits on use of longer-range missiles. But Moscow has been escalating its offensives in other ways in the past six months, burning through men and materiel in infantry assaults and other attacks far faster than it can replace them, according to the Institute for the Study of War. In Kursk, that includes Russia sending waves of soldiers on motorcycles and golf carts to storm Ukrainian positions, Hummer said. The Ukrainian drone commander and his comrades defend the ground they have seized from Russia with firearms, tanks and armored vehicles provided by the U.S. and other allies. Ukraine’s supporters fear that the kind of immediate ceasefire Trump is urging would be mostly on Putin’s terms and allow the Russian leader to resume the war when his military has recovered. 'Putin is sacrificing his own soldiers at a grotesque rate to take whatever territory he can on the assumption that the U.S. will tell Ukraine that U.S. aid is over unless Russia gets to keep what it has taken,' Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at Scotland’s University of St. Andrews, wrote on his Substack channel. Putin's need for troops led him to bring in North Korean forces. Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range missiles more broadly in Russia was partly in response, intended to discourage North Korea from deeper involvement in the war, one of the senior administration officials said. Since 2022, Russia already had been pulling forces and other military assets from Syria, Central Asia and elsewhere to throw into the Ukraine fight, said George Burros, an expert on the Russia-Ukraine conflict at the Institute for the Study of War. Any combat power that Russia has left in Syria that it could deploy to Ukraine is unlikely to change battlefield momentum, Burros said. 'The Kremlin has prioritized Ukraine as much as it can,' he said. ___ Novikov reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-biden-is-rushing-aid-to-ukraine-both-sides-are-digging-in-and-everyone-is-bracing-for-trump/	2024-12-10T04:59:08-08:00	
Israel's Netanyahu vows to challenge 'absurd' corruption charges ...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised defiantly on Tuesday to knock down corruption allegations against him as he began testifying in his long-running trial, becoming the first sitting Israeli leader to take the stand as a criminal defendant. The testimony is another low point for Israel’s longest-serving leader, who also faces an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war in Gaza. In his opening testimony in a packed Tel Aviv courtroom, Netanyahu argued that he was a dedicated leader and a defender of Israel’s interests, swatting away the charges against him as a 'drop in the sea' compared to the challenges he has faced protecting his country. But the charges have torn open divisions in Israel and complicated Netanyahu's legacy, which has also been tainted by the war in Gaza and the growing international isolation Israel faces because of it. Speaking freely and appearing at ease, Netanyahu said he could balance appearing at his trial with his duties as prime minister at a time when Israel is still fighting a war in Gaza and contending with the fall of Bashar Assad in neighboring Syria. 'I waited eight years for this moment, to say the truth,' Netanyahu said, standing at a podium, with his son Avner and several members of his Likud party seated on the courtroom benches. He said his testimony would 'poke holes in the absurd accusations.' Netanyahu will answer during his court appearances to charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. He is accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of cigars and champagne from a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for assistance with personal and business interests. He is also accused of promoting advantageous regulations for media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage of himself and his family. Netanyahu, 75, denies wrongdoing, saying the charges are a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media and a biased legal system out to topple his lengthy rule. His testimony caps years of scandals that have swirled around him and his family, who have gained a reputation as enjoying a lavish lifestyle at taxpayers' expense. Netanyahu's testimony is taking place in an underground, fortified courtroom for security reasons. Outside the courthouse, dozens of protesters gathered, both supporters of Netanyahu and his opponents. A banner draped outside read 'Crime Minister' as each side chanted slogans. Some families of hostages held in Gaza also demonstrated. At the start of his testimony, a judge told Netanyahu he had the same privileges as other witnesses and could sit or stand as he chose. Netanyahu told his version of events and shared personal details about his life that he might hope would shape the judges’ perception of him. He said at the start of his career in public service he would lose sleep over media coverage but learned it had no meaningful bearing — in contrast to the prosecution’s attempts to paint him as image-obsessed. He said he smoked cigars but could hardly finish them because of his workload, and hated champagne. Ahead of the testimony's start, Netanyahu’s lawyer, Amit Hadad, accused the Israeli justice system of making up the charges in an attempt to ensnare Netanyahu. 'There was a huge effort … to find a few pieces of a puzzle that don’t connect to each other,' Haddad said, as Netanyahu sat on a bench behind him. 'In court, in the light of day, we see everything falls apart.' The testimony, set to take place six hours a day, three days a week for several weeks, will take up a significant chunk of Netanyahu’s working hours, prompting critics to ask if he can capably manage a country embroiled in a war on one front, containing the fallout from a second, and keeping tabs on other potential regional threats, including from Iran. His lawyer asked that he be allowed to receive notes while testifying to help ensure he could continue running the country, and at some points during the trial, Netanyahu did. Under Israeli law, indicted prime ministers are not required to step down. But the charges against Netanyahu cleaved deep divisions in Israel, with protesters demanding he resign and former political allies refusing to serve in government with the Israeli leader, triggering a political crisis that led to five elections in less than four years beginning in 2019. Netanyahu’s supporters view the charges as the result of bias and overreach by the justice system. Despite the pressure, Netanyahu has rejected calls to step down and has used his position as prime minister to lash out at law enforcement, media and courts. An Israeli court rejected a request by Netanyahu’s lawyers to reduce the expected number of hours of testimony, as well as several other requests to delay its start, which they said were necessary because of the prime minister’s busy schedule and the country’s significant challenges. A verdict isn’t expected until 2026 at the earliest and Netanyahu will have the option to appeal to the Supreme Court. Since the trial began in 2020, the court has heard prosecution witnesses in the three cases, including some of Netanyahu’s once closest aides who turned state witnesses. The prosecution has tried to portray the prime minister as an image-obsessed leader who broke the law to improve his public perception. Netanyahu’s testimony could further tarnish his image at a complicated time. His popular support dropped after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, with the public blaming his leadership for failing to prevent the assault, and if elections were held today he would struggle to form a government. Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza with no end in sight, despite heavy international pressure to wind down the war, as well as pressure from the families of hostages held in Gaza and their supporters to bring their loved ones home. The Israeli leader along with his former defense minister also face an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes charges related to the war in Gaza. The warrant puts Netanyahu in the same company as Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israels-netanyahu-vows-to-refute-absurd-corruption-charges-as-he-takes-the-stand-in-his-trial/	2024-12-10T04:26:44-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes hit Gaza and also target susp...	Israeli strikes killed at least six people in the central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medical officials said Monday, while also hitting suspected chemical and long-range weapons sites in Syria to keep them from rebels who seized Damascus. The U.N. Security Council on Monday held emergency closed consultations on Syria at the request of Russia, which said it granted asylum to its longtime ally Syrian leader Bashar Assad. Russian President Vladimir Putin personally made the decision to offer asylum to Assad, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov wouldn’t comment on Assad’s specific whereabouts and said that Putin wasn’t planning to meet with him. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in the Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, according to local health authorities. They say most of the dead are women and children but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250, including older adults and children. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here's the Latest: UN Security Council appears united on the need to preserve Syria's sovereignty UNITED NATIONS – The U.N. Security Council appears united on the need to preserve Syria’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity and provide humanitarian assistance to millions in need following the surprise rebel offensive that overthrew President Bashar Assad, the United States and Russia said after a closed U.N. Security Council emergency meeting. Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, who called for Monday’s meeting, told reporters that the lightning takeover of Syria took everyone by surprise and the council has to watch and evaluate the fluid situation. 'The council, I think, was more or less united on the need to preserve the territorial integrity and unity of Syria, to ensure the protection of civilians, to ensure that humanitarian aid is coming to the needed population,' he said. Nebenzia said council members discussed issuing a united statement on Syria at the closed meeting, hopefully 'in the coming days.' U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood said the U.S. is working to get agreement on a statement 'over the next day or so.' 'The intention is for the council to speak with one voice on the situation in Syria,' he said. During the closed consultations, Wood said, the 15 council members showed 'a great respect and great understanding of what’s going on on the ground right now.' 'No one expected the Syrian forces to fall like a house of cards, and it took a lot of people by surprise,' he said. 'It’s very fluid situation, but just about everyone spoke about the need for Syria’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence to be respected, concern about the humanitarian situation.' Wood said there’s a lot of uncertainty about the future, but Assad’s ouster is a new opportunity for a democratic Syria that respects the human rights and dignity of the Syrian people. At the same time, there are great risks, he said, and 'we want to try to take advantage of the opportunities before other nefarious actors, try to take advantage of it for not so good purposes. Syria's UN ambassador says the country's diplomats have received instructions to continue with their jobs UNITED NATIONS – Syria’s U.N. ambassador says the country’s embassies and missions have received instructions to continue doing their job during the current transitional period. 'We are with the Syrian people,' Koussay Aldahhak told a group of journalists including The Associated Press on Monday outside the U.N. Security Council where members were holding emergency closed consultations on the rebel overthrow of President Bashar Assad. 'Syria now is witnessing a new era of change, a new historical phase of its history and Syrians are looking forward for establishing a state of freedom, equality, rule of law, democracy,' the Syrian envoy said. 'We will join efforts to rebuild our country, to rebuild what was destroyed, and to rebuild the future, a better future of Syria for all Syrians,' Syria’s U.N. mission follows instructions from the leaders who draw up the country’s foreign policy, he said, adding that while they await a new government 'we are continuing with the current one and the leadership.' On instructions from the current leaders, Aldahhak said he sent letters to the Security Council and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres Monday condemning and demanding an end to Israeli attacks on Syria on Sunday and Monday, and demanding 'to not allow Israel to benefit from the transition that the Syrians are doing now.' Aldahhak said like everyone he was surprised at the sudden transformation in the country. Asked whether he was happy about it, he said that even though the U.N. mission is thousands of miles from Syria, 'When Syrians are happy, we are happy. When Syrians are suffering, we are suffering.' 'We want to live in stability and security. Syrians suffered for a long time,' he said. State Department says it is not actively reviewing HTS ‘foreign terrorist organization’ designation WASHINGTON — The State Department says it is not actively reviewing the 'foreign terrorist organization' designation of the main Syrian rebel group that overthrew of President Bashar Assad’s government this weekend. But, it says such designations are constantly under review and that even while it is in place, the designation does not bar U.S. officials speaking with members or leaders of the group. 'There is no specific review related to what happened' over the weekend, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters on Monday. 'That said, we are always reviewing. Based on their actions there could be a change in our sanctions posture, but we have nothing today.' He said a review could be initiated if HTS takes steps to reverse the reasons for its designation. That would be based entirely on their actions, he said. The so-called FTO designation imposes numerous sanctions against those targeted, including a ban on the provision of 'material support' to such groups, although Miller said that would not necessarily prevent discussions between its members and U.S. officials. He cited the case of the Trump administration negotiating with the Taliban over the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan but later conceded that the Taliban has never been designated an FTO. Instead, the Taliban was listed as a 'specially designated terrorist organization' a label that comes with less stringent sanctions. Nevertheless, Miller said that U.S. officials 'do have the ability, when it is in our interest legally to communicate with a designated terrorist organization.' In an unrelated move, Miller said the U.S. had arranged with local groups to secure the shuttered U.S. embassy compound in Damascus, which suspended operations in 2012 and had been until recently under the protection of the Czech embassy. The Czechs, however, closed their own embassy in Damascus as the situation in the capital grew more uncertain. Miller would not say with what groups the U.S. made the arrangements with. U.S. President Joe Biden speaks to Jordan’s King Abdullah II about Syria President Joe Biden and Jordan’s King Abdullah II spoke by phone on Monday about the rapidly evolving situation in Syria and joint efforts to keep the terror group ISIS from exploiting the situation, according to the White House. The leaders also discussed the dozens of U.S airstrikes conducted on Sunday targeting IS leaders and fighters in the Syrian desert as well as ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. The call between the leaders comes with Undersecretary of state for Political Affairs John Bass and Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf in the region now holding consultations with key partners. They are in Amman, Jordan, on Monday and were in Doha, Qatar, over the weekend. More than a million Syrian refugees have flooded into neighboring Jordan since the civil war ignited in 2011, and officials in Amman are hoping to avoid another refugee crisis following the fall of Basher al-Assad’s regime. 'The President emphasized the support of the United States for the stability of Jordan and Jordan’s central role in maintaining stability and de-escalating tensions throughout the Middle East region,' the White House said in a statement. Syrian rights organization says Israeli air forces launched more than 100 airstrikes in Syria. DAMASCUS—The Israeli air force launched more than 100 airstrikes targeting military sites in four Syrian cities, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Associated Press reporters. The strikes killed two people and caused extensive damage to key military facilities. The targeted military sites included research centers, weapons warehouses, airports and aircraft squadrons, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The attacks also disabled air defense systems and rendered multiple sites inoperable. Among the targets were research centers in Hama and Damascus, including the Barzeh Scientific Research Center. The facility has previously been targeted, most notably during a 2018 U.S.-led coalition strike in response to Syria’s alleged chemical weapons program. In Damascus, an Associated Press reporter described plumes of smoke rising from the Barzeh research facility as weapon warehouses were also struck. Heavy explosions were heard across the capital. In the port city of Latakia, airstrikes hit an air defense facility near the coastal port, damaging Syrian naval ships and warehouses previously controlled by the former Syrian regime, the Syrian Observatory said. In Daraa, a city in southwestern Syria, strikes targeted military positions and warehouses in the western countryside and northern areas, killing two people, the observatory said. The Israeli military declined to comment on the strikes in Syria. Earlier on Monday, Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said it had struck suspected chemical weapons sites and long-range rockets in Syria to prevent them from falling into the hands of hostile actors. U.S. sends special envoy for hostage affairs to Beirut The U.S. has sent its special envoy for hostage affairs to Beirut to seek information about the whereabouts of Austin Tice, a journalist who vanished in Syria 12 years ago, following the overthrow of Bashar Assad’s government. Roger Carstens is talking to officials in the region to find out where Tice is and 'get him home as soon as possible,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters Monday. President Joe Biden said Sunday that his administration believed Tice was alive and was committed to bringing him home. Tice, who has had his work published by The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and other outlets, disappeared in August 2012 at a checkpoint in a contested area west of Damascus. A video released weeks after Tice went missing showed him blindfolded and held by armed men and saying, 'Oh, Jesus.' He has not been heard from since. Syria has publicly denied that it was holding him. Israel's UN ambassador sends an urgent letter to UN Security Council calling Syria's developments ‘a security threat’ Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon sent an urgent letter to the U.N. Security Council Monday calling the recent developments in Syria 'a security threat' and saying it has taken 'limited and temporary measures to counter any further threat to its citizens.' He said Israel is committed to the framework of the 1974 disengagement agreement and 'does not intervene in the ongoing conflict between Syrian armed groups.' The Security Council is scheduled to meet shortly for closed consultations called by Russia which said it wanted the buffer zone issue discussed. UN says Israeli forces are occupying a demilitarized buffer zone in violation of a ceasefire agreement UNITED NATIONS – The United Nations says Israeli forces are occupying a demilitarized buffer zone between Israel and Syria in violation of a 1974 ceasefire agreement following the 1973 Mideast war. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday U.N. peacekeepers confirmed that 'Israeli Defense Forces have entered the area of separation and have been moving within that area where they remain in at least three locations.' The Israeli military informed the peacekeeping force, known as UNDOF, that it would enter the area as 'a temporary defensive measure' to prevent it from being occupied 'by non-state armed groups' and reserved the right to take action against any threat against Israel, Dujarric said. 'For our part, the peacekeepers at UNDOF informed the Israeli counterparts that these actions would constitute a violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement, that there should be no military forces or activities in the area of separation, and Israel and Syria must continue to uphold the terms of that 1974 agreement,' the U.N. spokesman said. Dujarric underscored that following the rebel overthrow of president Bashar Assad 'the U.N. remains committed to helping Syrians build a country where reconciliation, where justice, and where freedom and prosperity are shared realities for all.' UN secretary-general speaks to Turkey and Qatar leaders about rebuilding Syria's institutions U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke to Turkey’s foreign minister and Qatar’s prime minister Monday morning about rebuilding Syria’s institutions so that they are inclusive, protect minority rights, and restore Syria’s territorial integrity, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Guterres and his senior advisors, including U.N. special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen, will continue to press this issue with other key leaders and parties, he said. On the humanitarian front, Dujarric said more than 16 million Syrians need assistance and there is an urgent need for more shelter materials, food and sanitation facilities. According to the U.N.’s partners, he said, some one million people, mostly women and children, were displaced between Nov. 28 and Sunday, particularly from Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Idlib governorates. Hundreds of Syrian refugees gather at border crossings in southern Turkey, eager to return to Syria Hundreds of Syrian refugees gathered at two border crossings in southern Turkey on Monday, eagerly anticipating their return home following the fall of President Bashar Assad’s government. Many arrived at the Cilvegozu and Oncupinar border gates at daybreak, draped in blankets and coats. Some camped by the barriers of the border crossing, warming themselves with makeshift fires or resting on the cold ground. The crossings correspond to the Bab al-Hawa and Bab al-Salameh gates on the Syrian side of the border. Hundreds of displaced Syrians are also returning from Lebanon, with dozens of cars lining up to enter. Turkish officials have not said how many Syrians have returned since Assad’s downfall. The country hosts 3 million refugees. Turkey's president welcomes capture of two Kurdish-held cities in northern Syria ANKARA, Turkey - Turkey’s president on Monday welcomed the capture of two Kurdish-held cities in northern Syria by a Turkey-backed opposition force and said Turkey would not allow militant groups to threaten its security from across its borders. The Turkish proxy force, known as the Syrian National Army, took control of the city of Manbij on Monday days after it also took over the city of Tal Rifaat, expelling Syrian Kurdish militias. In a televised address, Recep Tayyip Erdogan maintained that Kurdish groups in Syria were attempting to 'turn the chaos into an opportunity.' 'We will not tolerate the emergence of new terrorist outbreaks beyond our borders,' Erdogan said. The Turkish leader again hailed the fall of Syrian President Bashir Assad and vowed to stand by the Syrian people. 'As of yesterday, dark era has ended in Syria, bright days have begun,' Erdogan said. 'While Aleppo, Hama, Homs and finally Damascus passed under the control of (Syria’s) real owners, the Baath dictatorship which had survived through blood, cruelty, oppression and tyranny for 61 years, has completely collapsed.' Erdogan added that Turkey wanted all of Syria's ethnic and religious groups to live in peace. As hundreds of refugees began to return to Syria, Erdogan announced plans to reopen a third border crossing to prevent 'congestions and ease the (refugee) flows.' Syria's opposition meets for the first time with the prime minister BEIRUT — The leader of Syria’s opposition met for the first time with the country’s prime minister to discuss Syria’s political transition following the fall of the Syrian regime. He emphasized that the new leadership cannot entirely abandon the practices of the previous government. In a video of the meeting shared on the rebels’ 'Military Operations' Telegram channel, opposition leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, widely known as Abu Mohammad al-Golani, told Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi Jalali, 'The men have a high level of experience,' referring to the rebels. 'They started the work from nothing. Idlib is small and has few resources, but thank God, we were able to achieve something big through it,' he added. 'You will see there are skills, and despite this, we cannot dispense of the old practices.' Earlier today, Jalali said most cabinet members who are in Damascus are performing their duties from their offices to guarantee security in the country. Britain suspends decisions on accepting Syrian refugees LONDON — Britain has followed Germany and several other European countries by suspending decisions about whether to accept Syrian refugees in the wake of the Assad government’s fall. The Home Office said in a statement on Monday that it 'has paused decisions on Syrian asylum claims whilst we assess the current situation.' British prime minister says the UK will not soon remove Syrian militant group HTS from its list of terror groups LONDON — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says the U.K. will not soon remove Syrian militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham from its list of terror groups, after one of his Cabinet ministers said it would be considered 'quite quickly.' Speaking on a visit to Saudi Arabia, Starmer said 'no decision is pending at all on this.' Starmer said 'it is far too early' to make that decision, and 'at the moment the focus has to be on talking to our allies, making sure that this is an opportunity for Syria and therefore we have to work to make sure that this is a peaceful opportunity.' Foreign Secretary David Lammy said HTS’ past links with al-Qaida 'should rightly make us cautious' and 'we will judge HTS by their actions.' Cabinet Minister Pat McFadden said earlier that the group’s removal from the terrorist list 'will have to be considered quite quickly.' U.S. deputy ambassador to the UN outlines its priorities ahead of emergency Security Council meeting UNITED NATIONS – The United States has three primary interests in Syria: protecting U.S. soldiers and personnel, ensuring U.S. allies are safe, and preventing a humanitarian catastrophe, the U.S. deputy ambassador said ahead of an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting on the fast-evolving events in the country. The United States will work to try and ensure that 'all of those things happen,' Robert Wood told reporters ahead of Monday afternoon’s closed council meeting called by Russia. He said another 'high, high priority' for the U.S. is to locate and free missing American journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared 12 years ago near the Syrian capital. 'We have reasons to believe that he still is (alive), but we have to see,' he said. Wood called the situation in Syria 'dynamic' following the rebel overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The U.S. will judge the insurgent force now in control of Syria, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS on 'what actions they take.' HTS is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, which impacts U.S. efforts to communicate directly with the rebels. But he said there are various channels to talk to different factions 'and we’re going to do that in order to try to best protect our interests in Syria right now.' As for Iran’s so-called Axis of Resistance, Wood said Tehran and its allies Hezbollah and Hamas are clearly weakened while Israel has been strengthened. 'We just want to make sure that nefarious players are not going to be able to take advantage of the situation in Syria right now, because everything is fragile and fast-moving,' Wood said. Rebel forces in Syria announce a general amnesty for all conscripted soldiers BEIRUT— Rebel forces in Syria announced Monday a general amnesty for all conscripted soldiers serving under mandatory service in the now-ousted Syrian regime. 'The Military Operations Directorate announces a general amnesty for all conscripted soldiers serving under mandatory service. Their safety is guaranteed, and any harm or assault against them is strictly prohibited,' the opposition said in a message on their Telegram channel. The announcement followed the ousting of Bashar Assad and the fall of his regime, which had ruled Syria for over 50 years. The opposition faced little resistance from the Syrian army as it moved south, swiftly capturing one city after another. Global chemical arms watchdog warns Syria about unaccounted weapons THE HAGUE — The global chemical weapons watchdog on Monday reminded Syria of its obligations to comply with rules to safeguard certain toxic chemicals, after rebels entered the capital Damascus over the weekend and overthrew President Bashar Assad. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said in a statement it has been 'monitoring closely the recent developments in Syria, with special attention to the status of its chemical weapons related sites and other locations of interest.' Syria’s Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said Monday that most cabinet ministers are still working from offices in Damascus but the status of a stockpile of chemical weapons that Assad has been accused of using against civilians is unclear. Assad’s government has denied using chemical weapons but the OPCW has found evidence indicating their repeated use by Syria in the country’s grinding civil war. Ceasefire implementation committee holds its first meeting in Lebanon BEIRUT — Representatives from a five-member committee tasked with enforcing a ceasefire that stopped the war between Hezbollah and Israel on Monday held their first meeting in Naqoura, southern Lebanon. The group, comprising the United States, France, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon known as UNIFIL, the Lebanese army and the Israeli army met to coordinate efforts supporting the Nov. 27 ceasefire, the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said. Hosted by UNIFIL and chaired by the U.S. with France assisting, the meeting focused on advancing the implementation of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire and U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which aims to maintain stability along the Lebanon-Israel border, the embassy said. 'This mechanism will meet regularly and coordinate closely to advance implementation of the ceasefire agreement and UNSCR 1701,' the U.S. Embassy said. The U.S. military announced in late November that Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers and envoy Amos Hochstein would co-chair the committee temporarily, with Hochstein serving until a permanent civilian co-chair is appointed.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-strikes-in-gaza-kill-6-as-un-security-council-plans-to-meet-over-syria/	2024-12-09T16:44:40-08:00	
Zelenskyy open to Western troops providing security for end to wa...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that he's open to the potential deployment of Western troops in Ukraine to guarantee the country’s security as part of a broad effort to end the almost three-year war with Russia. The deployment would be a step toward Ukraine joining NATO, Zelenskyy said in a post on his Telegram channel. 'But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the European Union and when Ukraine will be in NATO,' Zelenskyy said. His proposals tread a delicate diplomatic path amid international efforts to find a way of ending Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II at a time when Russia has gained an upper hand in the fighting. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is seeking to bring about a ceasefire and met with Zelenskyy in Paris on Saturday. But Zelenskyy said Monday that he would approach outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden about Ukraine’s possible NATO membership because he's still in office, while Trump doesn't yet have 'legal rights' to decide on the matter. 'He wants to have a cease-fire,' Trump said of Zelenskyy in comments to the New York Post published Sunday. 'He wants to make peace. We didn’t talk about the details.' Putin’s forces are taking heavy losses in Ukraine, Trump noted. 'I’m formulating a concept of how to end that ridiculous war,' he said. The possibilities of Ukraine joining the 32-nation NATO military alliance and of Western troops being stationed on its soil have been deeply divisive and contentious issues since Russia’s full-scale invasion began on Feb. 24, 2022. At their summit in Washington in July, NATO declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership, but stopped short of inviting the country in. The United States and Germany have balked at Ukraine joining NATO while at war with Russia. One obstacle has been the view that Ukraine’s borders would need to be clearly demarcated before it could join so that there can be no mistaking where the alliance’s pact of mutual defense would come into effect. Russia’s invading army occupies about one-fifth of Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron floated the idea of Western troops on the ground in Ukraine last February. But it raised the same fears of escalation that have led Western leaders to place limits on weapons supplies and permissions for their use. European military heavyweights Germany and Poland immediately said they wouldn't send troops to Ukraine. Macron declined to provide details about which nations were considering sending troops, saying he preferred to maintain some 'strategic ambiguity.' Ukraine’s forces are weathering a monthslong onslaught by Russia centered on the eastern Donetsk region, where Kyiv’s defenses are creaking. Zelenskyy said on X that over the past week alone, Russia launched nearly 500 powerful guided bombs, more than 400 attack drones and almost 20 missiles of various types against Ukraine. 'Ukraine wants this war to end more than anyone else. No doubt, a diplomatic resolution would save lives. We do seek it,' he said. Zelenskyy thanked Biden for the latest U.S. military aid of nearly $1 billion. With doubts about whether Trump will keep up U.S. military support, the Biden administration has been trying to spend every dollar remaining from a massive foreign aid bill passed earlier this year to put Ukraine in the strongest position possible. Meanwhile, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s challenger in the upcoming German election, Friedrich Merz, said that there’s a 'basic consensus' in Germany on continuing to provide military aid to Ukraine. But during a visit to Kyiv, he also highlighted differences with Scholz, who has refused to send Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine as he insists that everything must be done to prevent a wider war between the West and Russia. Merz has been open to providing them and allowing Ukraine to hit military targets inside Russia. As he met Zelenskyy, Merz noted that France, the U.K. and the U.S. have a different position from the current German government. 'Our position is clear, as is that of my parliamentary group: we want to put your army in a position to reach military bases in Russia – not the civilian population, not the infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being fought,' he said. 'With this range restriction, we are forcing your country to fight with one hand behind its back, and that is not our position,' he added. Merz’s center-right Union bloc leads German opinion polls. The election is expected on Feb. 23. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-zelenskyy-open-to-western-troops-providing-security-for-end-to-war-in-ukraine/	2024-12-09T10:20:24-08:00	
Gaza health officials say latest Israeli airstrikes kill at least...	DEIR AL BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes in central Gaza killed at least 14 people including children Sunday, Palestinian health officials said, while the bombing of a hospital in northern Gaza wounded a half-dozen patients. Israel’s military continues its latest offensive against Hamas militants in northern Gaza, whose remaining Palestinians have been almost completely cut off from the rest of the territory amid a growing humanitarian crisis. One airstrike flattened a residential building in the urban Bureij refugee camp Sunday afternoon, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the casualties were taken. At least nine people were killed including six children and a woman. An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies at the hospital’s morgue. Earlier on Sunday, another Israeli strike hit a tent in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least five people including two parents and their two children, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said. In northern Gaza, the Health Ministry said a bombing targeted the Indonesian Hospital wounding six patients, one of them seriously. It is the largest hospital north of Gaza City. 'We demand international protection for hospitals, patients and medical staff,' the ministry said in a statement that also urged safe passage to and from hospitals, more medical supplies and fuel and safe evacuation of the wounded. The Israeli military Sunday evening said it was unaware of any attack on the Indonesian Hospital 'in the last three to four hours.' Meanwhile, the military said it briefly closed the key Kerem Shalom crossing after fighters launched mortar shells several meters (feet) from the nearby humanitarian corridor toward its troops. It said Gaza's main cargo crossing was reopened after those who fired were 'eliminated,' though it added that the arrival and distribution of humanitarian aid was delayed. Kerem Shalom is the only crossing between Israel and Gaza that is designed for cargo shipments and has been the main artery for aid since the Rafah crossing with Egypt was shut in May. Last month, nearly two-thirds of aid entering Gaza came through Kerem Shalom. A second cold, rainy winter is beginning in Gaza, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in squalid tent camps and reliant on international aid. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 45,600 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-gaza-health-officials-say-latest-israeli-airstrikes-kill-at-least-14-including-children/	2024-12-08T10:18:18-08:00	
Trump calls for 'immediate ceasefire' in Ukraine after meeting wi...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, shortly after a meeting in Paris with French and Ukrainian leaders, claiming Kyiv 'would like to make a deal' to end the more than 1,000-day war. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed that Moscow and Kyiv have both lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a war that 'should never have started.' 'There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed,' he said, as he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to act to bring the fighting to an end. Trump’s remarks came after a meeting Saturday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, that Zelenskyy later described as 'constructive'. Speaking to reporters later that day, Zelenskyy insisted that any peace deal 'should be just' for Ukrainians, 'so that Russia and Putin or any other aggressors will not have the opportunity to return.' In a separate social media update Sunday, Zelenskyy asserted that Kyiv has so far lost 43,000 soldiers since Moscow's all-out invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, while a further 370,000 have been wounded. Both Russia and Ukraine have been reluctant to publish official casualty figures, but Western officials have said that the past few months of grinding positional warfare in eastern Ukraine have meant record losses for both sides, with tens of thousands killed and wounded each month.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/trump-calls-for-immediate-ceasefire-in-ukraine-after-meeting-with-zelenskyy/	2024-12-08T06:40:18-08:00	
Middle East latest: Negotiations on a Gaza ceasefire have resumed...	An Israeli airstrike cut a primary border crossing point between Lebanon and Syria, days after it was reopened, Lebanon’s National News Agency reported Friday. The airstrike on the Arida border crossing in the country’s north caused heavy material damage and cut the road. Al-Watan, a pro-government daily newspaper in Syria, also reported that the border crossing was closed in the early Friday airstrike. Separately, Syrian insurgents entered two central towns early Friday just north of the central city of Homs, bringing them closer Syria’s third largest city, an opposition war monitor and pro-government media both reported. The break into Rastan and Talbiseh came a day after opposition gunmen captured the central city of Hama, Syria’s fourth largest, after the Syrian army said it withdrew to avoid fighting inside the city and spare the lives of civilians. Meanwhile. a Hamas official said international mediators have resumed negotiations with the militant group and Israel over a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he is hopeful a deal to end the 14-month war is within reach. Israel's war against Hamas has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel in October 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. Israel’s blistering retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the Latest: Israeli airstrike cuts key crossing point between Lebanon and Syria - report BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state news agency said Friday that an Israeli airstrike cut a primary border crossing point between Lebanon and Syria, days after it was reopened. Lebanon’s National News Agency said the airstrike on the Arida border crossing in the country’s north caused heavy material damage and cut the road. Al-Watan, a pro-government daily newspaper in Syria, also reported that the border crossing was closed in the early Friday airstrike. The Israeli military said fighter jets attacked the border crossing between Lebanon and Syria, adding that they were used to transfer munitions for Lebanon’s Hezbollah group. Over the past two months, Israel’s airstrikes closed several border crossings between Lebanon and Syria. The Arida border crossing was attacked in late November and reopened days later before it was struck again. Syrian insurgents enter 2 central towns, bringing them close to the city of Homs BEIRUT — Syrian insurgents entered two central towns early Friday just north of the central city of Homs, bringing them closer Syria’s third largest city, an opposition war monitor and pro-government media both reported. The break into Rastan and Talbiseh came a day after opposition gunmen captured the central city of Hama, Syria’s fourth largest, after the Syrian army said it withdrew to avoid fighting inside the city and spare the lives of civilians. The insurgents, led by the jihadi Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, have said that they will march to Homs and Damascus, President Bashar Assad’s seat of power. The city of Homs, parts of which were controlled by insurgents until 2014, is a major intersection point between the capital, Damascus, and Syria’s coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus where Assad enjoys wide support. Homs province is Syria’s largest in size and borders Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. Insurgents are now 5 kilometers (3 miles) away from Homs, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor. 'The battle of Homs is the mother of all battles and will decide who will rule Syria,' said Rami Abdurrahman, the Observatory’s chief. Iran says it conducted a successful space launch in a program long criticized by the West MANAMA, Bahrain — Iran said Friday it conducted a successful space launch, the latest for its program the West alleges improves Tehran’s ballistic missile technology. Iran conducted the launch using its Simorgh program, a satellite-carrying rocket that had had a series of failed launches, at Iran’s Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province. That’s the site of Iran’s civilian space program. The Simorgh carried what Iran described as an 'orbital propulsion system,' as well as two research systems to a 400-kilometer (250-mile) orbit above the Earth. A system that could change the orbit of a spacecraft would allow Iran to geo-synchronize the orbits of its satellites. Tehran has long sought that ability. Iran also put the payload of the Simorgh at 300 kilograms (660 pounds), heavier than its previous successful launches. There was no immediate independent confirmation the launch was successful. The U.S. military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The announcement comes as heightened tensions grip the wider Middle East over Israel’s continued war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon. Australian leader blames antisemitism for arson that extensively damaged a Melbourne synagogue MELBOURNE, Australia — Arsonists extensively damaged a Melbourne synagogue on Friday in what Australia’s prime minister condemned as an antisemitic attack on Australian values. The blaze in the Adass Israel Synagogue is an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and Hamas last year. Cars and buildings have been vandalized and torched around Australia in protests inspired by the war. A witness who had come to the synagogue to pray saw two masked men spreading a liquid accelerant with brooms inside the building at 4:10 a.m., officials said. About 60 firefighters with 17 fire trucks responded to the blaze, which police said caused extensive damage. Investigators have yet to identify a motive, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese blamed antisemitism. 'This was a shocking incident to be unequivocally condemned. There is no place in Australia for an outrage such as this,' Albanese told reporters. 'To attack a place of worship is an attack on Australian values. To attack a synagogue is an act of antisemitism, is attacking the right that all Australians should have to practice their faith in peace and security,' he added. Hamas official says Gaza ceasefire talks have resumed after weekslong hiatus ISTANBUL — A Hamas official says international mediators have resumed negotiating with the militant group and Israel over a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he was hopeful a deal to end the 14-month war was within reach. Ceasefire negotiations were halted last month when Qatar suspended talks with mediators from Egypt and the United States because of frustration over a lack of progress between Israel and Hamas. But there has been a 'reactivation' of efforts in recent days to end the fighting, release hostages from Gaza and free Palestinian prisoners in Israel, according to Bassem Naim, an official in Hamas’ political bureau who spoke with The Associated Press in Turkey on Thursday. Another official familiar with the talks confirmed the return of Qatari mediators. The official spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations with the media. Since the talks broke down, there have been significant shifts in the global and regional landscape. Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, and a ceasefire was declared last week between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. Trump is a staunch supporter of Israel, but Naim said he believes the incoming administration could 'affect the situation positively' given that Trump had made halting wars in the region part of his campaign platform. Trump this week called for the release of all hostages held in Gaza by the time he takes office on Jan. 20, saying there would be 'hell to pay' if that doesn’t happen. Attack near US base in eastern Syria may have wounded 3 service members, Pentagon says WASHINGTON -- Three U.S. service members were being evaluated for potential traumatic brain injuries following an attack near a base in eastern Syria this week, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday. Ryder said U.S. Central Command is still evaluating who was behind the attack near Mission Support Site Euphrates, which prompted the U.S. to conduct counter strikes on Tuesday. At the time, the Pentagon said rockets and mortars had landed in the vicinity of the base. The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria to conduct missions to counter the Islamic Stage group. ___ By Lolita Baldor	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-negotiations-on-a-gaza-ceasefire-have-resumed-hamas-says/	2024-12-06T04:01:47-08:00	
Ailing kids wait months for Israeli permission to leave Gaza for ...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The 12-year-old Palestinian boy was lying in a hospital bed in central Gaza, wracked with leukemia, malnourished and whimpering in pain despite the morphine doctors were giving him, when Rosalia Bollen, a UNICEF official, said she saw him in late October. Islam al-Rayahen’s family had asked Israeli authorities six times over the past months for permission to evacuate him from Gaza for a desperately needed stem cell transplant, Bollen said. Six times, the request was refused for unexplained security reasons, she said. Islam died three days after she saw him, Bollen said. Thousands of patients in Gaza are waiting for Israeli permission for urgently needed medical evacuation from Gaza for treatment of war wounds or chronic diseases they can’t get after the destruction of much of the territory’s health care system by Israel’s 15-month military campaign. Among them are at least 2,500 children who UNICEF says must be transported immediately. 'They cannot afford to wait. These children will die. They’re dying in waiting and I find it striking that the world is letting that happen,' Bollen said. The Israeli military often takes months to respond to medical evacuation requests, and the number of evacuations has plunged in recent months. In some cases, the military rejects either the patient or, in the case of children, the caregivers accompanying them on vague security grounds or with no explanation. The Israeli decisions appear to be 'arbitrary and are not made on a criteria nor logic,' said Moeen Mahmood, the Jordan country director for Doctors Without Borders. COGAT, the Israeli military agency in charge of humanitarian affairs for Palestinians, said in a statement to The Associated Press that it 'makes every effort to approve the departure of children and their families for medical treatments, subject to a security check.' It did not respond when asked for details about Islam's case. A military official said Israel's internal intelligence service reviews whether the patient or their escort have what he called 'a connection to terrorism,' and if one is found they are refused. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential procedures. Osaid Shaheen, who is nearly 2, now faces having his eyes removed after Israel rejected his evacuation for treatment of cancer in his retinas. The toddler was diagnosed with the cancer in April, after his mother, Sondos Abu Libda, noticed his left eyelid was droopy. The World Health Organization requested his evacuation through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza, but the crossing was shut down in May when Israeli troops took it over in an offensive, Abu Libda said. WHO applied again, this time for Osaid to leave through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Israel, now the only route for evacuees to travel. During the long wait, the cancer spread to the child’s other eye and reached stage 4. In November, Abu Libda was told Osaid was rejected on security grounds with no further explanation. She was stunned, she said. 'I didn’t expect that a child could get a security rejection.' Doctors have given the boy three doses of chemotherapy. But with supplies short in Gaza, they’re struggling to get more. If they can’t, they will have to remove Osaid's eyes or the cancer will spread to other parts of his body, Abu Libda said. 'He’s just a child. How will he live his life without seeing? How will he play? How will he see his future and how will his life turn out?' Abu Libda asked, standing outside the house where her family is sheltering in the Beni Suheil district of southern Gaza. Nearby, little Osaid — who so far still has his sight — toddled around in the rubble of a building destroyed by Israeli forces, smiling as he played with chunks of rubble. When asked about his case, COGAT did not reply. WHO says 14,000 patients of all ages need medical evacuation from Gaza, the territory's Health Ministry puts the number higher, at 22,000, including 7,000 patients in extreme need who could die soon without treatment, according to Mohamed Abu Salmeya, a ministry official in charge of evacuation referrals. Since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, 5,230 patients have been evacuated, said Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson. Since May, when the Rafah crossing shut down, the rate has slowed down, with only 342 patients evacuated, she said, an average of less than two a day. Before the war, when Israeli permission was also necessary, around 100 patients a day were transferred out of Gaza, according to WHO. More than 44,500 Palestinians have been killed and more than 105,000 wounded by Israel’s bombardment and ground offensives, launched in retaliation for Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The casualty toll, by Gaza’s Health Ministry, does not distinguish combatants from civilians — but more than half are women and children. Gaza’s health system has been decimated, with only 17 of the territory’s original 36 hospitals functioning — and those only partially. They struggle with the waves of war wounded on top of patients with other conditions. Carrying out specialized surgeries or treatments in Gaza is difficult or impossible, with equipment destroyed, some specialist doctors killed or arrested and medical supplies limited. Gaza’s only dedicated cancer hospital was seized by Israeli troops early in the war, heavily damaged and has been shut down. Doctors without Borders said in August, it sought to evacuate 32 children along with their caregivers, but only six were allowed to leave. In November, it applied for eight others, including a 2-year-old with leg amputations, but Israeli authorities blocked evacuation, it said The military official said five of the eight requests in November were approved but the caregivers trying to travel with the children were rejected on security grounds. The official said Doctors Without Borders would have to resubmit the requests with alternate escorts. The official didn't say why the other three children weren't approved. The rejected caregivers were the children's mothers and grandmothers, said Mahmood, the Doctor's Without Borders official, who said no explanation was given for the security concern. Children long waiting for permission face dire consequences if they don’t get treatment. Nima al-Askari said doctors told her that 4-year-old Qusay could become paralyzed if her son doesn’t get surgery in the next two or three months for a heart defect that constricts his aorta. 'Should I wait until my son becomes paralyzed?' al-Askari said. 'Everyone is telling me to wait until he gets evacuated. ... This is my only son. I can’t see him in a wheelchair.' Asma Saed said she has been waiting for three months to hear whether her 2-year-old son, Al-Hassan, can travel for treatment for kidney failure. In the meantime, they are living in a squalid tent camp in Khan Younis, with little clean water or food. She said her son doesn’t sleep, screaming all night. 'I wish I could see him like any child in the world who can move, walk, and play,' she said. 'He’s a child, he can’t express his pain.' ___ Khaled reported from Cairo.

Hamas official says Gaza ceasefire talks have resumed after weeks...	ISTANBUL (AP) — A Hamas official said Thursday that international mediators have resumed negotiating with the militant group and Israel over a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he was hopeful a deal to end the 14-month war was within reach. Ceasefire negotiations were halted last month when Qatar suspended talks with mediators from Egypt and the United States because of frustration over a lack of progress between Israel and Hamas. But there has been a 'reactivation' of efforts in recent days to end the fighting, release hostages from Gaza and free Palestinian prisoners in Israel, according to Bassem Naim, an official in Hamas’ political bureau who spoke with The Associated Press in Turkey. Another official familiar with the talks confirmed the return of Qatari mediators. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations with the media. Since the talks broke down, there have been significant shifts in the global and regional landscape. Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, and a ceasefire was declared last week between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. Trump is a staunch supporter of Israel, but Naim said he believes the incoming administration could 'affect the situation positively' given that Trump had made halting wars in the region part of his campaign platform. Trump this week called for the release of all hostages held in Gaza by the time he takes office on Jan. 20, saying there would be 'hell to pay' if that doesn't happen. Previous rounds of negotiations focused on variations of a proposal calling for a multiphased ceasefire — beginning with a preliminary six-week halt in fighting during which female, elderly and sick hostages would be freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. During that time, Israel would pull back some forces, and displaced Palestinians would be allowed to return home. The sides would also begin talks on the next phase that would include the full withdrawal of Israeli forces, the release of remaining hostages and the terms of a permanent end to the war. A third, final phase would focus on reconstruction. Naim said that no 'solid, well-formed' new ceasefire proposal has yet been presented to Hamas. And even though ceasefire talks have broken down on multiple occasions throughout the war, he added: 'I think it is not a big challenge to reach a deal … if there are intentions on the other side.' Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. Israel’s blistering retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, whose count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. In the negotiations to end the conflict, the two sides have been at odds on some major points, including whether any halt in the fighting would be permanent or temporary and whether Israeli forces would withdraw from all of the enclave, and on what timetable. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain a long-term military presence in the territory and vowed to dismantle Hamas' military capabilities and ensure that the militant group never governs again. Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff met separately in recent weeks with Netanyahu and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani to discuss Gaza ceasefire talks, according to a U.S. official who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to comment publicly. In an interview with British broadcaster Sky News on Wednesday, the Qatari prime minister said officials in his country are aiming to reach a ceasefire before president-elect Trump takes office. Naim said Hamas is sticking to the core demands it has held to during previous rounds of negotiations, including a permanent ceasefire, total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, and the right of internally displaced Palestinians in Gaza to return to their homes. But he also said the Palestinian militant group is 'ready to show flexibility' on implementation, including on the timeline for withdrawal of Israeli forces from key parts of Gaza. A previous round of talks in August reached an impasse in part because Israel demanded that it after any ceasefire it should maintain a military presence in the Philadelphi corridor, a strategic strip along the enclave’s border with Egypt, and in the Netzarim corrider that cuts from east to west across the territory's midsection. 'There can be a discussion about these points, but at the end, Israel has to withdraw totally from the Philadelphi corridor, and the Rafah border (with Egypt) has to be opened immediately,' Naim said. Naim said Palestinian factions were also making progress in deciding who would rule Gaza politically after the war. He confirmed that Hamas and its rival Fatah — which dominates the Western-backed Palestinian Authority — have reached an agreement in principle on forming a temporary committee of Palestinian technocrats that would govern Gaza in the immediate aftermath of the war. Under this arrangement, Hamas would give up its political rule of the enclave, but not lay down its arms. 'Originally we are a Palestinian national liberation movement. We are not a movement to govern,' he said. 'When it comes to the military wing ... as long as we are people under occupation, we have all the right to resist this occupation by all means, including armed resistance. Israel says it will never let Hamas rule Gaza again, and is demanding the group disarm. Hamas political official Khalil al-Hayya had previously told AP that if an independent Palestinian state were established along 1967 borders, the group would lay down its arms. Naim said that remains the group’s position. 'Resistance, including armed resistance, is a tool,' he said. 'It is not a goal in itself.' ___ Associated Press writers Josef Federman in Jerusalem, and Aamer Madhani in Washington, contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hamas-official-says-gaza-ceasefire-talks-have-resumed-after-weekslong-hiatus/	2024-12-05T21:41:48-08:00	
Blinken and Russia's Lavrov clash on Ukraine at a security meetin...	VALLETTA, Malta (AP) — Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov clashed Thursday indirectly with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at an annual security meeting, accusing the West of risking escalation over Ukraine but walking out before Blinken and other speakers could respond. Speaking at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ministerial meeting in Malta, Lavrov accused the West of reviving the Cold War and provoking a direct conflict with Russia. He said the U.S. actions were driven by a desire to 'return NATO to the political spotlight.' 'After the Afghan disgrace, there was a need for a new common enemy,' Lavrov said during his first stop in an EU nation since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 'The result is the reincarnation of the Cold War, but now with the far greater risk of its escalation into the hot phase.' Blinken, who spoke after Lavrov left the room, put the blame for escalation in the region back on Russia, noting that the Russian foreign minister, the fourth speaker, did not stick around to listen to other speakers. 'Let’s talk about escalation,'' Blinken said, citing the deployment of North Korean forces in Europe, the use of an intermediate-range ballistic missile to attack Ukraine, Russia's move to lower the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, and attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. 'Mr. Lavrov spoke about the sovereign right of every member-state to make their own choices,'' Blinken said. 'That’s exactly what this is about: the sovereign right of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people to make their own choices about the future, not to have those choices made in and by Moscow.' Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, who was the first to address the panel, walked out as Lavrov took the podium, along with the foreign ministers of Poland and Estonia. Before leaving the podium, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, Andrii Sybiha, called his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov a 'war criminal.' 'Ukraine continues to fight for its right to exist. And the Russian war criminal at this table (Lavrov) should know this: Ukraine will succeed and justice will prevail.' The visit marked Lavrov’s first visit to an EU member nation since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has been relatively rare for Lavrov to attend forums involving senior Western officials, although he recently took part in the United Nations General Assembly and the G20 summit in Brazil. Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on her message app that Malta had annulled her visa to accompany Lavrov. The Maltese foreign affairs office said that three OSCE member countries had objected to extending the visa to Zakharova, who is under a travel ban. Lavrov is subject to EU sanctions, but faces no travel ban. Lavrov attended the event last year in Skopje, North Macedonia, but Poland denied him a visa the previous year in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Blinken traveled to Malta from Brussels, where he attended what was likely to be his last NATO meeting of the outgoing Biden administration. Ukraine’s foreign minister was also attending, after Ukraine boycotted last year over Lavrov’s attendance. Reporters Without Borders called on the OSCE to release 38 journalists detained by Russia, including 19 Ukrainians arrested in illegally occupied territories. It said in a statement that Russia is the world’s fifth-largest jailer of journalists.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-blinken-russias-lavrov-clash-on-ukraine-at-a-security-meeting-in-malta/	2024-12-05T17:49:13-08:00
