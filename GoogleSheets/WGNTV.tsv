The Latest: Trump considering pressure on Russia and seeking deal...	President Donald Trump said he’s 'strongly considering' sanctions and tariffs on Russia in hopes of forcing a settlement to the war in Ukraine. Trump also sent a letter to Iran’s leaders seeking to negotiate a nuclear deal. In economic news, uncertainty in world markets continues after Trump declared a weeks-long delay of tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada. And as Trump's dismantling of the federal government continues, billionaire Elon Musk is telling Republicans he’s not to blame for the firings of thousands of workers. Meanwhile, the Pentagon’s diversity purge includes removing 26,000 images including photos of the Enola Gay aircraft that hastened the end of World War II by bombing Japan. Here's the latest: Trump’s interior and energy secretaries cheer natural gas exports Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright held a pep rally for expansion plans at a massive liquefied natural gas facility in Louisiana. Venture Global estimated that its $18 billion LNG expansion would enable exports of up to 20 million tons a year to Asia and Europe and generate 8.5 million tons of planet-warming emissions. There’s strong local opposition. Watchdogs say Venture Global violated its permits thousands of times by flaring gas and releasing chemicals. Former Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm warned that 'unfettered exports' could drive up gas prices for U.S. consumers. But Burgum told reporters Thursday: 'We can absolutely do both — we can sell energy to our friends and allies, we can lower the cost at home.' ▶ Read more about Trump’s energy policy Why should America worry about Trump? Try the price of eggs, say some Democrats As their party struggles to navigate the early days of Donald Trump’s second presidency, some Democrats are convinced their road to recovery lies in blaming Trump for the price of eggs, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture expects to rise 41% this year. Democratic officials shared new internal data showing voters are most worried about inflation and the cost of living. Democracy itself, by contrast, ranked No. 12. The party establishment’s focus on blaming Trump for inflation is a break with activists trying to mobilize against what they see as an existential threat — that Trump is a budding dictator has no regard for the Constitution. Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, who helped coordinate nationwide protests that put House Republicans on defense, said 'bored, tired talking points' won’t stop authoritarianism: 'It’s 2025 — this isn’t how politics works anymore.' ▶ Read more about the Democratic Party’s messaging Homeland Security ends collective bargaining agreement with TSA staffers In a major attack on worker rights, the Department of Homeland Security says it’s ending the collective bargaining agreement with the tens of thousands of frontline employees at the Transportation Security Administration who are responsible for keeping weapons and explosives off airplanes and protecting air travel. The department’s announcement Friday says poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job, and that the contract was hindering the ability of the organization 'to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe.' ▶ Read more on developments with the TSA and its union White House economist praises job numbers, noting that mass firings aren’t yet counted The director of the White House National Economic Council is cheering Friday’s report: U.S. employers added solid 151,000 jobs last month. Kevin Hassett said that’s 'really, really impressive' while noting that the mass federal firings Trump has championed likely won’t be reflected in jobs figures until next month or later. Hassett acknowledged that the Biden administration had 'some strong jobs numbers' too, but asserted that they were based on government employment, while Trump has promoted manufacturing and the private sector. The report came in below the 160,000 jobs economists had expected for last month. Unemployment also rose slightly, to 4.1%. Federal judge in DC won’t block DOGE from Treasury systems A separate court order out of New York still puts limits on what Elon Musk ’s team can do inside the Treasury Department’s systems, however. In Washington, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly previously restricted DOGE to two employees with read-only access. She declined Friday to grant a longer-term block, however. Her decision comes in a lawsuit filed by retirees and unions who fear DOGE’s activities could expose sensitive information. Kollar-Kotelly found that concerns about DOGE are 'understandable and no doubt widely shared,' but she hasn’t yet seen evidence of serious legal harm that would justify barring the team. She invited plaintiffs to return if more immediate risks emerge. Immigration judges quit, straining system backlogged with 3.7 million cases A labor union says 85 immigration courts employees have accepted Trump’s financial incentives to resign. They include 18 judges, one assistant chief immigration judge and 66 support staff in a court system that typically takes years to decide each asylum claim. Shortly after Trump took office in January, the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review fired 20 judges without explanation, according to the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers. 'This makes no sense,' said Matt Biggs, the union president. 'Immigration judges are hard to replace given their specialized knowledge and legal experience. It takes at least a year to recruit, hire, train and conduct a background check on a new judge.' Trump raises possibility of pressuring Russia Trump said he is 'strongly considering' sanctions and tariffs on Russia in hopes of forcing a settlement to the war in Ukraine. He said in a post on Truth Social that they could remain in place 'until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED.' The post came as Trump faces criticism for increasing pressure on Ukraine to reach a deal while downplaying or even denying Russia’s responsibility for starting the war with its invasion three years ago. 'To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late,' Trump added. Thrust into unemployment, axed federal workers face relatives who celebrate their firing Scrambling to replace their health insurance and to find new work, some laid-off federal workers are running into another unexpected unpleasantry: Relatives cheering their firing. The country’s bitterly tribal politics are spilling into text chains, social media posts and heated conversations as Americans absorb the reality of the government’s cost-cutting measures. Expecting sympathy, some axed workers are finding family and friends who instead are steadfast in their support of what they see as a bloated government’s waste. 'I’ve been treated as a public enemy by the government and now it’s bleeding into my own family,' says 24-year-old Luke Tobin, who was fired last month from his job as a technician with the U.S. Forest Service in Idaho’s Nez Perce National Forest. ▶ Read more about the DOGE cuts’ effects on families Trump says he’s sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader over its advancing nuclear program Trump’s comments about the letter to Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei were not immediately confirmed by the supreme leader. Trump made the comments in an interview aired Friday by Fox Business News. The White House confirmed Trump’s comments, saying he sent a letter to Iran’s leaders seeking to negotiate a nuclear deal. Trump made the comments in an interview that will air fully Sunday. Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported on Trump’s comments, citing the broadcast. However, there was no immediate word from the office of the 85-year-old Khamenei, who has final say over all matters of state. ▶ Read more about Trump and Iran European leaders downplay skepticism from Trump about NATO solidarity After European leaders committed Thursday to freeing up hundreds of billions of euros for security, Trump said he was 'not so sure' that the military alliance would come to the United States’ defense if the country were attacked. Here’s a look at how some EU leaders responded: 1. 'We are loyal and faithful allies,' French President Emmanuel Macron said late Thursday, expressing 'respect and friendship' toward U.S. leaders and adding that France was 'entitled to expect the same.' 2. Māris Riekstins, Latvia’s ambassador to NATO, stressed the military alliance remained the most important platform for addressing transatlantic security issues. He emphasized the commitment from his country — which shares a nearly 300-kilometer (186-mile) border with Russia — to defense spending. 3. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country would raise defense spending to reach NATO’s target faster than previously committed. But he did not specify when the eurozone’s fourth-largest economy — and NATO laggard — would hit the 2% of GDP military spending target. ▶ Read more about how EU leaders discussed NATO World Trade Organization chief says US concerns on tariffs need to be heard WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said it’s important for U.S. trade partners not to panic and engage in tit-for-tat measures but to embrace dialogue in reaction to Trump’s threats in recent days to impose tariffs. Okonjo-Iweala preferred to describe the threats and reversals as 'disruptions.' 'I think we need to listen to the United States and listen to what their concerns are, and say, ‘how can we also help them deal with their concerns,’' she said, speaking during a discussion alongside former German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the WTO headquarters in Geneva. ▶ Read more about the latest comments from the WTO Wall Street clings to early gains ahead of new US employment numbers Wall Street is poised to open with gains Friday after another U.S. pivot on tariffs kicked off the third market sell-off in four days. Futures for the S&P 500 gained 0.3% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.2%. Nasdaq futures rose 0.4%. However, the high growth, tech heavy Nasdaq tumbled 4% into correction territory this week. The S&P shed. 3.6% over the last four days and closed at its lowest point since early November on Thursday. The Dow has slid about 2.9% since Monday. The U.S. on Friday releases February employment numbers, which will show how many workers U.S. employers hired. Economists believe hiring accelerated last month. ▶ Read more about Friday’s stock market numbers Canada’s tariffs to remain despite Trump’s postponement Canada’s initial retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. will remain in place despite Trump postponing 25% tariffs on many imports from Canada for a month, two senior Canadian government officials said. Two senior Canadian governments official told the Associated Press that Canada’s first wave of response tariffs will remain. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Canada’s initial $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) worth of retaliatory tariffs have been applied on items like American orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, appliances, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles and certain pulp and paper products. ▶ Read more on Canada’s tariffs War heroes and military firsts are among 26,000 images flagged for removal in Pentagon’s DEI purge References to a World War II Medal of Honor recipient, the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan and the first women to pass Marine infantry training are among the tens of thousands of photos and online posts marked for deletion as the Defense Department works to purge diversity, equity and inclusion content, according to a database obtained by The Associated Press. The database, which was confirmed by U.S. officials and published by AP, includes more than 26,000 images that have been flagged for removal across every military branch. But the eventual total could be much higher. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given the military until Wednesday to remove content that highlights diversity efforts in its ranks. ▶ Read more about the Pentagon’s DEI purge Elon Musk tells Republican lawmakers he’s not to blame for federal firings Billionaire Elon Musk is telling Republican lawmakers that he is not to blame for the firings of thousands of federal workers, including veterans, as pushes to downsize the government. Instead, he said in private talks this week that those decisions are left to the various federal agencies. The message from one of Trump’s most influential advisers came as Republicans publicly support Musk’s work at the Department of Government Efficiency digging up waste, fraud and abuse, but are privately raising questions as personnel cuts ripple through communities across the nation. It’s a remarkable shift of emphasis away from the chainsaw-wielding tech entrepreneur whose vast power has made him an admired, revered and deeply feared figure in the second Trump administration. ▶ Read more about the latest on Elon Musk’s influence EU leaders commit to working together after Trump signals that Europe must defend itself European Union leaders on Thursday committed to bolstering the continent’s defenses and to free up hundreds of billions of euros for security after Trump’s repeated warnings that he would cut them adrift to face the threat of Russia alone. With the growing conviction that they will now have to fend for themselves, countries that have faltered on defense spending for decades held emergency talks in Brussels to explore new ways to beef up their security and ensure future protection for Ukraine. The resulting pledge underscored a sea change in geopolitics spurred on by Trump, who has undermined 80 years of cooperation based on the understanding that the U.S. would help protect European nations following World War II. ▶ Read more about the EU summit on defense Judge orders Trump administration to speed payment of USAID and State Dept. debts The order, issued Thursday, impacts nearly $2 billion in debts to partners of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department, giving the Trump administration a Monday deadline to repay the nonprofit groups and businesses in a lawsuit over the administration’s abrupt shutdown of foreign assistance funding. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali described the partial payment as a 'concrete' first step he wanted to see from the administration, which is fighting multiple lawsuits seeking to roll back the administration’s dismantling of USAID and a six-week freeze on USAID funding. The ruling came a day after a divided Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration’s bid to freeze funding that flowed through USAID. The high court instructed Ali to clarify what the government must do to comply with his earlier order requiring the quick release of funds for work that had already been done. Ali’s line of questioning in a four-hour hearing Thursday suggested skepticism of the Trump administration’s argument that presidents have wide authority to override congressional decisions on spending when it comes to foreign policy. ▶ Read more about the court hearing over State Department debts Trump delayed some tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but says ‘reciprocal’ tariffs will start April 2 President Donald Trump on Thursday postponed 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war. The White House insists its tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl, but the taxes proposed by Trump have caused a gaping wound in the decades-old North American trade partnership. Trump’s tariff plans have also caused the stock market to sink and alarmed U.S. consumers. In addition to his claims about fentanyl, Trump has insisted that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit. He emphasized while speaking in the Oval Office that he still plans to impose 'reciprocal' tariffs starting on April 2. 'Most of the tariffs go on April the second,' Trump said before signing the orders. 'Right now, we have some temporary ones and small ones, relatively small, although it’s a lot of money having to do with Mexico and Canada.' ▶ Read more about the latest on tariffs	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-the-latest-trump-changes-course-and-delays-some-tariffs-on-mexico-and-canada/	2025-03-07T08:35:53-08:00	
Russia bombards Ukraine's energy grid after Zelenskyy says his te...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in a large-scale missile and drone bombardment during the night, officials said Friday, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that talks with the U.S. on ending the three-year war will take place next week. Ukraine came under a 'massive missile and drone' attack, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. At least 10 people, including a child, were wounded, authorities said. 'Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians by striking energy and gas production facilities, without abandoning its goal of leaving us without light and heat, and causing the greatest harm to ordinary citizens,' Halushchenko wrote. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s power grid during the war. The attacks have depleted electricity generation capacity and disrupted critical heating and water supplies. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of 'weaponizing winter' in an effort to erode civilian morale. Zelenskyy on Friday won the support of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for Ukraine's proposals to take some first steps toward stopping the war, including a halt on firing missiles, drones and bombs at energy and other civilian infrastructure. Zelenskyy has also proposed ceasing combat operations in the Black Sea to allow safe shipping. Erdogan said that he also wants the shooting to stop without delay. 'We support the idea of an immediate ceasefire and the cessation of attacks in the air and at sea as a confidence-building measure between the parties,' he said in a video call with European leaders. Zelenskyy first suggested those initial steps in a post on X on Tuesday, when he said that he was ready to work under U.S. President Donald Trump’s 'strong leadership' to get a lasting peace, and has put them to Ukraine's European allies. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that the energy supply is a legitimate target in the war, because it's 'linked with Ukraine’s military industrial complex and weapons production.' Russian air defenses downed 39 Ukrainian drones overnight, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Ukraine’s largest private gas producer, DTEK, said that the overnight bombardment in the Odesa region was Russia’s sixth attack in the past two and a half weeks on its facilities. Russia fired 67 missiles from air, land and sea, and launched 194 strike and decoy drones, Ukraine’s air force said. Their primary target was Ukraine’s natural gas extraction facilities, it said. For the first time, Ukraine deployed French Mirage-2000 warplanes delivered a month ago to help repel the attack, according to the air force. Ukraine also has Western-supplied F-16 fighter jets to shoot down Russian missiles. Ukrainian defenses downed 34 missiles and 100 drones, the air force said, while up to 10 missiles didn’t reach their targets and 86 drones were lost from radars, presumably jammed by electronic warfare. Western-supplied air defense systems are crucial for Ukraine’s fight, but further U.S. help is uncertain under Trump, who says he's determined to end the war and has paused American military aid for Kyiv as a way of pressuring Zelenskyy to negotiate. In his nightly address, Zelenskyy said Thursday that he would travel to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet with the country’s crown prince, and his team would stay on to hold talks with U.S. officials. Zelenskyy welcomed a European Union plan to bolster the continent’s defenses. He expressed hope that some of the new spending could be used to strengthen Ukraine’s own defense industry. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-bombards-ukraines-energy-grid-after-zelenskyy-says-hell-hold-talks-with-us/	2025-03-07T04:41:45-08:00	
Aid efforts in Gaza slow as millions of promised USAID dollars do...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Trump administration’s cuts to USAID have frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in contractual payments to aid groups, leaving them paying out of pocket to preserve a fragile ceasefire, according to officials from the U.S. humanitarian agency. The cutbacks threaten to halt the small gains aid workers have made combatting Gaza’s humanitarian crisis during the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. They also could endanger the tenuous truce, which the Trump administration helped cement. USAID was supposed to fund much of the aid to Gaza as the ceasefire progressed, and the Trump administration approved over $383 million on Jan. 31 to that end, according to three USAID officials. But since then, there have been no confirmed payments to any partners in the Middle East, they said. The officials, who have survived multiple rounds of furloughs, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Two senior officials at aid organizations confirmed they have not received any of the promised funds, after spending millions of dollars on supplies and services. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the issue and of their work in Gaza, said they could not afford to continue aid operations indefinitely. Some organizations have already reported laying off workers and scaling down operations, according to internal USAID information shared with The Associated Press. That could imperil the ceasefire, under which Hamas is supposed to release hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners and ramping up the entry of humanitarian assistance. 'The U.S. established very specific, concrete commitments for aid delivery under the ceasefire, and there is no way ... to fulfill those as long as the funding freeze is in place,' said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International and a former USAID official. USAID has been one of the biggest targets of a broad campaign by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to slash the size of the federal government. USAID payments frozen, some NGOs scale down Gaza response Before Trump took office, USAID had roughly $446 million to disburse to partner organizations in Gaza in 2025, the USAID officials said. But after Trump froze global foreign assistance, USAID’s Gaza team had to submit a waiver to ensure the funds for Gaza aid could continue to flow. They received approval Jan. 31 to secure over $383 million in funding, less than two weeks after the U.S.-brokered ceasefire was reached. Some $40 million was subsequently cut under a measure that no money be provided for aid in the form of direct cash assistance. USAID then signed contracts with eight partner organizations, including prominent NGOs and U.N. agencies, awarding them money to flood supplies and services into Gaza. Then, the officials said, they began hearing that organizations were not receiving the promised payments — even as they had already spent millions, expecting USAID reimbursement. Some of those organizations are now spending less and scaling back programs. The International Medical Corps, a global nonprofit that partners with the World Health Organization and provides medical and development assistance, was awarded $12 million to continue operations at two hospitals in Gaza. These include the largest field hospital in Gaza, whose construction was funded by USAID at the request of the Israeli government, according to internal USAID information. The freeze has forced the organization to lay off some 700 staff members and offer only basic services at the hospitals, with a skeletal crew, said one USAID official. A former IMC staffer, who quit citing lack of stability, said the program providing life-saving treatment for malnutrition was significantly scaled down for lack of funds. The former staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the organization’s details, said the current nutrition services were at a minimum level. Another former IMC staffer, who also left recently and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss information not meant to be shared with media, said the USAID cuts have reduced the amount of medical supplies brought into Gaza and led the majority of IMC’s partners to reduce their programming. They said that some organizations have already purchased stocks of medical supplies, food to treat acute malnutrition, lab and medical equipment ready to enter Gaza, but because of the shortfall they have not been able to afford movement of those goods. Meanwhile, termination letters severing the contracts between USAID and Gaza partners were also sent out to organizations that were major providers of shelter, child protection and logistical support in the Gaza aid operation, a USAID official said. Some of the termination letters seen by the AP were signed by new USAID deputy chief Peter Marocco — a returning political appointee from Trump’s first term. They instruct organizations to 'immediately cease' all activities and 'avoid additional spending chargeable to the award,' citing a directive from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. USAID Gaza response in crisis as truce is tenuous In addition to the spending freeze, officials say USAID has been wracked by internal chaos and the introduction of new regulations since the new administration took office. During the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire, Israel had to allow at least 600 trucks of aid into Gaza a day, as well as 60,000 temporary homes and 200,000 tents. Two USAID officials said the agency was originally supposed to buy 400 temporary homes that would make it into Gaza by the end of Phase 1, and over 5,200 more during the next phase. That figure has since been slashed to just over 1,000. USAID was never able to purchase the mobile homes because of newly imposed policies requiring extra approvals for procurements. On Feb. 2, some 40% of the Gaza team was locked out of their email accounts and software necessary to track awards, move payments and communicate with the organizations. An email sent immediately following the lockout came from Gavin Kliger, a DOGE staffer. Access to the servers has now been restored, the officials said, but the team is smaller after waves of layoffs. From an original team of about 30 people, only six or seven remain. Very few mobile homes entered Gaza during Phase 1 of the ceasefire, which ended last week, prompting Hamas to accuse Israel of violating the truce. Since the end of Phase 1, Israel has cut off all aid shipments into Gaza in a bid to pressure Hamas to accept an extension of the ceasefire. That has sent aid groups scrambling to distribute reserves of food and shelter to the most needy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is considering cutting off electricity to raise the pressure on Hamas. With USAID in flux, the U.S. risks losing its influence, said Dave Harden, the former USAID assistant administrator of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Aid and a longtime director of the agency’s work in the Palestinian territories. 'U.S. aid assistance to Palestinians ... never, ever equated to U.S. assistance to Israel, never quite balanced, but always gave us a seat at the table, always helped us to have real discussions with both the Palestinians and the Israelis about what the future might hold,' Harden said. Now, he said, 'We’re just simply not at the table in a meaningful way, and so I think the ceasefire is fragile.' ___ AP correspondents Josef Federman in Jerusalem, Sarah El Deeb in Cairo and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed reporting.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-aid-operations-in-gaza-imperiled-as-millions-of-promised-usaid-dollars-do-not-arrive/	2025-03-07T04:38:45-08:00	
Paying with people's lives': Ukrainian refugees in Chicago face ...	CHICAGO — Former Homeland Security Director Alejandro Majorkas designated Ukraine for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) back in 2022 and more than a quarter of a million Ukrainian refugees came to the United States. Now, they are worried about their future. For 20 days, Ukrainian refugee Angela Savenko and her young boys lived in an underground bunker in Kyiv.

It's because of not knowing what could happen, what could be the announcement,' Self Reliance Association Program Director Olena Levko-Sandeha said. According to Routers, on Thursday, a senior Trump official reported that the president was potentially planning to revoke temporary legal status for 240,000 Ukrainian refugees, meaning they could face deportation as soon as April. The rollback of protections is part of a broader effort to strip nearly two million migrants of their legal status under former President Biden’s humanitarian parole programs. Ukrainian refugees had hoped this month to file for an extension that would allow them to stay in the US until at least October of 2026.

Ukraine will struggle to strike targets inside Russia without US ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. decision to stop sharing military intelligence with Ukraine hobbles its ability to strike and defend against the Russian army, and increases the pressure on it to accept a peace deal being pushed by the Trump administration. Earlier in the week, the U.S. suspended weapons shipments – a severe blow, but one that experts said Ukraine could withstand for at least a few months. The suspension of intelligence has a more immediate impact by disrupting Ukraine’s ability to track and target Russian troops, tanks and ships; its other allies lack the same resources to fill the gap. Here are things to know about the U.S. decision and its likely effects: Why did the U.S. stop sharing intelligence with Ukraine? The decision to withhold intelligence – and military aid – came on the heels of a tempestuous White House visit last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance want Zelenskyy to quickly accept a truce with Russia – which now controls one-fifth of his country – and to give up significant mineral rights to the U.S. to help fund any future support for Ukraine. The Trump administration says Ukraine hasn’t demonstrated sufficient willingness to seek peace with Russia, with whom the U.S. has held separate talks to try to bring an end to the war. U.S. officials suggested Wednesday that the withdrawal of intelligence-sharing might only be a temporary measure to expedite truce negotiations, citing more positive talks since the White House blowup. 'We have taken a step back and are pausing and reviewing all aspects of this relationship,' U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz said Wednesday. CIA Director John Ratcliffe called the suspension a 'pause.' Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he is ready to discuss peace, but that any deal must offer his country sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. He has also publicly stated his regrets about the contentious, and televised, White House meeting. Trump administration officials have said the deal for mineral rights would more closely bind the U.S. and Ukraine, giving Russian President Vladimir Putin pause before considering future malign action against Ukraine. How will the lack of U.S. intelligence affect Ukraine? The White House hasn’t specified what aspects of intelligence-sharing have been suspended. But without help from the U.S. – which includes vital data captured by Elon Musk's Starlink satellites – Ukraine’s ability to strike weapons and other targets inside Russia will be severely degraded. Its attacks inside Russian territory – which rely on U.S.-provided longer-range weapons -- have been key in deterring Russia's capabilities and advances. Ukraine relies on U.S. intelligence when operating U.S.-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, and the U.S. Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS. Ukraine also relies on U.S. intelligence as an early warning system to help it defend against Russian long-range missiles and drone strikes. Such intelligence in the war’s early days allowed Ukraine to thwart Putin’s hopes for a quick victory. Before the recent restrictions imposed by the U.S., a rising tempo of Ukrainian strikes inside Russia – such as those targeting stores of ammunition -- relieved pressure on Ukrainian troops on the front lines. It is one of the reasons Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine have slowed in recent weeks, analysts say. Will the U.S. ever share intelligence again with Ukraine? Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said in a Fox News television interview that the suspension of intelligence-sharing could be reversed once Zelenskyy demonstrates to President Trump that he is sufficiently willing to discuss peace with Russia on Trump’s terms. Zelenskyy has said he would like to 'make things right' with Trump, but that does not yet appear to have assuaged the U.S. -- Ukraine’s biggest military backer since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Officials from Ukraine and the U.S. will hold talks next week in Saudi Arabia next week, Zelenskyy said late Thursday. In the meantime, Zelenskyy has been leaning into support from Europe, most of whose leaders are dismayed by the Trump administration’s decision to deprive a key American ally of assistance needed to fight Russia. On Thursday, European Union leaders launched a day of emergency talks to beef up their own security and ensure that Ukraine will still be protected. It’s unclear whether the American suspension affects the intelligence-sharing ties between Ukraine and other Western powers, including four of the Five Eyes, an intelligence sharing coalition of the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia and New Zealand. French defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said in a radio interview Thursday that his country would continue providing military intelligence to Ukraine. And French President Emmanuel Macron said he would talk with EU leaders about the possibility of using France’s nuclear deterrent to protect the continent from Russian threats.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-without-us-intelligence-ukraine-will-struggle-to-strike-targets-inside-russia/	2025-03-06T12:59:12-08:00	
Trump envoy says Ukrainians 'brought it on themselves' after US p...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukraine was given 'fair warning' by the White House before President Donald Trump this week ordered a pause on U.S. military assistance and intelligence sharing with Kyiv, a senior administration official said Thursday. The Republican administration announced the pauses this week after Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy'sOval Office meeting devolved into a shouting match, with the U.S. president and Vice President JD Vance excoriating the Ukrainian leader for being insufficiently grateful for the tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance sent to Ukraine since Russia invaded three years ago. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said the pause is already having an impact on Kyiv, adding that the Ukrainians 'brought it on themselves.' 'The best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,' Kellogg said at an event Thursday at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'You got their attention.' Kellogg said it was made clear to the Ukrainians before last week’s Oval Office meeting that the talks would focus on signing a critical minerals deal. The agreement, which the two sides still have not signed, would give the U.S. access to Ukraine's rare earth deposits and could be of value to U.S. aerospace, electric vehicle and medical manufacturing. Trump administration officials have said the economic pact would bind the U.S. and Ukraine closer together and would give Russian President Vladimir Putin pause before considering malign action against Ukraine in the future. Zelenskyy had been pressing the White House for explicit security guarantees, to no avail. Kellogg said last week's talks went sideways because Zelenskyy pressed Trump — who is trying to play the role of intermediary to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia — to side with Kyiv. Zelenskyy later called the heated words 'regrettable' and said he’s ready to sign an agreement. He told European leaders gathered in Brussels on Thursday he was grateful for their support and said the teams from the U.S. and Ukraine had resumed their work and hoped to have 'a meaningful meeting' next week. 'Ukraine has been seeking peace since the very first second of the war, and we have always said that the only reason why the war continues is because of Russia,' Zelenskyy said in his speech, which was published on the Ukrainian president’s website. But Kellogg said he couldn’t guarantee a resumption of weapons deliveries even if Zelenskyy accepts the deal. 'That’s up to the president,' Kellogg said. He added, 'You don’t negotiate peace discussions in public. You don’t try to challenge the president of the United States in the Oval Office.' Trump said in a speech before Congress on Tuesday that Zelenskyy had written to him to say he appreciates U.S. support for his country in its war with Russia. Trump said Zelenskyy told him that Ukraine is ready to negotiate a peace deal with Russia as soon as possible and would accept the minerals agreement with the U.S. to facilitate that. Although Trump said he 'appreciated' getting the letter, he did not say if it would affect his policy toward Ukraine. The suspension of U.S. intelligence sharing with Ukraine will damage Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against ongoing Russian attacks against military and civilian targets, according to an assessment by the Institute for the Study of War. The research group said suspension of all U.S. intelligence sharing with Ukraine would also allow Russian forces to intensify their drone and missile strikes against the Ukrainian rear, affecting millions of Ukrainian civilians and the growth of Ukraine’s defense industrial base. — AP writer Susie Blann in Kyiv contributed reporting.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-trump-envoy-says-ukrainians-brought-it-on-themselves-after-us-pauses-aid-and-intelligence-sharing/	2025-03-06T10:27:49-08:00	
Hamas brushes off Trump's threat and says it will only free hosta...	CAIRO (AP) — Hamas on Thursday brushed off President Donald Trump's latest threat and reiterated that it will only free the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The militant group accused Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to back out of the ceasefire agreement they reached in January. The agreement calls for negotiations over a second phase in which the hostages would be released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a permanent ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas spokesman Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua said the 'best path to free the remaining Israeli hostages' is through negotiations on that phase, which were supposed to begin in early February. Only limited preparatory talks have been held so far. On Wednesday, Trump issued what he said was a 'last warning' to Hamas after meeting with eight former hostages. The White House meanwhile confirmed it had held unprecedented direct talks with the militant group, which Israel and Western countries view as a terrorist organization. 'Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 'Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!' Both Israel and Hamas have a longstanding practice of holding onto the remains of their adversaries in order to trade them in hostage-prisoner deals. U.S. plan for the second phase Hamas is believed to still have 24 living hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, including Israeli-American Edan Alexander. It is also holding the bodies of 34 others who were either killed in the initial attack or in captivity, as well as the remains of a soldier killed in the 2014 war. Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire, which ended on Saturday. Israel supports what it says is a new U.S. plan for the second phase in which Hamas would release half the remaining hostages immediately and the rest when a permanent ceasefire is negotiated. Hamas has rejected the proposal and says it is sticking with the agreement signed in January. Israel has cut off the delivery of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians in an attempt to pressure Hamas into accepting the new arrangement. It has threatened 'additional consequences' if Hamas does not resume the release of hostages. It is unclear if the U.S.-Hamas talks made any progress. The Trump administration has pledged full support for Israel's main war goals of returning all the hostages and eradicating Hamas, which may be incompatible. Direct talks between the U.S. and Hamas could make it difficult for Israel to resume the war, according to Mkhaimar Abusada, a political science professor at Gaza’s Al-Azhar University who is currently in Egypt. 'The current U.S. administration is trying to avoid a return to war in Gaza in all possible ways,' he said. Gaza reconstruction plan Egypt said Thursday it will host an international conference to raise money for a Gaza reconstruction plan proposed this week at the Arab Summit in Cairo. A date was not announced. The conference, in cooperation with the United Nations, would secure financial pledges for the $53 billion five-year plan, Egyptian foreign ministry spokesperson Tamim Khallaf said. Egyptian and Arab officials also will tour key capitals, including Washington, to promote further details, Khallaf said, adding that Egypt believes it’s a 'workable and realistic plan' in the interest of all partners. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and took a total of 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more. Israel's military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas in Gaza and displaced most of its population. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in tents, schools-turned-shelters or war-damaged buildings, and the population relies on international aid. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hamas-brushes-off-trumps-threat-and-says-it-will-only-free-hostages-in-return-for-a-lasting-truce/	2025-03-06T07:26:48-08:00	
EU leaders meet for emergency summit on defense and Ukraine aid a...	BRUSSELS (AP) — Facing the prospect that the United States might cut them adrift under President Donald Trump, European Union leaders launched a day of emergency talks Thursday in a bid to beef up their own security and ensure that Ukraine will still be properly protected. Friedrich Merz, the likely next chancellor of Germany, and summit chairman Antonio Costa discussed over breakfast in Brussels ways to fortify Europe's defenses on a short deadline. Merz pushed plans this week to loosen the nation’s rules on running up debt to allow for higher defense spending. Meanwhile, the 27-nation bloc was waking up to news that French President Emmanuel Macron would confer with EU leaders about the possibility of using France’s nuclear deterrent to protect the continent from Russian threats. It all underscored the sea change that has taken place in the two months since Trump took office and immediately started upending the cornerstones of cooperation between the United States and Europe that had been the bedrock of Western security since World War II. 'Spend, spend, spend on defense and deterrence. That’s. the most important message,' said Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. The call is a sharp departure from decades of decline in military spending in Europe, where defense often came last in many budgetary considerations. The bloc will 'take decisive steps forward,' Macron told the French nation Wednesday evening. 'Member states will be able to increase their military spending' and 'massive joint funding will be provided to buy and produce some of the most innovative munitions, tanks, weapons and equipment in Europe,' he said. Adding to the ebullient message, he said that 'Europe’s future does not have to be decided in Washington or Moscow.' Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was attending the summit, received warm bonhomie from most leaders — a stark contrast with the verbal lashing the Ukraine president got from Trump less than a week ago. 'I want to thank all our European leaders,' Zelenskyy said. 'Strong support from the very beginning of the war. During all this period, and last week, you stayed with us.' Helping EU members increase spending European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has proposed a plan to loosen budget rules so countries that are willing can spend much more on defense. Her proposal is underpinned by 150 billion euros ($162 billion) worth of loans to buy priority military equipment. Most of the increased defense spending would have to come from national budgets at a time when many countries are already overburdened with debt. Part of von der Leyen’s plan includes measures to ensure struggling member states won’t be punished for going too deep in the red if the spending is earmarked for defense. 'Europe faces a clear and present danger, and therefore Europe has to be able to protect itself, to defend itself,' she said. France is struggling to reduce an excessive annual budget deficit of 5% of GDP, after running up its total debt burden to 112% of GDP with spending on relief for businesses and consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Five other countries using the euro currency have debt levels over 100% of GDP: Belgium, Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal. Europe’s largest economy, Germany, has more room to borrow, with a debt level of 62% of GDP. Pressing security needs Part of any security plan is also to protect the increasingly beleaguered position of Ukraine. A Russian missile killed four people staying at a hotel in Zelenskyy’s hometown overnight. He said that a humanitarian organization’s volunteers had moved into the hotel in Kryvyi Rih, in central Ukraine, just before the strike. The volunteers included Ukrainian, American and British nationals, but it wasn't clear whether those people were among the 31 injured. Early this week, Trump ordered a pause to U.S. military supplies to Ukraine as he sought to press Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia, bringing fresh urgency to Thursday's summit. Thursday's meeting is unlikely to address Ukraine’s most pressing needs. It is not aimed at urgently drumming up more arms and ammunition to fill any supply vacuum created by the U.S. freeze. Nor will all nations agree to unblock the estimated 183 billion euros ($196 billion) in frozen Russian assets held in a Belgian clearing house, a pot of ready cash that could be seized. Still, the Europeans underlined the importance of the moment. 'This is a watershed moment for Europe and Ukraine as part of our European family. It’s also a watershed moment for Ukraine,' von der Leyen said, as she stood alongside Zekenskyy before striding together into the summit. But perhaps the biggest challenge for the EU will be taking a united stance at a moment when it’s fractured, since much of the bloc's actions requires unanimous support. Hungary is threatening to veto part of the summit statement on Ukraine, as is Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico. 'We have to take decisions no matter the one or two which are opposing every time,' said Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda. 'Otherwise history will penalize us and we will pay a very high cost.' Thursday's summit is unlikely to produce immediate decisions on spending for Ukraine or its own defenses. Another EU summit where the real contours of decisions would be much clearer is set for March 20-21. ___ AP journalists Sylvie Corbet in Brussels, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Barry Hatton in Lisbon and Illia Novikov in Kyiv contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-eu-leaders-open-emergency-talks-on-defense-and-ukraine-aid-as-us-support-wanes/	2025-03-06T04:28:39-08:00	
Trump issues 'last warning' to Hamas to release all remaining hos...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued what he called a 'last warning' to Hamas to release all remaining hostages held in Gaza, directing a sharply worded message after the White House confirmed that he had recently dispatched an envoy for unprecedented direct talks with the militant group. In a statement on his Truth Social platform soon after meeting at the White House with eight former hostages, Trump added that he was 'sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job.' 'Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,' Trump said. 'Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!' The pointed language from Trump came after the White House said Wednesday that U.S. officials have engaged in 'ongoing talks and discussions' with Hamas officials, stepping away from a long-held U.S. policy of not directly engaging with the militant group. Confirmation of the talks in the Qatari capital of Doha came as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains in the balance. It’s the first known direct engagement between the United States and Hamas since the State Department designated the group a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to provide detail on the substance of talks, but said President Donald Trump has authorized his envoys to 'talk to anyone.' Egyptian and Qatari intermediaries have served as mediators with Hamas for the U.S. and Israel since the group launched its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war. 'Look, dialogue and talking to people around the world to do what’s in the best interest of the American people is something that the president ... believes is a good-faith effort to do what’s right for the American people,' she said. Leavitt added that Israel has been consulted about the direct engagement with Hamas officials, and noted that there are 'American lives at stake.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office offered a terse acknowledgement of the U.S.-Hamas talks. 'Israel has expressed to the United States its position regarding direct talks with Hamas,' the prime minister’s office said. Israeli officials say about 24 living hostages — including Edan Alexander, an American citizen — as well as the bodies of at least 35 others are believed to still be held in Gaza. Adam Boehler, Trump’s nominee to be special envoy for hostage affairs, led the direct talks with Hamas. Boehler, founder and CEO of Rubicon Founders, a healthcare investment firm, was a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords team during Trump’s first term that strove to win broader recognition of Israel in the Arab world. The talks, which took place last month, focused mainly on the release of American hostages, and a potential end of the war without Hamas in power in Gaza, according to a Hamas official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official added that no progress was made but 'the step itself is promising' and more talks are expected. Egyptian and Qatari mediators helped arrange the talks. The direct engagement comes as continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains uncertain. Trump has signaled that he has no intentions of pushing Netanyahu away from a return to combat if Hamas doesn’t agree to terms of a new ceasefire proposal, which the Israelis have billed as being drafted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners, a key component of the first phase. Trump on Wednesday welcomed eight former hostages — Iair Horn, Omer Shem Tov, Eli Sharabi, Keith Siegel, Aviva Siegel, Naama Levy, Doron Steinbrecher and Noa Argamani — to the White House. 'The President listened intently to their heartbreaking stories,' Leavitt said. 'The hostages thanked President Trump for his steadfast efforts to bring all of the hostages home.' Keith Siegel, an Israeli-American released last month as part of the ceasefire, said they came to the White House to express their appreciation to Trump and Witkoff, the Mideast envoy. 'We urged them to continue their enormous efforts. They have done so much. We trust them and we know they will get the job done to get all the rest of the 59 remaining hostages held in Gaza back to their families,' he said in a statement. The talks between U.S. and Hamas officials were first reported earlier Wednesday by the news site Axios. Leavitt, the White House press secretary, is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-white-house-confirms-ongoing-talks-and-discussions-with-hamas-officials-amid-ceasefire-uncertainty/	2025-03-05T22:58:48-08:00	
Kremlin says a 2022 Ukrainian law bans Zelenskyy from talks with ...	A Ukrainian decree from 2022 ruling out negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin raises the question of who could sit at the table in potential peace talks aimed at ending their three-year war, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'is still legally prohibited from negotiating with the Russian side,' Peskov noted during his daily conference call with reporters. He said it was 'positive' that Zelenskyy expressed readiness Tuesday to negotiate peace with Russia as soon as possible. 'But the details have not changed yet,' Peskov added, apparently referring to the Ukrainian decree. Neither Ukrainian nor Western officials have recently mentioned the September 2022 presidential decree, signed seven months after Russia’s cross-border invasion, in the context of U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to stop the fighting. The Trump administration on Monday suspended its crucial military aid to Ukraine as the United States sought to pressure Zelenskyy into negotiating an end to the war. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the support would resume after Zelenskyy’s seeming effort to placate Trump. Ukrainian forces are toiling to slow advances by the bigger Russian army along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region. The Russian onslaught, which has been costly for its troops, hasn’t yet brought a strategically significant breakthrough for the Kremlin. The war of attrition has killed tens of thousands of soldiers and more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians. Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer could travel together to Washington, the French government spokesperson said Wednesday. 'It is envisaged that President Macron could eventually travel again to Washington with President Zelenskyy and his British counterpart,' spokesperson Sophie Primas told reporters. She did not elaborate. Macron was due to give a televised address to the nation later Wednesday about what he called the 'great uncertainty' in global affairs. The three leaders traveled separately to Washington last week for meetings with Trump. Starmer didn't comment on the possibility of a joint trip when he appeared in the British Parliament on Wednesday. His spokesman, Dave Pares, would not confirm such a trip. In the early months of the war, Zelenskyy repeatedly called for a personal meeting with Putin but was rebuffed. After the Kremlin's decision in September 2022 to illegally annex four regions of Ukraine — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — Zelenskyy enacted a decree declaring that holding negotiations with Putin had become impossible. The decree enacted a decision by Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council to bolster Ukrainian defenses and seek more weapons from the country’s Western allies. The Kremlin said at the time it would wait for Ukraine to sit down for talks on ending the conflict, noting that such a step may not happen until a new Ukrainian president takes office. Meanwhile, a Russian court on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a British national captured last year fighting for Ukraine in the Kursk border region of Russia, according to court officials. James Scott Rhys Anderson was found guilty of terrorism and mercenary activities during an armed conflict and sentenced to 19 years in prison. The case was heard behind closed doors. According to media reports at the time of his capture in November 2024, 22-year-old Anderson said he had served as a signalman in the British army for four years and then joined the International Legion of Ukraine, formed shortly after Russia's invasion. Ukrainian forces captured parts of Kursk in a shock offensive in August 2024. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-kremlin-says-a-2022-ukrainian-law-bans-zelenskyy-from-talks-with-putin/	2025-03-05T05:28:22-08:00	
Israel’s cutoff of supplies to Gaza sends prices soaring as aid s...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s cutoff of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza’s 2 million people has sent prices soaring and humanitarian groups into overdrive trying to distribute dwindling stocks to the most vulnerable. The aid freeze has imperiled the progress aid workers say they have made to stave off famine over the past six weeks during Phase 1 of the ceasefire deal Israel and Hamas agreed to in January. After more than 16 months of war, Gaza’s population is entirely dependent on trucked-in food and other aid. Most are displaced from their homes, and many need shelter. Fuel is needed to keep hospitals, water pumps, bakeries and telecommunications — as well as trucks delivering the aid — operating. Israel says the siege aims at pressuring Hamas to accept its ceasefire proposal. Israel has delayed moving to the second phase of the deal it reached with Hamas, during which the flow of aid was supposed to continue. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that he is prepared to increase the pressure and would not rule out cutting off all electricity to Gaza if Hamas doesn’t budge. Rights groups have called the cutoff a 'starvation policy.' Four days in, how is the cutoff affecting Gaza? Food, fuel and shelter supplies are threatened The World Food Program, the U.N.'s main food agency, says it has no major stockpile of food in Gaza because it focused on distributing all incoming food to hungry people during Phase 1 of the deal. In a statement to AP, it said existing stocks are enough to keep bakeries and kitchens running for under two weeks. WFP said it may be forced to reduce ration sizes to serve as many people as possible. It said its fuel reserves, necessary to run bakeries and transport food, will last for a few weeks if not replenished soon. There’s also no major stockpile of tents in Gaza, said Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council. The shelter materials that came in during the ceasefire’s first phase were 'nowhere near enough to address all of the needs,' she said. 'If it was enough, we wouldn’t have had infants dying from exposure because of lack of shelter materials and warm clothes and proper medical equipment to treat them,' she said. At least seven infants in Gaza died from hypothermia during Phase 1. Urgently checking reserves 'We’re trying to figure out, what do we have? What would be the best use of our supply?' said Jonathan Crickx, chief of communication for UNICEF. 'We never sat on supplies, so it’s not like there’s a huge amount left to distribute.' He predicted a 'catastrophic result' if the aid freeze continues. During the ceasefire's first phase, humanitarian agencies rushed in supplies, with about 600 trucks entering per day on average. Aid workers set up more food kitchens, health centers and water distribution points. With more fuel coming in, they could double the amount of water drawn from wells, according to the U.N. humanitarian agency. Around 100,000 tents also arrived as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians tried to return to their homes, only to find them destroyed or too damaged to live in. But the progress relied on the flow of aid continuing. Oxfam has 26 trucks with thousands of food packages and hygiene kits and 12 trucks of water tanks waiting outside Gaza, said Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam’s policy lead in the West Bank. 'This is not just about hundreds of trucks of food, it’s about the total collapse of systems that sustain life,' she said. The International Organization for Migration has 22,500 tents in its warehouses in Jordan after trucks brought back their undelivered cargo once entry was barred, said Karl Baker, the agency's regional crisis coordinator. The International Rescue Committee has 6.7 tons of medicines and medical supplies waiting to enter Gaza and its delivery is 'highly uncertain,' said Bob Kitchen, vice president of its emergencies and humanitarian action department. Medical Aid for Palestinians said it has trucks stuck at Gaza's border carrying medicine, mattresses and assistive devices for people with disabilities. The organization has some medicine and materials in reserve, said spokesperson Tess Pope, but 'we don’t have stock that we can use during a long closure of Gaza.' Prices up sharply Prices of vegetables and flour are now climbing in Gaza after easing during the ceasefire. Sayed Mohamed al-Dairi walked through a bustling market in Gaza City just after the aid cutoff was announced. Already, sellers were increasing the prices of dwindling wares. 'The traders are massacring us, the traders are not merciful to us,' he said. 'In the morning, the price of sugar was 5 shekels. Ask him now, the price has become 10 shekels.' In the central Gaza city of Deir Al-Balah, one cigarette priced at 5 shekels ($1.37) before the cutoff now stands at 20 shekels ($5.49). One kilo of chicken (2.2 pounds) that was 21 shekels ($5.76) is now 50 shekels ($13.72). Cooking gas has soared from 90 shekels ($24.70) for 12 kilos (26.4 pounds) to 1,480 shekels ($406.24). Following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, Israel cut off all aid to Gaza for two weeks — a measure central to South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice. That took place as Israel launched the most intense phase of its aerial bombardment of Gaza, one of the most aggressive campaigns in modern history. Palestinians fear a repeat of that period. 'We are afraid that Netanyahu or Trump will launch a war more severe than the previous war,' said Abeer Obeid, a Palestinian woman from northern Gaza. 'For the extension of the truce, they must find any other solution.' ___ This version corrects to say Wednesday is the fourth day of the freeze, not the second.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-cut-off-food-and-supplies-to-gaza-aid-groups-are-scrambling-whats-happening-on-the-ground/	2025-03-05T05:24:55-08:00	
What Trump’s aid freeze means for Ukraine war	(The Hill) -- President Donald Trump’s freeze on U.S. aid going to Ukraine threatens to create severe problems for Kyiv in its war against Russia, leaving the country more vulnerable to aerial attacks on population centers and key infrastructure. Experts predict the pause could be felt within a matter of weeks, depending on its scope. 'In terms of the immediate battlefield effect, this is bad,' said George Barros, an expert on the Ukraine-Russia conflict for the Institute for the Study of War. Barros said the freeze will have 'a significant effect' that will become more apparent should the suspension stretch into summer when ammunition supplies are likely to dwindle. But the biggest gap will be felt when the Ukrainians run low on U.S.-made Patriot interceptors and other air defenses, which could happen within weeks. 'There are certain niche systems and capabilities that the United States provides Ukraine that the Ukrainians do not have an analogue for, and neither do the Europeans, particularly air defense interceptors,' he said. Retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, a senior fellow with the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said there is simply no European substitute for U.S. air defense munitions such as Patriot interceptors and Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles — used to defend from incoming Kremlin drone and missile attacks on cities. Nor is there an easy replacement for long-range strike weapons such as HIMARS and ATACMS, which Ukrainian troops have used to strike targets just over the border in Russia. 'Their critical infrastructure is getting hammered by cruise and ballistic missiles,' Montgomery said. 'Without these weapons systems, more Russian stuff hits, more infrastructure is damaged. Without the long-range strike, Russia can bring contact to the enemy quicker with less risk. This [freeze] makes things worse.' Jennifer Kavanagh, senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, said once air defenses are gutted, 'it will force Ukraine to make choices. Do they defend the power station? Or do they defend their F-16 center on the ground? ... That's where the pinch will be felt first.' Trump on Monday directed his administration to 'pause' all military aid to Ukraine following a contentious Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week. Trump has been ramping up pressure on Kyiv to sign a critical minerals deal to repay U.S. assistance and agree to major concessions toward a peace deal with Russia. 'The President has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well,' a White House official said in a statement. 'We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.' US, Ukraine sound optimistic notes on mineral deal Senate Republicans, who are generally hawkish on Ukraine, on Tuesday defended Trump's move as a negotiating tactic, predicting it wouldn't last long. But the news has still been met with despair in Ukraine, with parliament member Oleksiy Goncharenko telling Sky News that 'thousands of people will die' due to Trump’s 'catastrophic' choice. 'The mood in Ukraine is that of betrayal. The mood is that of hopelessness,' Barros said. 'Telling them, ‘Congratulations, you're not getting any more weapons,’ it's a very poor incentive to actually try to increase and boost recruitment numbers.' Zelensky has quickly sought to remedy the situation, on Tuesday saying Ukraine is 'ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible' to sign the minerals deal and bring a peace deal closer. 'None of us wants an endless war,' Zelensky said in a statement that did not comment directly on the aid pause. 'Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.' It's unclear what lethal aid earmarked for Ukraine will be affected by the freeze, given that there has been no official statement from the administration on how far the pause will extend and what it will touch. Trump took office with nearly $4 billion in drawdown authority for Ukraine available from previously approved congressional funding, which could now go unused. And he could move to scrap contracts Ukraine has signed with U.S. defense firms – meant to guarantee a steady flow of newly produced arms into the country for at least the next several years. Trump could also withhold training for Ukrainians on weapons maintenance, providing spare parts, or allowing European allies to transfer crucial material such as F-16 fighter jet parts. Ukraine also partners with the U.S. for intelligence and relies on Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite network for communication and internet connectivity. The freeze could not come at a better time for Russia, which over the past six months has seen its military tempo decreasing as it has rapidly burned through troops and ammunition, allowing the Ukrainians to increasingly engage in counterattacks in southeastern parts of the country. With these trends, the Kremlin would likely have to face a series of very difficult decisions in how it would resource the war in the coming year, experts say, making it an ideal time to press Russia for hard concessions. With the American aid paused, however, experts said they wouldn't be surprised if the Russians started intensifying their air campaign to try to eliminate what remaining air defense interceptors the Ukrainians have. 'Depending on the intensity of the air campaign, they could run out of interceptors within a matter of days, if not weeks,' Barros said of Ukraine. Once that happens, Moscow 'can really unleash fury.' Polish PM tells European leaders to ‘keep calm and carry on’ amid US-Ukraine tensions That has put the spotlight on Europe, which has rallied in support of Ukraine in recent days, with leaders meeting over the weekend to chart a path forward without the U.S. But Europe’s ability to fill the gap is limited by various factors, including domestic politics. Branislav Slantchev, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego who studies the war, said despite the supportive rhetoric coming from Europe, leaders will struggle to sell the public on major boosts to defense spending if it requires big sacrifices such as cuts to the social safety net. 'I'm not sure that the Europeans can fill the gap quickly enough, even if they had the political will to do so. Now, they're saying all the right things, but their political reality in Europe is quite difficult,' he said. Ukraine may be able to sustain its current level of resistance for three to six months, Slantchev said, but will eventually have to make painful battlefield decisions if Trump sticks with the freeze. 'Essentially, they will begin to lose territory, because they will have to essentially withdraw to more defensible positions. They will have to rearrange how they do this. It's going to be a lot harder for them,' he said. Trump has proven willing to quickly shift positions in foreign relations as negotiations play out, and Slantchev said the aid suspension may be an attempt to see how far he can push Ukraine toward Russia’s negotiating positions. 'This is basically typical Trumpian moves to essentially force Ukraine to show ... the absolute maximum they can concede, and then take this to the Russians and see if it will work,' he said. 'My belief is that it will not work, and then all bets are off.'

Middle East latest: Israel demolished 181 Palestinian homes in ea...	An Israeli rights group says Israel demolished a record number of Palestinian homes in annexed east Jerusalem last year. Ir Amim, which closely tracks settlement activity and demolitions in the city, said Wednesday that 181 homes were destroyed last year, in addition to dozens of other structures. It said that more recently, Israel appears to have dropped a longstanding policy against demolishing homes during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began last weekend. It said a residential building and three apartments have been destroyed over the past week. Rights groups say discriminatory policies make it nearly impossible for Palestinians to expand or redevelop their neighborhoods in east Jerusalem, forcing many to build without permits. Israel also demolishes the family homes of Palestinians who carry out attacks. Here's the latest: Israel demolished 181 Palestinian homes in annexed east Jerusalem Ir Amim, an Israeli rights group, says Israel demolished a record number of Palestinian homes — 181 — in annexed east Jerusalem last year. It said that more recently, Israel appears to have dropped a longstanding policy against demolishing homes during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began last weekend. It said a residential building and three apartments have been destroyed over the past week. The Jerusalem municipality did not respond to a request for comment. Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three for their future state. Rights groups say discriminatory policies make it nearly impossible for Palestinians to expand or redevelop their neighborhoods in east Jerusalem, forcing many to build without permits. Israel also demolishes the family homes of Palestinians who carry out attacks. Arab leaders approve a counterproposal to Trump’s postwar Gaza plan Arab leaders meeting in Cairo on Tuesday endorsed a counterproposal to U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for the Gaza Strip to be depopulated of Palestinians and transformed into a beach destination, even as the continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire is uncertain. Israel is again blocking food, fuel, medicine and other desperately needed supplies from entering Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept an alternative U.S. proposal for the ceasefire and the release of hostages. The suspension of aid drew widespread criticism, with human rights groups saying that it violated Israel’s obligations as an occupying power under international law.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israel-demolished-181-palestinian-homes-in-east-jerusalem-group-says/	2025-03-05T03:00:32-08:00	
Ukraine selling T-shirts with Zelensky quote from Trump-Vance mee...	(The Hill) – The Ukrainian government has launched a T-shirt fundraising effort seeking to capitalize on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's now-infamous Oval Office meeting on Friday with President Trump and Vice President Vance. The meeting, which unraveled to such an extent that a joint press conference between the two sides scheduled for afterwards was canceled, including multiple moments that went viral, including when Zelensky was criticized for not wearing a suit. He has dressed in more military-themed garb since Russia invaded his country three years ago. United24, a Ukrainian state-sponsored platform that raises funds amid the ongoing war, is raffling off 100 T-shirts with Zelensky's response: 'I’ll wear a costume when the war is over.' In Ukrainian, the word 'costume' is used as a translated term for suit. The raffle is open to those who donate $24 or more toward Kyiv's defense efforts. 'They’re emphasizing the words of our President — a reminder that there is a time and place for everything,' United24's online post reads. 'There will be a time when we can all wear suits. Right now, it is time to help Ukraine finish this war. You have all the cards to support Ukraine — it’s time to play them. Donate to help Ukraine finish this war and win something to wear instead of a suit,' it concluded. During Friday’s Oval Office spat, Zelensky tried to tell Trump of the brutality endured by his citizens amid the conflict. Trump urged his counterpart to show more gratitude for American dollars fueling the war. 'Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. You’re in no position to dictate that. You don’t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards,' Trump said in front of cameras. 'You’re gambling with World War III, and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that has backed you.' The president and members of his administration have called on Zelensky to apologize over the meeting. Tensions have risen between Trump and Zelensky in recent weeks after the former called the latter a 'dictator without elections' who had done a 'terrible job.' Trump recently suggested Ukraine was to blame for the start of the war with Russia. On Monday, Trump, who has been pressuring Ukraine to sign a a deal that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine’s critical mineral supply, paused American military aid to Kyiv.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ukraine-selling-t-shirts-with-zelensky-quote-from-trump-vance-meeting/	2025-03-04T13:59:10-08:00	
Zelenskyy calls Oval Office spat with Trump 'regrettable,' says h...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that the Oval Office blowup with U.S. counterpart Donald Trump last week was 'regrettable,' adding that he stands ready to work under Trump's 'strong leadership' to get a lasting peace. Zelenskyy’s remarks — an apparent attempt to placate Trump — came in a social media post on X, hours after the White House announced a pause in military aid to Ukraine that is critical to fighting Russia’s invasion. But later during his nightly address, Zelenskyy indicated that Ukraine didn't receive direct notification from the U.S. that aid had been cut, and was seeking confirmation. 'I have instructed Ukraine’s Minister of Defense, the heads of our intelligence agencies, and our diplomats to contact their counterparts in the United States and obtain official information. People should not have to guess,' he said. 'Ukraine and America deserve a respectful dialogue and a clear position from one another. Especially when it comes to protecting lives during a full-scale war,' he added, saying that military aid had been cut once before in January for a brief period. Zelenskyy also said Ukraine is ready to sign a lucrative deal on rare-earth minerals and security with Washington. Trump was weighing whether to agree to the signing Tuesday, when he is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress, after Zelenskyy's sign of contrition, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. In an apparent reference to Trump’s criticism following the contentious White House meeting on Friday that Zelenskyy does not want a peace deal, the Ukrainian leader said, 'None of us want an endless war.' 'Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,' he said. Asked by reporters in Moscow about Zelenskyy voicing readiness for the resumption of talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, 'It’s good, it’s positive.' In his post, Zelenskyy said the Oval Office meeting 'did not go the way it was supposed to be.' 'It is regrettable that it happened this way. It is time to make things right,' he added. 'We would like future cooperation and communication to be constructive.' The pause of U.S. military aid catapulted Ukraine into alarm and apprehension. Zelenskyy’s statement came before Trump was expected to address the U.S. Congress later Tuesday. 'Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it in any time and in any convenient format,' Zelenskyy said. 'We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively.' French President Emmanuel Macron spoke by phone successively with Trump and Zelenskyy, Macron's office said, and 'welcomes' the Ukrainian's 'willingness to re-engage in dialogue with the U.S.' It released no details about the discussion with Trump. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also spoke to the Ukrainian leader and 'welcomed President Zelenskyy’s steadfast commitment to securing peace.' Zelenskyy’s post came as officials in Kyiv said they were grateful for vital U.S. help in the war and want to keep working with Washington. Ukraine’s prime minister, though, said the country still wants security guarantees to be part of any peace deal and won’t recognize Russian occupation of any Ukrainian land. Those are potential stumbling blocks for Washington and Moscow, respectively. Ukraine and its allies are concerned Trump is pushing for a quick ceasefire that will favor Russia, which Kyiv says cannot be trusted to honor truces. A White House official said the U.S. was 'pausing and reviewing' its aid to 'ensure that it is contributing to a solution.' The order will remain in effect until Trump determines that Ukraine has demonstrated a commitment to peace negotiations, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the assistance. The pause in U.S. aid isn’t expected to have an immediate impact on the battlefield. Ukrainian forces have slowed Russian advances along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the fiercely contested Donetsk region in the east. The Russian onslaught has been costly in troops and armor but hasn’t brought a strategically significant breakthrough for the Kremlin. Ukraine needs help to fight Russia Ukraine, which depends heavily on foreign help to hold back Russia’s full-scale invasion that began on Feb. 24, 2022, has feared that aid could be stopped since Trump took office. U.S.-made Patriot air defense missile systems, for example, are pivotal to protecting Ukraine. Just as vital is U.S. intelligence assistance, which has allowed Ukraine to track Russian troop movements and select targets. 'I feel betrayed, but this feeling is not really deep for some reason. I was expecting something like that from Trump’s side,' said a Ukrainian soldier fighting in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a daring incursion in August 2024 to improve its hand in negotiations. The soldier spoke by phone to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. On the front line, where Ukraine is struggling to fend off the larger and better-equipped Russian army, another soldier said the U.S. decision would allow further battlefield gains for Moscow. 'War is very pragmatic,' he told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity in compliance with military regulations. 'If we have weapons, enough ammunition, infantry, armored vehicles and aviation — great. If not, then we’re done,' he said. He recalled a seven-month delay in U.S. aid that ended in April 2024 but opened a door for Russia's capture of the strategic city of Avdiivka. Olena Fedorova, 46, of the southern port city of Odesa, said she hoped Trump’s decision would be temporary because 'we really need help.' U.S. support is vital because Europe cannot fully provide what Ukraine needs in air defense systems, leading to increased civilian casualties, said lawmaker Yehor Chernov. The suspension of U.S. military aid is already being felt at a hub in eastern Poland that has been used to ferry Western weapons into neighboring Ukraine, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. The U.S.-Ukraine relationship has taken a downturn since Trump took office and his team launched bilateral talks with Russia. Trump had vowed during his campaign to settle the war in 24 hours, but later changed that time frame and voiced hope that peace could be negotiated in six months. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said U.S. help is 'vital' and has saved 'perhaps tens of thousands' of civilian and military lives. But he emphasized that any peace agreement must be 'on Ukraine’s terms, as the victim country.' Ukraine wants 'concrete security guarantees' from Washington, European countries and Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, he said. Giving up territory to Russia, which occupies nearly 20% of Ukraine, 'is not possible' under the U.N. Charter, he said. European allies stress support for Kyiv Noting that the U.S. has been 'the chief supplier' of aid to Ukraine, Peskov said that if Washington suspends these supplies, 'it will make the best contribution to peace.' Poland’s Foreign Ministry said the U.S. had not consulted with or informed NATO countries before announcing the pause. Russia will likely try to use the halt in supplies to extend its territorial gains and strengthen its position in prospective peace talks. Andrei Kartapolov, a retired general who heads a defense committee in parliament, told Russia's state RIA news agency that Ukraine would exhaust its current ammunition reserves within months. 'We need to keep up the pressure and continue to target their bases and depots with long-range precision weapons to destroy the stockpiles,' he said. Ukraine’s European allies, meanwhile, reaffirmed their commitment to Kyiv. The chief of the European Union’s executive proposed an 800-billion-euro ($841 billion) plan to bolster defenses of EU nations and provide Ukraine with military muscle. The U.K. government, which has been leading European efforts to keep Trump from pushing to end the war on terms that could favor Moscow, said it remains 'absolutely committed to securing a lasting peace in Ukraine.' Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based defense think tank, said Washington’s move could encourage Russia to seek more Ukrainian concessions, including demilitarization and neutrality. ___ Volodymyr Yurchuk in Kyiv, Vanessa Gera in Warsaw, Poland, and Aamer Madhani, Zeke Miller and Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukrainians-wake-up-to-trumps-pause-on-all-military-aid/	2025-03-04T12:53:29-08:00	
Zelensky calls Trump meeting 'regrettable,' stops short of apolog...	(The Hill) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday called his contentious meeting last week with President Trump at the White House a 'regrettable' gathering but stopped short of issuing an apology for the public blowup. In a post online, Zelensky signaled Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table to end the three-year-war with Russia. 'Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be. It is regrettable that it happened this way,' the Ukrainian leader wrote in a post on social platform X. 'It is time to make things right.' 'We would like future cooperation and communication to be constructive,' he added. Zelensky reiterated on Tuesday that his country is committed to reaching a peace deal and he is ready to sign the mineral deal to reinvigorate cooperation between the war-torn country and the U.S. The two leaders were expected to sign the agreement, which would give Washington access to Ukraine's critical minerals in exchange for security guarantees, on Friday, but the clash derailed the plan. 'Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it in any time and in any convenient format,' he wrote on X. 'We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively.' Tensions have been simmering between the leaders for months. Trump has previously hammered Zelensky over his leadership, accusing him of being a 'dictator without elections,' doing a 'terrible job' as the country’s head official and blaming Kyiv for starting the war in Eastern Europe. The Ukrainian president has shot back, accusing Trump of living in a 'disinformation space,' and questioning the administration's peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Friday, Trump, along with Vice President Vance, went after Zelensky, arguing he was insufficiently grateful for U.S. military assistance and that his leverage in reaching a ceasefire with Russia was miniscule. Trump called off the signing of the minerals deal and claimed his Ukrainian counterpart was not prepared to reach a peace deal. Zelensky, after the meeting, told Fox News's Bret Baier in an interview that he would not apologize for the heated back-and-forth. On Monday, Trump instituted a freeze on all U.S. aid going to Ukraine. Zelensky said Tuesday that his team is 'ready' to work with Trump’s administration to bring an end to the conflict with Moscow. 'We are ready to work fast to end the war, and the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky — ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure — and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same,' Zelensky wrote. 'Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the US to agree a strong final deal,' he added. The Ukrainian leader also expressed gratitude for the aid the U.S. has provided. 'We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. And we remember the moment when things changed when President Trump provided Ukraine with Javelins,' Zelensky said. 'We are grateful for this.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/zelensky-calls-trump-meeting-regrettable-stops-short-of-apology/	2025-03-04T09:47:56-08:00	
Arab leaders gather to endorse counterproposal to Trump's Gaza pl...	CAIRO (AP) — Arab leaders meeting in Cairo on Tuesday are set to endorse a counterproposal to U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for the Gaza Strip to be depopulated and transformed into a beach destination, even as the continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire is uncertain. The summit hosted by Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi included the foreign ministers of regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, whose support is crucial for any postwar plan. Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative U.S. proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the war. It has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting. The suspension of aid drew widespread criticism, with human rights groups saying that it violated Israel's obligations as an occupying power under international law. The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase. Egypt's postwar plan Egypt has developed a postwar plan in which Palestinians would be relocated to safe areas inside Gaza, and equipped with mobile homes while its cities are rebuilt. Hamas would cede power to an interim administration of political independents until a reformed Palestinian Authority can assume control. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Western-backed authority and an opponent of Hamas, was attending the summit. Israel has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and, along with the United States, has demanded Hamas’ disarmament. Hamas, which doesn't accept Israel's existence, has said that it's willing to cede power in Gaza to other Palestinians, but won't give up its arms until there is a Palestinian state. An early draft of the statement endorsing the plan called for a 'permanent and just solution' for the Palestinian cause, and for the U.N. Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The mention of peacekeepers was dropped from a later draft. Israel has vowed to maintain open-ended security control over both territories, which it captured in the 1967 Mideast war and which Palestinians want for their future state. Israel’s government and most of its political class are opposed to Palestinian statehood. Trump shocked the region last month when he suggested that Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries. He said that the United States would take ownership of the territory and redevelop it into a Middle Eastern 'Riviera.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embraced the proposal, which was roundly rejected by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who said it would likely violate international law. Children from Gaza head to Jordan for treatment Trump has suggested that Egypt and Jordan, two close American allies, could take in large numbers of Palestinian refugees from Gaza. Both countries have adamantly rejected any such plan. Meeting with Trump at the White House last month, King Abdullah II of Jordan offered to take in around 2,000 children for medical treatment. The first batch of around 30 children left Gaza for Jordan on Tuesday, according to Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The children are being accompanied by up to two family members. Jordan said that the children are amputees, and will return to Gaza when their treatment is complete. The kingdom has also set up field hospitals in Gaza and delivered aid by air and land. The war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 people hostage. Hamas-led militants are still holding 59 hostages, 35 of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements. Israel has rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more. Israel's 15-month offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It doesn't say how many were fighters, but the ministry says women and children made up more than half the dead. Israel says it killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed large areas of Gaza, including much of its health system and other infrastructure. At its height, the war displaced abou 90% of the population, mostly within the territory, where hundreds of thousands packed into squalid tent camps and schools repurposed as shelters. ___ Jahjouh reported from Khan Younis, Gaza Strip. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-arab-leaders-gather-to-endorse-counterproposal-to-trumps-gaza-plan-with-ceasefires-fate-uncertain/	2025-03-04T05:44:48-08:00	
Trump pauses aid to Ukraine amid clash with Zelensky	President Trump has ordered a pause on U.S. aid going to Ukraine in its war against Russia, a consequential move as he clashes with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about the path to ending the conflict. 'The President has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well,' a White House official said in a statement. 'We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.' The pause applies to all military aid not already on the ground in Ukraine and will effect munitions, anti-tank weapons and other materials the U.S. has provided to Kyiv since Russia invaded roughly three years ago. Trump took office with nearly $4 billion in drawdown authority available from previously approved congressional funding for Ukraine. That funding now appears poised to go unused. The move is likely to increase the pressure on Zelensky to get back in Trump’s good graces or risk losing ground in the war. It is also likely to put the spotlight on European nations seeking to rally more support for Kyiv. As of the end of fiscal 2024, Congress had approved nearly $183 billion in Ukraine aid, according to a federal government oversight office. The European Union has contributed roughly $145 billion in total assistance to Ukraine since the war began. Trump campaigned on a pledge to end the war in Ukraine. Since taking office, he has spoken with both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tensions have been heightened between Trump and Zelensky in recent weeks after the U.S. president called the Ukrainian leader a 'dictator without elections' who had done a 'terrible job.' Trump recently suggested Ukraine was to blame for the start of the war with Russia. Zelensky responded at the time that Trump was living in a 'disinformation space.' The tensions appeared to culminate last Friday at a confrontational meeting in the Oval Office, after which Trump said the Ukrainian leader was not 'ready for peace.' Zelensky had arrived at the White House last week expecting to meet with Trump and sign off on a deal that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine’s critical mineral supply. Trump had touted the deal as a way for the U.S. to recoup some of the aid it had provided to Ukraine in its war against Russia, while boosting Ukraine’s economy in the long term. But Trump called off peace talks, and the deal was left unsigned after the Oval Office blowup. Trump said earlier Monday that the minerals deal was not dead, and that Zelensky could restart talks by showing appreciation for U.S. assistance.

The Latest: Trump and his allies lash out at Ukraine’s Zelenskyy ...	President Donald Trump ’s senior aides and allies lashed out at Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy from Washington as he attended a European summit in London to rally international support for his military’s fight against the Russian invasion. Meanwhile, Trump on Tuesday night will deliver the first joint congressional address of his second presidency. It’s not officially called the State of the Union, a title reserved for a president’s annual address to Congress during other years of an administration. Here's the latest: Waltz commends UK Prime Minister Starmer, French President Macron for stepping up on Ukraine 'We welcome the Europeans taking a lead in European security,' National security adviser Mike Waltz told reporters at the White House. 'I mean that’s been an underpinning. They have to invest in the capability to do that. They’re certainly showing a will.' Waltz’s comments come after Starmer gathered his European counterparts in London on Sunday for talks and called on them to shore up their borders and throw their full weight behind Ukraine as he announced outlines of a plan to end Russia’s war. Both Starmer and Macron have said they would send troops to Ukraine for a peacekeeping mission once a truce in the fighting between Ukraine and Russia is achieved. ‘There’s initial signs’ of effect on the budget, Congressional Budget Office director says of DOGE cuts Phillip Swagel, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said Monday that cuts enacted by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, are slowing government spending but added that it’s 'too early' to make any broader judgement about DOGE’s impact on spending or deficits. 'There’s initial signs that there has been a budgetary impact,' Swagel said in remarks at the National Association for Business Economics. He noted that government spending in some agencies has come in below what was projected before the Trump administration took office. But he said the cuts won’t show up as official budgetary savings unless Congress rescinds the money through legislation later this year. Some of DOGE’s spending cuts could be reversed by the courts, he said. He also noted that the majority of government spending is in the form of mandatory benefit programs and hasn’t been affected. RFK Jr. lays out benefits of measles vaccines, but stops short of calling for people to get a dose The nation’s top health official wrote Sunday that the measles vaccine has benefits but he stopped short of calling on parents to inoculate their children from the deadly disease. In an opinion piece for Fox News, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urged parents to consult with 'healthcare providers' on whether their children should get the vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella. 'Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,' Kennedy wrote in the piece, published Sunday. Kennedy has previously criticized the vaccines, although research and real-world use has proven that they are safe and effective. Waltz adds to doubt about whether White House willing to deal with Zelenskyy going forward National security adviser Mike Waltz also on Monday said Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s posture during Friday’s Oval Office 'put up in the air' whether he’s someone the U.S. administration will be able to deal with going forward. 'Is he ready? Personally, politically, to move his country towards an end to the fighting?' Waltz said on Fox News on Monday. 'And can he and will he make the compromises necessary?' Waltz added another layer of doubt about U.S. support in the aftermath of Friday’s contentious meeting with President Trump and Vice President JD Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz calls Oval Office blowup a ‘truly ridiculous and unacceptable session’ He was speaking on Fox News on Monday morning. The meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which was meant to result in the signing of a minerals deal between the two nations was abruptly ended after an extraordinary blowup between the Ukrainian and American leaders. 'He’s not ready to talk peace at all,' Waltz said. 'This wasn’t an ambush,' he said. 'Zelenskyy did his country a disservice.' Unlike some Republican lawmakers who over the weekend called for Zelenskyy’s resignation — Waltz did not call on the Ukrainian leader to step down, but after asked whether Zelenskyy is fit to lead Ukraine, Waltz said: 'what happened Friday really put that up in the air.' Senate will vote on confirming Linda McMahon to lead an education agency Trump has vowed to close The Senate will be voting Monday. McMahon would face the competing tasks of winding down the Education Department while also escalating efforts to achieve Trump’s agenda. Already the Republican president has signed sweeping orders to rid America’s schools of diversity programs and accommodations for transgender students while also calling for expanded school choice programs. At the same time, Trump has promised to shut down the department and said he wants McMahon 'to put herself out of a job.' A billionaire and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon, 76, is an unconventional pick for the role. She spent a year on Connecticut’s state board of education and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University but otherwise has little traditional education leadership. ▶ Read more about Linda McMahon Trump’s next first speech to Congress is bound to have little resemblance to his last first one The nation will hear a new president sing a far different tune in his prime-time address before Congress on Tuesday night. Some Americans will lustily sing along. Others will plug their ears. The old tune is out — the one where a president declares 'we strongly support NATO,' 'I believe strongly in free trade' and Washington must do more to promote clean air, clean water, women’s health and civil rights. That was Donald Trump in 2017. That was back when gestures of bipartisanship and appeals to national unity were still in the mix on the night the president comes before Congress to hold forth on the state of the union. Trump, then new at the job, was just getting his footing in the halls of power and not ready to stomp on everything. It would be three more years before Americans would see Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, then the House speaker and his State of the Union host in the chamber, performatively rip up a copy of Trump’s speech in disgust over its contents. ▶ Read more about what to expect from Trump’s address to congress The Trump administration may exclude government spending from GDP, obscuring the impact of DOGE cuts Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that government spending could be separated from gross domestic product reports, in response to questions about whether the spending cuts pushed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency could possibly cause an economic downturn. 'You know that governments historically have messed with GDP,' Lutnick said on Fox News Channel’s 'Sunday Morning Futures.' 'They count government spending as part of GDP. So I’m going to separate those two and make it transparent.' Doing so could potentially complicate or distort a fundamental measure of the U.S. economy’s health. Government spending is traditionally included in the GDP because changes in taxes, spending, deficits and regulations by the government can impact the path of overall growth. GDP reports already include extensive details on government spending, offering a level of transparency for economists. ▶ Read more about government spending and the GDP Trudeau is expected to bring up Trump’s threat to annex Canada when he meets King Charles Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will meet with King Charles III, the country’s head of state, on Monday where he will discuss U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to make Canada the 51st state. The king has come under criticism in Canada for being silent about Trump’s threats to annex Canada. Trudeau said in London on Sunday he will discuss matters of importance to Canadians with Charles and said 'nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation.' ▶ Read more about Trudeau’s meeting with King Charles III What to watch when Trump gives his big speech to Congress Trump loves a good spectacle, and it’s hard to top a speech to a joint session of Congress. The House chamber is packed with lawmakers, and the president’s arrival is announced in a booming voice by the sergeant-at-arms, triggering cacophonous applause. Trump’s speech on Tuesday evening isn’t technically considered a State of the Union address — that comes next year, after he’s been on the job for longer — but there’s no distinguishable difference for anyone watching at home. Almost no detail is left to chance in these situations. Here’s some ideas of what to look and listen for: 1. Is Elon Musk in attendance? 2. What does Trump say about Ukraine? 3. How do lawmakers behave? 4. Does Trump spell out a legislative plan? 5. Which version of Trump shows up? ▶ Read more on what to watch for in Trump’s big speech UK’s Starmer says Europe is at ‘crossroads in history’ as leaders agree to steps to Ukraine peace British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rallied his European counterparts Sunday to shore up their borders and throw their full weight behind Ukraine as he announced outlines of a plan to end Russia’s war. 'Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can, bringing different capabilities and support to the table, but all taking responsibility to act, all stepping up their own share of the burden,' he said. Starmer’s exhortation to 18 fellow leaders that they need to do the heavy lifting for their own security comes two days after U.S. backing of Ukraine appeared in jeopardy when Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy. Starmer said he had worked with France and Ukraine on a plan to end the war and that the group of leaders — mostly from Europe — had agreed on four things. The steps toward peace would: 6. keep aid flowing to Kyiv 7. maintain economic pressure on Russia to strengthen Ukraine’s hand 8. make sure Ukraine is at the bargaining table and any peace deal must ensure its sovereignty and security 9. continue to arm Ukraine to deter future invasion ▶ Read more about Starmer’s meeting with European leaders Following Trump’s lead, his allies lash out at Ukraine’s Zelenskyy and suggest he may need to resign President Donald Trump’s senior aides and allies lashed out at Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy from Washington as he attended a European summit Sunday in London to rally international support for his military’s fight against the Russian invasion. Following Trump’s lead, White House officials and Republicans in Congress used news show appearances to demand that Zelenskyy display more gratitude for U.S. support and an openness to potential war-ending concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some suggested Zelenskyy should consider resigning even as Ukrainians rally around him. But they offered little clarity as to what Zelenskyy and Ukraine could do after Friday’s Oval Office meeting in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated him before canceling the signature of an economic agreement between Washington and Kyiv. The dispute leaves the future of that relationship in question, as well as the prospects for ending a conflict that began when the Kremlin invaded in February 2022. ▶ Read more about the European summit on Ukraine	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-the-latest-trump-and-his-allies-lash-out-at-ukraines-zelenskyy-and-suggest-he-may-need-to-resign/	2025-03-03T07:17:00-08:00	
European leaders hold summit for Ukraine	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) – The fallout continues after President Donald Trump's Oval Office blowup with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president was quickly ushered out of the White House on Friday. President Trump called him 'disrespectful'. President Zelenskyy spent the weekend in Europe. The U.K.’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted European leaders to show support for Ukraine. Starmer says he spoke with President Trump after the Oval Office dust-up between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Democrats and Republicans were divided on who's to blame. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz blamed Zelenskyy. 'He found every opportunity to Ukraine-splain on every issue. Then he confronts the Vice President,' said Rubio. Democrats blamed President Trump and Vice President JD Vance. 'Either it was an ambushed setup, or they just got so hot-headed,' said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Senator James Lankford (R-Okla.) responded to calls from some in his own party for Zelenskyy to step down. 'Quite frankly I think that would spiral Ukraine into chaos right now,' said Lankford. President Trump and President Zelenskyy were supposed to sign a minerals agreement, a chance for Ukraine to pay back the U.S. for support in the war and President Trump says it would've moved Ukraine and Russia closer to peace. President Zelenskyy says he's still willing to sign the deal.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/european-leaders-hold-summit-for-ukraine/	2025-03-03T04:59:03-08:00	
With the Gaza ceasefire in limbo, Israel tries to impose an alter...	Israel this week introduced what it said was a new U.S. ceasefire plan — different from the one it agreed to in January — and is trying to force Hamas to accept it by imposing a siege on the Gaza Strip. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to it as the 'Witkoff proposal,' saying it came from U.S. President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff. But the White House has yet to confirm that, saying only that it supports whatever action Israel takes. Netanyahu's remarks came a day after the first phase of the negotiated ceasefire ended, with no clarity on what would come next since the agreement's second phase has not yet been hammered out. The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group's main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase. Hamas has accused Israel of trying to sabotage the existing agreement, which called for the two sides to negotiate the return of the remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire. But no substantive negotiations have been held. On Sunday, Israel halted all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza’s population of some 2 million people and vowed 'additional consequences' if Hamas did not embrace the new proposal. Arab leaders are meanwhile finalizing a separate plan for postwar Gaza to counter Trump's suggestion that its population be relocated so it can be transformed into a tourist destination. But all bets are off if the war resumes. The existing agreement is in limbo The ceasefire reached in January, after more than a year of negotiations mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, laid out a three-phase plan to return all the hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, and ending the war triggered by the attack. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage. More than 100 were released in an earlier ceasefire. Israeli forces rescued eight and recovered dozens of bodies before the current ceasefire took hold. During the first, six-week phase, Hamas released 25 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces withdrew from most of Gaza and allowed an influx of desperately needed humanitarian aid. Each side accused the other of violations, but the deal held. Phase 2 was always going to be far more difficult because it would force Israel to choose between securing the return the hostages and annihilating Hamas — two of Netanyahu's main war goals. Hamas, which remains in control of Gaza, has said it will only release the remaining hostages if Israel ends the war. But that would leave the militant group intact and with major influence over the territory, even if it hands over formal power to other Palestinians, as it says it is willing to do. The new plan favors Israel Hamas still has 59 hostages, 35 of whom are believed to be dead. Under the so-called Witkoff plan, it would release half the hostages on the first day — apparently without getting anything new in return. The sides would then have around six weeks — through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover holiday ending April 20 — to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and the return of the remaining hostages. But with fewer hostages, Hamas' hand would be weakened, and Israel and the United States are already speaking about new conditions — like the disarmament of Hamas or the exile of its leadership — that were not part of the original agreement. A political lifeline for Netanyahu Netanyahu's narrow coalition is beholden to far-right allies who want to eliminate Hamas, depopulate Gaza through what they refer to as 'voluntary emigration' and rebuild Jewish settlements in the territory. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has threatened to bring down the government if Netanyahu enters Phase 2 of the existing agreement and does not resume the war. The new plan would buy Netanyahu six weeks of breathing room and enough time to pass a budget by the end of the month — something he must do to keep his government from automatically falling. If it falls, elections would be held roughly a year and a half ahead of schedule and could see him removed from power. Opposition parties say they would ensure Netanyahu's government is not brought down over a deal that returns the rest of the hostages. But that would still weaken him politically. The American position is unclear Netanyahu says his government has 'fully coordinated' its approach with the Trump administration, which has publicly endorsed Israel's war goals, including the eradication of Hamas. But Witkoff has not said a word in public about the plan that supposedly bears his name. Trump himself has sent mixed signals about Gaza. As a candidate, he pledged to end wars in the Middle East, and he took credit for pushing the ceasefire agreement past the finish line just before his inauguration. But he has also expressed revulsion at Hamas' treatment of the captives and suggested that 'all hell' should break loose if they are not immediately returned, while leaving that decision to Israel. An Arab counterproposal to Trump's Gaza plan Trump has also floated the idea of relocating Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians to other countries so the U.S. can rebuild it as a tourist destination. Netanyahu welcomed that proposal, which was universally rejected by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who warn it could violate international law. It's hard to see how Trump's Gaza plan would be carried out without Israel resuming the war and launching an even bloodier offensive than the last one, which left much of Gaza in ruins and killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. They say more than half of those killed were women and children but do not specify how many of the dead were combatants. Egypt has developed a counterproposal expected to be endorsed at an Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday. Under its plan, Palestinians would remain in Gaza and relocate to 'safe zones' while cities are rebuilt. Hamas would hand over power to a transitional authority of political independents while the international community works to empower the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. But Israel, which has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza, is unlikely to accept such a plan. And while Trump has called on Arab countries to come up with their own proposal, it's unclear whether he would go for it either. ___ Associated Press writers Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-with-the-gaza-ceasefire-in-limbo-israel-tries-to-impose-an-alternative-plan-on-hamas/	2025-03-03T04:37:41-08:00	
Conan O'Brien swipes at Trump with 'Anora' joke: Americans 'excit...	(The Hill) — Conan O'Brien seemingly took a knock at President Donald Trump at the Oscars, saying audiences are happy to see fictional film characters stand up to 'a powerful Russian.' 'You know 'Anora' is having a good night,' O'Brien, the host of the 97th annual Academy Awards, said during the ceremony in Los Angeles on Sunday. 'That's great news. Two wins already,' the comedian said of the movie, which is about a sex worker who marries a Russian oligarch's son. 'I guess Americans are excited to see somebody finally stand up to a powerful Russian,' O'Brien deadpanned to applause from the audience. Without naming him, the quip appeared to be a swipe at Trump, following a tense Oval Office meeting on Friday between the president, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the sometimes-heated and explosive exchange, Trump and Zelensky argued over U.S. support for Ukraine. Several Republican political figures, including GOP strategist Karl Rove and Rep. Mike Lawler (N.Y.), have publicly criticized the clash between Trump and Zelensky, saying the only winner of the contentious meeting was Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'Anora' secured the Oscar for best picture on Sunday as director Sean Baker won the award for director, best original screenplay, and film editing. Mikey Madison also won best actress for her role in 'Anora.'

No Other Land' Oscar winners call for a different path on Israel...	LOS ANGELES (The Hill) — The filmmakers behind 'No Other Land,' which won the Oscar for best documentary, called for a different path forward to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in their acceptance speech Sunday. 'There is a different path, a political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people,' said Israeli filmmaker Yuval Abraham, in his acceptance speech. 'And I have to say, as I am here, the foreign policy in this country is helping to block this path,' Abraham continued, knocking President Trump’s approach to foreign policy.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) The film is a collaboration between Israelis and Palestinians, and it follows activist Basel Adra as he documents the destruction of his hometown at the southern edge of the West Bank, which Israeli soldiers are tearing down to use as a military training zone, according to The Associated Press. Adra then befriends a Jewish Israeli journalist to help tell his story. 'We made this film, Palestinians and Israelis, because together, our voices are stronger. We see each other, the atrocious destruction of Gaza and its people, which must end, the Israeli hostages brutally taken in the crime of October 7, which must be freed,' Abraham said on stage. 'When I look at Basel, I see my brother, but we are unequal,' he continued. 'We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law, and Basel is under military laws that destroy his life, and he cannot control.' Adra, on stage, said that two months ago, he became a father and said he hopes his daughter 'will not have to live the same life I’m living now, always fearing settlers, violence, home demolitions and forcible displacements.' 'We call on the world to take serious actions to stop injustice and to stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people,' Adra added in his speech. The documentary, which was filmed over four years between 2019 and 2023, wrapped production just days before Hamas launched its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, precipitating the ongoing war.

Israel cuts off Gaza aid to pressure Hamas to accept a new ceasef...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel stopped the entry of all goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip on Sunday and warned of 'additional consequences' if Hamas doesn’t accept a new proposal to extend a fragile ceasefire, while key mediator Egypt accused Israel of using 'starvation as a weapon.' Hamas accused Israel of trying to derail the ceasefire agreement hours after its first phase ended. It called the decision to cut off aid 'cheap extortion, a war crime and a blatant attack' on the truce, which took hold in January after over a year of negotiations. Both sides stopped short of saying the ceasefire had ended. LATEST: Israel and Hamas conflict The first phase, which included a surge in humanitarian assistance after months of growing hunger in the territory, expired on Saturday. The two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, in which Hamas was to release dozens of remaining hostages in return for an Israeli pullout from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire. Talks should have begun a month ago. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty condemned Israel’s decision as 'a flagrant and clear violation of humanitarian law' and called for the immediate implementation of the second phase. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has facilitated the releases of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, said the ceasefire has saved countless lives, and 'any unraveling of the forward momentum created over the last six weeks risks plunging people back into despair.' Israel described the new proposal as a U.S. one. There was no immediate comment from the United States, and it was not clear when U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, expected to visit the region last week, would arrive. UK, France and Ukraine agree to work on ceasefire plan for Russia’s war in Ukraine Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that under the existing agreements, Israel could resume fighting after the first phase if it believes negotiations are ineffective. He said the ceasefire would only continue if Hamas keeps releasing hostages, telling his Cabinet 'there will be no free lunches.' He said Israel was 'fully coordinated' with President Donald Trump’s administration. Getting the Israel-Hamas ceasefire to the next phase will be difficult. Here’s why The war has left most of Gaza’s population of over 2 million dependent on international aid. Hundreds of aid trucks had entered Gaza daily since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, easing fears of famine raised by international experts. But residents said prices doubled as word of the closure spread. 'Everyone is worried,' said Sayed al-Dairi in Gaza City. 'This is not a life.' Fayza Nassar, in the heavily destroyed urban Jabaliya refugee camp, said the closure would worsen already dire conditions. 'There will be famine and chaos,' she said. Hamas warns of consequences for hostages Israel said the new proposal called for extending the ceasefire through Ramadan — the Muslim holy month that began over the weekend — and the Jewish Passover holiday, which ends on April 20. Syrians begin fasting during first Ramadan without Assad family rule in decades Under that proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, Netanyahu said. Hamas warned that any attempt to delay or cancel the ceasefire agreement would have 'humanitarian consequences' for the hostages. It reiterated that the only way to free them is through implementing the existing deal. Hamas has said it is willing to free the hostages all at once in Phase 2, but only in return for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. An Egyptian official said Hamas and Egypt would not accept a new proposal aimed at returning the remaining hostages without ending the war. The official, who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said mediators were trying to resolve the dispute. Ceasefire marred by disputes Under the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, including some serving life sentences for deadly attacks and others held without charge. Israeli forces pulled back from most of Gaza, and Israel allowed a surge of humanitarian aid to enter. The first phase was marred by repeated disputes. Israeli strikes killed dozens of Palestinians who the military said had approached its forces or entered areas in violation of the truce. On Sunday, Israel carried out an airstrike on Palestinians it said were planting an explosive device in northern Gaza near the border. Gaza’s Health Ministry said two men were killed and that Israeli fire killed two other people elsewhere. Hamas paraded most captives — some of them emaciated — before crowds in spectacles that Israel and the United Nations said were cruel and degrading. And it initially returned the wrong set of remains instead of those of a mother who was killed in captivity along with her two young children. Israel sought to restrict public celebrations over released Palestinian prisoners, and some were freed wearing shirts emblazoned with a Star of David and the phrase 'Never forgive, never forget' in Arabic. Some people threw their sweatshirts on the ground and burned them. Israel accused of blocking aid Israel imposed a siege on Gaza in the war’s opening days and only eased it under U.S. pressure. U.N. agencies and aid groups accused Israel of not facilitating enough aid during 15 months of war. The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used 'starvation as a method of warfare' when it issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu last year. The allegation is also central to South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide. Israel has denied the accusations and rejected both court actions as being biased. Israel says it has allowed in enough aid and blamed shortages on what it called the U.N.’s inability to distribute it. Israel accused Hamas of siphoning off aid. Kenneth Roth, the former head of Human Rights Watch, said Israel as an occupying power has an 'absolute duty' to facilitate humanitarian aid under the Geneva Conventions and called Israel’s decision 'a resumption of the war-crime starvation strategy' that led to the ICC warrant. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostage. The militants currently hold 59 hostages, 35 of them believed to be dead.

UK, France and Ukraine agree to work on ceasefire plan for Russia...	LONDON (AP) — Britain, France and Ukraine have agreed to work on a ceasefire plan to present to the United States, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday as European leaders assembled in London to discuss ending the war. The meeting has been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by U.S. President Donald Trump, who blasted him Friday at the White House as being ungrateful for U.S. support against the invasion by Russia. But Starmer said he's focused on being a bridge to restore peace talks, whose collapse he used as an opportunity to re-engage with Trump, Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron rather than 'ramp up the rhetoric.' 'We’ve now agreed that the United Kingdom, along with France and possibly one or two others, will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, and then we’ll discuss that plan with the United States,' Starmer told the BBC. Starmer and Macron have both spoken to Trump since Friday. Sunday's meeting an important step The London meeting has taken on greater importance in defending the war-torn ally and shoring up the continent’s defenses. Sunday’s summit is likely to include talks on establishing a European military force to be sent to Ukraine to underpin a ceasefire. Starmer said it would involve 'a coalition of the willing.' Starmer said he does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin but does trust Trump. 'Do I believe Donald Trump when he says he wants lasting peace? The answer to that is yes,' he said. Starmer said there are 'intense discussions' to get a security guarantee from the U.S. 'If there is to be a deal, if there is to be a stopping of the fighting, then that agreement has to be defended, because the worst of all outcomes is that there is a temporary pause and then (Russian President Vladimir) Putin comes again,' Starmer said. 'That has happened in the past, I think it is a real risk, and that is why we must ensure that if there’s a deal, it is a lasting deal, not a temporary pause.' The three essentials Starmer listed for a successful peace deal were: arming the Ukrainians to put them in a position of strength; including a European element to guarantee security; and providing a 'U.S. backstop,' to prevent Putin from breaking promises. 'That’s the package. All three parts need to be in place, and that’s what I’m working hard to bring together,' Starmer said. Starmer hosted the meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace, following a charm offensive last week to persuade Trump to put Ukraine at the center of negotiations and tilt his allegiances toward Europe. Leaders from France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Canada, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania will be at the summit. The Turkish foreign minister, NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council were in attendance. European leaders backing Zelenskyy Zelenskyy received broad support from leaders across Europe after the White House fiasco, an exceptional attack on an ally broadcast on live television. Starmer embraced Zelenskyy as he arrived at the meeting Sunday, one of the final arrivals. Europe has been anxious since Trump initiated direct peace talks with Putin, who had been isolated by most Western leaders since invading Ukraine three years ago. The scramble to remain relevant and protect European interests as their once stalwart ally appeared to be cozying up to Putin was even more troubling when Trump called Zelenskyy a dictator and falsely said Ukraine started the war. Meetings in recent days had provided some hope — until Zelenskyy’s visit to the White House. Visits to the Oval Office by Macron, who had declared his visit a 'turning point,' and Starmer were seen as steps in the right direction. The meetings were cordial and Trump even took a gentler tone toward Ukraine, though he would not commit to providing U.S. security guarantees and maintained Europe would need to provide peacekeeping troops. Within 12 hours of Starmer's return from Washington, the talk of peace seemed to collapse as Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy for challenging Trump's assertions that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be trusted. 'Starmer did an impressive job of asserting Europe’s agency in the war on Ukraine and conveying to President Trump that Europe is willing and able to take a leading role in implementing any credible peace deal,' said Rachel Ellehuus, director-general of Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank. 'Unfortunately, Friday’s White House meeting was a major step backward.' Ukraine can no longer count on military or political support from the U.S. after Trump declared himself neutral in negotiations, Ellehuus said. She said Europe needs to step in and could release some 200 billion euros ($207 billion) in seized Russian assets to help fund that effort. 'The immediate goal of the meetings in London must be to keep Ukraine in the fight so it can negotiate from a maximum position of strength,' she said. Pledge to increase military spending Starmer pledged this week to boost military spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027. Other European nations may follow suit. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said Saturday that Europe faces a historic test and has to look after itself. He said European countries have to increase their arms spending to reach at least 3% of GDP. 'If we don’t increase our effort fast enough and let the aggressor dictate its conditions, we won’t end up well,' he said. Macron, who said it was legitimate for the U.S. to shift its focus to dealing with China and Asia, also called for more defense spending as he called for unity. 'We should have woken up earlier,' Macron said. 'I’ve been saying for years that we need a more sovereign, more united, more independent Europe.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/uk-france-and-ukraine-agree-to-work-on-ceasefire-plan-for-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2025-03-02T07:02:05-08:00	
Ukrainians rally around Zelenskyy as defender of Ukraine's intere...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Soon after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy left the White House on Friday after an astonishing Oval Office blowout with President Donald Trump, Ukrainians rallied around Zelenskyy as a defender of his country's interests. The shouting match that unfolded in the final minutes of the highly anticipated meeting between the two leaders seemed to dash, at least for now, Ukrainian hopes that the United States could be locked in as a reliable partner in helping fend off, and conclude, Russia's three-year onslaught. The exchange, which saw a frustrated Zelenskyy lectured by Trump and Vice President JD Vance over what they saw as his lack of gratitude for previous U.S. support, delighted officials in Moscow, who saw it as a final breakdown in relations between Washington and the Ukrainian leader. Many Ukrainians unfazed by the row But many Ukrainians on Friday seemed unfazed by the blowout between Zelenskyy and Trump, expressing a sense that the Ukrainian leader had stood up for their country’s dignity and interests by firmly maintaining his stance in the face of chiding from some of the world’s most powerful men. Nataliia Serhiienko, 67, a retiree in Kyiv, said she thinks Ukrainians approve of their president's performance in Washington, 'because Zelenskyy fought like a lion.' 'They had a heated meeting, a very heated conversation,' she said. But Zelenskyy 'was defending Ukraine’s interests.' The meeting at the White House was meant to produce a bilateral agreement that would establish a joint investment fund for reconstructing Ukraine, a deal that was seen as a potential step toward bringing an end to the war and tying the two countries' economies together for years to come. But as Zelenskyy and his team departed the White House at Trump's request, the deal went unsigned, and Ukraine's hopes for securing U.S. security backing seemed farther away than ever. Yet as the Ukrainian leader was set to return to Kyiv empty handed, his support at home seemed undiminished. Regional Ukrainian leader says president ‘held strong’ As two drones struck Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv on Friday night, the head of the region which sits on the border with Russia, Oleh Syniehubov, praised Zelenskyy. He said the president held strong to his insistence that no peace deal could be made without assurances for Ukraine's security against future Russian aggression. 'Our leader, despite the pressure, stands firm in defending the interests of Ukraine and Ukrainians. … We need only a just peace with security guarantees,' Syniehubov said. Kyiv resident Artem Vasyliev, 37, said he had seen 'complete disrespect' from the United States in the Oval Office exchange, despite the fact that Ukraine 'was the first country that stood up to Russia.' 'We are striving for democracy, and we are met with total disrespect, toward our warriors, our soldiers, and the people of our country,' said Vasyliev, a native of Russian-occupied Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Vasyliev criticized the U.S. president for what he said was a failure to recognize the human cost of Russia’s invasion, saying Trump 'doesn’t understand that people are dying, that cities are being destroyed, people are suffering, mothers, children, soldiers.' 'He cannot understand this, he is just a businessman. For him, money is sacred,' he said. Broad praise for Zelenskyy on social media Ukrainian social media was awash in praise for Zelenskyy late Friday, with officials on the national, regional and local level chiming in to voice their support for their leader. The outpouring resembled a recent surge in Ukrainian unity after Trump denigrated Zelenskyy by making false claims that Ukraine was led by a 'dictator' who started the war with Russia — comments that led some of the Ukrainian president's harshest critics to rally around him. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of Ukraine's southern Kherson region, which was mostly occupied by Russia early in the war but later partially retaken by Ukrainian forces, said three years of war had hardened his countrymen to the ups and downs of the fight to survive. 'We know what pressure is, on the front lines, in politics, in daily struggle,' Prokudin said. 'It has made us stronger. It has made the president stronger. Determination is the force that drives us forward. And I am confident that we will endure this time as well.' Trump's administration cast the heated exchange with Zelenskyy as part of its 'America First' policy and slammed the Ukrainian leader for a perceived lack of gratitude for U.S. assistance. But Zelenskyy's backers in Ukraine praised his commitment to acting in Ukraine's national interest — even if it meant coming into conflict with the president of the United States. 'Unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s interests and devotion to his country. This is what we saw today in the United States. Support for the President of Ukraine,' Vice Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba wrote on Telegram Friday. Not all of Ukraine's political figures, however, were as full-throated in their praise for how the Oval Office meeting concluded. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that he hoped 'that Ukraine does not lose the support of the United States, which is extremely important to us.' 'Today is not the time for emotions, from either side. We need to find common ground,' Klitschko wrote in a post on Telegram. ___ Associated Press writers Hanna Arhirova and Illia Novikov contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-after-oval-office-blowout-ukrainians-rally-around-zelenskyy-as-defender-of-ukraines-interests/	2025-03-01T00:08:07-08:00	
At meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy will seek security assurances ag...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukraine's leader is meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday at a pivotal moment for his country, as he tries to persuade the White House to provide some form of U.S. backing for Ukraine's security against any future Russian aggression. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's delegation is expected to sign a landmark economic agreement with the U.S. aimed at financing the reconstruction of war-damaged Ukraine, a deal that would closely tie the two countries together for years to come. The deal, which is seen as a step toward ending the three-year war, references the importance of Ukraine’s security. But it leaves that to a separate agreement to be discussed between the two leaders — talks that are likely to commence Friday. As Ukrainian forces hold out against slow but steady advances by Russia’s larger and better-equipped army, leaders in Kyiv have pushed to ensure a potential U.S.-brokered peace plan would include guarantees for the country’s future security. Many Ukrainians fear that a hastily negotiated peace — especially one that makes too many concessions to Russian demands — would allow Moscow to rearm and consolidate its forces for a future invasion after current hostilities cease. According to the preliminary economic agreement, seen by The Associated Press, the U.S. and Ukraine will establish a co-owned, jointly managed investment fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of future revenues from natural resources, including minerals, hydrocarbons and other extractable materials. A more detailed agreement on establishing the fund will be drawn up once the preliminary one is signed. Trump, a Republican, has framed the emerging agreement as a chance for Kyiv to compensate the U.S. for wartime aid sent under his predecessor, President Joe Biden, a Democrat. But Zelenskyy has remained firm that specific assurances for Ukraine’s security must accompany any agreement giving U.S. access to Ukraine’s resources. On Wednesday, he said the agreement 'may be part of future security guarantees, but I want to understand the broader vision. What awaits Ukraine?' Trump remains noncommittal about any American security guarantees. 'I’m not going to make security guarantees ... very much,' Trump told reporters this week. 'We’re going to have Europe do that.' This is Zelenskyy’s fifth White House visit, but his previous four came during the Biden administration. The Ukrainian president was also set to meet with U.S. senators during his time in Washington. If a truce can be reached, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have agreed to send troops for a potential peacekeeping mission to Ukraine to ensure that fighting between Ukraine and Russia doesn’t flare up again. Both leaders traveled to Washington this week before the Zelenskyy visit to discuss with Trump the potential peacekeeping mission and other concerns about the war. White House officials are skeptical that Britain and France can assemble enough troops from across Europe, at least at this moment, to deploy a credible peacekeeping mission to Kyiv. It will likely take a 'consensual peace settlement' between Russia and Ukraine before many nations would be willing to provide such forces, according to a senior Trump administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House. Zelenskyy and European officials have no illusions about U.S. troops taking part in such a mission. But Starmer and others are trying to make the case that the plan can only work with a U.S. backstop for European forces on the ground — through U.S. aerial intelligence, surveillance and support, as well as rapid-response cover in case the truce is breached. 'You’ve created a moment of tremendous opportunity to reach a historic peace deal — a deal that I think would be celebrated in Ukraine and around the world,' Starmer told Trump. 'That is the prize. But we have to get it right.' Zelenskyy has been vague on exactly what kinds of security guarantees would be suitable for his country, and while he continues to advocate for Ukraine’s eventual membership in NATO, he has also suggested a similar security arrangement would suffice. But Trump on Wednesday said Ukraine 'could forget about' joining the Western military alliance. Still, Zelenskyy’s meeting with Trump, their first since the U.S. leader's inauguration in January, is seen in Kyiv as a diplomatic win for Ukraine. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy said being able to meet personally with Trump before Russian President Vladimir Putin does 'is a good signal.' Zelenskyy said he hopes to discuss whether the U.S. plans to halt its military aid to Ukraine and, if so, whether Kyiv would be able to purchase weapons directly from the U.S. He also wants to know whether Ukraine can use frozen Russian assets for the purchase of weapons and whether Washington plans to lift sanctions on Moscow. Fears that Trump could broker a peace deal with Russia that is unfavorable to Ukraine have been amplified by recent precedent-busting actions by his administration. Trump held a lengthy phone call with Putin, and U.S. officials met with their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia without inviting European or Ukrainian leaders — both dramatic breaks with previous U.S. policy to isolate Putin over his invasion. Trump later seemed to falsely blame Ukraine for starting the war, and called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' for not holding elections after the end of his regular term last year, though Ukrainian law prohibits elections while martial law is in place. As Zelenskyy seeks to lower the temperature with the U.S. while in Washington, American officials are saying the economic deal, if implemented, would itself provide a measure of security to Ukraine through the presence of U.S. investments on its territory. On Wednesday, Trump said the U.S. working on mineral extraction in Ukraine would amount to 'automatic security because nobody’s going to be messing around with our people when we’re there.' 'It’s a great deal for Ukraine too, because they get us over there and we’re going to be working over there,' Trump said. 'We will be on the land.' That perspective is echoed by the text of the economic agreement, which says the U.S. 'supports Ukraine’s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.' Washington, it continues, has 'a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/at-meeting-with-trump-zelenskyy-will-seek-security-assurances-against-future-russian-aggression/	2025-02-28T08:34:03-08:00	
President Trump set to meet with President Zelenskyy	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) – A high-stakes diplomatic meeting is set to take place in Washington Friday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet with President Donald Trump. The visit comes at a crucial moment for Ukraine’s future. President Trump and President Zelenskyy will meet to discuss a critical minerals agreement and ongoing peace negotiations with Russia. 'I think we're going to have a very good meeting,' said Trump. The face-to-face meeting comes after weeks of tension between the two leaders, with President Trump at one point calling Zelenskyy a dictator. 'Did a say that? I can't believe I said that…', said Trump. The two will discuss a deal that would grant the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, a key resource for high-tech industries. The meeting also comes as Ukraine faces growing pressure to negotiate an end to its war with Russia. 'I think we're going to have a very successful peace, and I think it's going to be a long-lasting peace. And, I think it's going to happen hopefully quickly,' said Trump. On Thursday President Trump hosted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer they talked about a resolution to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. The meeting with President Trump and President Zelenskyy is expected to take place at 11am eastern time.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/president-trump-set-to-meet-with-president-zelenskyy/	2025-02-28T04:23:29-08:00

Mourners bury one of the last hostages released from Gaza as talk...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Mourners in Israel on Friday were burying the remains of one of the last hostages released in the first phase of the ceasefire between Hamas militants and Israel, as negotiators discussed a second phase of the deal that could end the war in Gaza and see the remaining live hostages returning home. The funeral procession for Tsachi Idan, an avid soccer fan who was 49 when he was abducted by Hamas militants, began from a football stadium in Tel Aviv towards the cemetery where he was to be buried in a private ceremony. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Idan, who was taken from Kibbutz Nahal Oz during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 2023 attack that sparked the war in Gaza, was killed in captivity. His body was one of four released by Hamas overnight Wednesday to Thursday, in exchange for over 600 Palestinian prisoners, the last planned swap of the ceasefire’s first phase, which began in January. Idan was the only one of his family to have been taken to Gaza. His eldest daughter, Maayan, was killed as militants shot through the door of their saferoom. Hamas militants broadcast themselves on Facebook live holding the Idan family hostage in their home, as his two younger children pleaded with the militants to let them go. 'My brother is the real hero. He held on,' Idan’s sister, Noam Idan ben Ezra, said in an interview on Israeli radio Friday. She said Idan had been 'a pace away' from being released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023, when more than 100 of the 251 people abducted on Oct. 7 were released. 'Tsachi was forsaken twice. The first time when he was kidnapped from his home and the second time when the deal blew up,' she added. 'The fact that Tsachi is not standing next to me today is the outcome of the decision-making and the policy here in Israel. They did not listen to us then, but it’s not too late to listen to us today.' Concern for remaining hostages The relatives of hostages still held in Gaza are ramping up pressure on Netanyahu to secure the release of their loved ones. According to Israel, 32 of the 59 hostages still in Gaza are dead, and there has been growing concern about the welfare of an unknown number who are still alive, particularly after three hostages who were released Feb. 8 emerged emaciated from captivity. One of the three, Eli Sharabi, said in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12 Friday that he and other hostages had been held in iron chains, starved and sometimes beaten or humiliated. 'During the first three days, my hands are tied behind my back, my legs are tied, with ropes that tear into your flesh, and a bit of food, a bit of water during the day,' he said, in one of the first interviews by a hostage released under the current deal. 'I remember not being able to fall asleep because of the pain, the ropes are already digging into your flesh, and every movement makes you want to scream.' Sharabi only found out after his release that his wife and daughters had been killed during the Oct. 7 attack. The next phase of the ceasefire Under the terms of the truce Israel and Hamas agreed to, Phase 2 of the ceasefire is meant to involve negotiations on ending the war that has devastated the Gaza Strip. That includes the return of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from the Palestinian territory. The return of the bodies of the remaining deceased hostages would occur in Phase 3. Officials from Israel, Qatar and the United States have started 'intensive discussions' on the ceasefire’s second phase in Cairo, Egypt‘s state information service said Thursday. Netanyahu's office confirmed he had sent a delegation to Cairo. 'The mediators are also discussing ways to enhance the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as part of efforts to alleviate the suffering of the population and support stability in the region,' its statement said. The first phase of the ceasefire saw 33 hostages, including eight bodies, released in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Netanyahu has vowed to return all the hostages and destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas, which remains in control of Gaza. The Trump administration has endorsed both goals. But it’s unclear how Israel would destroy Hamas without resuming the war, and Hamas is unlikely to release the remaining hostages — its main bargaining chips — without a lasting ceasefire. After suffering heavy losses in the war, the militant group has nonetheless emerged intact, and says it will not give up its weapons. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of war that erupted after Hamas’ 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say over half the dead have been women and children. The fighting displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s population and decimated the territory’s infrastructure and health system. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-mourners-bury-one-of-the-last-hostages-released-from-gaza-as-talks-start-for-ceasefire-future/	2025-02-28T03:55:31-08:00	
Tens of thousands of Palestinians seek shelter after Israeli assa...	JENIN, West Bank (AP) — When Israeli snipers took positions in her neighborhood, Haleemeh Zawaydeh knew her family needed to leave quickly. As the snipers' gunfire rang out, the 63-year-old matriarch said there was no time to pack as she and 14 other family members fled on foot. The invasion of Jenin was faster than past Israeli assaults, she said. And, now, like some 37,000 other Palestinians the U.N. estimates have been driven out by a month-old offensive against militant groups in the occupied West Bank, Zawaydeh and her family are waiting to return to the place they’ve long called home. But it's unclear if Israel will let them. Israel’s assault has mostly emptied four refugee camps — sites that originated to house Palestinians driven from homes in the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation and have since grown into densely built up towns or neighborhoods. Across the four camps, troops have ripped up roads and destroyed buildings, infrastructure, and water and electricity lines. The Israeli defense minister said Monday that troops were preparing to stay for a year and would prevent Palestinians from returning. That leaves thousands who hail from among the poorest areas of the West Bank in dire straits as many are forced to rent temporary housing in neighboring villages. OCHA, the U.N.’s humanitarian agency, said there is an 'urgent need for cash assistance' for 4,000 families to meet rent needs. Zawaydeh said she was safe now at her shelter outside Jenin, but not at ease. 'I was born and raised in the camp, and now I have grown up and I still live in the camp,' she said. 'There is no place that can replace the camp.' The displacement is the biggest since the 1967 war Many Palestinians displaced from their West Bank homes are renting temporary housing or relying on friends or family to take them in. Some are staying in university dorms, others in makeshift shelters. Help is limited: The Palestinian Authority is strapped for cash, and the main U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known by the acronym UNRWA, has been handicapped by Israeli legislation. 'The West Bank has never seen large-scale forced displacement of the level we’re seeing now' since 1967, said Roland Friedrich, the West Bank field director for UNRWA. During the 1967 Mideast War, some 250,000 Palestinians were forced from the West Bank when Israel seized the territory along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. After announcing a widespread crackdown against West Bank militants on Jan. 21 — just two days after it began a ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza — Israeli forces descended on Jenin camp, as they have dozens of times since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. But unlike past operations, Israeli forces also pushed deeper and more forcefully into several other nearby camps known as bastions of militant groups, including Tulkarem, Far’a and Nur Shams. Israel's military says it has engaged in fierce battles with Palestinian militants inside the camps, which are now mainly emptied of their civilian populations. The dispersals are stirring bitter memories of the 1948 war over Israel’s creation, when some 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from or fled their homes in what's now Israel. Forcible population transfers are banned under international law, and, if implemented as a policy, could be a war crime, rights groups say. The emptying of the West Bank camps comes as Israel’s government and military have embraced U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for pushing out the population of the Gaza Strip permanently. Troops have demolished homes in the camps In Nur Shams, a smaller refugee camp with a population of roughly 13,700, a number of displaced people returned Wednesday to clear what possessions they could from their homes after learning the Israeli military had slated them for demolition. Palestinians said the military puts out maps of intended demolitions in the camps. Asked the reasons for the demolitions, the military said it could not discuss operational plans. Mohammed Abdullah took advantage of the brief access to visit the grave of his son, Ali, who he said was killed by Israeli troops during a previous incursion into the camp. He hadn’t been able to visit since being forced out two weeks ago. Abdullah then packed up his family’s things from his home. No one can take everything, he said. 'Every person has memories in his home, in his neighborhood, in the streets.' The damage to the camps has been extensive. In Jenin camp, troops have demolished over 100 homes, Friedrich said. In Tulkarem camp, they have destroyed about 100 housing units and at least 300 commercial shops and set fire to at least 10 homes, according to the local Awda community center. Families have scattered among shelters At a charity for helping the blind in Jenin, converted into a shelter for those driven from the camp, barefoot children swung from monkey bars while their parents smoked cigarettes and looked on. Some 85 people from 23 families have taken up at the shelter. Rooms have been turned into separate dorms for men and women and children. Some have beds, others have mats on the floor. The charity relies on donations to feed its new residents. Facing mounting financial pressure and worried for their homes, many families have tried to return to the camps only to be blocked by the military. 'Every day, we try to go back to the camp, hoping to enter, but they prevent us,' said Nazmi Turkman, 53, who fled Jenin camp a month ago. 'They’ve set up checkpoints, placed tanks, and stationed soldiers. Even drones are flying around the people.' 'God willing, we will return soon,' he said. But he said he has no idea if his home still stands. There are few resources to help the displaced The Palestinian Authority, the body charged with administering affairs in pockets of the West Bank where the camps lie, has denounced the wave of displacement. It says it has dispatched over 16 trucks of aid and sent funds to first responders. But its ability to help is limited. It has been left cash-strapped by the war, with Israel for months holding up tax revenues it needs to pay its workers. It is also largely detested across the territory, especially in the refugee camps, where it is seen as a tool of Israeli authorities. 'What is happening in the West Bank is a continuation of what the Israeli authorities did in the Gaza Strip,' said Nabil Abu Redeineh, spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. 'What is happening will only lead to escalation, the repercussions of which will be felt throughout the region.' UNRWA, too, is hampered. In the past, it could coordinate evacuations with the Israeli military. But new Israeli laws ban any interaction between Israeli authorities and the agency, making it difficult to evacuate people or ascertain when they will be allowed back, Friedrich said. On Tuesday, a small group of displaced men gathered outside Tulkarem camp, holding signs reading 'The right of return is sacred – No to displacement.' Nihad al-Shaweesh, head of a local political council for Nur Shams camp, said they were there to 'tell the whole world and all parties that we will not accept displacement.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-tens-of-thousands-of-palestinians-seek-shelter-after-israeli-assaults-across-the-west-bank/	2025-02-27T21:13:58-08:00	
Trump on calling Zelensky a dictator: 'Did I say that?'	President Trump on Thursday backtracked on his recent sharp criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as the U.S. aims to strike a deal to end the war between Kyiv and Moscow. Trump, during an Oval Office meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, tempered his comments about Zelensky, including a social media post last week in which Trump called Zelensky a 'dictator with elections.' When asked by a reporter whether he still believed Zelensky was a dictator, Trump responded: 'Did I say that? I can’t believe I said that. Next question.' 'We want to work with him, President Zelensky … and we will work with him,' Trump said. 'I think the president and I actually have had a very good relationship. It maybe got a little bit testy because we wanted to have a little bit of what the European nations had.' Trump has repeatedly claimed European aid for Ukraine was in the form of a loan, while the U.S. provided aid that it would not recoup. Starmer, like French President Emmanuel Macron did alongside Trump on Monday, interjected to note that much of Europe's assistance for Ukraine was a 'gift.' Trump has in recent days become increasingly critical of Zelensky as U.S. officials pushed for a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Trump last week raised eyebrows when he called Zelensky a 'dictator without elections,' claimed he was doing a 'terrible job' and suggested he was responsible for the start of the war. At one point, Trump said he did not think it was important for Zelensky to be part of meetings on peace negotiations because the Ukrainian leader 'has no cards.' Monday marked three years since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February after amassing troops on the border and demanding a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO. The invasion took place nearly a decade after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Zelensky is slated to visit the White House on Friday as the two countries finalize an agreement that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine’s critical minerals supply. Proponents of the deal have suggested the economic partnership would give the U.S. a vested interest in protecting Ukraine against future threats from Russia. Trump campaigned on ending the war in Ukraine, and he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month in an effort to kickstart ceasefire talks. Trump said Ukraine joining NATO was 'not gonna happen.' Asked Thursday whether he thought he could trust Putin, Trump said he thought the Russian leader would keep his word. 'Trust and verify, let's call it that. … You have to verify, because you never know what’s going to happen. I know a lot of people you’d say, ‘No chance that they would ever deceive you,’ and they’re the worst people in the world,' Trump told reporters. 'You never know what you're getting,' he added. 'No, I have confidence that if we make a deal, it's going to hold.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/trump-on-calling-zelensky-a-dictator-did-i-say-that/	2025-02-27T11:21:24-08:00	
Israel's army admits failures on Oct. 7. Its probe of the attack ...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — An investigation by the Israeli military has determined that Hamas was able to carry out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, because the much more powerful Israeli army misjudged the militant group’s intentions and underestimated its capabilities. The findings, released Thursday, could pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the attack, which triggered the war in Gaza. Many Israelis believe the mistakes of Oct. 7 extend beyond the military, and they blame Netanyahu for what they view as a failed strategy of deterrence and containment in the years leading up to the attack. That strategy included allowing Qatar to send suitcases of cash into Gaza and sidelining Hamas' rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The prime minister has not taken responsibility, saying he will answer tough questions only after the war, which has been paused for nearly six weeks by a tenuous ceasefire. Despite public pressure, including from the families of the roughly 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack and the 251 taken as hostages into Gaza, Netanyahu has resisted calls for a commission of inquiry. The military's main findings were that the region’s most powerful and sophisticated military misread Hamas’ intentions, underestimated its capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack by thousands of heavily armed militants in the early morning hours of a major Jewish holiday. The military’s findings are in line with past conclusions reached by officials and analysts. The military released only a summary of the report and military officials outlined its findings. 'Oct. 7 was a complete failure,' said one military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. A central misconception was that Hamas, which seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, was more interested in governing the territory than fighting Israel, the inquiry found. The military also misjudged the militant group’s capabilities. Military planners had envisioned that, at worst, Hamas could stage a ground invasion from up to eight border points, the official said. In fact, Hamas had more than 60 attack routes. Intelligence assessed in the aftermath of the attack has shown Hamas came close to staging the offensive on three earlier occasions but delayed it for unknown reasons, the official said. The official said that in the hours before the attack, there were signs that something was amiss, including when Hamas fighters switched their phones over to the Israeli network. The perception that Hamas did not want war guided decision makers away from taking action that might have thwarted the attack. The Israeli military official said intelligence shows that Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack who was killed last October, had begun planning it as early as 2017. With the military off guard on a holiday weekend, Hamas launched a heavy wave of rockets that allowed thousands of fighters to burst through the security fence or fly over it on hang gliders. They knocked out surveillance cameras and quickly overwhelmed hundreds of soldiers stationed along the border. From there they advanced to key highway intersections and attacked troops dispatched to the area, including some senior officers, disrupting the military’s command and control, according to a second military official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. For the first three hours after the attack, Hamas fighters marauded through border communities and a music festival with little resistance. That was when most of the 251 hostages were taken and most people were killed, the official said. The official said the chaos led to friendly fire incidents, although he said there were not many, without disclosing a figure. It took hours for the military to regain control and days until the area was fully cleared of militants. According to the first official, the report blamed the military for being overconfident in its knowledge and not showing enough doubt in its core concepts and beliefs. It did not place blame on any individual soldiers or officers, but is likely to pave the way for a reckoning in the military and eventual dismissals. Some high-ranking officers have already resigned, including the former head of military intelligence and Israel’s top general, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who steps down next week.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israels-army-admits-failures-on-oct-7-its-probe-of-the-attack-could-put-pressure-on-netanyahu/	2025-02-27T09:25:38-08:00	
Israeli official says the army won't withdraw from a Gaza corrido...	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel will not withdraw from a strategic corridor in the Gaza Strip as called for by the ceasefire, an official said Thursday. Israel’s refusal could spark a crisis with Hamas and key mediator Egypt at a sensitive moment for the fragile truce. Hours earlier, Hamas released the remains of four hostages in exchange for over 600 Palestinian prisoners, the last planned swap of the ceasefire’s first phase, which ends this weekend. Talks over the second and more difficult stage have yet to begin. Much could hinge on a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, who is expected in the region in the coming days. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile said in a brief statement that he was sending negotiators to Cairo, without providing further details. ‘Blatant violation’ The Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said the army needed to remain in the so-called Philadelphi corridor, on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, to prevent weapons smuggling. Separately, Defense Minister Israel Katz said at a meeting with local leaders that he had seen tunnels penetrating the border on a recent visit to the corridor, without providing evidence or elaborating on Israel's plans. Egypt says it destroyed the smuggling tunnels from its side years ago and set up a military buffer zone to halt smuggling. Hamas said any Israeli attempt to maintain a buffer zone in the corridor would be a 'blatant violation' of the ceasefire agreement. The militant group says that sticking to the agreement is the only way for Israel to secure the release of dozens of hostages still held in Gaza. Israel is supposed to begin withdrawing from the Philadelphi corridor on Saturday, the last day of the first phase, and complete it within eight days. There was no immediate comment from Egypt, which is opposed to any Israeli presence on the Gaza side of its border. Remains of 4 hostages identified The remains released Thursday were confirmed to be those of Ohad Yahalomi, Itzhak Elgarat, Shlomo Mantzur and Tsachi Idan, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents families of the captives. Mantzur, 85, was killed in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, and his body was taken into the territory. Israel said the other three were killed in captivity, without elaborating. 'Our hearts ache upon receiving the bitter news,' Israeli President Isaac Herzog said. 'In this painful moment, there is some solace in knowing that they will be laid to rest in dignity in Israel.' French President Emmanuel Macron said he shared the 'immense pain' of the family and loved ones of Yahalomi, who had French citizenship. Hamas confirmed that over 600 prisoners had been released overnight. Most were detainees returned to Gaza, where they had been rounded up after the Oct. 7 attack and held without charge on security suspicions. Joyful return for released prisoners Some of the released prisoners fell to their knees in gratitude after disembarking from buses in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. In the West Bank town of Beitunia, dozens of prisoners were welcomed by crowds of relatives and well-wishers. The released prisoners wore shirts issued by the Israeli prison service bearing a message in Arabic about pursuing one's enemies. Some of the prisoners threw the shirts on the ground or set them on fire. Israel delayed the release of the prisoners on Saturday over Hamas' practice of parading hostages before crowds and cameras during their release. Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have called the ceremonies humiliating for the hostages. Hamas released the four bodies to the Red Cross in Gaza overnight without a public ceremony. The prisoners released Thursday included 445 men, 21 teenagers and one woman, according to lists shared by Palestinian officials that did not specify their ages. Only around 50 Palestinians were released into the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem in this round, while dozens sentenced to life over deadly attacks against Israelis were exiled. Truce in peril The latest handover was the final one planned under the ceasefire’s first six-week phase, which expires this weekend. Hamas has returned 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Trump's envoy, Witkoff, has said he wants the sides to move into negotiations on the second phase. Those talks were supposed to begin the first week of February. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to return all the hostages and destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas, which remains in control of Gaza. The Trump administration has endorsed both goals. But it's unclear how Israel would destroy Hamas without resuming the war, and Hamas is unlikely to release the remaining hostages — its main bargaining chips — without a lasting ceasefire. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of war that erupted after Hamas’ 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. About 250 people were taken hostage. If the identities of the four bodies are confirmed, then 59 captives will remain in Gaza, 32 of whom are believed to be dead. Nearly 150 have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals, while dozens of bodies have been recovered by Israeli forces and eight captives have been rescued alive. Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, who don't differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say over half the dead have been women and children. The fighting displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s population and decimated the territory’s infrastructure and health system. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip and Melzer from Nahariya, Israel.

Israel's refusal to withdraw from this narrow strip of desert cou...	Israel's refusal to withdraw from a narrow strip of desert on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, as called for in the ceasefire with Hamas, could further threaten the fragile truce. An Israeli official said Thursday that Israeli forces would remain in the so-called Philadelphi corridor to prevent weapons smuggling. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. Under the ceasefire agreement reached last month, Israel was to begin withdrawing on Saturday and complete the pullout within eight days. Hamas said any attempt to preserve the corridor as a buffer zone would be a 'blatant violation' of the ceasefire agreement. There was no immediate comment from Egypt, a key mediator that is also opposed to any Israeli presence on the Gaza side of the border. Saturday is also the final day of the first phase of the ceasefire. Negotiations have yet to begin on the second and more difficult phase, in which Hamas is to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting truce. The war could resume if an agreement is not reached. Here's a look at the Philadelphi corridor and why it las long been a source of tension. What is the Philadelphi corridor and why does Israel want it? The Philadelphi corridor is an empty strip — only 100 meters (yards) wide in some places — that runs the 14-kilometer (8.6-mile) length of Gaza's border with Egypt. It includes the Rafah crossing, which was Gaza’s only outlet to the outside world not controlled by Israel until the Israeli army captured the entire corridor last May. At a September news conference, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas had been using tunnels under the border to import arms and was trying to rebuild the military machine it unleashed on Israel in its Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war. However, Israeli media reported in September that the tunnels had not been used for years. Israel’s Haaretz news outlet, citing military officials, said Israeli troops had found nine tunnels running under the Philadelphi corridor, all sealed from the Egyptian side since Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi came to power in 2013 and launched a campaign to destroy tunnels. It said the army believes most weapons in Gaza were produced locally, using some materials smuggled through the Rafah crossing and the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing, which is controlled by Israel. that the tunnels had not been used for years. Israel’s Haaretz news outlet, citing military officials, said Israeli troops had found nine tunnels running under the Philadelphi corridor, all sealed from the Egyptian side since Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi came to power in 2013 and launched a campaign to destroy tunnels. It said the army believes most weapons in Gaza were produced locally, some using materials smuggled through the Rafah crossing and the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing, which is controlled by Israel. On Thursday. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he had seen unblocked tunnels between Gaza and Egypt during a recent visit to the corridor, without providing evidence. Egypt has denied the Israeli allegations, saying it destroyed hundreds of tunnels on its side of the border years ago and set up a military buffer zone that prevents smuggling. How does the corridor figure into the ceasefire? In January, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and the phased release of hostages, pausing 15 months of war. Under the first phase, Hamas has freed 25 living Israeli hostages and returned the bodies of eight more, in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israeli forces have pulled back from most areas and there has been a surge in humanitarian aid. In the second phase, Hamas was to release the rest of the living hostages in exchange for more prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal and a lasting ceasefire. The third phase would see the exchange of remains and the start of Gaza's daunting reconstruction. Negotiations over the second phase were supposed to begin in early February, but so far only limited preparatory talks have been held. Netanyahu says he remains committed to bringing back all the hostages and destroying the military and governing capabilities of Hamas. Those aims are likely incompatible, however, as Hamas still rules Gaza and has ordered its fighters to kill hostages if their rescue appears imminent. The Trump administration has fully endorsed Israel's war goals, but Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff says he hopes to reach the second phase of the ceasefire. He is expected to visit the region in the coming days. What would a lasting Israeli presence mean? Hamas is adamantly opposed to any lasting Israeli presence inside Gaza, which would be widely seen as a military occupation. Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, territories the Palestinians want for their own state. It withdrew soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but continued to control the territory’s airspace, its coastline and all of its border crossings except Rafah. An Israeli decision to stay in the corridor could also further strain relations with Egypt, an American ally that has served as a key mediator with Hamas. Egypt has warned that it could undermine its nearly half century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region. The United States has not taken a position on control of the corridor, and U.S. President Donald Trump has not said how it might figure into his proposal for Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians to be relocated to other countries so the U.S. can redevelop the territory as a tourist destination. ___ Associated Press writers Samy Magdy in Cairo and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israels-refusal-to-withdraw-from-this-narrow-strip-of-desert-could-threaten-the-gaza-ceasefire/	2025-02-27T04:28:23-08:00	
North Korea appears to have sent more troops to Russia to back it...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s spy agency said Thursday that North Korea appears to have sent additional troops to Russia, after its soldiers deployed on the Russian-Ukraine fronts suffered heavy casualties. The National Intelligence Service said in a brief statement it was trying to determine exactly how many more troops North Korea has deployed to Russia. The NIS also assessed that North Korean troops were redeployed at fronts in Russia’s Kursk region in the first week of February, following a reported temporary withdrawal from the area. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an address on Feb. 7, confirmed a new Ukrainian offensive in Kursk and said North Korean troops were fighting alongside Russian forces there. North Korea has been supplying a vast amount of conventional weapons to Russia, and last fall it sent about 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia as well, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukraine intelligence officials. North Korean soldiers are highly disciplined and well trained, but observers say they’ve become easy targets for drone and artillery attacks on Russian-Ukraine battlefields due to their lack of combat experience and unfamiliarity with the terrain. In January, the NIS said about 300 North Korean soldiers had died and another 2,700 had been injured. Zelenskyy earlier put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 4,000, though U.S. estimates were lower at around 1,200. Earlier Thursday, South Korea’s JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, citing unidentified sources, reported that an additional 1,000-3,000 North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk between January and February. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners worry that Russia could reward North Korea by transferring high-tech weapons technologies that can sharply enhance its nuclear weapons program. North Korea is expected to receive economic and other assistance from Russia as well. During talks in Saudi Arabia last week, Russia and the U.S. agreed to start working toward ending the war and improving their diplomatic and economic ties. Ukrainian officials weren’t present at the talks. That marked an extraordinary shift in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump and a clear departure from U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia over its war in Ukraine. Observers say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could send more troops to Russia to win further Russian assistance before the war ends. ___ This story has been edited to reflect that the NIS statement was released on Thursday, not Wednesday.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-north-korea-appears-to-have-sent-more-troops-to-russia-to-back-its-war-against-ukraine-seoul-says/	2025-02-27T02:25:04-08:00	
Why the Trump administration may want Ukraine's minerals	DETROIT (AP) — The United States will have access to Ukraine's critical mineral wealth, including key ingredients for the clean energy transition, under a deal the two countries are expected to sign later this week. President Donald Trump, who has pushed for the agreement, has long been critical of a transition to green energies, which include wind and solar power, along with electrification of transportation and appliances, all things that require the various minerals the U.S. will have access to in this deal. So if Trump is against this trend, why go after these minerals? The quick answer could be they're used in a lot of other things, too. Here's a closer look: Ukraine's mineral wealth Countries vary in which minerals they deem strategically critical. The U.S. Department of the Interior has designated 50, and Ukraine has more than 20 of those. Deposits of titanium, which is in high demand, are spread across the country. Titanium is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, for marine uses, chemical processing and medical devices. Ukraine has lithium, key to several current battery technologies, and it has uranium, used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. The country also has graphite and manganese, both used in batteries for electric vehicles. Still, the data on Ukraine's geology is incomplete, according to Tom Moerenhout, adjunct associate professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. The maps date back to when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, which dissolved in 1991. So it's not clear how easy or profitable it will be to get the desired materials out of the ground. 'It’s one thing to have a deal that talks about how might we manage their extraction and their revenue,' Moerenhout said of the agreement. 'It’s another thing entirely to actually have extractive projects, to actually have mining operations going on, and that is something that the deal does not guarantee.' Some of the mineral riches lie in parts of the country currently occupied by Russia. Ukraine's rare earth metals Rare earths are a subset of critical minerals; there are 17 of them, and not one is a common word. For example, ytterbium and promethium are rare earths. Rare earths are important for many kinds of technology and electronics, including medical care, military, aerospace as well as clean energy uses. Ytterbium is used in infrared lasers, chemical reactions, rechargeable batteries and fiber optics. Lanthanum is used in batteries, specialty glass for eyeglasses and and camera lenses and in petroleum refining. A single piece of military equipment can require hundreds of pounds of a rare earth. Contrary to their name, rare earths are not necessarily rare. However, they do often occur in low concentrations, making processing complicated. It's mainly China that excels at this processing currently. Geopolitical reasons for interest in Ukraine's supply The Trump administration has steered clear of clean energy policy in favor of its 'energy dominance' agenda, focused on oil and gas. As promised during his campaign, the president's early executive orders slashed support for climate- and clean-energy related technologies, funding and programs. Electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar photovoltaic panels and other clean energy technology require the rare earths for components such as magnets and batteries; broadly, renewable energy and decarbonization are placing high demand on minerals across the globe. But clearly, the uses of the minerals Ukraine has go far beyond the energy transition. And Ukraine has tried hard to interest the new administration in its mineral wealth. Also, China controls much of the world's supply of these materials. Opening access to Ukraine’s supply could reduce U.S. dependence elsewhere. 'To the credit of the first Trump administration, they have always put critical minerals as a very important policy priority because they knew they were so heavily reliant on China,' Moerenhout said. 'That priority for the Trump administration doesn’t change at all because they are less, let’s say, less aggressive about clean energy deployment targets in the future.' ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

Trump shares AI video envisioning Gaza development with gold stat...	(The Hill) - President Trump on Tuesday evening shared a video using artificial intelligence (AI) that showcases his proposals for the potential development of the war-torn Gaza Strip, complete with a golden statue of his likeness and beachfront skyscrapers rising from the rubble. The 33-second video, which the president shared on Truth Social, starts with a shot of the city in ruins after the Israeli military's 15-month bombardment campaign. Text on the screen then reads 'Gaza 2025 — What’s next.' The AI footage then pans to a scene of presumably tech billionaire and senior advisor Elon Musk enjoying a meal and laughing, as the sun shines and people dance around him. 'No more tunnels, no more fear,' the voice in the video sings. 'Trump Gaza is finally here. Trump Gaza shining bright, golden future, brand new light.' The video also features children holding gold balloons also made to look like Trump and a renovated beachfront with luxury hotels and money flying in the air. It also shows a shot of a 'Trump Gaza' building and toward the end, the U.S. president and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seem to be enjoying drinks in the sun, shirtless. The AI film comes as Trump has doubled down in recent weeks on a plan for the U.S. to take responsibility for the enclave, currently controlled by Palestinian militant group Hamas. The president has proposed turning the Strip into a 'Riviera of the Middle East.' He has also suggested that Palestinians in be permanently relocated after the war between Israel and Hamas is over. The plan invited a bevy of criticism from Arab American and Muslim leaders, heads of Western countries and leaders of nations in the Middle East. During an interview on Fox News, Trump also suggested that Palestinians would not have the right to return to Gaza. 'In other words, I’m talking about building a permanent place for them, because if they have to return now, it’ll be years before you could ever — it’s not habitable,' Trump said during the interview earlier this month. 'It would be years before it could happen.' Israel and Hamas are currently under a fragile ceasefire agreement, which brought an end to the conflict that began on Oct. 7, 2023. The second phase of the deal is expected to begin soon after the remaining hostages and Palestinian prisoners are exchanged.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/trump-shares-ai-video-envisioning-gaza-development-with-gold-statue-of-himself/	2025-02-26T05:55:37-08:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy says framework economic deal with US is ready	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Wednesday that Ukraine and the United States have reached preliminary agreement on a broad economic deal that includes U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals amid its three-year war with Russia. After days of negotiations, Ukraine and the U.S. will sign the preliminary agreement but with further details of a full agreement — including U.S. security guarantees that Kyiv officials view as vital — still to be worked out, Shmyhal said on Ukrainian public television. Since returning to office last month, U.S. President Donald Trump let Ukraine know he wanted something in return for tens of billions of dollars in U.S. help to fend off Russia’s invasion. Trump has abruptly ditched some previous Washington policies. He scrapped efforts to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin and cast doubt on U.S. support for its European allies. That has brought momentous geopolitical shifts that could reset the war’s path this year. The preliminary agreement sets out the terms and conditions of an investment fund for the rebuilding of Ukraine, Shmyhal said. The agreement could be signed as early as Friday and plans are being drawn up for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to travel to Washington to meet Trump, officials have said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-and-ukraine-have-agreed-on-a-preliminary-economic-deal-ukraines-prime-minister-says/	2025-02-26T05:37:45-08:00	
Hamas will turn over bodies of 4 Israeli hostages in exchange for...	CAIRO (AP) — Hamas will return the bodies of four dead Israeli hostages on Thursday in exchange for Israel's release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the group said, just days before the first phase of the ceasefire between the warring parties was to expire. Israel has delayed the release of about 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it says is the cruel treatment of hostages during their release by Hamas. The militant group has said that the delay is a 'serious violation' of their ceasefire and that talks on a second phase aren't possible until the Palestinians are freed. Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Hamas would hand over the bodies of four Israelis the next day. In exchange, Israel would release the Palestinian prisoners, as well as an unspecified number of women and minors detained since the militant group's Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the conflict. An Israeli official confirmed that the bodies of four hostages were expected to be turned over but provided no further details. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak with the media. Israel and Hamas had already said on Tuesday that an agreement had been reached to return the bodies of the hostages, but no date had been announced. Hamas has released hostages, and the bodies of four dead hostages, in large public ceremonies during which the Israelis were paraded and forced to wave to large crowds. Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have said the ceremonies were humiliating to the hostages, and Israel last weekend delayed the scheduled prisoner release in protest. There will be no public ceremony when the four bodies in the latest exchange are returned to Israel in the early hours of Thursday, according to a senior Hamas official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak with the media. A fragile ceasefire in peril The deadlock over the exchange had threatened to collapse the ceasefire when the current six-week first phase of the deal expires this weekend. The latest agreement would complete both sides’ obligations of the first phase of the ceasefire — during which Hamas is returning 33 hostages, including eight bodies — in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. It also could clear the way for an expected visit this week by U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region. Witkoff has said that he wants the sides to move into negotiations on the second phase, during which all remaining hostages held by Hamas are to be released and an end to the war is to be negotiated. The Phase 2 talks were supposed to begin weeks ago, but never did. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of heavy fighting that erupted after Hamas’ 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. About 250 people were taken hostage. Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s population and decimated the territory’s infrastructure and health system. The Hamas-run Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but it says that over half of the dead have been women and children. Another infant in Gaza dies of hypothermia With people are living in tent camps and damaged buildings in the Gaza Strip, health officials said another infant had died of hypothermia Wednesday, bringing the toll to seven over the past two weeks. Dr. Munir al-Boursh, director general of Gaza’s Health Ministry, said a baby less than two months old died due to the 'severe cold wave' that has hit the Palestinian enclave. Temperatures have been below 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) at night and the last few days have been particularly cold. ___ Lidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Israel and Hamas agree on new exchange, leaving fragile ceasefire...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli and Hamas officials said Tuesday they have reached an agreement to exchange the bodies of dead hostages for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, keeping their fragile ceasefire intact for at least a few more days. Israel has delayed the release of 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it says is the cruel treatment of hostages during their release by Hamas. The militant group has said the delay is a 'serious violation' of their ceasefire and that talks on a second phase are not possible until they are freed. The deadlock had threatened to collapse the ceasefire when the current six-week first phase of the deal expires this weekend. But late Tuesday, Hamas said an agreement had been reached to resolve the dispute during a visit to Cairo by a delegation headed by Khalil al-Hayya, a top political official in the group. The breakthrough appeared to clear the way for the return of the bodies of four more dead hostages and hundreds of additional prisoners scheduled to be released under the ceasefire. The prisoners previously slated for release 'will be released simultaneously with the bodies of the Israeli prisoners who were agreed to be handed over,' along with the release of a new set of Palestinian prisoners, the Hamas statement said. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed an agreement to bring home the bodies in the coming days. He gave no further details. But Israeli media reports said the exchange could take place as soon as Wednesday. The Ynet news site said the Israeli bodies would be handed over to Egyptian authorities without any public ceremony. Hamas has released hostages, and the bodies of four dead hostages, in large public ceremonies during which the Israelis were paraded and forced to wave to large crowds.

Middle East latest: Hamas official says no further talks with Isr...	A Hamas official says Israel’s delay in the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners is a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire agreement and talks on a second phase of the accord are not possible until they are returned. As part of the agreement, Israel was supposed to release the prisoners last weekend after Hamas freed hostages from its Oct. 7, 2023, attack. But Israel delayed the release over the treatment of the captives, who were paraded before crowds. In a written statement, Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said the militant group had 'fully adhered to all provisions of the agreements' and that Israel’s delay 'puts the agreement at risk of collapse, potentially leading to a resumption of war.' Here's the latest: Hamas official says Israel's delay in releasing prisoners puts ceasefire at risk A Hamas official says Israel’s delay in the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners constitutes a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire agreement, and suggested that talks on a second phase of the accord are not possible until they are returned.

The first phase of the ceasefire is due to end Saturday, and while negotiations on a second phase were to have started weeks ago, they have not yet begun. A U.S. diplomat is returning to the region this week with the hope of extending the first phase to buy time for further negotiations, but Naim suggested Hamas was unwilling to talk until the prisoners were released. At least 6 infants have died from hypothermia in the Gaza Strip Palestinian medics say at least six infants have died from hypothermia in the last two weeks in the Gaza Strip. A fragile ceasefire that took hold last month paused 15 months of war between Israel and the Hamas militant group. But hundreds of thousands of people are still living in squalid tent camps or bombed-out buildings with little shelter from the cold, and temperatures have plunged in recent days. Dr. Ahmed al-Farah, head of the pediatric department at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told The Associated Press that it received the body of a 2-month-old girl on Tuesday. He said another two infants were treated for frostbite, with one of them discharged. Saeed Saleh, of the Patient’s Friends Hospital in Gaza City, said five infants aged one month or younger have died from the cold over the last two weeks. Zaher al-Wahedi, head of the Gaza Health Ministry’s records department, said it has recorded 15 deaths from hypothermia this winter. The territory on the Mediterranean coast experiences cold and wet winters, with temperatures dropping below 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) at night. Freed Israeli hostage says faith kept her going through Gaza captivity Agam Berger, a former hostage released by Hamas, said it was her Jewish faith that sustained her during her 16-month ordeal in the Gaza Strip. Berger was a military spotter who was captured during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. Berger told Israeli public radio Reshet Bet on Tuesday that she was held in tunnels and apartments with other female captives. She was given two meals a day, pita and rice, and had some access to media. In January 2024, Berger said her captors brought her and other hostages two Jewish prayer books, as well as other objects left behind by Israeli soldiers, such as a newspaper and military maps. She said around the first Hanukkah she spent in captivity in December 2023, in a tunnel with four other hostages, they asked their captors for candles to mark the holiday, and they brought them one. Lebanon's prime minister says only armed forces can defend the nation Lebanon’s new prime minister has read his government policy statement stating that only the country’s armed forces should defend the nation in case of war. Nawaf Salam was picked to form a new government last month after a devastating war between Israel and Hezbollah that killed over 4,000 people and caused widespread destruction. Hezbollah has kept its weapons over the past decades saying it is necessary to defend Lebanon against Israel. But many in Lebanon have been calling on the group to disarm, and such calls intensified during the latest war that stopped when a U.S.-brokered ceasefire went into effect on Nov. 27. Salam said Tuesday that the government asserts that Lebanon has the right to defend itself in case of 'aggression' and only the state has the right to have weapons. He also said that the government takes measures to liberate land occupied by Israel 'through its forces only.' Trump administration's suspension of funds to WHO freezes $46 million for Gaza A Trump administration move to suspend funding to the World Health Organization has frozen $46 million for its operations in Gaza, a top WHO official in the region said Tuesday. Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO representative for Occupied Palestinian Territories, said the 'freezing' would leave six areas underfunded, including EMT operations, rehabilitation of health facilities, coordination with partner organizations, and medical evacuation operations. Speaking from Gaza to reporters a U.N. briefing in Geneva, Peeperkorn said money for such operations remained in WHO’s funding pipeline and 'we’re still going full steam ahead' with activities. Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman, said he did not have figures about how the U.S. funding cuts affected the entirety of its operations worldwide.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-hamas-official-says-no-further-talks-with-israel-until-prisoners-are-freed/	2025-02-25T05:21:53-08:00	
Desperation grows in northern Gaza as Palestinians struggle to re...	BEIT LAHIYA, Gaza Strip (AP) — When night falls over northern Gaza, much of the cityscape of collapsed buildings and piled wreckage turns pitch black. Living inside the ruins of their home, Rawia Tambora’s young sons get afraid of the dark, so she turns on a flashlight and her phone’s light to comfort them, for as long as the batteries last. Displaced for most of the 16-month-long war, Tambora is back in her house. But it is still a frustrating shell of a life, she says: There is no running water, electricity, heat or services, and no tools to clear the rubble around them. Nearly 600,000 Palestinians flooded back into northern Gaza under the now month-old ceasefire in Gaza, according to the United Nations. After initial relief and joy at being back at their homes — even if damaged or destroyed — they now face the reality of living in the wreckage for the foreseeable future. 'Some people wish the war had never ended, feeling it would have been better to be killed,' Tambora said. 'I don’t know what we’ll do long-term. My brain stopped planning for the future.' The six-week ceasefire is due to end Saturday, and it’s uncertain what will happen next. There are efforts to extend the calm as the next phase is negotiated. If fighting erupts again, those who returned to the north could find themselves once again in the middle of it. A massive rebuilding job has no way to start A report last week by the World Bank, U.N. and European Union estimated it will cost some $53 billion to rebuild Gaza after entire neighborhoods were decimated by Israel’s bombardment and offensives against Hamas militants. At the moment, there is almost no capacity or funding to start significant rebuilding. A priority is making Gaza immediately livable. Earlier in February, Hamas threatened to hold up hostage releases unless more tents and temporary shelters were allowed into Gaza. It then reversed and accelerated hostage releases after Israel agreed to let in mobile homes and construction equipment. Humanitarian agencies have stepped up services, setting up free kitchens and water delivery stations, and distributing tents and tarps to hundreds of thousands across Gaza, according to the U.N. President Donald Trump turned up the pressure by calling for the entire population of Gaza to be removed permanently so the U.S. can take over the territory and redevelop it for others. Rejecting the proposal, Palestinians say they want help to rebuild for themselves. Gaza City’s municipality started fixing some water lines and clearing rubble from streets, said a spokesperson, Asem Alnabih. But it lacks heavy equipment. Only a few of its 40 bulldozers and five dump trucks still work, he said. Gaza is filled with over 50 million tons of rubble that would take 100 trucks working at full capacity over 15 years to clear away, the U.N. estimates. Families try to get by day by day Tambora’s house in the northern town of Beit Lahiya was destroyed by an airstrike early in the war, so she and her family lived in the nearby Indonesian Hospital, where she worked as a nurse. After the ceasefire, they moved back into the only room in her house that was semi-intact. The ceiling is partially collapsed, the walls are cracked; the surviving fridge and sink are useless with no water or electricity. They stack their sheets and blankets in a corner. Tambora said her 12-year-old son lugs heavy containers of water twice a day from distribution stations. They also have to find firewood for cooking. The influx of aid means there is food in the markets and prices went down, but it remains expensive, she said. With the Indonesian Hospital too damaged to function, Tambora walks an hour each day to work at the Kamal Adwan Hospital. She charges her and her husband’s phones using the hospital generator. Many of Tambora’s relatives returned to find nothing left of their homes, so they live in tents on or next to the rubble that gets blown away by winter winds or flooded during rains, she said. Asmaa Dwaima and her family returned to Gaza City but had to rent an apartment because their home in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood was destroyed. It was only weeks after returning that she went to visit their four-story house, now a pile of flattened and burned wreckage. 'I couldn’t come here because I was afraid. I had an image of my house in my mind — its beauty, and warmth. ... I was afraid to face this truth,' the 25-year-old dentist said. 'They don’t just destroy stone, they are destroying us and our identity.' Her family had to rebuild the house once before, when it was leveled by airstrikes during a round of fighting between Israel and Hamas in 2014, she said. For the time being, they have no means to rebuild now. 'We need to remove the rubble because we want to pull out clothes and some of our belongings,' she said. 'We need heavy equipment … There are no bricks or other construction tools and, if available, it’s extremely expensive.' Desperation is growing Tess Ingram, a spokesperson with UNICEF who visited northern Gaza since the ceasefire, said the families she met are 'grieving the lives that they used to live as they begin to rebuild.' Their desperation, she said, 'is becoming more intense.' Huda Skaik, a 20-year-old student, is sharing a room with her three siblings and parents at her grandparents’ house in Gaza City. It’s an improvement from life in the tent camps of central Gaza where they were displaced for much of the war, she said. There, they had to live among strangers, and their tent was washed away by rain. At least here they have walls and are with family, she said. Before the war interrupted, Skaik had just started studying English literature at Gaza’s Islamic University. She is now enrolled in online classes the university is organizing. But the internet is feeble, and her electricity relies on solar panels that don’t always work. 'The worst part is that we’re just now grasping that we lost it all,' she said. 'The destruction is massive, but I’m trying to remain positive.' ___ Khaled reported from Cairo.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-palestinians-struggle-to-restart-their-lives-in-the-ruins-of-gaza/	2025-02-25T04:59:19-08:00	
US refuses to blame Russia for Ukraine war, splitting with Europe...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — In a dramatic shift in transatlantic relations under President Donald Trump, the United States split with its European allies by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in votes on three U.N. resolutions Monday seeking an end to the three-year war. The growing divide follows Trump’s decision to open direct negotiations with Russia on ending the war, dismaying Ukraine and its European supporters by excluding them from the preliminary talks last week. In the U.N. General Assembly, the U.S. joined Russia in voting against a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution that calls out Moscow’s aggression and demands an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops. The U.S. then abstained from voting on its own competing resolution after Europeans. led by France, succeeded in amending it to make clear Russia was the aggressor. The voting was taking place on the third anniversary of Russia's invasion and as Trump was hosting French President Emmanuel Macron in Washington. It was a major setback for the Trump administration in the 193-member world body, whose resolutions are not legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion. The U.S. then pushed for a vote on its original draft in the more powerful U.N. Security Council, where resolutions are legally binding and it has veto power along with Russia, China, Britain and France. The vote in the 15-member council was 10-0 with five European countries abstaining – Britain, France, Denmark, Greece and Slovenia. The dueling resolutions also reflect the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine. In escalating rhetoric, Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator' for not holding elections during wartime, when much of Ukraine is under Russian occupation, its soldiers are on the frontlines and the country is under martial law. Trump also has falsely accused Kyiv of starting the war and warned that he 'better move fast' to negotiate an end to the conflict or risk not having a nation to lead. Zelenskyy responded by saying Trump was living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space.' In a whirlwind of diplomacy, Trump’s meeting with Macron will be followed by a visit on Thursday from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, key U.S. allies who were in lockstep with Washington on Ukraine just over a month ago. They now find themselves on opposite sides on the best pathway for the UN to call for an end to the war. The General Assembly voted 93-18 with 65 abstentions to approve the Ukrainian resolution. The result showed some diminished support for Ukraine, because previous assembly votes saw more than 140 nations condemn Russia’s aggression and demand an immediate withdrawal. The assembly then turned to the U.S.-drafted resolution, which acknowledges 'the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict' and 'implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia,' but never mentions Moscow’s aggression. In a surprise move, France proposed three amendments, which add that the conflict was the result of a 'full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.' The amendments reaffirm the assembly’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity, and call for peace that respects the U.N. Charter. Russia proposed an amendment calling for 'root causes' of the conflict to be addressed. All the amendments were approved and the resolution passed 93-8 with 73 abstentions, with Ukraine voting 'yes,' the U.S. abstaining, and Russia voting 'no.' Both assembly resolutions were supported by U.S. allies in Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, its neighbors Canada and Mexico and European countries, with the exception of Hungary. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa said her country is exercising its 'inherent right to self-defense' following Russia’s invasion, which violates the U.N. Charter’s requirement that countries respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations. 'As we mark three years of this devastation — Russia’s full invasion against Ukraine — we call on all nations to stand firm and to take … the side of the Charter, the side of humanity and the side of just and lasting peace, peace through strength,' she said. Trump has often stated his commitment to bringing 'peace through strength.' Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward warned the council, 'If Russia is allowed to win, we will live in a world where might is right, where borders can be redrawn by force, where aggressors think they can act with impunity.' Denmark’s Lotte Machon, a deputy foreign minister, stressed that in peace negotiations, 'nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, nothing about European security without Europe.' U.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea, meanwhile, said multiple previous U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops 'have failed to stop the war,' which 'has now dragged on for far too long and at far too terrible a cost to the people in Ukraine and Russia and beyond.' 'What we need is a resolution marking the commitment from all U.N. member states to bring a durable end to the war,' Shea said before the vote. In the Security Council, Russia used its veto to prevent European amendments to the U.S. resolution, which is legally blinding but essentially toothless. It only operative paragraph 'Implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.' Shea called it 'a first step, but a crucial one,' saying it 'puts us on the path to peace.' The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body on Ukraine because the Security Council has been paralyzed by Russia’s veto power. It has approved half a dozen resolutions since Russian forces stormed across the border on Feb. 24, 2022. The Ukrainian resolution adopted Monday recalls the need to implement the previous resolutions, singling out the demand that Russia 'immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine.' The resolution reaffirms the assembly’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and also 'that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.' It calls for 'a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine' and it reiterates 'the urgent need to end the war this year.' ___ AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-the-un-will-vote-to-demand-russia-pull-troops-out-of-ukraine-but-the-us-wants-a-softer-approach/	2025-02-24T17:58:45-08:00	
Trump expresses hope Russia's war in Ukraine is nearing an endgam...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump expressed hope that Russia's war in Ukraine is nearing an endgame as he met Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron on the third anniversary of the invasion. But France's leader cautioned that it's crucial that any potential agreement with Moscow does not amount to surrender for Ukraine. Their talks come at a moment of deep uncertainty about the future of transatlantic relations, with Trump transforming American foreign policy and effectively tuning out European leadership as he looks to quickly end the war in Ukraine. While Macron and Trump made nice at the White House, their countries were at loggerheads at the United Nations over resolutions describing Russia as the aggressor in the war. In broad comments on the state of the conflict, Trump said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine. 'Yeah, he will accept it,' Trump told reporters. 'I have asked him that question. Look, if we do this deal, he’s not looking for more war.' And Trump said he hoped that the war could end within weeks and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would soon come to the U.S. to sign a deal giving America access to Ukraine's critical minerals, which are used in key technology. Trump is pressing the economic deal to help repay some of the $180 billion in American aid for Kyiv since the start of the war — tens of billions of which is being spent in the U.S. to replenish older weapons sent to Ukraine. 'It looks like we’re getting very close,' Trump told reporters of the minerals deal before his meeting with Macron. He said Zelenskyy could potentially visit Washington this week or next to sign it. Ensuring security for Ukraine Ukraine also is looking for future security guarantees as part of any agreement. Trump, however, did not say whether the emerging deal would include such assurances from the United States: 'Europe is going to make sure nothing happens.' A French official with knowledge of Macron’s meeting with Trump said the U.S. president didn’t object to the need for U.S. security guarantees in a possible peace deal but details were still being worked out. The official wasn’t authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. At a joint press conference, Macron acknowledged that European nations must do more to bolster defense on the continent. But he also warned against capitulating to Russia. 'This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine,' Macron said. 'It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees. This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty.' Macron cut off direct communication with Putin after Russian forces carried out brutal operations in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha months into the conflict. But he said the moment has changed and he hopes Trump's engagement with Putin can lead to something fruitful. 'Now, there is a big chance because there is a new U.S. administration, so this is a new context,' Macron said. 'So there is good reason for President Trump to reengage with President Putin.' Putin said Monday that he has not discussed resolving the conflict in Ukraine in detail with Trump and neither did Russian and American negotiating teams when they met in Saudi Arabia last week. Putin also said Russia does not rule out European countries — who were dismayed that they and Ukraine were not invited to the table in Riyadh — participating in a peace settlement. America's foreign policy turnaround The war's anniversary — and the talks at the White House — come at an unnerving moment for much of Europe as it witnesses a dramatic shift in American foreign policy under Trump. Trump has made demands for territory — Greenland, Canada, Gaza and the Panama Canal. Just over a month into his second term, the 'America First' president has cast an enormous shadow over what veteran U.S. diplomats and former government officials had regarded as America’s calming presence of global stability and continuity. Despite some hiccups, the military, economic and moral power of the United States has dominated the post-World War II era, most notably after the Cold War came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union. All of that, some fear, may be lost if Trump gets his way and the U.S. abandons the principles under which the United Nations and numerous other international bodies were founded. 'The only conclusion you can draw is that 80 years of policy in standing up against aggressors has just been blown up without any sort of discussion or reflection,' said Ian Kelly, a U.S. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administrations and now a professor at Northwestern University. European leaders in Washington Trump is set to hold a meeting Thursday with another key European leader, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump shook Europe with repeated criticism of Zelenskyy for failing to negotiate an end to the war and rebuffing a push to sign off on a deal giving the U.S. access to Ukraine's critical minerals, which could be used in the American aerospace, medical and tech industries. Zelenskyy initially bristled, saying it was short on security guarantees. He said Sunday on X that 'we are making great progress' but noted that 'we want a good economic deal that will be part of a true security guarantee system for Ukraine.' Zelenskyy, who said Sunday in response to a question that he would trade his office for peace or to join NATO, had angered Trump by saying the U.S. president was living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space.' In the public spat, Trump called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and falsely charged Kyiv with starting the war. Russia, in fact, invaded its smaller and lesser-equipped neighbor in February 2022. Asked Monday if he thought Putin was also a dictator, Trump demurred: 'I don’t use those words lightly.' Some daylight between allies While Macron and Trump held talks, including participating in a virtual meeting with fellow Group of Seven leaders, the United States split with its European allies at the U.N. by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in a series of resolutions. The U.S. abstained from voting on its own proposal after the Europeans, led by France, succeeded in changing it to make clear that Russia was the aggressor. Before meeting with Trump, Macron said he intended to tell him that it’s in the joint interest of Americans and Europeans not to 'be weak in the face of President Putin.' 'It’s not you, it’s not your trademark, it’s not in your interest,' Macron said. 'How can you then be credible in the face of China if you’re weak in the face of Putin?' Yet, Trump said this month he'd like to see Russia rejoin the G7. It was suspended from the G8 after annexing Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. 'I really believe he wants to make a deal,' Trump said. 'I may be wrong, but I believe he wants to make a deal. ___ AP writers Edith M.

McConnell suggests Trump has ‘gross misunderstanding’ of Ukraine ...	(The Hill) – Former Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday suggested that President Trump’s refusal to blame Russia as the sole aggressor who provoked the war in Ukraine 'reflects a gross misunderstanding of the nature of negotiations and leverage.' McConnell declared in a statement marking the three-year anniversary of the war that the 'human catastrophe rests solely on Vladimir Putin' and that if Ukrainian forces laid down their arms, 'Putin’s aims would not stop with Kyiv.' 'Mistaking this fact is as embarrassing as it is costly,' McConnell said. He also criticized what he called the Biden administration’s 'shameful hesitation and half-measures' in responding to Russian aggression but, without naming Trump specifically, he warned that refusing to recognize the United States’ interest in defeating Russian aggression would be 'even more disgraceful.' 'Refusing to acknowledge Russia as the undeniable and unprovoked aggressor is more than an unseemly moral equivalency — it reflects a gross misunderstanding of the nature of negotiations and leverage,' he said. McConnell, the chairman of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, issued his statement a few days after Trump suggested that Ukraine started the war with Russia and called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 'a dictator without elections.' Russia’s army invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, after Putin said he needed to protect the Russian-speaking population in eastern Ukraine and contain NATO expansion. Trump refused to call Putin a 'dictator' when asked by a reporter whether he would use the same words for the Russian president. 'I don’t use those words lightly,' Trump responded during a joint press appearance with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday at the White House. Trump and Macron discussed their efforts to bring an end to the three-year war. Those comments came on the same day the United States voted against a U.N. resolution condemning Russia as the aggressor in the war, joining Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Israel and Hungary in voting no. McConnell, who has devoted his final two years in the Senate to pushing back against the isolationists in his party, said that hoping that 'appeasement will check the ambitions' of Putin is 'as naïve today as it was in 1939,' referring to western Europe's initial hesitancy in standing up to Nazi Germany. 'America is right to seek an end to this war, but an end that fails to constrain Russian ambition, ensure Ukrainian sovereignty, or strengthen American credibility with both allies and adversaries is no end at all,' he warned. 'Instead, such a hollow peace would invite further aggression,' he said. McConnell said the 'axis of aggressors from Beijing to Moscow,' which includes Iran and North Korea, is seeking an outcome in Ukraine that 'undermines the credibility of American deterrence and leaves U.S. interests more vulnerable.' 'Without a clear and resolute commitment to the leadership and order that underpins our prosperity and security, America’s adversaries will receive exactly what they hope for,' he declared.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/mcconnell-suggests-trump-has-gross-misunderstanding-of-ukraine-talks/	2025-02-24T15:46:16-08:00	
The fragile ceasefire in Gaza faces a key deadline. Will it last?	The first phase of the ceasefire that paused 15 months of brutal warfare between Israel and Hamas militants is set to end on Saturday — and it's unclear what comes next. The two sides were supposed to start negotiating a second phase weeks ago in which Hamas would release all the remaining hostages from its Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which triggered the war, in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. But those negotiations have not begun — there have only been preparatory talks — and the first phase has been jolted by one dispute after another. Hamas has freed all 25 living hostages included in the first six-week phase ending on March 1 in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. It has also released the bodies of four captives and is expected to turn over four more, though it's unclear if that will happen Thursday as planned. That leaves it with more than 60 captives, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Israel has meanwhile delayed the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners who were supposed to be freed last weekend over the treatment of the captives, who were paraded before crowds. Israel is reportedly seeking an extension of the first phase to secure the freedom of more captives. But Hamas says it won't negotiate anything until the prisoners whose release was delayed are freed. Negotiations over Phase 2 will be even more contentious. Phase 2 was always the biggest challenge The second phase was always going to be the most difficult because it would likely force Israel to choose between its two main war goals — the safe return of the hostages and the annihilation of their captors. Hamas, though weakened, remains in power with no internal challengers. In exchange for the remaining living hostages — its main bargaining chip — it is demanding a lasting ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. A third phase would see the exchange of remains and the start of Gaza's daunting reconstruction process, which is expected to take years and cost billions of dollars. Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration's Mideast envoy, is returning to the region this week. In an interview with CNN’s 'State of the Union' on Sunday, he said he will aim for an extension of Phase 1 to buy time for negotiating the second phase. But Egypt, which has served as a key mediator, has refused to discuss an extension of Phase 1 until negotiations over Phase 2 begin, according to two Egyptian officials who were not authorized to brief reporters and spoke on condition of anonymity. One official familiar with the negotiations said the mere launch of Phase 2 talks would keep the truce intact, according to the language of the deal. That would mean a continued halt in fighting and aid flowing into Gaza, though there would be no further hostage releases beyond what has already been negotiated, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss closed diplomatic contacts. Hamas has previously said it is open to a short extension to complete talks on Phase 2, but that was before Israel held up the release of the prisoners. One of the Egyptian officials said Egypt is also demanding Israel complete its withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor, on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, before moving on to the next phase. The agreement calls for that withdrawal to begin this weekend and be completed within eight days. Netanyahu has not publicly stated what he will do this weekend. He is under heavy pressure from hard-line coalition partners to resume the war against Hamas. But after images showed freed hostages returning home in poor condition, he also faces heavy public pressure to bring the remaining hostages home. Witkoff said Netanyahu is committed to bringing back all the hostages but has set a 'red line' that Hamas cannot be involved in governing Gaza after the war. Netanyahu has also ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, dominated by Hamas' main rival, Fatah. Hamas has said it is willing to hand over control of Gaza to other Palestinians. But the militant group, which does not accept Israel's existence, would still be deeply entrenched in Gaza. And it says it won't lay down its arms unless Israel ends its occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, lands captured in the 1967 Mideast war that Palestinians want for a future state. Hamas has also dismissed Israel's suggestion that its Gaza leadership go into exile. Phase 1 is unfinished and has further embittered both sides The first phase of the ceasefire has yet to be completed and has only deepened the bitter mistrust on both sides. Israelis were shocked to see the captives — some of whom were emaciated — paraded before crowds upon their release, with some forced to smile, wave, deliver statements and, in one case, kiss a masked militant on the head. After returning to Israel, hostages said they were held under harsh conditions. Last Thursday, Hamas displayed coffins holding what it said were the remains of Shiri Bibas and her two small children, who it said were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel said a forensic investigation showed the two children were killed by their captors. The third body turned out to be someone else. Hamas then released another body that was confirmed to be the mother. On Saturday, Hamas filmed two hostages who were forced to watch the release of others, turning to a camera and begging to be released, in yet another public spectacle that infuriated Israel. That appears to have prompted Israel to postpone the release of the prisoners. Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire by killing dozens of people who the army said had approached its forces or entered unauthorized areas. It also accused Israel of dragging its feet on the entry of mobile homes and equipment for clearing rubble, which entered late last week, and of beating and abusing Palestinian prisoners prior to their release. Israel has also launched a major military operation in the occupied West Bank that has displaced some 40,000 Palestinians, according to the United Nations. Israel says it is cracking down on militants who threaten its citizens, while Palestinians see it as trying to further cement its decades-long rule. Mixed signals from Trump U.S. President Donald Trump took credit for the ceasefire, which Witkoff helped push across the finish line after a year of negotiations led by the Biden administration, Egypt and Qatar. But Trump has since sent mixed signals about the deal. Earlier this month, he set a firm deadline for Hamas to release all the hostages, warning 'all hell is going to break out' if it didn't. But he said it was ultimately up to Israel, and the deadline came and went. Trump sowed further confusion by proposing that Gaza's population of some 2 million Palestinians be relocated to other countries and for the U.S. to take over the territory and develop it. Netanyahu welcomed the idea, which was universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries, including close U.S. allies. Human rights groups said it could violate international law. Trump stood by the plan in a Fox News interview over the weekend but said he's 'not forcing it.' ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-the-fragile-ceasefire-in-gaza-faces-a-key-deadline-will-it-last/	2025-02-24T12:00:29-08:00	
Western leaders visit Kyiv and pledge military support against Ru...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — More than a dozen Western leaders attended events in Ukraine on Monday marking the third anniversary of the country's war with Russia, many pledging more military aid in a conspicuous show of support for Kyiv as uncertainty deepened over the commitment of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to helping it fend off Russia’s invasion. The fourth year of fighting could be pivotal, as Trump uses his return to office last month to press for a peace deal. But Ukrainian and European officials have been rattled by his cordial approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his tough words for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. World security is at stake in talks over how the war ends, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned. 'The autocrats around the world are watching very carefully whether there’s any impunity if you violate international borders or invade your neighbor, or if there is true deterrence,' she told a conference in Kyiv. Some observers say Russian success in Ukraine could embolden China’s own ambitions. Just as Moscow claims that Ukraine is rightfully Russian territory, China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own. In a cascade of unwelcome developments for Kyiv, Trump has in recent days called Zelenskyy a dictator, suggested Ukraine is to blame for the war and ended Putin’s three-year diplomatic isolation by the United States. U.S. officials have also indicated to Ukraine that its hopes of joining NATO are unlikely to be realized and that it probably won’t get back the land that Russia’s army has occupied, amounting to nearly 20% of the country. Meanwhile, Putin’s troops are making steady progress on the battlefield while Ukraine is grappling with shortages of troops and weapons. Some of Ukraine’s most important backers, including European leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were among the stream of dignitaries arriving by train in Kyiv. Others spoke at a conference via video link. The guests had similar messages: Ukraine and its European partners must be consulted in any peace negotiations, Putin’s ambitions must be thwarted, and Europe must take on more of the burden for its own defense. Alarm bells sound in Europe as Washington changes course The shift in Washington's policy has set off alarm bells in Europe, where governments fear being sidelined by the U.S. in efforts to secure a peace deal and are mulling how they might pick up the slack of any cut in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The changes have also placed strain on transatlantic relations. European Council President Antonio Costa on Sunday announced that he would convene an emergency summit of the 27 EU leaders in Brussels on March 6, with Ukraine at the top of the agenda. 'We are living a defining moment for Ukraine and European security,' he said in a post on social media. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are to both visit Washington this week. EU foreign ministers on Monday approved a new raft of sanctions against Russia. The measures target Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet' of ships that it uses to skirt restrictions on transporting oil and gas, or to carry stolen Ukrainian grain. The EU said 74 vessels were added to its shadow fleet list. Asset freezes and travel bans were imposed on 83 officials and 'entities' — usually government agencies, banks or companies. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country would provide a 1 billion-euro ($1.04 billion) military systems package to Ukraine this year. Starmer said Ukrainians’ voices 'must be at the heart of the drive for peace,' while Trump’s intervention had 'changed the global conversation' and 'created an opportunity.' 'Russia does not hold all the cards in this war,' he said. Coming off a victory in Sunday’s German elections, conservative leader Friedrich Merz — also a staunch backer of Ukraine — posted on X Monday: 'More than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength.' 'For a fair peace, the country that is under attack must be part of peace negotiations,' he wrote. Diplomacy ramps up after record Russian drone attack On Sunday, Russia launched its biggest single drone attack of the war, pounding Ukraine with 267 drones. The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, insisted that the U.S. cannot seal any peace deal to end the war without Ukraine or Europe being involved. She highlighted what she claimed were pro-Russian positions being taken up by the Trump administration. 'You can discuss whatever you want with Putin. But if it comes to Europe or Ukraine, then Ukraine and Europe also have to agree to this deal,' Kallas told reporters in Brussels, where she was chairing a meeting of EU foreign ministers. Kallas travels to Washington on Tuesday for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Washington and Moscow draw closer U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the third anniversary was 'a grim milestone.' 'More than 12,600 civilians killed, with many more injured. Entire communities reduced to rubble. Hospitals and schools destroyed,' he said in Geneva. Russia's foreign ministry said Saturday that preparations for a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin were underway, and U.S. officials have said that they had agreed with Moscow to reestablish diplomatic ties and restart economic cooperation. Kallas rejected Trump’s earlier inflammatory assertion that Zelenskyy was a dictator for not having held elections after his regular term expired last year, saying, 'Russia hasn’t had elections in 25 years.' Ukrainian law prohibits elections being held while martial law is in place, and Zelenksyy said as recently as Sunday that after martial law is lifted, 'there will be elections and people will make their choice.' ___ Associated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-foreign-leaders-visit-ukraines-capital-to-mark-3rd-war-anniversary/	2025-02-24T05:20:15-08:00	
Russia-Ukraine war enters third year	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) - As the war in Ukraine enters its third year, the United States is ramping up efforts to broker a peace deal, but sharp divisions are emerging over how to approach Russia’s role in the conflict. On the three-year mark of the war Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he'll give up his presidency, in exchange for peace. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is making headlines after declining to call Russia’s invasion 'unprovoked.' 'Does all the finger pointing and pearl clutching make peace more likely? That’s the enduring question. The president is asking, he wants peace,' stated Hegseth. Special envoy Steve Witkoff shared similar comments in an interview. 'Irrespective of who started it, it needs to end too. Many people's lives have been expunged as a result of it,' said Witkoff. Not everyone in Washington is on board with the Trump administration's approach. 'I think Trump is much closer, ideologically to Putin and other autocrats around the world, than he is to democratic countries,' said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.). President Trump will hold a call with other G-7 leaders on Monday to discuss the three-year mark of the war and next steps toward a possible resolution.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/russia-ukraine-war-enters-third-year/	2025-02-24T04:13:32-08:00	
Zelenskyy says progress made on reaching an agreement with the US...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A contentious Trump administration proposal to give the U.S. $500 billion worth of profits from Ukraine's rare earth minerals as compensation for its wartime assistance to Kyiv has been taken off the table, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday, indicating a more equitable deal is in the works. Zelenskyy had earlier declined a U.S. draft agreement on exploitation of his country's valuable minerals such as lithium used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries because it did not contain security guarantees and came with the $500 billion price tag. 'The question of $500 billion is no longer there,' Zelenskyy told a news conference at a forum of government officials in Kyiv marking the three-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainian leader said considering aid as a debt to be repaid would be a 'Pandora's box' that would set a precedent requiring Kyiv to reimburse all its backers. 'We do not recognize the debt,' Zelenskyy said. 'It will not be in the final format of the agreement.' No further details were given on the state of negotiations. Ukraine has insisted on security guarantees that it needs to deter any potential Russian aggression in the future. Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said on CNN’s 'State of the Union' that he expects a deal this week allowing the U.S. to play a greater role in exploiting Ukraine's mineral resources. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration's minerals plan was to create a U.S.-Ukraine partnership, calling it a 'win-win.' 'We make money if the Ukrainian people make money,' Bessent told Fox News Channel’s Sunday Morning Futures program. Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, left the Kyiv forum early along with Economic Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko for what Yermak said were talks with U.S. officials on a potential deal. Later Sunday, Yermak posted on social media that he'd spoken with U.S. officials, including Bessent and Trump's national security adviser Mike Walz, saying it had been a 'constructive conversation.' 'We are making progress ,' Yermak wrote. 'The USA is our partner and we are grateful to the American people.' Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency for NATO membership In response to a pointed question from a reporter on whether he would give up his presidency for peace in Ukraine, Zelenskyy said he would if it achieved a durable end to the fighting under the security umbrella of the NATO military alliance. 'If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I’m ready,' he said. 'I can trade it for NATO.' His comment appeared to be aimed at recent suggestions by President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that elections should be held despite Ukrainian legislation prohibiting them during martial law. Ukraine fears Trump's policy shift toward Putin Trump's engagement with Russian officials and his recent agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow have marked a dramatic about-face in U.S. policy that has rattled leaders in Ukraine and across Europe. Zelenskyy has expressed fear that Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in Ukraine losing territory and being left vulnerable to future Russian aggression. U.S. officials have asserted the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start. Trump, however, prompted alarm and anger in Ukraine this week when he suggested Kyiv had started the war and Zelenskyy was acting as a 'dictator' by not holding elections. On Sunday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the state TASS news agency that Moscow and Washington would continue bilateral talks at the end of next week. Ryabkov said the talks would take place between department heads from both countries’ foreign ministries, adding that 'quite a lot' of contact was ongoing between the Russian and American sides. European leaders prepare for talks with Zelenskyy and Trump European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other top EU officials were headed to Kyiv Monday for talks with Ukraine’s government as Europe scrambles to devise a response to the Trump administration's U.S. policy changes, and to maintain support for Kyiv if aid from Washington ends. The U.K. said it would announce new sanctions against Russia on Monday, describing them as the biggest package since the early days of the war. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the measures would be aimed at eroding Russia’s 'military machine and reducing revenues fueling the fires of destruction in Ukraine.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were to both visit Washington this week as Europe attempts to persuade Trump not to abandon Ukraine in pursuit of a peace deal. Russia launches record drone strikes on eve of anniversary Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia had launched 267 drones into Ukraine overnight, more than in any other single attack of the war. Ukraine’s air force said 138 drones were shot down over 13 Ukrainian regions, with 119 more lost enroute to their targets. Three ballistic missiles also were fired, the air force said. One person was killed in the city of Kryvyi Rih, according to the city military administration. Reacting to the latest Russian attacks, Andrii Sybiha‎, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, said on social media: 'No one should trust Putin’s words. Look at his actions instead.' More sanctions imposed on Russia New Zealand will sanction an additional 52 people and entities involved in Russia’s military and energy sectors, North Korea’s support to Russia’s war effort, and the forced relocation and reeducation of Ukrainian children, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Monday. Since March 2022, New Zealand has placed sanctions on more than 1,800 individuals and entities. New Zealand will contribute a further 3 million New Zealand dollars ($1.7 million) to the World Bank-administered fund for Ukraine, Peters said in a statement. ___ Associated Press writers Thomas Strong and Will Weissert in Washington and Charlotte Graham-McLay in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-launches-a-record-number-of-drones-into-ukraine-on-the-eve-of-the-wars-3-year-anniversary/	2025-02-23T20:03:57-08:00
