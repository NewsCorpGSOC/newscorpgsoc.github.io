Hezbollah vows a new phase in the war, as Israel says it has kill...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah vowed to launch a new phase of fighting against invading Israeli troops Friday, a day after Israel said its forces in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza had killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the chief architect of last year’s brutal attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Sinwar’s killing in what appeared to be a chance frontline encounter with Israeli troops offers a potential window to shift the dynamic in the Gaza war even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah along its northern border with Lebanon and continues its aerial bombardment in other areas of Lebanon. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, which hailed Sinwar as a martyr who can inspire others in challenging Israel. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. Israel says Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in Gaza Hamas has not yet commented directly on the Israeli announcement, but photos which were apparently taken by Israeli troops on the scene showed the body of a man who appeared to be Sinwar half-buried in rubble with a gaping wound in his head. A statement issued by one of Hamas’ political leaders abroad Friday seemed to be a reference to Sinwar's death and said Israel is mistaken if it 'believes that killing our leaders means the end of our movement and the struggle of the Palestinian people.' Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim, who is usually based in Qatar, said that past leaders in the organization had also been killed and 'Hamas each time became stronger and more popular, and these leaders became an icon for future generations to continue the journey towards a free Palestine.' He added that it is 'painful and distressing to lose beloved people, especially extraordinary leaders' but that the Palestinian militant group is sure it will be 'eventually victorious.' When asked if the statement was a confirmation of Sinwar’s death, however, Naim said it was not. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing Thursday night that 'our war is not yet ended.' But many, from the governments of Israel's allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar’s death would pave the way for an end to the war. Iran’s mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Sinwar, emphasizing that he died on the battlefield and not in hiding, unlike the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who was hanged in 2006. 'When U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed,' the statement said. 'However when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield — in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy — the spirit of resistance will be strengthened.' More than 1 million people on both sides were killed during the brutal Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. In Lebanon, Hezbollah issued a statement early Friday saying its fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones against Israel for the first time in recent days. The statement appeared to refer to an explosives-laden drone that evaded Israel’s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel last Sunday night, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced earlier this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. Hezbollah said its fighters were working according to 'plans prepared in advance' to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. It also announced several missile and artillery attacks on Israeli forces operating in villages in southern Lebanon’s border area overnight and Friday morning. In one case, the group said it fired a heavy missile barrage at Israeli soldiers who were trying to evacuate those wounded in an earlier strike. The group also said it had fired 'large missile salvos' at a military barracks in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights and at the Zvulun area north of Haifa. Earlier this week, Hezbollah’s acting leader Naim Kassem warned that the group will continue to target wider areas of Israel unless a cease-fire is implemented in Lebanon. As Israel fought militants in Lebanon and in Gaza, its military said Friday that its forces had killed two militants who crossed into Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea from neighboring Jordan. Such infiltrations are relatively rare, especially as Israel has ramped up border security since the Hamas attack in October 2023. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed vast swathes of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Abby Sewell and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hezbollah-vows-a-new-phase-in-the-war-as-israel-says-it-has-killed-hamas-leader-sinwar/	2024-10-18T04:12:13-07:00	
South Korean intelligence says North has sent troops to aid Russi...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's spy agency said Friday that North Korea has dispatched troops to support Russia's war against Ukraine, a development that could bring a third country into the war and intensify a standoff between North Korea and the West. The National Intelligence Service said in a statement that Russian navy ships transferred 1,500 North Korean special operation forces to the Russian port city of Vladivostok from Oct. 8 to Oct. 13. It said more North Korean troops are expected to be sent to Russia soon. The North Korean soldiers deployed in Russia have been given Russian military uniforms, weapons and forged identification documents, the NIS said. It said they are currently staying at military bases in Vladivostok and other Russian sites such as Ussuriysk, Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk, and that they will likely be deployed to battle grounds after completing their adaptation training. The NIS posted on its website satellite and other photos showing what it calls Russian navy ship movements near a North Korean port and suspected North Korean mass gatherings in Ussuriysk and Khabarovsk in the past week. South Korean media, citing the NIS, reported that North Korea has decided to dispatch a total of 12,000 troops formed into four brigades to Russia. The NIS did not immediately confirm the reports. If confirmed, it would be North Korea's first major participation in a foreign war. North Korea has 1.2 million troops, one of the largest militaries in the world, but it lacks actual combat experience. Many experts question how much the North Korean troop dispatch would help Russia, citing North Korea’s outdated equipment and shortage of battle experience. Experts also said that North Korea likely received Russian promises to provide security support over the intense confrontations over its advancing nuclear program with the U.S. and South Korea. During a meeting in Pyongyang in June, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked, in what was considered the two countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. South Korea’s presidential office said in a statement that President Yoon Suk Yeol had presided over an emergency meeting earlier Friday to discuss North Korea’s troop dispatch to Russia. The statement said participants of the meeting agreed that North Korea’s troop dispatch poses a grave security threat to South Korea and the international community. But the presidential office gave no further details like when and how many North Korean soldiers have been sent to Ukraine and what roles they are expected to play. Russia has denied using North Korean troops in the war, with Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov describing the claims as 'another piece of fake news' during a news conference last week, according to Russia media. Ukrainian media reported earlier this month that six North Koreans were among those killed after a Ukrainian missile strike in the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region on Oct. 3. On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his government has intelligence that 10,000 troops from North Korea are being prepared to join Russian forces fighting against his country, warning that a third nation wading into the hostilities could turn the conflict into a 'world war.' 'From our intelligence we’ve got information that North Korea sent tactical personnel and officers to Ukraine,' Zelenskyy told reporters at NATO headquarters. 'They are preparing on their land 10,000 soldiers, but they didn’t move them already to Ukraine or to Russia.' NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the western alliance 'have no evidence that North Korean soldiers are involved in the fight. But we do know that North Korea is supporting Russia in many ways, weapons supplies, technological supplies, innovation, to support them in the war effort. And that is highly worrying.' The U.S., South Korea and their partners have accused North Korea of supplying Russia with artillery shells, missiles and other equipment to help fuel its war on Ukraine Outside officials and experts say North Korea in exchange possibly received badly needed food and economic aid and technology assistance aimed at upgrading Kim’s nuclear-armed military. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have repeatedly denied the existence of an arms deal between the countries.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-south-korean-spies-say-north-is-sending-troops-to-support-russias-war-on-ukraine-reports-say/	2024-10-18T03:40:21-07:00	
Israel says Hamas' top leader Yahya Sinwar may be dead	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Israeli military said Thursday it was looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a military operation in Gaza. Authorities were conducting DNA tests on a body to determine if it is him, an Israeli security official said. The military said in a statement that three militants were killed during operations in Gaza, without specifying where or elaborating further. It said the identities of the three were so far not confirmed, but it was 'checking the possibility' that one of them was Sinwar. The security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said the tests on the body had not yet confirmed if it was Sinwar's. There was no immediate comment by Hamas on the report. Yahya Sinwar, head of Hamas in Gaza, chairs a meeting with leaders of Palestinian factions at his office in Gaza City, on April 13, 2022. (AP Photo/Adel Hana, File) Sinwar was one of the chief architects of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel has vowed to kill him since the beginning of its retaliatory campaign in Gaza. If confirmed, Sinwar's death could be a heavy blow to the militant group. He has been Hamas' top leader inside the Gaza Strip for years, closely connected to its military wing while dramatically building up its capabilities. Sinwar was chosen as Hamas's top leader after his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in July in an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. Israel has also claimed to have killed the head of Hamas' military wing Mohammed Deif in an airstrike, but the group has said he survived. Who is Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar? President Joe Biden has been briefed on Israel's investigation into whether it killed Sinwar, and U.S. officials have been in close contact with Israeli officials throughout Thursday morning, according to a senior administration official. The report came as Israeli forces continued a more than week-old major air and ground assault in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza. On Thursday, an Israeli strike hit a school sheltering displaced Palestinians, killing at least 15 people, including five children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Fares Abu Hamza, head of Gaza Health Ministry’s local emergency unit, said dozens of people were wounded. He said the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital was struggling to treat the casualties. 'Many women and children are in critical condition,' he said. The Israeli military said it targeted a command center run by Hamas and Islamic Jihad inside the school. It provided a list of around a dozen names of people it identified as militants who were present when the strike was called in. It was not immediately possible to verify the names. Israel has repeatedly struck tent camps and schools sheltering displaced people in Gaza. The Israeli military says it carries out precise strikes on militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its strikes often kill women and children. In a separate development, a building in central Beirut that houses offices of the Al Jazeera news network and the Norwegian Embassy was evacuated after a warning. Mazen Ibrahim, Al Jazeera’s Lebanon bureau chief, said the building’s administration received three calls telling everyone to leave the building, which he said also houses the embassies of Norway and Azerbaijan, as well as dozens of offices. He said it was unclear who called in the warning. Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ragnhild Simenstad said the building was evacuated after a 'bomb threat,' without elaborating. Israel has ordered the evacuation of several buildings, as well as entire cities, towns and villages, as it strikes what it says are targets linked to the Hezbollah militant group. There have also been several instances of evacuation warning calls and text messages that turned out to be bogus, which Lebanese security agencies say they are investigating. Did Trump actually call veterans who died in wars ‘suckers’? Israel launched its campaign in Gaza to eliminate Hamas after the militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Some 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. Northern Gaza was the first target of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, with entire neighborhoods in Gaza City and other towns reduced to rubble. Most of the population fled after Israel issued evacuation orders in the opening days of the war, but about 400,000 are believed to have remained despite the harsh conditions. Earlier this month, Israel once again ordered the full-scale evacuation of the north, and allowed no food aid to enter the area for around two weeks. That led many Palestinians to fear that it had adopted a surrender-or-starve strategy suggested by former Israeli generals. Israel allowed two shipments of aid to enter the north earlier this week after the United States warned it might reduce its military aid if its ally did not do more to address the humanitarian crisis. Since the start of the conflict, Israeli forces have launched repeated operations into Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. The military says militants have repeatedly regrouped there after major operations.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/israel-says-hamas-top-leader-yahya-sinwar-may-be-dead/	2024-10-17T08:01:56-07:00	
Ukraine's former armed forces chief endorses 'victory plan' in fi...	LONDON (AP) — Ukraine's former commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, on Thursday expressed his support for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s 'victory plan,' despite the tensions between the two that led to his dismissal. 'Ukraine must clearly follow the plan,' Zaluzhnyi said in his first public appearance since his appointment as ambassador to the U.K. He told an audience at London’s Chatham House think-tank: 'But this list of steps primarily concerns those countries that should ultimately be interested in stopping the war.' The plan lays out Ukraine’s view on how to strengthen its positions before any potential negotiations with Russia to end the conflict. After briefing U.S. and other Western officials, Zelenskyy presented the key points publicly during a speech to the Ukrainian parliament on Wednesday. The plan includes a formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. Zaluzhnyi asserted that NATO membership is the only viable security guarantee for his country, fully backing President Zelensky’s call for the alliance to extend an invitation to Kyiv. But the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO has left the alliance in a bind, with some members concerned it could escalate the conflict and risk direct confrontation with Russia. 'Declaring yet another freeze in the situation with Ukraine will not work,' said Ukraine’s former commander-in-chief. 'We want to have guarantees of security for ourselves and our children,' he said. Zaluzhnyi, who was in charge of armed forces during Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, said a shortfall in Western support during that period meant that Ukraine lost its chance to fend off Russia on its own. He said that missed opportunity turned the war into a protracted conflict where the way out 'seems rather doubtful and almost impossible,' and allowed Russia the chance to form an alliance with North Korea, Iran and China which Ukraine now cannot defeat without the help of Western partners. 'Against Ukraine now stands not only Russia, but also a quite powerful coalition of strong states,' he said. Such an 'alliance of authoritarian countries' may pose a security threat to the democratic world and the West 'should have made a plan to protect its democratic institutions,' he said. During the presentation of his plan in Brussels on Thursday, Zelenskyy said Kyiv has intelligence information that 10,000 troops from North Korea are being prepared to join Russian forces fighting against his country, warning that a third nation wading into the hostilities would turn the conflict into a 'world war.' Zelenskyy did not go into further details about the claim. As the war grinds through its third year, the mood in Ukraine is grim as its outmanned troops face difficulty holding back Russian advances, especially in the east. Although Moscow’s gains are incremental, the steady forward movement is making Kyiv feel it needs more large-scale Western help. The former armed forces chief stressed that Ukraine is battling Russia, which significantly outweighs it in resources, including in manpower. 'The only thing which works in the war is mathematics,' he said. Zaluzhnyi acknowledged the challenges his country faces with mobilization, emphasizing the need to reform recruitment practices inherited from the times Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union. Despite his popularity, he has faced widespread criticism for failing to meet the army’s need for more troops. Conscription has become a sensitive issue as infantry shortages grow, which became one of the factors that allowed Russia to gain the initiative on the battlefield. 'We had to change it (the system),' he said but adding that Ukraine doesn’t have enough time to do it while the war with Russia lasts. 'The material side does not depend entirely on us, but in working with human resources, everything completely depends on Ukraine,' he said. Tensions between Zaluzhnyi and President Zelenskyy escalated following Ukraine’s 2023 counter-offensive, which failed to achieve significant territorial gains. In February, Zelenskyy dismissed Zaluzhnyi as military commander-in-chief in a move to revitalize efforts in the stalled war. Zaluzhnyi is widely respected among Ukrainian troops and considered a national hero. He is credited with stalling Russia’s full-scale invasion in the early days of the war and expertly pushing back Moscow’s troops. ——— Arhirova contributed from Kyiv	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraines-former-armed-forces-chief-endorses-victory-plan-in-first-speech-since-his-dismissal/	2024-10-17T07:17:52-07:00	
Hunger experts say the risk of famine in Gaza remains high	The Gaza Strip is still at risk of famine more than a year into the Israel-Hamas war, even as the number of people facing the most extreme level of hunger has declined in recent months, the international authority on hunger crises said Thursday. The findings come after the United States warned Israel that it might cut off military aid if its ally does not do more to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of people there are displaced from their homes and packed into squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters. In recent weeks Israel has once again ordered the evacuation of the northern third of Gaza, and it launched another major military operation there. It allowed no food to enter the north for roughly the first two weeks of October before resuming shipments on Monday. In a statement announcing a second shipment on Wednesday, the military said it will continue to act in accordance with international law 'to facilitate and ease the entry of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.' 86% of Gaza's population faces crisis-level hunger or worse The latest findings on hunger in Gaza were released by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, an initiative set up in 2004 during the famine in Somalia that involves more than a dozen U.N. agencies, aid organizations, governments and other groups. It has repeatedly warned of famine over the course of the yearlong war, which was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel. Over 1.8 million people, or around 86% of Gaza's population, are experiencing crisis levels of hunger, defined as Phase 3 or higher on the IPC's five-point scale. Some 133,000 people, or around 6%, are at Phase 5, the highest level, known as catastrophic hunger. That is down from earlier periods of the war, when nearly a third of the population was at Phase 5. The IPC warned the situation could rapidly deteriorate, and that it expects catastrophic hunger levels to double in the coming months. It cited a slowdown in aid in recent weeks, the onset of what is typically a cold and rainy winter, and the harsh conditions people face in crowded tent camps with little in the way of food, clean water or toilets. 'One year into the conflict, the risk of famine persists throughout the whole Gaza Strip as conflict intensifies and winter approaches,' it said in the report. Israel has controlled Gaza's entire land border since May. The Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs, known as COGAT, says it places no limits on humanitarian aid entering the territory and accuses U.N. agencies and aid groups of failing to promptly deliver it. Those groups say their efforts are severely hampered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and displacement, and the breakdown of law and order in many areas. Israel cut aid to the north for 2 weeks as it launched another offensive Israel allowed no food to enter northern Gaza for the first two weeks of October, according to the U.N.'s World Food Program, as it waged a major military operation there that is still ongoing. U.N. humanitarian officials said last week that aid entering Gaza is at its lowest level in months. Most residents of northern Gaza fled after evacuation warnings at the start of the war, and Israel has not allowed them to return. An estimated 400,000 people have remained there despite the harsh conditions. Palestinians say nowhere in the besieged territory feels safe. Many fear Israel will implement a surrender-or-starve plan proposed by former generals calling for a cutoff in aid, and for anyone who ignores evacuation orders to be classified as a militant. The Israeli government has not said whether it has adopted the plan, which rights groups say would violate international law. The IPC report said the latest evacuation orders 'have significantly disrupted humanitarian operations, and repeated displacements have steadily worn down people’s ability to cope and access food, water and medicine, deepening the vulnerability of entire communities.' In a letter over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Israel that if it did not increase the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza within the next 30 days it could risk losing U.S. weapons supplies for the ongoing wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. A similar letter sent in April — after an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers — led to an increase in humanitarian aid to the territory. But State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said this week that the supply dwindled again, falling by over 50% from its peak earlier this year. Israel has so far allowed two shipments into northern Gaza this week — a total of 80 trucks — and it says around 430 trucks have entered through the southern Kerem Shalom Crossing since the start of the month. That is far below the 350 trucks a day that the U.S. said were needed. The United States has spent nearly $18 billion on military aid to Israel since the war in Gaza began, according to a report for Brown University’s Costs of War project. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hunger-experts-say-the-risk-of-famine-in-gaza-remains-high/	2024-10-17T05:42:51-07:00	
Israel pressured by UN and US to step up action to tackle Gaza's ...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The top U.N. humanitarian official accused Israel on Wednesday of blocking the delivery of desperately needed aid to Gaza, and the U.S. ambassador demanded that its government step up efforts to tackle the Palestinian territory’s 'intolerable and catastrophic humanitarian crisis.' Acting humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya and U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield stepped up the pressure on Israel at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on the escalating humanitarian emergency, especially in northern Gaza. The council meeting, called by Algeria, the Arab representative on the council, followed a U.S. warning to Israel to boost aid efforts dramatically or risk losing funding for weapons from its main supplier. The Biden administration gave Israel 30 days to take a number of actions, including sending 350 trucks with food and other aid into Gaza every day. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon insisted that his country’s humanitarian efforts remain 'as comprehensive as ever' and criticized the council for focusing on the humanitarian situation in Gaza while Israeli civilians 'are being targeted daily by those who seek our destruction.' He said Israel has delivered over 1 million tons of aid, including 700,000 tons of food, to Gaza since it launched its military operation after Hamas’ surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Danon accused the international community of missing the real issue — which he said was Hamas’ hijacking of aid shipments while fellow Palestinians suffer. 'This makes it incredibly difficult to ensure that the aid reaches its intended recipients,' he said. But Israel remains committed to working with its partners to deliver aid, 'even under these dangerous and morally reprehensible conditions.' Msuya, the top U.N. aid official, painted a grim picture, telling the council that there is barely any food left in northern Gaza where an Israeli offensive is under way. No food entered the north from Oct. 2 to Oct. 15 'when a trickle was allowed in,' she said, and 'most bakeries will be forced to shut down again in the next several days without additional fuel.' Throughout Gaza, Msuya said, less than one-third of the 286 humanitarian missions coordinated with Israeli authorities in the first two weeks of October 'were facilitated without major incidents or delays.' The level of suffering in Gaza worsens every day, she said, as Israeli bombs continue to fall, fierce fighting continues, and 'supplies essential for people’s survival and humanitarian assistance are blocked at every turn.' Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, accused Israel of besieging, bombing and starving 400,000 Palestinians in northern Gaza as part of its all-out war against the Palestinian people. 'These are crimes,' he said. 'This is genocide. They must be stopped -- and they must be stopped now.' Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador, pointed to some new Israeli commitments since the U.S. warning and two dozen trucks entering northern Gaza for the first time in several weeks. But she said Israel’s progress since last week is 'insufficient' and stressed that it must follow through on its commitments, including opening more border crossings and routes and taking steps 'to help secure delivery routes against armed gangs involved in violent looting.' 'A `policy of starvation’ in northern Gaza would be horrific and unacceptable and would have implications under international law and U.S. law,' the U.S. ambassador warned. 'The government of Israel has said that this is not their policy, that food and other essential supplies will not be cut off, and we will be watching to see that Israel’s actions on the ground match this commitment.' At the council meeting, there were repeated calls by members for action by the U.N.’s most powerful body to end the more than yearlong war in Gaza. Guyana’s U.N. Ambassador Carolyn Rodrigues Birkett lamented that 47 Security Council meetings and four legally binding resolutions in the past year, including demands for a cease-fire, 'have not had the expected results, and the situation in Gaza continues to worsen with each passing day.' 'We must not allow the shredding of the moral and legal thread that holds our organization together,' she said. 'The most fundamental question then that this council faces is, what will we do to stop this tide?' Thomas-Greenfield urged all council members to support the U.N. as it works with Israel to step up aid deliveries. She said the U.S. focus in the coming months will be 'getting humanitarian aid in, getting hostages out, and ending the conflict.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-pressured-by-un-and-us-to-step-up-action-to-tackle-gazas-escalating-humanitarian-crisis/	2024-10-16T20:03:37-07:00	
NATO shows no sign of letting Ukraine join soon and wants more de...	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO showed no sign Wednesday it would invite Ukraine to join anytime soon as allies sought more information from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about his 'victory plan' for ending the war with Russia. The plan centers on a request for NATO to move forward on the 'accelerated' membership application that Zelenskyy made two years ago to seek protection under the military alliance's security umbrella after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. NATO’s credibility is based on its collective security guarantee, Article 5 of its founding treaty. It’s a commitment by all 32 member countries to come to the aid of any member whose sovereignty or territory might be under attack. However, it does not apply to a partner country like Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte declined to welcome the 'victory plan,' saying only that he and the allies 'take note' of it. He did not discuss when Ukraine might join the world’s biggest military alliance, beyond insisting that it would become a member. 'The plan has many aspects and many political and military issues we really need to hammer out with the Ukrainians to understand what is behind it, to see what we can do, what we cannot do,' Rutte said in his muted response at NATO headquarters in Brussels. 'We are in close contact with allies, with Ukraine, to see how we can take next steps,' he added. He declined to provide details about what more NATO wants to know, telling reporters only: 'I cannot give you all the insights about that.' For now, Rutte said, the focus must be on helping Ukraine to win back more territory and strengthen its hand for any future peace negotiations. Zelenskyy is due to explain elements of his plan on Thursday to leaders of the European Union, most of whom also stand among NATO's ranks. It all comes at a dark time for Ukraine. Its troops are struggling to hold off better manned and equipped Russian forces, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where they are gradually being pushed back. Kyiv is surviving with Western help, but Ukraine says it is coming too slowly. While outlining his plan on Wednesday, Zelenskyy told Ukrainian lawmakers that granting the country a NATO invitation would be a 'testament of (allies’) determination' to support its efforts. 'An invitation is a strong decision that requires nothing but determination,' he said. Ukraine’s future in NATO is something the alliance has weighed for 16 years. At their summit in Washington in July, the 32 members declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership. To the uninitiated, however, little seems to have progressed since NATO leaders promised Ukraine and Georgia in 2008 that 'these countries will become members of NATO' one day. For now, NATO is in a holding pattern. Its biggest and most powerful member, the United States, is facing a presidential election. European allies expect little movement on Ukraine until a new president takes office in January. Beyond that, the United States and European heavyweight Germany remain deeply concerned about being dragged into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia, and they lead a group of countries that oppose allowing Ukraine to join NATO until the conflict ends. In any case, NATO diplomats said, Ukraine’s borders would need to be clearly demarcated before it could join so that there can be no mistaking where the Article 5 guarantee would come into effect. Russian troops have seized about 20% of the country.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-nato-shows-no-sign-of-letting-ukraine-join-soon-and-wants-more-details-about-its-victory-plan/	2024-10-16T19:13:52-07:00	
Biden announces $425 million in Ukraine military aid	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) -- President Joe Biden announced an additional $425 million in military support for Ukraine, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lays out his plan to win the war with Russia. Zelenskyy said, if all goes according to plan, Ukraine can end the war with Russia within a year. He said it’s critical that Ukraine be accepted into NATO, but the NATO Secretary General would not commit. 'This is really a discussion which is ongoing between us and Ukraine,' said Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO. Zelenskyy has also accused North Korea of providing troops and ammunitions to Russia in their battle against Ukraine. 'We are still evaluating those reports. We are concerned by them,' said United States Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell. The White House said President Biden talked with Zelenskyy on Wednesday. The president goes to Germany on Thursday. 'Obviously, a big part of this meeting, of this travel that he’s doing, is going to be around Ukraine,' said White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. President Biden has promised unwavering support for Ukraine, but former president Donald Trump could bring a shift in U.S. policy. Trump has said he has a good relationship with Russian President Vladamir Putin. Trump would not answer, when asked if he has spoken with Putin since he left office. 'I don’t comment on that.

Zelenskyy's 'victory plan' includes a big hurdle for the West: An...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly acknowledged for the first time on Wednesday that Western partners are ramping up pressure to negotiate with Russia, hinting that such talks may not be favorable to Kyiv, as he unveiled to lawmakers the main points of his victory plan - his blueprint to pave the way for a just peace for Ukraine. Zelenskyy told the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s parliament, that in 'non-public communication with Ukraine,' partners are increasingly mentioning 'negotiations' and much less frequently using the word 'justice,' he said addressing lawmakers in Ukraine's Parliament. Zelenskyy said that Ukraine is not prepared for a 'frozen conflict' or any 'trade-offs involving territory or sovereignty,' which garnered a long applause. The victory plan, which has been shrouded in secrecy as Zelenskyy presented it to key allies in recent weeks, including U.S. President Joe Biden, is Ukraine's way to strengthen its hand in any future negotiation scenario with Russia as circumstances on the battefield appear bleak. The president also dialed up the stakes in Ukraine, repeating his recent claims that North Korea is now sending military personnel to help Russia’s war effort, as well as delivering ammunition, and that Iran and China are also aiding Moscow. His plan to win his country’s fight against Russia’s invasion could bring peace next year, Zelenksyy said, but it contains a step that some crucial Western allies have so far refused to countenance: inviting Ukraine to join NATO before the war ends. 'If we start moving according to this victory plan now, it may be possible to end the war no later than next year,' Zelenskyy said. The parliament will prioritize the bills needed to implement the plan, said Parliament Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk after Zelenskyy’s presentation. According to Stefanchuk, while the issue of NATO membership is political, it also requires the adoption of series of laws to match Ukraine to NATO standards. The first point in Zelenskyy’s five-point plan is an invitation to join NATO. 'We understand that NATO membership is a matter of the future, not the present,' he clarified. Ukrainian officials reckon an invitation would alter Putin's 'geopolitical calculations.' As he delivered his speech, the mood in Ukraine was grim. Ukraine’s troops are having trouble holding back Russia’s military might, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where they are gradually being pushed back. Though Russia’s gains have been incremental, its steady forward movement is slowly adding up and Ukraine keenly feels the need for more large-scale Western help. But there are signs that Western support may be diminished by a focus on the Middle East wars and domestic political concerns. The U.S. elections next month could bring a major shift in Ukraine’s fortunes, as Washington has been the biggest provider of military aid. Zelenskyy said granting Ukraine an invitation would be a 'testament of (allies’) determination' to support Ukraine. 'An invitation is a strong decision that requires nothing but determination,' he said. NATO’s collective security guarantee — Article 5 of its founding treaty — is the pillar on which its credibility is based. It is a political commitment by all member countries to come to the aid of any member whose sovereignty or territory might be under attack. At their summit in Washington in July, NATO’s 32 members declared Ukraine to be on an 'irreversible' path to membership. Any decision on offering to start membership talks is probably not likely before the next summit in the Netherlands in June. Despite his attempts to win approval for the plan from Western partners, none have yet publicly voiced their support. Lawmakers had a mixed reaction to the plan and whether it could be implemented. 'First of all, it’s not a plan. Plan means something with concrete steps. It’s kind of a wish list from Ukraine for our partners, how they can and should support us. And it doesn’t look realistic. We were waiting for some real serious conversation about the situation and the strategy, and this is not that,' said Oleksii Honcharenko, a lawmaker from an opposition party. He added that delivering a plan purported to be about victory as Russia advances along the eastern front is 'contradictory.' 'It’s realistic and rather pragmatic plan. It can be implemented if we have enough aid and support from our allies and partners,' said Oleksandr Merezhko, an MP with Zelenskyy’s party. 'One of the key issues is invitation from NATO to join the Alliance. In itself it would be a huge strategic defeat for Putin. 'I also liked that president talked about those things which can be lucrative for the West, explaining why Ukraine might be of great value for Europe and the West from geopolitical and economic economic points of view,' he added. 'And the question is on whose side will be these resources: on the side of the democratic states or on the side of the authoritarian regimes.' Even as Zelenskyy was presenting his plan to Ukrainian lawmakers, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov shrugged it off as 'ephemeral,' saying mockingly that 'most likely, it’s the U.S. plan to fight us until the last Ukrainian, which Zelenskyy camouflaged and called a ‘peace plan.’' Zelenskyy’s 'victory plan' contains confidential sections which he didn’t mention in Parliament. Other aspects of the plan include continued striking of targets on Russian soil, including the incursion into Russia’s Kursk border region that began in August and permission to use long-range missiles to target military infrastructure deep inside Russian territory. Ukraine, he said, also needs more air defense systems and assistance from partners to shoot down Russian missiles. It also requested access to a broader range of intelligence from allies. Zelenskyy noted that Ukraine is rich in natural resources, including critically important metals 'worth trillions of U.S. dollars,' such as uranium, titanium, lithium, graphite and others. Those Ukrainian assets, as well as the country’s agricultural production, are among Russia’s key targets in the war, he said, but could be shared in postwar times with partners. Also in a postwar period, battle-hardened Ukrainian troops would be an asset for NATO efforts to keep Russia at bay. ___ Associated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed. ___ Follow AP's coverage at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-zelenskyy-to-unveil-victory-plan-to-ukrainian-lawmakers-after-presenting-it-to-western-allies/	2024-10-16T06:21:34-07:00	
Israeli strikes kill 21 in Lebanon, including in a town with a da...	QANA, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli airstrikes pounded areas across Lebanon, killing at least 21 people, officials said Wednesday, including more than a dozen in a southern town where Israeli bombardments in previous conflicts are seared into local memory. Elsewhere in the south, a city’s mayor was among the dead in a strike that Lebanese officials said targeted a meeting coordinating relief efforts. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strikes late Tuesday on the southern town of Qana, where 15 people were killed. Associated Press photos and video of the scene showed several flattened buildings and others with their top floors collapsed. Rescue workers carried away the remains of dead people and used a bulldozer to remove rubble, as they searched for more victims. In 1996, Israeli artillery shelling on a United Nations compound housing hundreds of displaced people in Qana killed at least 100 civilians and wounded scores more people, including four U.N. peacekeepers. During the 2006 war, an Israeli strike on a residential building killed nearly three dozen people, a third of them children. Israel said at the time that it struck a Hezbollah rocket launcher behind the building. 'Qana always gets its share,' Mayor Mohammed Krasht told the AP, referring to the town’s grim history. Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, meanwhile accused Israel of 'intentionally targeting' a municipal council meeting to discuss relief efforts in Nabatiyeh, where six people were killed. 'What solution can be hoped for in light of this reality?' he asked in a statement. The Israeli military said it targeted Hezbollah command centers and weapons facilities that had been embedded in civilian areas of Nabatiyeh in Wednesday’s strikes, without providing evidence. Israel also resumed its barrage on Beirut’s southern suburbs after a six-day pause, hitting what it said was an arms warehouse under an apartment building, without providing evidence. The military warned residents to evacuate before the strike, and there were no reports of casualties. Israel resumes strikes on Beirut The strikes on southern Beirut came after Mikati said the United States had given him assurances that Israel would curb its strikes on the capital. Hezbollah has a strong presence in southern Beirut, known as the Dahiyeh, which is also a residential and commercial area home to large numbers of civilians and people unaffiliated with the militant group. The Israeli military posted an evacuation warning on the social media platform X ahead of the strike in Beirut. An Associated Press photographer saw three airstrikes in the area, the first coming less than an hour after the notice. In Nabatiyeh, more than half a dozen strikes hit the city and surrounding areas, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, which said at least six people were killed and 43 wounded, with rescue efforts still underway. The city's mayor, Ahmad Kahil, was among those killed, provincial governor Huwaida Turk told The Associated Press. In his statement about Nabatiyeh, Mikati, the caretaker prime minister, said the international community has been 'deliberately silent' about Israeli strikes that have killed civilians. U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert called reports of Kahlil's death 'alarming.' 'This attack follows other incidents in which civilians and civilian infrastructure have been targeted across Lebanon,' she said. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, following the surprise Hamas attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza. A year of low-level fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border escalated into all-out war last month, and Israel invaded Lebanon at the start of October. Israeli airstrikes have killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his senior commanders, and Israel has vowed to continue its offensive until its citizens can safely return to communities near the border. Some 2,300 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon since last October, more than three-quarters of them in the past month, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The fighting has displaced some 1.2 million people in Lebanon. Hezbollah's rocket attacks, which have extended their range and grown more intense over the past month, have driven around 60,000 Israelis from their homes in the north. The attacks have killed nearly 60 people in Israel, around half of them soldiers. Hezbollah has said it will keep up its attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but that appears increasingly remote after months of negotiations brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar sputtered to a halt. Palestinians say 350 bodies recovered from Israeli operation in Gaza Israel is still at war in Gaza more than a year after Hamas' attack, in which some 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and another 250 were abducted. Around 100 captives are still being held, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel has been carrying out a major operation for more than a week in Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp in the territory's north dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to Jabaliya and other areas after saying that Hamas militants had regrouped. Hospitals have received around 350 bodies since the offensive began on Oct. 6, according to Dr. Mounir al-Boursh, the director-general of Gaza's Health Ministry. He told the AP that more than half the dead were women and children, and that many bodies remain in the streets and under the rubble, with rescue teams unable to reach them because of Israeli strikes. 'Entire families have disappeared,' he said. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 people, according to the Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but says more than half were women and children. The offensive has left large areas in ruins and displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people, forcing hundreds of thousands into crowded tent camps or schools-turned-shelters. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut and Magdy from Cairo.

US official warns of growing North Korean military support for Ru...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Wednesday that Washington and its allies are 'alarmed' by North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats as well as its increasing military support for Russia's war in Ukraine, but said he couldn’t confirm Ukrainian claims that Pyongyang was also sending soldiers to fight for Moscow. Campbell spoke with reporters following discussions with South Korean and Japanese counterparts on reinvigorating an international pressure campaign against North Korea, which faltered in recent years amid a deepening divide at the U.N. Security Council. Earlier on Wednesday, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo announced plans with eight Western governments to launch a new multinational team to monitor the enforcement of sanctions against North Korea. Russia in March vetoed a U.N. resolution in a move that effectively abolished monitoring by U.N. experts of Security Council sanctions against North Korea, which prompted Western accusations that Moscow was acting to shield its arms purchases from Pyongyang to fuel its war in Ukraine. Campbell said there are signs that North Korea was increasing its support of materials, including artillery and missiles, to support Russia’s war on Ukraine, which he said was 'creating further instability in Europe.' He said the U.S. was still evaluating reports that North Korea was also sending personnel. 'We are concerned by them and ... we agreed that we will continue to monitor the situation closely,' Campbell said about the claims. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has claimed that North Korea is sending military personnel to help Russia’s war effort without providing details. Ukrainian media reported earlier this month that six North Koreans were among those killed after a Ukrainian missile strike on Oct. 3. North Korea has also been making increasingly provocative threats against rival South Korea, including accusing the South of infiltrating drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang and threatening to attack the South if it happens again. North Korea also on Tuesday blew up the northern sections of unused road and rail routes that once linked it with South Korea, in a choreographed demolition aimed at demonstrating its growing anger with South Korea’s conservative government. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have spiked since 2022 as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used Russia’s war on Ukraine as a window to dial up his weapons testing activities and threats. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have strengthened their combined military exercises in response and took steps to sharpen their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets. Following his talks with Campbell and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Masataka Okano, South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Hong Kyun said that the countries condemn the North’s 'intentional moves to create tensions.' 'We have agreed to maintain a solid South Korea-U.S. combined posture to respond firmly to North Korean provocations and strengthen security cooperation through close coordination between South Korea, the U.S., and Japan,' Kim said.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-senior-us-official-warns-of-north-korean-nuclear-threats-and-help-for-russia/	2024-10-16T05:21:25-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli jets strike Beirut's southern suburbs	Israeli jets struck Beirut's southern suburbs early Wednesday for the first time in six days, Lebanese state media reported. Israel says it is striking Hezbollah assets in the suburbs, where the militant group has a strong presence, but is also a busy residential and commercial area. The casualty count was not yet clear. Hezbollah acting leader Sheikh Naim Kassem declared Tuesday that the Lebanese militant group will ramp up attacks on Israel in response to an Israeli airstrike Monday on an apartment building in northern Lebanon that killed at least 22 people. Israel said it struck a target belonging to Hezbollah, but the United Nations called Tuesday for an independent investigation. Israel has escalated its campaign against Hezbollah in recent weeks, after a year of near-daily exchanges of cross-border fire. It’s been more than a year since Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. In northern Gaza, Israel has been waging an air and ground campaign in Jabaliya for more than a week, leaving families trapped in their shelters. United States President Joe Biden’s administration warned Israel that it must increase the amount of humanitarian aid it allows into Gaza within the next 30 days or risk losing access to American weapons funding. ___ Here's the latest: Israel strikes Beirut's southern suburbs BEIRUT — Israeli jets struck the southern suburbs of Beirut early Wednesday for the first time in six days, Lebanese state media reported. The casualty count was not yet clear. The attack comes just one day after caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the United States government gave him some assurances of Israel easing its strikes in the Lebanese capital. Israel says it is striking Hezbollah assets in the suburbs, where the militant group has a strong presence, but is also a busy residential and commercial area. The Israeli military said the Wednesday strike hit a weapons warehouse stored under a residential building. The Israeli military posted an evacuation warning on X, formerly Twitter, saying it is targeting a building in the Haret Hreik neighborhood. An Associated Press photographer who witnessed the strikes said there were three in the area. The first strike was documented less than an hour after the notice. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8 in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, following their surprise attack on southern Israel. Almost one year of low-level fighting has turned into all-out war and displaced some 1.2 million people in Lebanon. Elsewhere, Israeli strikes late Tuesday in the southern town of Qana killed 10 people and wounded 15 others, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency. EU official says calls for a cease-fire have not been heard MANILA, Philippines — A European Union official expressed regret over the failure so far of efforts to forge a cease-fire in the Middle East, saying that fighting between Israel and the Hezbollah has made it more difficult to work for wide-ranging reforms in Lebanon and create conditions to draw international financial aid in. EU Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič told The Associated Press in an interview late Tuesday in Manila that stalled reforms in Lebanon include the election of a new president, the establishment of a working government and the signing of a deal with the International Monetary Fund. 'It’s difficult to see that happening in these circumstances when Lebanon is under such a strain,' said Lenarčič, who flew to Manila to attend an Asia Pacific conference on disaster mitigation. 'That’s one of the reasons why we’re calling for a cease-fire, so as to allow Lebanon to organize itself so that it can benefit from all the funding which is out there,' he said. 'I regret that we have not been heard.' The EU was also extremely concerned over the killings of civilians in the fighting between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. 'This collateral damage is simply unacceptable,' Lenarčič said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-jets-strike-beiruts-southern-suburbs/	2024-10-15T22:56:40-07:00	
Man to row across the Pacific Ocean to honor victims of war in Uk...	SAN DIEGO (KSWB/KUSI) — A man set sail on what could be a historic 8-month journey across the Pacific Ocean from San Diego to Australia in a solo rowing boat Monday night. If he succeeds, 44-year-old Aurimas Mockus from Lithuania will be the first person in the world to complete the 12,000-kilometer (nearly 8,000 mile) trip alone in a rowing boat, without help or stops. Mockus was seen off by a crowd of supporters at Shelter Island in San Diego Monday afternoon. His plan is to sail — or rather, row — to Brisbane in Queensland, Australia, in a single-seater boat. The boat itself has already been on quite the journey. It was built in Ukraine, modified in Lithuania, and shipped to California just in time for Monday night's launch. Aurimas Mockus to journey across the Pacific Ocean from San Diego to Australia in solo rowing boat (FOX 5/KUSI) Aurimas Mockus to journey across the Pacific Ocean from San Diego to Australia in solo rowing boat (FOX 5/KUSI) Mockus began preparations for the trip back in the fall 2023, according to his website. After several steps, like boat preparations and swimming preparations in the spring and summer of 2024, he is now ready for the journey that he expects will take until March or May 2025. Few and far between: Rare comet streams across San Diego sky The community was invited to see him off at the Shelter Island Boat Ramp on Monday from noon until he set sail around 6 p.m. You can follow his progress during his entire journey at share.garmin.com/KURSIS. As of Tuesday afternoon, he was about 20 miles from the boat ramp. Mockus' website says he sails with the message 'Lithuania stands together' and aims to honor 'Ukrainians who died in the war and to remind the world that we cannot stop helping the country fighting for the freedom of us all.' He is raising money for his trip with a GoFundMe, 'Solo across the Pacific Ocean: row for Ukraine.' Funds raised will go to the organization founded by Mockus to help him complete his journey. 'Everything is possible if you want,' Mockus said. 'The best news I can hope for is when the journey is over is to hear that the war in Ukraine is over.'

US warns Israel to boost humanitarian aid into Gaza or risk losin...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration has warned Israel that it must increase the amount of humanitarian aid it is allowing into Gaza within the next 30 days or it could risk losing access to U.S. weapons funding. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned their Israeli counterparts in a letter dated Sunday that the changes must occur. The letter, which restates U.S. policy toward humanitarian aid and arms transfers, was sent amid deteriorating conditions in northern Gaza and an Israeli airstrike on a hospital tent site in central Gaza that killed at least four people and burned others. A similar letter that Blinken sent to Israeli officials in April led to more humanitarian assistance getting to the Palestinian territory, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday. But that has not lasted. 'In fact, it’s fallen by over 50% from where it was at its peak,' Miller said at a briefing. Blinken and Austin 'thought it was appropriate to make clear to the government of Israel that there are changes that they need to make again, to see that the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up from the very, very low levels that it is at today.' For Israel to continue qualifying for foreign military financing, the level of aid getting into Gaza must increase to at least 350 trucks a day, Israel must institute additional humanitarian pauses and provide increased security for humanitarian sites, Austin and Blinken said in their letter. They said Israel had 30 days to respond to the requirements. 'The letter was not meant as a threat,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters. 'The letter was simply meant to reiterate the sense of urgency we feel and the seriousness with which we feel it, about the need for an increase, a dramatic increase in humanitarian assistance.' An Israeli official confirmed a letter had been delivered but did not discuss the contents. That official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a diplomatic matter, confirmed the U.S. had raised 'humanitarian concerns' and was putting pressure on Israel to speed up the flow of aid into Gaza. The letter, which an Axios reporter posted a copy of online, was sent during a period of growing frustration in the administration that despite repeated and increasingly vocal requests to scale back offensive operations against Hamas, Israel’s bombardment has led to unnecessary civilian deaths and risks plunging the region into a much wider war. 'We are particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government, including halting commercial imports, denying or impeding 90 percent of humanitarian movements' and other restrictions have kept aid from flowing, Blinken and Austin said. The Biden administration is increasing its calls for its ally and biggest recipient of U.S. military aid to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza while assuring that America's support for Israel is unwavering just before the U.S. presidential election in three weeks. Funding for Israel has long carried weight in U.S. politics, and Biden said this month that 'no administration has helped Israel more than I have.' Humanitarian aid groups fear that Israeli leaders may approve a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas, which could trap hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who are unwilling or unable to leave their homes without food, water, medicine and fuel. U.N. humanitarian officials said last week that aid entering Gaza is at its lowest level in months. The three hospitals operating minimally in northern Gaza are facing 'dire shortages' of fuel, trauma supplies, medications and blood, and while meals are being delivered each day, food is dwindling, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. 'There is barely any food left to distribute, and most bakeries will be forced to shut down again in just days without any additional fuel,' he said. The U.N. humanitarian office reported that Israeli authorities facilitated just one of its 54 efforts to get to the north this month, Dujarric said. He said 85% of the requests were denied, with the rest impeded or canceled for logistical or security reasons. COGAT, the Israeli body facilitating aid crossings into Gaza, denied that crossings to the north have been closed. U.S. officials said the letter was sent to remind Israel of both its obligations under international humanitarian law and of the Biden administration’s legal obligation to ensure that the delivery of American humanitarian assistance should not be hindered, diverted or held up by a recipient of U.S. military aid. Israel’s retaliatory offensive since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas has killed over 42,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians but has said a little more than half the dead are women and children. The Hamas attacks killed some 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and militants abducted another 250. The United States has spent a record of at least $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel since the war in Gaza began and led to escalating conflict around the Middle East, according to a report for Brown University’s Costs of War project. That aid has enabled Israel to purchase billions of dollars worth of munitions it has used in its operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. However, many of those strikes also have killed civilians in both areas. ___ AP reporter Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Edith M.

Middle East latest: Top leaders attend an Iranian Revolutionary G...	The funeral of an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general killed alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah drew the largest crowd of top leaders in the paramilitary organization together Tuesday for the first time since Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel. Rumors circulated for weeks over the status of the head of the Guard's expeditionary arm, Gen. Esmail Qaani, but the Quds Force leader was seen in a black bomber jacket wiping away tears early Tuesday morning at the body repatriation at Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes in the southern Gaza Strip killed at least 15 people overnight, including six children and two women, Palestinian medical officials said Tuesday. In northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging an air and ground campaign in Jabaliya for more than a week, residents said families were still trapped in their homes and shelters. It’s been more than a year since Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. In solidarity with Hamas, Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has exchanged cross-border fire with Israel almost daily for the past year. Israel escalated its campaign against the group in recent weeks. ___ Here's the latest: Hezbollah's acting leader says the group is focused on ‘hurting the enemy’ BEIRUT — Hezbollah’s deputy chief and acting leader, Sheikh Naim Kassem, said in a televised speech Tuesday that the group is now focused on 'hurting the enemy,' exemplified by targeting the Israeli city of Haifa and areas beyond it, including Tel Aviv. The pre-recorded speech marked his third appearance since Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed by an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Sept. 27. 'We will defeat our enemies and drive them out of our lands,' Kassem said. He accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of seeking a 'new Middle East' aligned with Israeli and American interests. He urged Hezbollah supporters to remain steadfast amid Israeli attacks. 'Our hope for victory is limitless,' he said. 'I give you good news that we are the ones who will hold the enemy’s reins and return it to the fold.' Addressing Israelis, Kassem said that a cease-fire is the only solution to return residents of northern Israel to their homes. 'We are not seeking a cease-fire because we are weak,' he said. If Israel continues its bombardment and ground invasion in Lebanon, he said that Hezbollah’s strikes will expand over a geographically wider area and 'more than 2 million will be in danger.' Israeli officials have said the operation in Lebanon is intended to push back Hezbollah and return displaced Israelis to their homes. Kassem linked the ongoing conflict in Lebanon to the broader struggle of the Palestinians, and to the ongoing war in Gaza. 'We cannot separate Lebanon from Palestine, or Palestine from the world,' he said. A team of US troops supporting a missile defense system arrives in Israel JERUSALEM — A team of American troops supporting a missile defense system in Israel has arrived in the country, the U.S. military said. A statement from Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder announced the team’s arrival in Israel on Monday. They’ll operate a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery there to defend against ballistic missile attacks from Iran. Tehran has launched two missile attacks on Israel as the wars in Gaza and Lebanon rage. 'Over the coming days, additional U.S. military personnel and THAAD battery components will continue to arrive in Israel,' Ryder said. 'The battery will be fully operational capable in the near future, but for operations security reasons we will not discuss timelines.' Iran has warned U.S. troops would be in harm’s way if Iran launches another attack on Israel. Thousands vaccinated against polio in Gaza as the campaign enters a second phase GENEVA — The U.N. health agency says more than 92,000 children aged under 10 in central Gaza received doses of novel oral polio vaccine as a second phase of a vaccination campaign got underway. World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters Tuesday that the kick-off a day earlier to the second round of polio vaccinations was part of efforts to reach over 179,000 kids in central Gaza – and over 590,000 across the entire strip. 'What we have received from colleagues is that the vaccination went without major issues yesterday,' he told reporters at a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva. He expressed hopes that a 'humanitarian pause' will be respected in north and south Gaza over the next six-to-eight days. Jasarevic said 92,821 children aged under 10 received the vaccine on Monday, the first day of the new phase of the vaccination campaign. 'No one wants to see any child paralyzed (because of polio),' Jasarevic said. 'But there are so many other problems that people in Gaza are facing, and we need sustained access.' A police officer killed and 4 civilians wounded in a shooting in central Israel JERUSALEM — Israeli police say one officer was killed and four civilians were wounded in a shooting Tuesday on a highway in central Israel. Police did not immediately provide the identity of the shooter, but police spokeswoman, Mirit Ben Mayor, said that it was a militant attack. Police said the attacker approached the highway and shot the officer before firing on civilians, wounding four. The attacker was then shot by a paramedic arriving on the scene, Israel’s rescue services said, without saying whether the attacker was killed. The shooting occurred on a two-lane highway near the city of Yavne, just south of Tel Aviv. Ohad Yehezkeli, a spokesperson for nearby Assuta Hospital, said the officer died on the way there and another civilian was being treated for moderate injuries. He said two more wounded people were being transported to the hospital. Palestinians have carried out dozens of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel has ramped up military operations in the occupied West Bank, killing more than 750 Palestinians. Most have been killed during gunbattles with the army or violent protests, but the dead also include civilian bystanders. Iran's general threatens Israelis at a funeral in Tehran DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A general in Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard directly threatened the lives of Israelis during a funeral service in Tehran for a general slain alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The comment from Gen. Ali Fadavi, a deputy commander in chief of the Guard, comes as Iran awaits a threatened retaliation by Israel over its Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack. 'That land is a small land. It’s not even as big as one of Iran’s small provinces,' Fadavi said. 'If we will, we can obliterate all the Zionists.' Iranian officials routinely refer to Israelis as 'Zionists.' The Guard’s leadership attended a funeral service for Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, who was killed alongside Nasrallah in an airstrike in Beirut. Guard leaders and others in Iran’s theocracy have threatened to destroy Israel in the past during the more than four decades since the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israeli police accuse Hamas operatives in Turkey for August attack in Tel Aviv JERUSALEM — Israeli police accused Hamas operatives in Turkey of directing a militant attack in August in Tel Aviv in which an explosive went off on a busy street, killing the attacker and wounding a bystander. There was no immediate comment from Turkey. Relations between the two countries have plunged since the start of the war in Gaza. Turkey has long provided political support for Hamas, including welcoming its top leaders on visits, but denies involvement in its military activities. The bomb appeared to have gone off before it was planned to, and it was unclear if the attacker had planned to carry out a suicide bombing or plant the explosives. Both Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group claimed the attack. Police said Tuesday that they filed indictments against eight suspects. They said the attacker was a militant from Nablus, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, who had been directed by an operative in Turkey. They said one of the attack planners had traveled to Turkey several times for explosives training, and that a raid in Nablus uncovered more bombs and funds transferred from Turkey. The police did not provide evidence. 'The findings of this investigation clearly indicate the establishment of Hamas headquarters in Turkey and their extensive efforts abroad to incite violence and carry out bombings in Israel,' the police statement said. First responders recover 11 bodies from a destroyed home in northern Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian first responders say they recovered 11 bodies, nearly all women and children, from a home destroyed in an airstrike in northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging an air and ground operation for over a week. The Gaza Health Ministry’s ambulance service said the dead recovered Tuesday were all from the same family and included seven women and three children. Fares Abu Hamza, head of the emergency service, said ambulances were only able to reach the area in the Jabaliya refugee camp around 12 hours after the airstrike late Monday. He said funeral prayers for the dead, which included a medic killed in Jabaliya, were held Tuesday in the courtyard of the Kamal Adwan Hospital. First responders from the Civil Defense said its teams evacuated three families Tuesday who were stuck inside their homes in Jabaliya for several days because of heavy fighting. Since the start of the war, the Israeli military has carried out several large operations in Jabaliya — a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation — only to return months later after saying militants had regrouped there. Israel launched a large operation there on Oct. 6. Top leaders are among those mourning an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The funeral of an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general killed alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah drew the largest crowd of top leaders in the paramilitary organization together Tuesday for the first time since Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel. The Guard’s leadership hasn’t been as visible in the two weeks since Iran’s Oct. 1 attack on Israel. The Guard is the main power behind Iran’s theocracy and oversees its arsenal of ballistic missiles — which would be crucial in any future attack on Israel. At the funeral in Tehran for Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, the Guard’s chief commander, Gen. Hossein Salami, attended alongside President Masoud Pezeshkian and the head of the country’s judiciary. Other Guard generals also attended, including Gen. Esmail Qaani of the Guard’s expeditionary Quds Force, about whom rumors had circulated for days regarding his status after the strike that killed Nasrallah. At least two prominent Guard generals were not on hand: Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of Guard’s aerospace division that oversees its missile program, and Gen. Ali Reza Tangsiri, commander of the Guard’s navy, did not attend. Iran offered no explanation for their absence, though Israel has threatened to carry out a serious retaliatory strike against Iran. Israeli strikes on south Gaza kill at least 15 overnight DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes in the southern Gaza Strip killed at least 15 people overnight, including six children and two women, Palestinian medical officials said Tuesday. A strike early Tuesday hit a house in the southern town of Beni Suhaila, killing at least 10 people from one extended family, according to Nasser Hospital in nearby Khan Younis. The dead include three children and one woman, according to hospital records. An Associated Press camera operator at the hospital counted the bodies. In the nearby town of Fakhari, a strike hit a house early Tuesday, killing five people, including three children and a woman, according to the European Hospital, where the casualties were taken. The Israeli military rarely comments on individual strikes. It says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas, accusing the militants of sheltering in civilian areas. Israeli bombardment around Jabaliya leaves family trapped DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — In northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging an air and ground campaign in Jabaliya for more than a week, residents said families were still trapped in their homes and shelters Tuesday. Adel al-Deqes said his relatives tried to move to another place in Jabaliya in the morning, but the military shelled them. 'We don’t know who died and who is still alive,' he said. Ahmed Awda, another Jabaliya resident, said they heard 'constant bombing and gunfire' overnight and Tuesday morning. He said the military destroyed many buildings in the eastern and northern parts of the camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. 'They bombed many buildings; some of them empty buildings,' he said. Iranian paramilitary leader whose status was in question is shown on state TV DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The head of the expeditionary arm of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has appeared in television footage aired Tuesday by Iranian state television. Rumors circulated for weeks over Gen. Esmail Qaani’s status in the time since an Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut in late September. But Qaani, the head of the Quds Force, was seen in a black bomber jacket, wiping away tears at an event early Tuesday morning at Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport. While Iranian state television did not acknowledge the rumors, it made a point to film Qaani for over a minute and later share the footage from the airport ceremony online. Qaani was on hand for the repatriation to Iran of the body of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, 58, who was killed in the airstrike. Australia puts sanctions and travel bans on 5 Iranians WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Australia’s government has imposed targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on five Iranians contributing to the country’s missile defense program, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Tuesday. Iran’s launch of at least 180 ballistic missiles against Israel on Oct. 1 was 'a dangerous escalation that increased the risk of a wider regional war,' Wong said in a statement. The fresh sanctions target two directors and a senior official in Iran’s Aerospace Industries Organization, the director of the Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group, and the commercial director of the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group. The decision brings to 200 the number of Iran-linked individuals and entities now sanctioned by Australia. 'Australia will continue to hold Iran to account for its reckless and destabilizing actions,' Wong said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-strikes-on-southern-gaza-kill-at-least-15-people-overnight/	2024-10-15T06:08:34-07:00	
UN Security Council voices 'strong concern' for UN peacekeepers a...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. Security Council expressed 'strong concern' Monday as Israel has fired on and wounded U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon during intensified fighting, reiterating its support for their role in supporting security in the region. It's the first statement by the U.N.’s most powerful body since Israel's attacks on the positions of the peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL began last week, drawing international condemnation. U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told reporters that Secretary-General António Guterres confirmed Monday that peacekeepers will remain in all their positions even as Israel has urged the peacekeepers to move 5 kilometers (3 miles) north during its ground invasion in Lebanon. Israel has been escalating its campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon across a U.N.-drawn boundary between the two countries. The sides have been clashing since the Iranian-backed militant group started firing rockets a year ago in solidarity with its ally Hamas in Gaza. Hamas' deadly attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, launched the war. The Security Council statement, issued after emergency closed consultations on Lebanon, did not name either Israel, Lebanon or Hezbollah. Read by Swiss U.N. Ambassador Pascale Baeriswyl, the council's current president, it urges all parties 'to respect the safety and security of UNIFIL personnel and U.N. premises.' The 15-member Security Council has been deeply divided over the war in Gaza, with the United States defending its ally Israel as support for the Palestinians has grown among members and casualties have escalated. The Biden administration has become more critical of civilian deaths as well as the recent attacks on UNIFIL. US. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told reporters that 'it’s good that the council can speak with one voice on what’s on the minds of all people around the world right now — and it’s the situation in Lebanon.' The council's statement sends a message to the Lebanese people 'that the council cares, that the council is watching this issue and that the council today spoke with one voice,' Wood said. Council members also expressed 'deep concern' at civilian casualties and suffering, the destruction of civilian infrastructure and the rising number of internally displaced people. More than 1,400 people in Lebanon, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million displaced in the past month. Around 60 Israelis have been killed in Hezbollah strikes in the past year. Israel says it wants to drive the militant group away from the border so some 60,000 displaced Israelis can return to their homes. The Security Council statement called on all parties to abide by international humanitarian law, which requires the protection of civilians. Council members also called for the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war 'and recognized the need for further practical measures to achieve that outcome.' That resolution calls for the Lebanese army to deploy throughout the south and for all armed groups, including Hezbollah, to be disarmed — neither of which has happened in the past 18 years. Lacroix, the undersecretary-general for peace operations, told reporters after his closed briefing to the Security Council that five UNIFIL peacekeepers have been injured in recent days and that the U.N. has protested to Israel. Israel has indicated 'investigations will be carried out regarding some of these incidents ... and we will see what comes out of this,' he said. Israeli Army spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani asserted Sunday that Israel has tried to maintain constant contact with UNIFIL and that any instance of U.N. forces being harmed will be investigated at 'the highest level.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for UNIFIL to heed Israel’s warnings to evacuate, accusing them of 'providing a human shield' to Hezbollah. 'We regret the injury to the UNIFIL soldiers, and we are doing everything in our power to prevent this injury. But the simple and obvious way to ensure this is simply to get them out of the danger zone,' he said Sunday in a video addressed to the U.N. secretary-general, who has been banned from entering Israel. Lacroix on Monday stressed that all parties have a responsibility to ensure the safety and security of the peacekeepers. He also said it’s important that the peacekeepers stay in their positions 'because we all hope there will be a return to the negotiation table, and that there will be finally a real effort to full implementation of resolution 1701.' —— This story Corrects the first name of the U.N. peacekeeping chief in the third paragraph to Jean-Pierre Lacroix	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-un-security-council-voices-strong-concern-for-un-peacekeepers-after-israeli-attacks/	2024-10-14T19:34:05-07:00	
Remembrance ceremony honors Wadee Alfayoumi, boy killed in allege...	CHICAGO — A remembrance ceremony set for Monday night will honor the life of a six-year-old boy one year after he was allegedly stabbed by his landlord in what authorities called a hate crime. Scheduled to be held at the Muslim Community Center on Elston Avenue, the vigil marks one year since the passing of Wadee Alfayoumi, who lived in Plainfield with his mother. The child’s mother was also stabbed but survived the attack. PREVIOUS: Man accused of stabbing 6-year-old to death, injuring mother over being Muslim; FBI involved A lover of Legos, soccer, and basketball, loved ones say Wadee's life was cut short after a knock at the door of his Plainfield home, which he shared with his mother, Hanan Shaheen. Once the boy's mother answered, prosecutors say 71-year-old Joseph Czuba launched a vicious attack. Czuba remains in custody while awaiting trial on multiple felony charges, including murder and attempted murder. He pleaded not guilty. Shaheen told authorities Czuba's anger stemmed from the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war days earlier. Authorities agree the victims were targeted because of their Muslim faith, with the US Senate unanimously passing a resolution just last month honoring Wadee's life. President Joe Biden released a statement Monday, saying in part that, 'One year later, we continue to think about them. We are grateful for Hanan’s recovery and her powerful voice for peace. But we know the hole in their heart that remains without their beloved son. Days like this are hard because it brings it all back. We keep them in our hearts.' WGN Investigates: Investigating public corruption, crime & fraud Biden's statement goes on to reaffirm the nation's commitment to countering hate in all forms.

U.S. to send troops and air defense system to Israel	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) -- The Pentagon announced the U.S. military will send a Terminal High Altitude Defense battery and about 100 U.S. troops to Israel. The battery is a defensive system that shoots down incoming ballistic missiles. 'To defend Israel,' said President Joe Biden, when asked why he was sending the assistance to the Middle East. U.S. officials said the missile defense system is in response to Iranian missile strikes on Israel in April and October. Israel is now at war with two Iran-backed groups. It’s fighting Hamas, the organization responsible for the Oct. 7 attack, in Gaza, and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Over the weekend, Israel struck a hospital courtyard in Gaza, killing at least four people. Israel also traded strikes with Hezbollah. An Israeli strike in Northern Lebanon killed 21. A Hezbollah attack killed four Israeli troops. 'We will continue to strike Hezbollah without mercy everywhere in Lebanon – including Beirut,' said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Michigan and Georgia have high Arab American populations, and they’re both key states in this year’s election. A poll by the Arab American Institute shows the Biden administration’s handling of the war has lost Democrats support from a group that usually votes in their favor, by a 2-to-1 margin. This year’s poll shows former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris essentially tied among Arab American voters.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/u-s-to-send-troops-and-air-defense-system-to-israel/	2024-10-14T14:01:38-07:00	
Hezbollah's drones are a fierce and evasive threat to Israel	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — One of the worst mass casualty strikes on Israel in a year of war came not from dozens of Iranian ballistic missiles nor the repeated barrages of rocket fire launched by Hamas and Hezbollah. Instead, it was a single drone. The unmanned aerial vehicle, laden with explosives, evaded Israel's multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. It’s the latest achievement for Hezbollah’s drone fleet and has shined a light on Israel’s struggle over the past year of war to knock down unmanned aircraft incoming from as far away as Yemen, Iraq and Iran. Over the years, Israel has built up its aerial defense array to provide broad protection against short-range rocket fire and medium- and long-range missiles, although experts caution it is not airtight. While the system has taken down drones repeatedly, many have penetrated Israel's airspace and sidestepped its defenses, in some cases with deadly results. The drone traversed Israeli airspace unimpeded On Sunday evening, reports emerged of a mass casualty event about 65 kilometers (40 miles) from the Lebanese border. A drone had slammed into a mess hall filled with troops eating dinner, according to Israeli media, killing four soldiers and wounding 67 people. Minutes earlier, air raid sirens had blared in northern Israel as the aircraft flew overhead. But no sirens sounded at the base, giving the soldiers no advance warning and indicating that the drone may have fallen off Israel’s radar. An Israeli security official said Israel was still investigating how the drone made it through Israel’s air defenses. A pair of drones initially entered Israeli airspace, but while one was shot down, the other one continued to its target. Hezbollah, which said the attack was in response to Israeli strikes in Lebanon, said the drone was 'able to penetrate the Israeli air defense radars without being detected' and reach its target. It claimed it had outsmarted Israel's air defenses by simultaneously launching dozens of missiles and 'squadrons' of drones simultaneously. It was the second deadly drone strike in just two weeks. Earlier this month, a drone launched from Iraq killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded roughly two dozen, according to Israeli media. On Friday, during a major Jewish holiday, a Hezbollah drone slammed into a nursing home in central Israel, causing damage. 'We already have six dead in the past 10 days from drones. That’s too much,' said Ran Kochav, a former head of the Israeli military’s aerial defense command. Drones, he said, 'have become a real threat.' Drones are harder to detect and track than rockets or missiles Drones, or UAVs, are unmanned aircraft that can be operated from afar. Drones can enter, surveil and attack enemy territory more discreetly than missiles and rockets. Israel has a formidable arsenal of drones, capable of carrying out spy missions and attacks. It has developed a drone capable of reaching archenemy Iran, some 1500 kilometers (1,000 miles) away. But Israel's enemies have caught Israel off-guard on a number of occasions over the past year, often with deadly consequences. In July, a drone launched from Yemen travelled some 270 kilometers (160 miles) from Israel’s southern tip, all the way to Tel Aviv, slamming into a downtown building and killing one person without it having been intercepted. The Israeli security official said drones are harder to detect for a number of reasons: They fly slowly and often include plastic components, having a weaker thermal footprint with radar systems than powerful rockets and missiles. The trajectory is also harder to track. Drones can have roundabout flight paths, can come from any direction, fly lower to the ground and — because they are much smaller than rockets — can be mistaken for birds. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation into the mess hall strike was still underway. Kochav said that Israel spent years focusing on strengthening its air defense systems to improve protection against rockets and missiles. But drones were not seen as a top priority. During the current fighting, that has meant Israel’s ability to detect and intercept drones is not as successful as its capabilities in the face of rockets and missiles, Kochav said. Hezbollah's drone program receives support from Iran Hezbollah began using Iranian-made drones after Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000 and sent the first reconnaissance Mirsad drone over Israel’s airspace in 2004. Hezbollah’s drone program still receives substantial assistance from Iran, and the UAVs are believed to be assembled by experts of the militant group in Lebanon. Drones have become an 'Iranian-inspired, strategic system' for Hezbollah, according to Tal Beeri, the director of research for The Alma Research and Education Center, a think tank that studies Hezbollah and Israel's north. The militant group has launched roughly 1,500 surveillance and attack drones since it began striking Israel in October 2023, according to the group's count. The attack drones, which Beeri said often hit civilian targets, have a payload of 10 kilograms (22 lbs) of explosives and can fly hundreds of kilometers (miles). He said Hezbollah in May used for the first and only time a drone that was able to fire an anti-tank missile and that it may possess more. Hezbollah has also used drones to erode Israel’s air-defense capabilities by slamming them into the very batteries and infrastructure meant to take them down. Earlier this year, Hezbollah said it used an Ababil explosive drone to down Israel’s Sky Dew observation balloon, a component of its aerial defense. On Monday evening, Hezbollah released a video showing some of its militants in a warehouse full of drones. The video shows drones on launchers and at the end displays a caption that reads: 'Our capabilities are intact.' Israel says it is working to tackle the threat On Monday, on a visit to the training camp hit by the drone, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant pledged to learn from the strike and said Israel was 'concentrating significant efforts in developing solutions' to tackle the drone threat, without elaborating. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also visited the base and soldiers injured in the attack, noting that Israel had paid 'a painful price.' Kochav said there were ways to combat the drones that could be considered. Detection capabilities could be expanded to include acoustic radars to pick up on the sound of the drone's engine or electro-optics, which could allow Israeli surveillance to better identify them. He said rockets, fighter jets and helicopters could be deployed for interception, and that electronic warfare could be used to overtake the drones and divert them. 'We were busy in recent years ... and unmanned (aerial vehicles) was not a top priority,' he said. 'The results unfortunately are not good.' ___ Associated Press writers Josef Federman in Jerusalem, and Abby Sewell and Bassem Mroue in Beirut, contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israel-faces-a-fierce-and-evasive-foe-in-hezbollahs-drones/	2024-10-14T11:08:50-07:00	
Israeli strike in northern Lebanon kills at least 18 people far f...	BEIRUT (AP) — An Israeli airstrike hit an apartment building in northern Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 18 people, according to the Lebanese Red Cross. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military and it was not clear what the target was. The strike hit a small apartment building in the village of Aito, far from the Hezbollah militant group's main strongholds in the south and east of the country. The strike came a day after a Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in northern Israel killed four soldiers — all of them 19 years old — and severely wounded seven others in the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. A total of 61 people were wounded in Sunday's attack. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets, missiles and drones into Israel over the past year but most have been intercepted or hit in open areas, disrupting daily life but causing few casualties. A strike and an inferno in a Gaza hospital courtyard Even as attention has shifted to Lebanon, Israel is still battling Hamas in the Gaza Strip more than a year after its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel triggered the war there and set off escalations across the region. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies, and both are backed by Iran. Earlier on Monday, an Israeli airstrike on a hospital courtyard in the Gaza Strip killed at least four people and triggered a fire that swept through a tent camp for people displaced by the war, leaving more than two dozen with severe burns. The Israeli military said the strike in Gaza targeted militants hiding out among civilians, without providing evidence. In recent months it has repeatedly struck crowded shelters and tent camps, alleging that Hamas fighters were using them as staging grounds for attacks. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah was already struggling to treat a large number of wounded from an earlier strike on a school-turned-shelter that killed at least 20 people when the early morning airstrike hit and fire engulfed many of the tents. Several secondary explosions could be heard after the initial strike, but it was not immediately clear if they were caused by weapons or fuel tanks. Associated Press footage showed children among the wounded. A man sobbed as he carried a toddler with a bandaged head in his arms. Another small child with a bandaged leg was given a blood transfusion on the floor of the packed hospital. Hospital records showed that four people were killed and 40 wounded. Twenty-five people were transferred to Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza after suffering severe burns, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, while Palestinian militants abducted around 250 hostages. Around 100 are still being held inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. Around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced by the war, often multiple times, and large areas of the coastal territory have been completely destroyed. Israeli rights groups warn of forced transfer in northern Gaza Israel has ordered the entire remaining population of the northern third of Gaza, estimated at around 400,000 people, to evacuate to the south and has not allowed any food to enter the north since the start of the month. Hundreds of thousands of people from the north heeded Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war and have not been allowed to return. That has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel intends to implement a plan devised by former generals in which it would order all civilians out of northern Gaza and label anyone remaining there a combatant — a surrender-or-starve strategy that rights groups say would violate international law. The plan has been presented to the Israeli government, but it's unclear whether it has been adopted. The military says it has not received such orders. Israeli rights groups on Monday called on the international community to prevent Israel from carrying out the plan, saying there are 'alarming signs' that Israel is beginning to implement it. The statement, signed by B'Tselem, Gisha, Yesh Din and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, warned that states 'have an obligation to prevent the crimes of starvation and forcible transfer. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip and Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israeli-strike-on-hospital-tent-camp-kills-4-and-ignites-a-fire-that-burns-dozens/	2024-10-14T06:06:22-07:00	
Russia says it captured a southern Ukraine village in a push befo...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia said Monday that it has captured the village of Levadne in southern Ukraine as it probes for weaknesses along the war ’s roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, including in eastern areas which are the main focus of Moscow’s military effort before winter arrives. Ukrainian authorities, meanwhile, reported no nighttime Shahed drone attacks on the country for the first time in about six weeks, after saying five days ago it struck a Shahed storage facility in Russia’s Krasnodar region where around 400 drones reportedly were being kept. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry said Russian troops took Levadne in the Zaporizhzhia region. Levadne was seized by the Russians early on during the full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022, but was recaptured by Ukrainian forces during a counteroffensive in the summer of 2023. Ukrainian officials made no comment about Levadne’s possible capture, though they had previously noted that the Russian army was assembling troops there and were conducting local assaults at the end of last week. Ukraine’s troops are straining to hold back Russia’s military might, especially in the eastern Donetsk region, and don’t have the manpower or weaponry to launch their own offensive. Though Russia’s gains have been incremental, its steady forward movement is slowly adding up as the Ukrainians are pushed backward. Ukraine says it needs more Western help to have a chance of holding back Russia’s invasion. Russia illegally annexed four regions of Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia, in September 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from all four regions as the main condition for a prospective peace deal, a demand Ukraine and the West have rejected. Last week, the Ukrainian General Staff reported a direct hit on the Shahed drone warehouse inside Russia. 'The destruction of the Shahed drone storage base will significantly reduce the ability of Russian occupiers to terrorize peaceful residents of Ukrainian cities and villages,' it said at the time. Ukrainian officials are keen to show the West that they aren't giving up the fight against their much bigger neighbor. An incursion into Russia’s Kursk border region has put Ukrainian troops on Russian soil for more than two months. Ukraine has also deployed sophisticated new long-range drones to strike targets inside Russia, including airfields, oil refineries and ammunition depots. The Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence said Monday that it destroyed a Russian military transport aircraft, a Tu-134, at a military airfield in Russia’s Orenburg region. Russia also struck port infrastructure in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa with a ballistic missile Monday, killing one person and wounding eight other people, as well as damaging two merchant ships, officials said. The attack damaged grain storage facilities, cargo cranes, administrative buildings, port equipment and vehicles, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister for Restoration Oleksii Kuleba said on his Telegram channel. Recent attacks on Odesa port facilities appear intended to disrupt the country’s exports of grains and other food staples. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-says-it-captured-a-southern-ukraine-village-in-a-push-before-winter-comes/	2024-10-14T05:35:13-07:00

Recent attacks on Odesa port facilities appear intended to disrupt the country’s exports of grains and other food staples. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/international/ap-international/ap-russia-says-it-captured-a-southern-ukraine-village-in-a-push-before-winter-comes/	2024-10-14T05:35:13-07:00	
Netanyahu mulls plan to empty northern Gaza of civilians and cut ...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is examining a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas militants, a plan that, if implemented, could trap without food or water hundreds of thousands of Palestinians unwilling or unable to leave their homes. Israel has issued many evacuation orders for the north throughout the yearlong war, the most recent of which was Sunday. The plan proposed to Netanyahu and the Israeli parliament by a group of retired generals would escalate the pressure, giving Palestinians a week to leave the northern third of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, before declaring it a closed military zone. Those who remain would be considered combatants — meaning military regulations would allow troops to kill them — and denied food, water, medicine and fuel, according to a copy of the plan given to The Associated Press by its chief architect, who says the plan is the only way to break Hamas in the north and pressure it to release the remaining hostages. The plan calls for Israel to maintain control over the north for an indefinite period to attempt to create a new administration without Hamas, splitting the Gaza Strip in two. There has been no decision by the government to fully carry out the so-called 'Generals’ Plan,' and it is unclear how strongly it's being considered. When asked if the evacuation orders in northern Gaza marked the first stages of the 'Generals' Plan,' Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said no. 'We have not received a plan like that,' he said. But one official with knowledge of the matter said parts of the plan are already being implemented, without specifying which parts. A second official, who is Israeli, said Netanyahu 'had read and studied' the plan, 'like many plans that have reached him throughout the war,' but didn't say whether any of it had been adopted. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity, because the plan isn't supposed to be discussed publicly. On Sunday, Israel launched an offensive against Hamas fighters in the Jabaliya refugee camp north of the city. The amount of aid reaching the north has declined significantly since Oct. 1, according to the U.N. The U.S. State Department spokesperson has said Washington is against any plan that would bring direct Israeli occupation in Gaza. Human rights groups fear the plan's potential toll on civilians Human rights groups say the plan would likely starve civilians and that it flies in the face of international law, which prohibits using food as a weapon and forcible transfers. Accusations that Israel is intentionally limiting food to Gaza are central to the genocide case brought against it at the International Court of Justice, charges Israel denies. A coalition of Israeli NGOs on Monday urged the international community to act, noting that 'there are alarming signs that the Israeli military is beginning to quietly implement' the plan. 'States have an obligation to prevent the crimes of starvation and forcible transfer,' they wrote, warning that continuing a '‘wait and see’ approach will enable Israel to liquidate northern Gaza.' So far, very few Palestinians have heeded the latest evacuation order. Some are older, sick or afraid to leave their homes, but many fear there’s nowhere safe to go and that they will never be allowed back. Israel has prevented those who fled earlier in the war from returning. 'All Gazans are afraid of the plan,' said Jomana Elkhalili, a 26-year-old Palestinian aid worker for Oxfam living in Gaza City with her family. 'Still, they will not flee. They will not make the mistake again ... We know the place there is not safe,' she said, referring to southern Gaza, where most of the population is huddled in dismal tent camps and airstrikes often hit shelters. 'That’s why people in the north say it’s better to die than to leave.' The plan has emerged as Hamas has shown enduring strength, firing rockets into Tel Aviv and regrouping in areas after Israeli troops withdraw, bringing repeated offensives. After a year of devastating war with Hamas, Israel has far fewer ground troops in Gaza than it did a few months ago and in recent weeks has turned its attention to Hezbollah, launching an invasion of southern Lebanon. There is no sign of progress on a cease-fire in either front. Israel’s offensive on the strip has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but says more than half of the dead are women and children. People in northern Gaza could be forced to ‘surrender or starve’ The Generals’ Plan was presented to the parliament last month by a group of retired generals and high-ranking officers, according to publicly available minutes. Since then, officials from the prime minister’s office called seeking more details, according to its chief architect, Giora Eiland, a former head of the National Security Council. Israeli media reported that Netanyahu told a closed parliamentary defense committee session that he was considering the plan. Eiland said the only way to stop Hamas and bring an end to the yearlong war is to prevent its access to aid. 'They will either have to surrender or to starve,' Eiland said. 'It doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re going to kill every person,' he said. 'It will not be necessary. People will not be able to live there (the north). The water will dry up.' He believes the siege could force Hamas to release some 100 Israeli hostages still being held by the group since its Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s campaign. At least 30 of the hostages are presumed dead. Human rights groups are appalled. 'I’m most concerned by how the plan seems to say that if the population is given a chance to evacuate and they don’t, then somehow they all turn into legitimate military targets, which is absolutely not the case,' said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians’ right to move freely within Gaza. The copy of the plan shared with the AP says that if the strategy is successful in northern Gaza, it could then be replicated in other areas, including tent camps further to the south sheltering hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. When asked about the plan Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the U.S. was going to 'make absolutely clear that it’s not just the United States that opposes any occupation of Gaza, any reduction in the size of Gaza, but it is the virtual unanimous opinion of the international community.' In northern Gaza, aid has dried up and people are trapped The north, including Gaza City, was the initial target of Israel’s ground offensive early in the war, when it first ordered everyone there to leave. Entire neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble since then. About 80 trucks carrying aid have entered through crossings in Gaza's north since Oct. 1, down from roughly 60 trucks a day previously, according to the U.N. website tracking deliveries. A senior U.N. official said one small shipment of fuel for hospitals has entered the north since Oct. 1. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. COGAT, the Israeli body facilitating aid crossings into Gaza, denied that crossings to the north have been closed, but didn't respond when asked how many trucks have entered in recent days. The U.N. official said that only about 100 Palestinians have fled the north since Sunday. 'At least 400,000 people are trapped in the area,' Philippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N.’s agency for Palestinian refugees, wrote on X Thursday. 'With almost no basic supplies available, hunger is spreading.' Troops have already cut off roads between Gaza City and areas further north, making it difficult for people to flee, said two doctors in the far north — Mohammed Salha, director of al-Awda Hospital, and Dr. Rana Soloh, at Kamal Adwan Hospital. 'North Gaza is now divided into two parts,' Soloh said. 'There are checkpoints and inspections, and not everyone can cross easily.' ___ Melanie Lidman contributed to this report from Jerusalem.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-netanyahu-mulls-plan-to-empty-northern-gaza-of-civilians-and-cut-off-aid-to-those-left-inside/	2024-10-14T03:38:13-07:00	
Ukraine’s human rights envoy urges response to alleged killings o...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman urged international organizations Sunday to respond to a claim that several Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed in Russia’s Kursk region, where Kyiv had launched an incursion in August. DeepState, a Ukrainian battlefield analysis site close to Ukraine’s Defense Ministry, said that Russian troops shot and killed nine Ukrainian 'drone operators and contractors' on Oct. 10 after they had surrendered. Dmytro Lubinets said on Telegram that he sent letters to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding the case, calling it 'another crime committed by the Russians.' Later on Sunday, Ukrainian Prosecutor-General Andriy Kostin said that his office had opened a criminal investigation into the matter. Earlier this month, Ukraine’s Prosecutor-General’s Office of Ukraine said that Russian troops had killed 16 captured Ukrainian soldiers in the partially occupied Donetsk region. There was no immediate response from Russian officials. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Sunday that its air defenses had shot down 31 of 68 drones launched at Ukraine by Russia overnight into Sunday in the regions of Kyiv, Poltava, Chernihiv, Sumy and Cherkasy. A further 36 drones were 'lost' over various areas, it said, likely having been electronically jammed. The air force added that ballistic missiles struck Odesa and Poltava while Chernihiv and Sumy came under attack by a guided air missile. Local authorities didn't report any casualties or damage. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that Russia had launched around 900 guided aerial bombs, more than 40 missiles and 400 drones against Ukraine over the past week. Zelenskyy appealed on X to Ukraine’s allies to 'provide the necessary quantity and quality of air defense systems' and 'make decisions for our sufficient range.' Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said that 13 Ukrainian drones were shot down over three regions of Russia: six each in the Belgorod and Kursk regions, and one in the Bryansk region, all of which border Ukraine. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraines-human-rights-envoy-urges-response-to-alleged-killings-of-ukrainian-pows-in-kursk/	2024-10-13T11:57:49-07:00	
Heavy Israeli bombardment in northern Gaza as UN peacekeepers in ...	BEIRUT (AP) — Palestinians in northern Gaza described heavy Israeli bombardment Saturday in the hours after airstrikes killed at least 22 people, as Israel continued to tell people there and in southern Lebanon to get out of the way of its offensives against the Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups. In Lebanon, the United Nations peacekeeping force said its headquarters in Naqoura had again been hit, with a peacekeeper struck by gunfire late Friday and in stable condition. It wasn’t clear who fired. The shooting occurred a day after Israel’s military fired on the headquarters for the second straight day. Israel, which has warned the peacekeepers to leave their positions, didn’t immediately respond to questions. Hunger warnings emerged again as residents in northern Gaza said they hadn't received aid since the beginning of the month. The U.N. World Food Program said no food aid had entered the north since Oct. 1. An estimated 400,000 people remain there. Israel’s military renewed its offensive in northern Gaza almost a week ago while escalating its air and ground campaign against the Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said an Israeli airstrike hit an apartment building in the Zarout coastal area on the edge of Barja south of Beirut, and the Health Ministry said four were killed. The ministry said another airstrike on the village of Maisra northeast of Beirut killed five. Hezbollah continued to fire into Israel. 'We will keep standing with the Lebanese people during these difficult circumstances and also with the Palestinian people,' the speaker of Iran’s parliament, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, said Saturday while touring the scene of an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Gaza residents are trapped In northern Gaza, residents told The Associated Press many were trapped in their homes and shelters with dwindling supplies while seeing bodies uncollected in the streets as the bombing hampered emergency responders. Those who rushed to the scene of the latest deadly airstrikes in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya found a hole 20 meters (65 feet) deep where a home once stood. At least 20 bodies were recovered as of Saturday morning, while others likely were trapped under the rubble, emergency service officials said. Elsewhere in Jabaliya, a strike on a home killed two brothers and wounded a woman and newborn baby, the officials said. Another strike in the afternoon hit a Jabaliya home and killed at least four people including a woman, said Fares Abu Hamza, an official with the emergency service. Israel's military did not immediately respond to request for comment on the strikes. Military spokesperson Avichay Adraee told people in parts of Jabaliya and Gaza City to evacuate south to an Israeli-designated humanitarian zone as Israel plans to use great force 'and will continue to do so for a long time.' Israel has repeatedly returned to parts of Gaza as Hamas and other militants regroup. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. 'It’s like the first days of the war,' said a Jabaliya resident, Ahmed Abu Goneim. 'The occupation is doing everything to uproot us. But we will not leave.' The 24-year-old said Israeli warplanes and drones struck many neighboring houses in the past week, He counted 15 relatives and neighbors, including four women and five children as young as 3, killed in neighboring homes. He said there were dead in the streets and 'no one is able to recover them because of the bombing.' Hamza Sharif, who stays with his family in a school-turned shelter in Jabaliya, described 'constant bombings day and night.' He said the shelter has not received aid since the beginning of the month. 'Families depend on what they have stored, but they will run out of supplies very soon,' he said. Food is running out The World Food Program said it was unclear how long the limited food supplies it distributed in northern Gaza earlier will last. The U.N.’s independent investigator on the right to food last month accused Israel of carrying out a 'starvation campaign' against Palestinians, which Israel has denied. Israel's offensive in Gaza started after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, when militants stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not specify between combatants and civilians. Gaza’s Health Ministry said hospitals had received the bodies of 49 people killed over the past 24 hours. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Ukraine's Zelenskyy meets Pope Francis as he continues his Europe...	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis met Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Vatican on Friday, the latest step on the Ukrainian president's European tour to win support for his proposed 'victory plan' aimed at ending the war with Russia. The pope and the Ukrainian leader held private talks for 35 minutes. After their private meeting at the Sala della Biblioteca and the presentation of the Ukrainian delegation, Francis gave Zelenskyy a bronze plaque depicting a flower and an inscription reading: 'Peace is a fragile flower.' In turn, Zelenskyy gifted the pontiff with an oil painting portraying 'The massacre of Bucha. The story of Marichka.' Bucha, a suburb northwest of Kyiv, was occupied by Russian troops shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and witnessed some of Russia’s worst atrocities against civilians. Later Friday, Zelenskyy met the Vatican's secretary of state, Pietro Parolin, accompanied by Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, secretary for relations with states and international organizations. 'The discussions were dedicated to the state of the war and the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, as well as the ways in which it could be brought to an end, leading to just and stable peace in the country,' the Vatican said in a statement, adding that 'some matters relating to the religious life of the country were also examined.' Since the first Russian attack on Kyiv, there have been multiple contacts between Francis and Zelenskyy, through visits, letters and phone calls. The pope sparked some criticism from Ukrainian leaders in March when he suggested they should have the courage of the 'white flag' negotiating an end to the war with Russia, in what was intepreted by many as a call to surrender. Francis has repeatedly and strongly for an end to the war, focusing on prisoner exchanges and on reaching a diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian conflict. Cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi was sent as a special envoy on a mission to ease tensions among the parties at war, meeting with political and ecclesiastical leaders around the world. His mission was, in particular, to encourage exchanges of Russian and Ukrainian prisoners and to find a way to facilitate the return of children forcibly deported from Ukraine to Russia. Zelensky is city-hopping across Europe to promote a plan that he said 'aims to create the right conditions for a just end to the war' against Russia, unveiling the proposals to European allies after a summit with President Joe Biden was derailed by Hurricane Milton. On Thursday, Zelenskyy met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in London, French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni in Rome. He is expected to travel to Germany later on Friday to hold talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The Ukrainian leader has yet to publicly detail his proposals for 'victory.' But the timing of his efforts to lock in European support appear to have the looming U.S. election in mind. Former President Donald Trump has long been critical of U.S. aid to Kyiv. Ukraine’s stretched and short-handed army is currently under heavy pressure in the country’s eastern Donetsk region. Russian forces recently pushed it out of the Donetsk town of Vuhledar and are now in control of about half of nearby Toretsk, local administration chief Vasyl Chynchyk said Friday. To stop the losses, Zelenskyy needs to secure more help.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraines-zelenskyy-meets-pope-francis-as-he-continues-his-european-tour-to-push-his-victory-plan/	2024-10-11T04:28:26-07:00	
Israel's deadliest strike in central Beirut leaves Lebanese stunn...	BEIRUT (AP) — Rescue workers searched through the rubble of a collapsed building in central Beirut on Friday morning, hours after two Israeli strikes hit the Lebanese capital, killing at least 22 people and wounding dozens. The air raid was the deadliest attack on central Beirut in over a year of war, hitting two residential buildings in neighborhoods that have swelled with displaced people fleeing Israeli bombardment elsewhere in the country. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar television and Israeli media said the strikes aimed to kill Wafiq Safa, a top security official with the group. Al-Manar said Safa was not in either building at the time. The Israeli military had no comment on the reports. Thursday night's strikes came as Israel escalates its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion at the border, after a year of exchanges of fire between the two rivals. The same day as the Beirut explosions, Israeli forces fired on United Nations peacekeepers in southern Lebanon and wounded two peacekeepers from Indonesia, drawing widespread condemnation. Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire to more populated areas deeper inside Israel. While disrupting life for Israelis, most of Hezbollah’s barrages have not caused casualties. But early Friday, an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon killed a man from Thailand working on a farm in northern Israel. In Beirut’s Burj Abi Haidar neighborhood, civil defense members and municipal workers dug through the pile of concrete and twisted metal from a three-story building knocked down by Thursday night’s strike. In an adjacent building that was badly damaged, Ahmad al-Khatib stood in the apartment of his in-laws where he, his wife, Marwa Hamdan, and their 2 ½-year-old daughter, Ayla, suffered injuries. He had just picked up his wife from work and she was performing the evening Muslim prayers at home when the blast hit. 'The world suddenly turned upside down and darkness prevailed,' said the 42-year-old, tears running down his cheeks. He pulled his daughter out from under the debris of a wall that collapsed in a bedroom. Al-Khatib, who works for the postal service. said he found the force of the explosion had thrown his wife against a wall and a piece of metal had hit her in the head. 'I looked in her face and shouted, ‘Say something!’' he said, but she only responded with sounds of pain. His wife remains in the ICU at a Beirut hospital. His daughter suffered only minor injuries. Mohammed Tarhani said he had moved in with his brother nearby in the neighborhood after fleeing around southern Lebanon to escape airstrikes the past weeks. His children were out on the veranda, and he was in the living room when the strike hit. 'We rushed out to look for the children,' he said. 'Where is one supposed to go now?' Civil defense official Walid Hashash said they don’t expect more bodies under the rubble as no people are missing. He added that once operations are over they will issue a final death toll. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in support of Hamas and the Palestinians, drawing Israeli airstrikes in retaliation. Israel says its stepped-up campaign since late September aims to push Hezbollah away from the border to allow tens of thousands of its citizens evacuated from the area to return home. More than 2,100 Lebanese –- including Hezbollah fighters, civilians and medical personnel — have been killed the past year by Israeli strikes, more than two thirds of them in the past few weeks. Hezbollah attacks have killed 29 civilians as well as 39 Israeli soldiers in northern Israel since October 2023 and in southern Lebanon since Israel launched its ground invasion on Sept. 30. So far, Israeli troops have been operating in a narrow strip of a few kilometers (miles) along the border. The war threatens to spiral even further, with Israel aiming to strike a crippling blow to its longtime adversary Hezbollah. Netanyahu this week warned Lebanese they would suffer the same destruction that Israel’s campaign against Hamas has inflicted in Gaza unless they take action against Hezbollah. Israel has also vowed to strike back against the Lebanese group’s supporter, Iran, after it launched some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel last week. Iran’s barrage was in retaliation for previous Israeli strikes that killed Hamas’ leader in Tehran and senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard figures in Lebanon. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday reiterated U.S. support for Israel’s escalated campaign against Hezbollah. He said Israel had a 'clear and very legitimate' interest to try to ensure the return of tens of thousands of its citizens who were evacuated from their homes near the border because of Hezbollah fire since last October. He told a news conference after attending an annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos that the U.S. is 'extremely focused' on reaching a diplomatic solution to the war. Meanwhile the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, was rearranging some of its personnel after its positions were repeated hit by Israeli forces Thursday. UNIFIL said an Israeli tank directly fired on an observation tower at the force’s headquarters in the town of Naqoura, Lebanon, and that soldiers attacked a bunker near where peacekeepers were sheltering, damaging vehicles and a communication system. It said an Israeli drone was seen flying to the bunker’s entrance. The Israeli military acknowledged opening fire at a U.N. base in southern Lebanon on Thursday and said it had ordered the peacekeepers to 'remain in protected spaces.' Afterward, the U.N. peacekeeping chief said 300 peacekeepers in frontline positions on southern Lebanon’s border have been temporarily moved to larger bases. Plans to move another 200 will depend on security conditions as the conflict escalates. Jean-Pierre Lacroix told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that peacekeepers with UNIFIL are staying in their positions, but because of air and ground attacks they cannot conduct patrols. UNIFIL, which has more than 10,000 peacekeepers from dozens of countries, was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israel’s 1978 invasion. The United Nations expanded its mission following the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, allowing peacekeepers to patrol a buffer zone set up along the border. Israel accuses Hezbollah of establishing militant infrastructure along the border in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 war. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israels-deadliest-strike-in-central-beirut-leaves-lebanese-stunned-as-they-dig-through-the-rubble/	2024-10-11T03:39:28-07:00	
Russia launches 4th aerial attack in a week against Ukraine's gra...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A nighttime Russian missile strike on Odesa killed at least four people including a 16-year-old girl, regional authorities said Friday, in the latest in a series of attacks this week on the southern Ukrainian region that are likely intended to disrupt the country’s grain exports. Four Russian missile and drone attacks on the Odesa region this week have killed 14 people and wounded around 20, according to local officials. The strikes have hit merchant ships and damaged port infrastructure in the region, which is a vital hub for Ukraine’s agricultural exports through the Black Sea. An attack on Odesa late Wednesday killed nine people and hit a container ship sailing under the Panamanian flag — the third attack on a merchant vessel in four days, according to regional Gov. Oleh Kiper. The apparent Russian effort to frustrate Ukraine’s exports, which bring vital revenue for a national economy battered by more than two years of war, coincided with a renewed push by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to ensure continuing military and financial support from his country’s Western partners. Ukraine’s stretched and short-handed army is currently under heavy pressure in the country’s eastern Donetsk region. Russian forces recently pushed it out of the Donetsk town of Vuhledar and are now in control of about half of nearby Toretsk, local administration chief Vasyl Chynchyk said Friday. To stop the losses, Zelenskyy needs to secure more help. Russia last year tore up an agreement that allowed Ukraine — one of the world’s biggest suppliers of grain and other food staples, especially to developing nations — to export produce safely through the Black Sea. Months later, and amid successful Ukrainian attacks on Russia’s Black Sea fleet which forced its navy to back away from the coast, Ukraine established a shipping corridor that hugs the coast down to Turkey and opens a way to the Mediterranean Sea. A special insurance program has provided affordable coverage to shippers who have carried millions of tons of cargo out of Ukraine, but the latest attacks could jeopardize that arrangement. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-launches-4th-aerial-attack-in-a-week-against-ukraines-grain-exporting-odesa-region/	2024-10-11T03:30:55-07:00	
UN-backed experts say Israel is destroying Gaza's health sector a...	A U.N. commission on Thursday accused Israel of destroying Gaza's health care system through 'relentless and deliberate attacks' in its yearlong war with Hamas and said that Palestinian prisoners and Israeli hostages have been tortured and sexually abused. The expert panel was commissioned in 2021 by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council to look into rights violations and abuses in Israel and the Palestinian areas it controls. Led by Navi Pillay, a former U.N. human rights chief, the panel members are independent experts and do not speak for the world body. There was no immediate comment from Israel, which has long accused the U.N. of being biased against it and has not cooperated with the commission. Israeli forces have raided hospitals in Gaza on several occasions, accusing militants of sheltering there. Palestinian medical officials have denied such allegations and accused Israel of recklessly endangering civilians. Hospitals can lose their protection under international law if they are used for military purposes. The report accused Israel of deliberately killing, detaining and torturing Palestinian medical staff, of targeting their vehicles and of restricting permits for medical evacuations from Gaza. It said those amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. 'Israel must immediately stop its unprecedented wanton destruction of health care facilities in Gaza,' Pillay said in a statement. 'By targeting health care facilities, Israel is targeting the right to health itself with significant long-term detrimental effects on the civilian population.' The commission said children have borne much of the cost of such actions, pointing to attacks on medical facilities offering pediatric and neonatal care. The panel also said it found that thousands of adults and children detained in Gaza had been subjected to 'widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence.' It said Israeli security forces had raped male detainees, attacked their genitals and forced them to perform humiliating or strenuous acts while stripped naked. It said children who had been detained had returned to Gaza unaccompanied and deeply traumatized. The commission further said the abuse had been institutionalized by Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir. He has boasted of making conditions in the country's prisons as harsh as possible under Israeli law in what he says is an attempt to deter militant attacks. Israel detained nine soldiers in July over what their defense lawyer said were allegations of sexual abuse of a detainee being held at a shadowy facility where detainees from Gaza have been taken since the start of the war. The lawyer denied the allegations, and their arrest sparked protests by Israeli hard-liners. The commission also said that hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza were subjected to physical and sexual violence, forced isolation and threats, and given limited access to water, food and hygiene facilities. It said Palestinian armed groups were also guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and called on them to immediately release all the hostages. Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, and the International Criminal Court is considering arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders. Israel has adamantly denied the accusations and says it abides by international law. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage of the war at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-un-backed-experts-say-israel-is-destroying-gazas-health-sector-and-both-sides-have-tortured-people/	2024-10-10T07:20:40-07:00	
Biden and Netanyahu hold their first conversation in weeks. Trump...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday were holding their first call in weeks, a conversation that comes as Israel expands its ground incursion into Lebanon and considers how to respond to Iran’s recent ballistic missile attack. Netanyahu's office also confirmed that the prime minister had recently spoken with former President Donald Trump. Trump, a Republican who is the midst of a close White House race against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, called Netanyahu last week and 'congratulated him on the intense and determined operations that Israel carried out against Hezbollah,' according to Netanyahu's office. A Trump ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., joined that call. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is set to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday as Israel expands its ground incursion into Lebanon and considers how to respond to Iran's recent ballistic missile attack. The leaders' call, previewed by three people familiar with the matter, including an official in Netanyahu's office, is coming two days after the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel that led to the war in Gaza that has spread into a wider regional conflict. It will be the first conversation between Biden and Netanyahu since Aug. 21. The three people were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Israel has been discussing how to respond to the Iranian missile barrage from Oct. 1, which the United States helped to fend off. Biden last week said he would not support a retaliatory Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran’s nuclear program. Israel’s other choices range from a largely symbolic strike — similar to how Israel responded after Iran launched missiles and attack drones in April — to hitting oil facilities and other infrastructure. Since the leaders' last call seven weeks ago, Israel has carried out a brazen sabotage and assassination campaign against Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, where the militant group has continued to fire missiles, rockets and drones at Israel. Israel is now undertaking what it has described as limited ground operations across its northern border with Lebanon to dig out Hezbollah. Airstrikes killed the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and decimated its leadership. Last month, thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing dozens of people and maiming thousands, including many civilians. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack The U.S. has maintained a stepped-up troop presence in the region, to defend Israel and American interests in the Middle East. Washington has grown increasingly vocal with Israeli officials about the need to be kept in the loop on their decision-making to ensure the protection of U.S. forces. Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, had been scheduled to meet with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday, but the Israelis postponed the visit, according to Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh. ___ Associated Press writers Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem and Lolita C.

Israeli offensive in hard-hit northern Gaza kills dozens and thre...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A large-scale Israeli operation in northern Gaza has killed dozens of people and threatens to shut down three hospitals over a year into the war with Hamas, Palestinian officials and residents said Wednesday. Heavy fighting was underway in Jabaliya, where Israeli forces have carried out several major operations over the course of the war and then returned as militants regroup. The entire north, including Gaza City, has suffered heavy destruction and has been largely isolated by Israeli forces since late last year. The continuing cycle of destruction and death in Gaza, unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, comes as Israel expands a weeklong ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon and considers a major retaliatory strike on Iran. A rocket fired from Lebanon killed two people in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, and another six were wounded in a series of stabbings in the city of Hadera Wednesday, which Israeli police described as a militant attack. Police said the attacker was 'neutralized,' indicating he was killed. Hezbollah claimed the strike on Kiryat Shmona, saying it targeted 'a gathering of enemy forces.' Ofir Yehezkeli, the town's acting mayor, said the two killed were a couple walking their dogs. Residents of Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, said thousands of people have been trapped in their homes since the operation began Sunday, as Israeli jets and drones buzz overhead and troops battle militants in the streets. 'It’s like hell. We can’t get out,' said Mohamed Awda, who lives with his parents and six siblings. He said there were three bodies in the street outside his home that could not be retrieved because of the fighting. 'The quadcopters are everywhere, and they fire at anyone. You can’t even open the window,' he told The Associated Press by phone, speaking over the sound of explosions. Dozens have been killed and survivors fear displacement Gaza's Health Ministry said it recovered 40 bodies from Jabaliya from Sunday until Tuesday, and another 14 from communities farther north. There are likely more bodies under rubble and in areas that can't be accessed, it said. An airstrike in Jabaliya early Wednesday killed at least nine people, including two women and two children, according to Al-Ahly Hospital, which received the bodies. Strikes in central Gaza killed another nine people, including three children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Kamal Adwan hospital director Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya, said an Israeli strike on tents sheltering displaced Palestinians near the Yemen Saeed hospital in Jabaliya had killed at least 16 people and wounded another 17. The casualties were taken to the Kamal Adwan hospital. Jabaliya residents fear Israel aims to depopulate the north and turn it into a closed military zone or a Jewish settlement. Israel has blocked all roads except for the main highway leading south from Jabaliya, according to residents. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said it was evacuating seven schools being used as shelters and that only two of eight water wells in the camp are still functioning. 'We are concerned about the displacement to the south,' Ahmed Qamar, who lives in Jabaliya with his wife, children and parents, said in a text message. 'People here say clearly that they will die here in northern Gaza and and won’t go to southern Gaza.' Hospitals are under threat Fadel Naeem, the director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said it had received dozens of wounded people and bodies from the north. 'We declared a state of emergency, suspended scheduled surgeries, and discharged patients whose conditions are stable,' he told AP in a text message. Israel’s offensive has gutted Gaza’s health sector, forcing most of its hospitals to shut down and leaving the rest only partially functioning. Naeem said three hospitals farther north — Kamal Adwan, Awda and the Indonesian Hospital - have become almost inaccessible because of the fighting. The Gaza Health Ministry says the Israeli army has ordered all three to evacuate staff and patients. Meanwhile, no humanitarian aid has entered the north since Oct. 1, according to U.N. data. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the hospitals or the apparent suspension of aid delivery in the north. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, said late Tuesday that Israeli forces were operating in Jabaliya to 'prevent Hamas' regrouping efforts' and had killed around 100 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it fights in residential areas. Israel ordered the wholesale evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, in the opening weeks of the war, but hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have remained there. Israel reiterated those instructions over the weekend, telling people to flee south to an expanded humanitarian zone where hundreds of thousands are already crammed into squalid tent camps. The war began just over a year ago, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. They still hold around 100 hostages, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. It has said women and children make up over half of the dead. The offensive has also caused staggering destruction across the territory and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Israel warns Lebanon it could end up like Gaza Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until 'total victory' over Hamas and the return of all hostages. On Tuesday, he warned that Lebanon would meet the same fate as Gaza if its people did not rise up against Hezbollah, which began firing rockets into Israel after the initial Hamas attack. That set in motion a cycle of escalation that ignited a full-scale war last month. 'You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza,' Netanyahu said, addressing the Lebanese people. An Israeli strike killed four people and wounded another 10 at a hotel sheltering displaced people in the southern Lebanese town of Wardaniyeh on Wednesday, Lebanon's Health Ministry said. An Associated Press reporter in a nearby town heard two sonic booms from Israeli jets before the strike. Plumes of smoke rose from the building after the explosion. In recent weeks Israel has waged a heavy air campaign across large parts of Lebanon, targeting what it says are Hezbollah rocket launchers and other militant sites. A series of strikes killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. The Israeli military said Wednesday that Hezbollah has fired more than 12,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel in the past year. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Dozens killed as Israeli troops pound central and northern Gaza	Israel’s bombardment of central and northern Gaza has killed dozens of people and trapped thousands in their homes, Palestinian officials said Wednesday, as the death toll in the yearlong war passed 42,000. Gaza’s Health Ministry said it recovered 40 bodies from Jabaliya from Sunday until Tuesday, and another 14 from communities farther north. The toll is likely higher as there are bodies buried under the rubble and in areas that can’t be accessed, it said. Among the dead Wednesday were nine people, including three children, whose bodies were brought to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah. An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies at the morgue. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, said that Israeli forces were operating in Jabaliya to prevent Hamas from regrouping and had killed around 100 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it fights in residential areas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israel has killed the successor to the head of Hezbollah, while the militant group's acting leader promised more fighting in southern Lebanon. A year ago, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023. ___ Here is the latest: 2 killed in a rocket attack on northern Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli first responders say a man and a woman were killed by a rocket fired from Lebanon. The Magen David Adom rescue service said the two were killed Wednesday when a rocket struck the northern town of Kiryat Shmona. Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel in recent days as Israel has ramped up its airstrikes in Lebanon and pushed ahead with a ground incursion. Most of the rockets have been intercepted or landed in open areas, but the barrages have grown more intense and have reached deeper into Israel, disrupting daily life. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack from Gaza into Israel ignited the war. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran, and Hezbollah said the attacks were in support of the Palestinians. Israel retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict escalated into a full-blown war last month. At least 4 killed in an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon BEIRUT — The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least four people were killed in an Israeli strike on a hotel-turned-shelter for displaced people in southern Lebanon. Ten others were wounded in the strike that hit the building in Wardaniyeh in Lebanon’s Chouf province. An Associated Press reporter in a nearby town heard two sonic booms and an explosion from Israeli jets before the strike, followed by plumes of black and white smoke rising from the building. At least 6 people stabbed and wounded in an attack in northern Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — At least six people were stabbed and wounded in northern Israel in what police say was a militant attack. Police said the assailant stabbed people in multiple locations in the northern city of Hadera on Wednesday before fleeing on a motorbike. Police said they later shot and 'neutralized' him, indicating he was killed. They did not provide the name or nationality of the assailant. Five of the people who were attacked were in critical or severe condition, while the sixth was moderately wounded, according to the nearby Hillel Yaffe Medical Center. Palestinians have carried out scores of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis in recent years, and tensions have spiked over the war in Gaza. Philippine president orders preparations for evacuation from Lebanon MANILA, Philippines — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered government agencies Wednesday to prepare to evacuate Filipinos 'by whatever means' from Lebanon. Marcos held a virtual meeting with key Cabinet members while attending a summit of Southeast Asia leaders in Laos, underscoring the urgency as Israel intensified attacks against the militant group Hezbollah. 'We are now going to evacuate our people by whatever means — by air, or by sea,' Marcos said, adding that any ship to be used has to be positioned near Beirut so Filipinos could immediately leave. About 11,000 Filipinos live and work in Lebanon, including many house helpers, but Philippine Foreign Affairs officials say many are hesitant to leave their jobs. Only about 171 Filipinos in Lebanon were ready for immediate repatriation, they said. Turkish navy ships bring humanitarian aid to Beirut and evacuate citizens BEIRUT — Turkish navy ships docked at a port in Beirut on Wednesday as a part of a mission to bring humanitarian aid to Lebanon and evacuate Turkish citizens. Two of the ships, which can accommodate up to 2,000 passengers, were carrying up to 300 tons of humanitarian aid consisting of food, tents and blankets, according to a statement from the Turkish Defense Ministry. Rear Adm. Nihat Baran, commander of the evacuation mission, said the trip was ordered by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan 'to ensure that our citizens living in Lebanon are transferred to Turkey safely.' Citizens of Bulgaria, Romania and Kazakhstan also applied for the evacuation, the ministry said. The two ships are part of a larger six-vessel convoy that departed the southern port of Mersin early Wednesday. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said additional evacuations would be organized if necessary. Gaza death toll passes 42,000 Gaza’s Health Ministry says the Palestinian death toll from the war in Gaza has passed 42,000. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count, but has said women and children make up more than half of those killed. It said Wednesday that 42,010 Palestinians have been killed and 97,720 wounded since the start of the war, which was ignited by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. German police close pro-Palestinian protest camp Greta Thunberg planned to visit BERLIN — German police say they dissolved a pro-Palestinian protest camp in the western city of Dortmund after organizers told them that Swedish activist Greta Thunberg was planning to visit the camp. Dortmund police said late Tuesday the decision was made, among other reasons, because Thunberg’s appearance would probably have drawn more people to the protest camp than originally permitted. The dismantling of the camp, which had been in existence for months, was accepted without resistance, police said. Seven protesters were present at the camp on Tuesday, but Thunberg did not appear, German news agency dpa reported. On Monday, Thunberg participated in a pro-Palestinian protest in Berlin. 18 dead after Israeli strikes in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian officials say Israeli strikes in central and northern Gaza killed at least 18 people, including five children and two women. Two strikes hit tents for displaced people in the urban Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps in central Gaza early Wednesday. The bodies of nine people, including three children, were brought to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah. An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies at the morgue. In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike hit a family home in the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing at least nine people, according to the Civil Defense, a rescue agency operating under the Hamas-run government. The dead were taken to the Al-Ahly Hospital, which said two women and two children were among those killed. Footage shared by the Civil Defense showed first responders recovering dead bodies and body parts from under the rubble. Israel launched an air and ground operation earlier this week in Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. Israel has carried out several previous operations in Jabaliya, and its forces have repeatedly returned to other areas of Gaza after militants have regrouped.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-18-dead-after-israeli-strikes-in-gaza/	2024-10-09T05:04:03-07:00	
Ukrainian drone strikes another arms depot inside Russia, officia...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone struck an important arms depot inside Russia, the Ukraine military said Wednesday, three weeks after another drone blasted a major Russian armory and three days after a drone smashed into a key oil terminal in Russia-occupied Crimea. The Tuesday night strike targeted an arsenal in Russia’s Bryansk border region where missiles and artillery munitions were stored, including some that had been delivered by North Korea, a Ukrainian General Staff statement said. Hugely powerful glide bombs that have terrorized civilian areas of Ukraine and bludgeoned Ukrainian army defenses were also kept at the arsenal, located 115 kilometers (70 miles) from the Ukrainian border, and some of the ammunition was stored in the open, it said. 'Striking such arsenals creates serious logistical problems for the Russian army, thus significantly reducing (its) offensive capabilities,' the statement said. Russia is expending enormous amounts of ammunition as it makes its advantage in artillery shells felt on the battlefield in a war of attrition that is approaching its 1,000-day milestone next month. Its slow but relentless drive deeper into Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region is stretching Ukraine’s resources just as some of Kyiv’s key Western partners are being distracted by domestic concerns and Middle East wars. Ukraine is building up its own arms industry, and authorities have identified drones as an important aspect of that. 'Among the key areas identified are drones for our army, and this should be a supply that not only constantly increases in volume, but also evolves and develops in line with the demands of war,' Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address late Tuesday about weapons production. The Russian military has also improved its drones’ capabilities and expanded their use. Russian drones targeted Ukraine’s southern Odesa region for the third night in a row on Tuesday, injuring five people, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said. However, Ukraine’s air defenses have proved resilient against drones. The Ukrainian air force said Wednesday it shot down 21 out of 22 drones that Russia launched over three Ukrainian regions. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukrainian-drone-strikes-another-arms-depot-inside-russia-officials-say/	2024-10-09T03:28:35-07:00	
Israel says it killed a senior Hezbollah commander as more rocket...	The Israeli military said Tuesday it killed a senior Hezbollah commander in a strike on Beirut while the militant group's acting leader promised more fighting against Israeli troops in southern Lebanon and rocket fire into Israel. The military said the strike killed Suhail Husseini, who it said was responsible for overseeing logistics, budget and management of the group. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah. Sheikh Naim Kassem, the acting leader of Hezbollah, said in a defiant televised statement that his group's military capabilities are still intact. He said that Hezbollah has replaced all of its senior commanders after weeks of heavy Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon, including targeted strikes that killed much of its top command in a matter of days. Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday, the anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, underscoring their resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive in Gaza that has killed about 42,000 people, according to local medical officials. A year ago, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023. On Monday, Lebanon’s Health Ministry said an Israeli strike in the country’s south, part of a wider bombardment, killed at least 10 firefighters. Hezbollah fired new barrages despite its recent losses. ___ Here is the latest: China evacuates over 200 citizens from Lebanon BEIJING — China has evacuated more than 200 citizens from Lebanon by ship and chartered flight, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. A total of 211 residents of mainland China, three Hong Kong residents and a Taiwan resident have been evacuated, according to ministry spokesperson Mao Ning. At the request of the Lebanese government, Beijing has agreed to provide Lebanon with emergency humanitarian medical supplies, Mao added. Fighting rages in northern Gaza after Israel's evacuation order CAIRO — Palestinians say heavy fighting is underway in northern Gaza, where Israel has ordered another wholesale evacuation and launched a ground operation a year into the war with Hamas. At least 15 people, including two women and four children, were killed Tuesday in the fighting in Jabaliya, the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital said. The Israeli military said it killed around 20 militants in airstrikes and ground fighting in Jabaliya. It said troops located a large quantity of weapons, including grenades and rifles. The north, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel’s ground offensive. Entire neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble and the region has been largely isolated by Israeli troops since last October, when Israel ordered everyone to leave. Hundreds of thousands of people have remained there despite the harsh conditions, leading Israel to order another mass evacuation in recent days. Israel has prevented residents who left the north during the war from returning. Israeli forces are battling Hamas militants in Jabaliya, home to a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. Palestinian residents said Israeli warplanes and artillery were pounding Jabaliya as well as Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, towns near the border. 'The situation is extremely difficult. The bombing and explosions haven’t stopped,' said Mahmoud Abu Shehatah, a Jabaliya resident. 'It’s like the first days of the war.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged 'total victory' over Hamas, even as the war has expanded to include Lebanon’s Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups across the region. Months of diplomatic efforts aimed at reaching a cease-fire in Gaza appear to have fizzled out, with each side accusing the other of making unacceptable demands. 85 rockets launched from Lebanon into northern Israel, military says JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said 85 projectiles were launched Tuesday from Lebanon toward northern Israel in a significant burst of fire. The military said most of the projectiles were intercepted. Hezbollah confirmed it fired the salvo Tuesday. Israel’s rescue service Magen David Adom said a 70-year-old woman was moderately wounded by shrapnel. Israeli media aired footage of what appeared to be minor damage to buildings near the coastal city of Haifa. The military also said that it struck Hezbollah targets in the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, where the militant group has a strong presence. Hezbollah leader says more Israelis will be displaced as it extends its rocket fire BEIRUT — Hezbollah’s acting leader said Tuesday that even more Israelis will be displaced as the militant group extends its rocket fire deeper into Israel, in a defiant televised statement marking the anniversary of fighting that escalated into war last month. Sheikh Naim Kassem said Hezbollah's military capabilities are still intact and that it has replaced all of its senior commanders after weeks of heavy Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon, including targeted strikes that killed much of its top command in a matter of days. He also said Israeli forces have not been able to advance after launching a ground incursion into Lebanon last week. The Israeli military said a fourth division is now taking part in the incursion, which has expanded to the west, but operations still appear to be confined to a narrow strip along the border. Israeli reserve division begins ‘limited operations’ in southwest Lebanon JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said a reserve division has begun limited operations against Hezbollah in southwestern Lebanon, in an apparent widening of its ground incursion. The military said Tuesday that the 146th Division is the first reserve division to enter Lebanon since it launched ground operations just inside the border last week. The announcement came a day after the Israeli military warned residents to evacuate from over a dozen towns and villages in southwestern Lebanon, including the coastal town of Naqoura, where U.N. peacekeepers are headquartered. Israel has called on people to evacuate several dozen communities across southern Lebanon, many of them north of a U.N.-declared buffer zone established after the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. Israel says its operations are aimed at halting a year of Hezbollah rocket attacks so that tens of thousands of its citizens can return to their homes in the north. Hezbollah has vowed to keep up the attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza. The fighting, which escalated in mid-September, has displaced over 1 million Lebanese. UN officials in Lebanon call for talks on anniversary of Israel-Hezbollah fighting BEIRUT — The U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon and the head of the peacekeeping force deployed along the border with Israel said that a negotiated solution is the only way to restore stability and the time to act is now. The statement by Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro of the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL came on the first anniversary of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group starting attacks on Israeli military posts along the border in support of its Hamas allies in the Gaza Strip. Over the past weeks, the exchanges along the border have expanded into Israeli airstrikes and Hezbollah missile attacks that are hitting deeper inside both countries. In Lebanon, more than 1 million people have been displaced and over 1,300 killed since mid-September. Plasschaert and Lázaro said Hezbollah’s attacks starting on Oct. 8, 2023 were in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 34-day Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. 'Too many lives have been lost, uprooted, and devastated, while civilians on both sides of the Blue Line are left wanting for security and stability,' the statement said referring to the border line along the Lebanon-Israel border. 'Today, one year later, the near-daily exchanges of fire have escalated into a relentless military campaign whose humanitarian impact is nothing short of catastrophic,' the statement said. It warned that further that further violence and destruction will neither solve the underlying issues nor make anyone safer in the long run. 'A negotiated solution is the only pathway to restore the security and stability that civilians on both sides so desperately want and deserve,' the statement said. 'The time to act accordingly is now.' Turkey sends navy to evacuate citizens from Lebanon ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey is deploying two navy ships to evacuate its citizens from Lebanon amid the rising tensions in the region. According to a statement from the Turkish Foreign Ministry, the ships, which together can accommodate up to 2,000 passengers, will depart for Lebanon on Tuesday. The evacuations are scheduled to begin on Wednesday. The ministry said additional evacuations would be organized if necessary. Besides evacuating citizens, the ships will be carrying humanitarian aid for Lebanon, the ministry said. Death toll from Israeli strikes on Gaza rises to 30 DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — At least 30 people, including six children and two women, were killed in Israeli strikes in central Gaza late Monday. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the bodies were taken, provided an updated toll Tuesday as more bodies were recovered from the rubble. The strikes took place on the anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel that triggered the war. Two strikes hit houses in the built-up Bureij refugee camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. An Associated Press journalist counted 21 bodies on Monday, along with about a dozen wounded, including several children. The Palestinian death toll in the war in Gaza is nearing 42,000, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between civilians and militants. Israeli military says it killed a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut strike JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it killed a senior Hezbollah commander in a strike on Beirut. The military said Tuesday that it killed Suhail Husseini, who it said was responsible for overseeing logistics, budget and management of the militant group. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah. The military said Husseini was involved in the transfer of advanced weapons from Iran and their distribution to different Hezbollah units, and that he was a member of the group’s military council. Israeli strikes have killed Hezbollah’s overall leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several of his top commanders in recent weeks. Last week, Israel launched what it says is a limited ground incursion into southern Lebanon. Hezbollah says it has already replaced its slain commanders. It has vowed to keep firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel until there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, where its ally Hamas has been at war with Israel for a year.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-military-says-it-killed-a-senior-hezbollah-commander-in-beirut-strike/	2024-10-08T05:09:33-07:00	
Vigils, protests around the world commemorate the anniversary of ...	NEW YORK (AP) — Commemorations and protests unfolded across the world on Monday to mark the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, an assault that sparked a war that has devastated the Hamas-ruled Gaza strip, fueled bloodshed in other Mideast lands and stirred protests and divisions far away. Those divisions were visible in New York, where a crowd gathered for an evening remembrance ceremony in Central Park even as pro-Palestinian protesters converged on a corner of the park less than a mile away. Hamas militants' surprise cross-border attack last year killed about 1,200 people. Another 250 were taken hostage; around 100 remain in captivity, with many of them feared dead. The attack, on a major Jewish holiday, shattered Israelis’ sense of security and left the world facing the prospect of a major conflict in the Middle East. 'The unfathomable horrors I experienced that morning have transformed me, along with every single Israeli and every single Jew,' Natalie Sanandaji, a survivor from a music festival where the attackers killed hundreds, told the audience in Central Park. Israel responded to the Oct. 7 attack by waging a war against Hamas in Gaza, where the fighting has killed over 41,000 people and displaced around 1.9 million. The conflict has spread in the region, where Israel also is fighting Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, facing escalating threats from Yemen's Houthi rebels and contending with a mounting conflict with Iran, which backs Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. In New York, protesters spread a large Palestinian flag on a street near the New York Stock Exchange early Monday afternoon, while a smaller group of counterprotesters held an Israeli flag. The pro-Palestinian group grew to a blocks-long column as it marched through Manhattan streets, at one point holding a banner that read 'war begets war' on the steps of the New York Public Library. Associated Press journalists saw several people being taken into police custody at various points in the march. Police said multiple arrests were made; no further information was immediately available. While the protesters paused to conduct a Muslim evening prayer at the southwestern corner of Central Park, the parents of American-Israeli hostage Omer Neutra shared their anguish from the park's SummerStage venue. 'We would never have imagined we would still be standing here a whole year later, with no news of him,' his mother, Orna Neutra, told hundreds of people at an event that drew New York’s governor, mayor, U.S. senators and other elected officials. Her son, a New York-born Israeli soldier, turns 23 next week. At Philadelphia's Weitzman National Museum of American Jewish History, a New Jersey high school group viewed an exhibition about the Tribe of Nova music festival in Re’im, Israel, where over 360 people were killed. 'I feel like that really could have been me there,' said student Ellie Solomon. Many festivalgoers were close to her age, she noted. 'It’s important for us to remember them and honor them because they didn’t deserve anything that happened to them,' she added. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, also toured the exhibition and emerged hoping that it gave people 'an understanding of what really happened' and made them more tolerant 'and more committed to finding peace in our society and peace across the globe.' In an echo of campus protests across the U.S. last spring, activists gathered again at colleges Monday. About 200 pro-Palestinian protesters chanted and held banners and flags at the University of California, Los Angeles, while a few other demonstrators held Israeli flags. Six months after counterprotesters attacked a pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA, some people wore helmets to Monday's demonstration in case of violence. The protest was peaceful. In Europe, where countries have sought to tamp down antisemitic and anti-Muslim sentiment, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in Hamburg that 'we stand beside' Israelis, and he also pointed to the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. The chancellery in Berlin was adorned with a yellow ribbon commemorating Israeli hostages, and the names of people killed and kidnapped were read out at the Brandenburg Gate. In Italy, Premier Giorgia Meloni visited Rome's main synagogue and reaffirmed Israel’s right to defend itself, while lamenting the devastation unleashed by Israeli forces in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron met in Paris with relatives of hostages and of the dead. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot attended a memorial service at the Nova festival site. The Vatican took up a collection for the people of Gaza and published a letter expressing Pope Francis' solidarity. In the Polish capital of Warsaw, the Jewish community paid tribute to Alex Dancyg, a Polish-born Holocaust educator who was abducted from the Nir Oz kibbutz on Oct. 7. Israel believes he died in captivity. In Australia, thousands of people attended vigils in Sydney and Melbourne, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese joining the latter event. A day after thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators rallied across Australia's cities, hundreds gathered amid a heavy police presence at Sydney town hall to remember Palestinians killed in the conflict. In Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, schoolchildren took part in a pro-Palestinian rally organized by the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League party. Japanese officials demanded the immediate release of all hostages and expressed condolences to Israelis who lost relatives. ___ Vejpongsa reported from Philadelphia and Spike from Budapest, Hungary.

Jewish community gathers in Skokie to mourn victims of Hamas atta...	SKOKIE, Ill. - Monday marks one year since Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people, including 46 Americans. In remembrance of that day, the Jewish community will be gathering in Skokie Monday night, standing with the Israeli people. 'Everything started at 6 a.m. and it ended around 2 p.m., so we had to choose to hide or cross an open field while terrorists shooting behind us,' said Shahar Gabay, a survivor of the Oct. 7 attack. 'We were in a van; the van got shot at, and we had to decide to stay in the van or jump from the van.' Gabay was at the Nova Music Festival that day, the outdoor concert where hundreds of Jewish people were killed and over 40 take hostage by Hamas. SEE ALSO: Highland Park remembers Hamas attacks on 1-year anniversary U.S. Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Illinois), spoke in solidarity with the Jewish people Monday, calling for all hostages to be freed and for peace in the Middle East. One of the hostages, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, had Chicago ties and was killed by captors after being held for nearly a year. His body was found in an underground tunnel in Gaza in late August. Goldberg-Polin's aunt is expected to speak Monday night, as is the Chicago President of the Jewish United Fund. The community is coming together to mourn and stand together in support of Israel. This comes as demonstrators gathered on several Chicago college campuses Monday, including DePaul. Organizers of the encampment that took over the DePaul quad last May met to pray and remember the Palestinian lives lost in Gaza. Trump and Harris mark somber anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel 'We're trying to bring back the humanization of our people becasue I think after Oct. 7, we witnesses a lot of dehumanization of Palestinians, which is what we're trying to retain today,' After that gathering, students marched to the student center on campus. A walkout was also held at the University of Illinois Chicago.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/skokie-jewish-community-remembers-hamas/	2024-10-07T16:41:20-07:00	
Biden, Trump, Harris mark somber anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7 att...	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are marking the first anniversary of the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust as the presidential candidates approach the final weeks of the campaign during a widening conflict in the Middle East. Political leaders across the spectrum were marking the killing of about 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, by Hamas-led militants in the Oct. 7 attack last year, and the taking of about 250 hostages. A year later, about 100 people, including several Americans, remain in captivity, as U.S.-led efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage release deal have sputtered out. Trump will visit the New York City gravesite of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who led the Chabad-Lubavitch movement of Orthodox Judaism from 1951 until his death in 1994. Schneerson was the movement’s seventh leader, known as Lubavitcher Rebbe. Trump then will speak before Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in the Miami suburb of Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and, with her husband, plant a pomegranate tree on the grounds of the Vice President’s Residence in honor of the those killed a year ago. Earlier Monday, Harris’ husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, recited a prayer for peace at an event to commemorate the anniversary hosted by the American Jewish Committee in Washington. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden also hosted a somber memorial ceremony at the White House Monday to mark the one-year anniversary of the attack. The Bidens looked on as Rabbi Aaron Alexander of Washington’s Adas Israel Congregation recited the Jewish remembrance prayer for the more than 1,200 people, including dozens of Americans, killed that day, listing the towns, villages and festival site that were the scenes of the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. The president then lit a lone memorial candle placed on a small table at the center of the Blue Room, before they observed a moment of silence. Earlier in the day, Biden spoke with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, the White House said. The attack sparked a deadly war in Gaza, as Israel moved to root out Hamas' control over the territory and try to return those taken captive. Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, including many women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians. Another Iran-backed group, Hezbollah, has fired thousands of rockets at Israeli territory in the same period from Lebanon, and Israel last month expanded a campaign of sabotage and assassination and launched a ground incursion into Lebanon to combat the threat from the group. Iran, meanwhile, has fired large missile salvos at Israel, most recently a week ago, as the U.S. maintains troops and weaponry in the region to help Israel shoot them down. Trump has blamed both Harris and Biden for the war, arguing their administration empowered Iran, and he has tried to take advantage of some of the divisions within the Democratic Party with progressives protesting Israel's war. Some of Trump's statements on Israel overlook his association with people who spew antisemitic rhetoric such as far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West. Trump has repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats 'should have their head examined' and recently said that if he loses the presidential election to Harris on Nov. 5 'the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that.' In an excerpt released from an interview with CBS’ '60 Minutes' that will air Monday night, Harris appeared to avoid answering a question about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered 'a real close ally,' and said, 'The better question is: Do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.' Trump’s own relations with Netanyahu have been rocky. They soured after the Israeli prime minister became one of the first world leaders to congratulate Biden for his 2020 victory, which Trump continues to deny. A few days after the Oct. 7 attack last year, Trump publicly criticized Netanyahu and said he 'was not prepared' for the deadly incursion from Gaza. Trump said Netanyahu had let the U.S. down just before the U.S. killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020. Since then, the two have met to talk about a cease-fire deal for Gaza. Halie Soifer, head of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said the conflict in the Middle East — including fighting with Hezbollah and Iran — has left Jewish voters 'with a sense of vulnerability and concern for Israel’s future.' Soifer previously advised Harris on national security issues. She says Harris has been consistent with a message of commitment to Israel’s defense for the last year, and says that Harris and Biden have directed U.S. forces to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel on multiple occasions. ___ Megerian reported from Washington.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-trump-and-harris-mark-somber-anniversary-of-hamas-oct-7-attack-on-israel/	2024-10-07T10:04:43-07:00	
Middle East latest: Palestinian militants in Gaza fire rockets in...	Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday as mourners marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, without disrupting a nearby ceremony. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said an Israeli strike in the country’s south killed at least 10 firefighters. Hamas also said it attacked Israeli forces in different parts of Gaza. The Israeli military said it launched a wave of artillery and airstrikes overnight and into Monday to thwart what it said was an imminent attack. It said it targeted Hamas launch posts and underground militant infrastructure. The fighting on the anniversary underscored the militants’ resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive that has killed around 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials. It has also destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population. Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into nearby army bases and farming communities in a surprise attack one year ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding around 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has also vowed to strike Iran in response to a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week. ___ Here is The Latest: US Treasury sanctions 3 people for helping bankroll Hamas WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury on Monday sanctioned three people in Europe, a charity group and a bank in Gaza, all accused of helping to bankroll militant group Hamas. Treasury says Hamas and its affiliates raise funds through sham charities and as of this year, the militant Palestinian group may have received as much as $10 million a month through such donations. Included in the sanctions: Mohammad Hannoun, an Italy-based Hamas member and his Charity Association of Solidarity with the Palestinian People; Majed al-Zeer, a senior Hamas representative in Germany and Adel Doughman, who is in charge of Hamas activity in Austria. Additionally, Al-Intaj, an unlicensed Hamas-run bank in Gaza was sanctioned for allegedly providing services to Hamas. 'As we mark one year since Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, Treasury will continue relentlessly degrading the ability of Hamas and other destabilizing Iranian proxies to finance their operations and carry out additional violent acts,' Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. Israeli defense minister will hold talks in Washington WASHINGTON -- Israel’s defense minister is to travel to Washington this week for talks at the Pentagon. The visit by Yoav Gallant comes at a sensitive time in the yearlong Mideast conflict. Israel has vowed to attack Iran following an intense Iranian missile barrage last week. Such an attack could rattle international oil markets and potentially draw in American forces in the region. Israel has also been expanding a ground offensive against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. The Pentagon’s spokesman, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, announced the visit on the platform X, saying that Gallant and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would discuss 'ongoing Middle East security developments.' Gallant’s office confirmed the scheduled visit but gave no further details. A Lebanese mountain village mourns the dead in an airstrike QMATIYEH, Lebanon — A village in the mountains southeast of Beirut was in shock after an Israeli airstrike demolished a residential building and partly destroyed another, killing seven people, including three children. Hadi Zahwe, a resident of the area, told reporters that the strike on Sunday was 'terrifying.' 'There were children killed, there were children’s body parts,' he said. 'This enemy is targeting civilian women and children.' Israel has carried out a widening aerial bombardment of many parts of southern and eastern Lebanon and Beirut’s southern suburbs over the past two weeks, targeting what it said were Hezbollah militants and weapons. It was not clear what the intended target was in Sunday’s strike, which was the first one to hit the area. Mahmoud Nasr Eldin, the town’s deputy mayor, said the village contains 'no security or military centers.' ''There’s nothing in Qmatiyeh that they’re looking for — it’s a safe area,' he said. 'We welcomed around 15,000 internally displaced people. They are our people, they ran away from their villages and came to get protection here.' A 12-year-old Palestinian boy is fatally shot in the West Bank RAMALLAH, West Bank — Israeli troops shot and killed a 12-year-old Palestinian boy in the central West Bank Monday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The boy was fatally shot in the stomach at the Qalandiya refugee camp, the ministry said. Commenting on the shooting, the Israeli army said its forces opened fire at rioters who were hurling rocks at troops operating in the area. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian new agency, the shooting occurred during an Israeli military raid on the camp. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war a year ago, violence has surged in the occupied West Bank, where over 700 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, according to the Health Ministry. Netanyahu says Israel is waging a 'war of resurrection' JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that Israel was fighting a 'war of resurrection' and would continue until achieving its goals, as Israelis marked the anniversary of the Hamas attack. 'This is the war of our existence — the ‘war of resurrection’. This is what I would like to officially call the war,' Netanyahu said during a Cabinet meeting. His comment provoked a response from a group representing the families of the hostages held in Gaza, who said they wished to 'remind the prime minister that there is and will be no resurrection without the return of all the hostages.' In a statement earlier, Netanyahu vowed that Israel would keep fighting until the 'living and dead' hostages were returned, Hamas is overthrown in Gaza and residents of the country’s north and south could go back to their homes. 'Since that black day, we are under attack on seven fronts,' Netanyahu said, referring to Oct. 7, 2023. He said counterattacking Iranian-backed groups 'is a necessary condition for securing our future.' French foreign minister on a visit to Israel pleads for a cease-fire PARIS — French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot on Monday pleaded in favor of a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon, saying that France and its partners were 'ready to work collectively for de-escalation and peace in the region.' 'After a year of war, the time for diplomacy has come,' Barrot said in Jerusalem. He earlier took part in a memorial service at the site of the Nova music festival, where about 1,200 people were killed and some 250 were taken hostage in Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, 2023. He said he had held multiple meetings while touring the region in recent days, including in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan. Barrot reiterated France’s commitment to Israel’s security as 'unwavering,' but said 'force alone cannot guarantee Israel’s security.' Barrot said that a two-state solution is 'the only one that guarantees a just and lasting peace.' Barrot’s comments came two days after French President Emmanuel Macron called for 'a halt to arms exports for use in Gaza,' drawing strong criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Both leaders spoke over the phone on Sunday. Macron’s office said the French leader told Netanyahu that arms deliveries, the prolongation of the war in Gaza and its extension to Lebanon will not produce security for either Israelis or others living in the region. 'We must be consistent,' Barrot said on Monday. 'We cannot ask for a cease-fire while arming the belligerents.' Barrot announced that France will hold in a few days an international conference in support of Lebanon's army and to help strengthen its institutions. Swedish, Czech prime ministers condemn Hamas' attack a year ago STOCKHOLM — Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Monday that Hamas' attack on Israel a year ago was 'the worst mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust was committed.' Kristersson said the attack also 'led to an escalated conflict in the Middle East that is still ongoing, with tens of thousands of civilian casualties and enormous suffering.' Kristersson called for a cease-fire and the release of hostages, a de-escalation in the region and an increased humanitarian access. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala reiterated his country’s support for Israel on the anniversary of the attack by Hamas. 'A few days ago, Israel was attacked again by Iran. Again, unfortunately, anti-Semitism in various forms is also on the rise,' Fiala wrote on X. 'Tensions in the Middle East bring suffering to many people. However, terrorist organizations will not bring peace and a dignified life to people there. Israel defends its existence, it is repeatedly attacked and must have the right to defend itself. Therefore, on the day of this tragic anniversary, I repeat: The Czech Republic stands by Israel!' Erdogan condemns Israel's military actions in Gaza and Lebanon ANKARA, Turkey — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack to condemn Israel's military actions in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Today, I remember with sorrow the tens of thousands of people that the murderous Israeli government has massacred since Oct. 7,' Erdogan said in a message posted on X. 'I convey my most heartfelt condolences to my brothers from Gaza, Palestine, and Lebanon.' An outspoken critic of Israel’s actions in Gaza and more recently the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Erdogan said: 'Israel’s long-standing policy of genocide, occupation, and invasion must finally come to an end.' He has praised Hamas previously as a 'liberation group.' Erdogan on Monday made no mention of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, in which the militants killed about 1,200 people and dragged some 250 hostages back to Gaza. The subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians and displaced most of the territory’s 2.3 million population. 'Israel will sooner or later pay the price for this genocide, which it has been implementing for a year and which is still continuing,' Erdogan wrote. 'Just as Hitler was stopped by a joint alliance of humanity, (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and his killer network will be stopped in the same way.' Pope Francis refers to the ‘fuse of hatred’ lit a year ago ROME — The Vatican marked the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel by taking up a collection for the people of Gaza and publishing a letter form Pope Francis to Catholics in the region expressing his solidarity. Francis made no mention of Israel, Hamas or hostages in the letter dated Oct. 7 and addressed to Catholics in the Middle East, especially in Gaza. He referred to the 'fuse of hatred' being lit one year ago, and the spiral of violence that had ensued, in insisting that what is needed is dialogue and peace. After some comments that upset Israel early on in the conflict, Francis has usually tried to strike an even tone, often referring to Palestinians and Israel in his frequent appeals for peace. But he recently suggested Israel was using disproportionate and 'immoral' force in Lebanon and Gaza. And on the Oct. 7 anniversary, Francis spoke in general terms to people of all religious confessions in the region, thanking Christians for staying in their historic lands and directing himself in a particular way to the people of Gaza. 'I am close to you, I am with you. I am with you, the people of Gaza, long embattled and in dire straits. You are in my thoughts and prayers daily,' he wrote. Francis said he was particularly close to those who have been forced to flee their homes to find refuge from bombing; to the mothers weeping over their dead children and those 'who are afraid to look up for fear of fire raining down from the skies.' Francis has called for a day of fasting and prayer on Monday, and his chief almsgiver announced he was taking up a collection from participants in Francis’ big meeting of bishops at the Vatican this week. He urged donors to be particularly generous, saying the proceeds of the fundraising drive would go straight to the Catholic parish in Gaza, where Francis calls every day. At least 10 Lebanese firefighters killed in the country's south BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry said an Israeli strike in the country’s south killed at least 10 firefighters on Monday. It said more people were buried under the rubble and the death toll may rise. The ministry said the firefighters were in a municipality building in the town of Baraachit that was hit as they prepared to embark on a rescue mission. Biden and Harris condemn Hamas on the attack anniversary and call for a cease-fire WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris condemned Hamas on the anniversary of the militant group’s attack on Israel, while reiterating their administration’s commitment to cementing cease-fire deals to end fighting in Gaza and Lebanon. 'On this solemn anniversary, let us bear witness to the unspeakable brutality of the October 7th attacks but also to the beauty of the lives that were stolen that day,' Biden said in a statement. The president said that he thinks every day of the more than 100 hostages still in captivity and their families. He vowed that his administration 'will never give up until we bring all of the remaining hostages home safely.' Biden added that 'history will also remember October 7th as a dark day for the Palestinian people because of the conflict that Hamas unleashed that day.' Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the Israel-Hamas war. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. 'It is far past time for a hostage and ceasefire deal to end the suffering of innocent people,' Harris said. 'And I will always fight for the Palestinian people to be able to realize their right to dignity, freedom, security, and self-determination.' Israeli military warns dozens of towns in southern Lebanon to evacuate BEIRUT — The Israeli military Monday warned people in over a dozen towns and villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate, including the coastal town where the U.N. peacekeeping mission is headquartered. Israeli evacuation warnings in recent days have expanded to include a provincial capital, as troops continue their ground incursion backed by intense airstrikes. The U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as UNIFIL, is headquartered in Naqoura, not far from the coastal city of Tyre. Israel’s Arabic military spokesperson Avichay Adraee in a post on X told residents to immediately flee north. 'You are not allowed to head southward,' the statement read. 'Any movement to the south puts your lives at risk.' Lebanon’s cash-strapped government estimates that some 1.2 million people have been displaced in the fighting and it's struggling to support them. Israel says its aim is to weaken Hezbollah to allow its displaced residents to move back to northern Israel. Hezbollah maintains that it will stop firing rockets at Israel when there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, in solidarity with its ally Hamas. Israeli military orders an evacuation in southern Gaza after Hamas' rocket attack JERUSALEM — The Israeli military ordered people to evacuate areas near the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip after Hamas fired rockets at Tel Aviv. The military had also ordered an evacuation of the areas east of Khan Younis earlier in the war when it sent ground troops into the territory’s second largest city. The latest orders on Monday came after a barrage of five rockets triggered air raid sirens in central Israel, lightly wounded two women and caused minor damage. The military said the rockets were fired from the area of Khan Younis. Hamas claimed the attack, which came as Israelis marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza that triggered the war. On Sunday, the military reiterated warnings for the entire population of northern Gaza to flee south. Those warnings date back to the early weeks of the war, when Israeli forces sealed off the north and launched heavy operations there. A year of war has inflicted heavy losses on Hamas, but its fighters have repeatedly regrouped in areas where Israel has carried out large operations. Netanyahu addresses an Oct. 7 memorial JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel 'arose as a nation as lions' following the Oct. 7 attack a year ago. 'We remember our fallen, our hostages — whom we are committed to return — our heroes who fell in defense of our homeland and country. We went through a terrible massacre a year ago and we arose as a nation as lions,' Netanyahu said at a memorial commemorating the anniversary of the attack. He visited the memorial in Jerusalem for civilians, first responders and soldiers killed in the Hamas-led attack and the war it ignited. He spoke alongside the mayor of Jerusalem as the two held a small tribute at an event that appeared closed to the public. Netanyahu has faced heavy criticism for security lapses that allowed the attack to unfold and mass protests over his failure to return some 100 hostages still held in Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. The attack one year ago killed some 1,200 people across southern Israel, mostly civilians. Palestinian militants dragged some 250 hostages back to Gaza. The subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians and displaced most of the territory’s 2.3 million population. Nearly 700 Americans have left Lebanon WASHINGTON — The State Department says nearly 700 American citizens, green card holders and family members have now left Lebanon aboard U.S.-contracted planes since late September. The department said Monday that about 90 passengers — less than a third of the planes 300-person capacity — departed Beirut for Istanbul, Turkey, on Sunday on the latest flight. Hundreds of other Americans have left Lebanon aboard regularly scheduled commercial flights since fighting between Israel and Hezbollah intensified. The department said it has made more than 2,900 seats available for Americans on those flights. Jordan's foreign minister criticizes Israel's war with Hezbollah BEIRUT — Jordan’s top diplomat on Monday slammed Israel’s war with the militant Hezbollah group in Lebanon, saying it is pushing the Middle East into the 'abyss of full-scale regional war.' 'We are facing a disaster and a dangerous escalation that threatens the region,' Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi. 'Israel bears responsibility of this aggression, the escalation in the region, and any new escalation that the region faces.' He spoke in a news conference following a meeting with Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati in Beirut. Safadi said that Jordan backs the Lebanese government’s initiative to elect a new president and commitment to implement the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended Israel’s last war with Hezbollah in 2006, and that would keep southern Lebanon exclusively under the control of the Lebanese military and U.N. peacekeepers. He added that Jordan, like Lebanon, backed an initiative by the United States and France for a three-week cease-fire in Lebanon. Meanwhile, as the region braces for an Israeli retaliation for Iran's missile attack, Safadi said Jordan rejects either country using its airspace in their tit-for-tat hostitilies. 'We will not a battlefield for anyone,' he said. 'We made this message clear to Iran and to Israel as well.' Australian prime minister attends a vigil in Melbourne MELBOURNE, Australia — Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attended a vigil commemorating the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and walked in Melbourne with members of the Jewish community and lawmakers from across party lines. Albanese was not expected to speak at the vigil, attended by thousands. In a statement, he said the day carried 'terrible pain' and his government 'unequivocally' condemned Hamas’ actions. 'Since the atrocities of October 7, Jewish Australians have felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day -- and as a nation we say never again,' he said. 'We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred. There is no place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith,' Albanese said. He acknowledged the 'devastating' loss of civilian lives since Oct. 7. Hundreds of people gathered Monday night at Sydney town hall for a vigil for Palestinian lives lost in the conflict amid a heavy police presence. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters had rallied across Australia’s cities on Sunday. Meanwhile, the first of two repatriation flights organized by the Australian government to transport Australians from Lebanon touched down in Sydney on Monday evening with nearly 350 people on board. Kibbutz Be'eri commemorates the Oct. 7 attack KIBBUTZ BE’ERI, Israel — Members of Kibbutz Be’eri, one of the hardest-hit communities during the Oct. 7 attack, gathered amid the burned ruins of their homes and demanded an immediate return of the hostages during a memorial and rally on Monday. More than 95 people were killed there and 30 were taken hostage on Oct. 7, according to the community’s spokesperson. Some of the women and children from the kibbutz were released in a cease-fire deal in November, but 10 hostages from Be’eri remain in captivity. Israel believes most of them are no longer alive. On Monday, the community marched silently through the streets of the kibbutz bearing signs of the hostages before gathering for a rally, unfurling a massive flag with the words 'Be’eri cannot heal until everyone is home.' Ella Ben-Ami, whose father Ohad Ben-Ami was kidnapped from Be’eri, addressed the crowd and demanded the government of Israel bring her father home. She said she continues to take solace from the video of his kidnapping, when he stands tall and proud, as if he knew he was being filmed, to broadcast a message to his family that he would be OK. Many people at Be’eri were dreading the anniversary, which felt like an 'impossible' amount of time, she said. 'But then I stop for a moment I think that my father woke up today to count a year in captivity, a year!' she said. Meloni visits the Rome synagogue ROME — Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who has voiced strong support for Israel, commemorated the Oct. 7 anniversary by visiting the main synagogue in Rome and reaffirming Israel’s right to defend itself. Meloni also denounced the 'latent and rampant antisemitism' that has arisen in the year since the Hamas attacks, citing in particular pro-Palestinian protests in Italy over the weekend, some of which turned violent. While asserting Israel’s lights to live safely within its borders, she insisted that it respect international law and lamented the devastation unleashed by Israeli forces in Gaza. She said Palestinians in Gaza had been 'victims twice over: first of Hamas’ cynicism, which uses them as human shields, and then of Israeli military operations.' As the current president of the Group of Seven, Italy will continue to work for an immediate cease-fire, 'the release of Israeli hostages and the stabilization of the Israeli-Lebanese border through the full implementation of U.N. resolutions,' Meloni said. Since coming to office in 2022, Meloni has taken several initiatives to show her strong support for Italy’s Jewish community and Israel. Her Brothers of Italy party has roots in the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, or MSI, which was founded in 1946 by sympathizers of Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Hamas fires rockets from Gaza, setting off sirens in central Tel Aviv TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said on Monday that projectiles fired from Gaza set off sirens in central Tel Aviv, as Israel marks a year to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. There were no immediate reports of damage or injury. The sirens came as Israelis were marking the anniversary to the deadliest attack in their country’s history. That attack one year ago began with a volley of rockets from Gaza. Israeli strikes hit locations used by Hamas-run police in central Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes hit two makeshift points used by Hamas-run police at a hospital in central Gaza, wounding a journalist. There were no police present at the sites when they were hit early Monday. Ali al-Attar, a journalist working for Al Jazeera, was hit by shrapnel while he was inside a tent used by reporters nearby, according to an Associated Press journalist. Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, operated a police force numbering in the tens of thousands before the war. They have adopted a low profile after being repeatedly targeted by Israeli strikes but still maintain control on the ground in Gaza. Lebanon's Hezbollah group pledges to keep fighting Israel BEIRUT — The Lebanese Hezbollah militant group on Monday reaffirmed its commitment to support Hamas by fighting Israel along Lebanon's southern border. The statement came a year after its allies from the Palestinian Hamas group staged a surprise attack into southern Israel, setting off the war, and amid ongoing intense Israeli airstrikes and a ground incursion into Lebanon. Hezbollah maintains that it will stop its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, and although its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed. Large swaths of southern and eastern Lebanon have been targeted in Israeli airstrikes. 'We are confident, God willing, in the ability of our resistance to repel the aggression, and in our great and resistant people to be patient, steadfast, and endure until this calamity is removed,' Hezbollah said. The Lebanese government estimates that some 1.2 million people in Lebanon have been displaced, mostly during the escalations less than a month ago. Hezbollah also praised Iran and other Tehran-backed groups in the region, notably Yemen's Houthis and Iraqi Shiite militias for their attacks on Israel. Families gather across southern Israel to mark anniversary of Oct 7 attack BE’ERI, Israel — Across southern Israel on Monday, families gathered in spots where their loved ones were killed during Hamas’ attack, marking a year since the assault that sparked the war in Gaza. They crowded into roadside bomb shelters that became death traps when people seeking shelter from Hamas rockets and militants were sprayed with bullets or struck by grenades. People were also visiting spots on the side of a main road marked with memorials. In Kibbutz Be’eri, one of the hardest-hit communities struck in Hamas’ attack, where roughly 100 residents were killed and 30 kidnapped on Oct. 7, hundreds marched silently holding signs bearing photos of people still being held captive in Gaza. They held a rally in front of homes destroyed in the attack. French President Macron says pain of Oct 7 ‘as vivid as it was a year ago’ PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron took to social media on Monday to mark the one-year anniversary since Hamas’ attack on Israel. 'The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity,' Macron said on X. 'We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts.' French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot was in Israel for the anniversary and attended a memorial service at the site of the Nova music festival where hundreds were killed in Hamas’ attack. Barrot, talking to the families of victims, pledged France’s support in the face of 'the worst anti-Semitic massacre in our history since the Holocaust.' 'The joyful dawn of what should have been a day of celebration was suddenly torn apart by unspeakable horror,' he said. 'France mourns alongside Israel our 48 compatriots victims of barbarism.' Barrot, who is expected to speak with his counterpart Israel Katz later Monday, said that Macron will also meet in Paris with family members of Israelis held hostage today. Japan expresses condolences on anniversary of Hamas attack TOKYO — Japan has expressed its condolences to families of victims on the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and demanded the immediate release of hostages. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters on Monday that Japan is seriously concerned about the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip amid continued fighting, the large number of civilian casualties and the ongoing security threats to both Israeli and Palestinian people. 'Japan continues to urge all parties including Israel to comply with international law, including international humanitarian law, and strongly urges them to steadily work toward realization of a cease-fire,' Hayashi said. He added that Japan strongly supports mediation efforts by the United States, Egypt and Qatar in achieving negotiations for the release of the hostages and a cease-fire. Group representing families of hostages announces death of a captive TEL AVIV, Israel — A group representing the families of Israeli hostages announced on Monday the death of a captive whose body is still being held in Gaza. The Hostages and Families Forum said Idan Shtivi, 28, was captured from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7. He was thought to have been taken alive. Israeli media reported that he was killed that day and his body was taken into Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Shtivi’s death became apparent, but in previous such announcements, the Israeli military has discovered evidence indicating a hostage’s death. The announcement of Shtivi’s death comes as Israelis are marking one year since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, where militants killed 1,200 people and kidnapped 250 others. About 100 remain in captivity, although more than a third of those are said to be dead. Hundreds gather at Nova music festival site to remember Oct 7 victims RE’IM, Israel — Hundreds of families and friends of people killed at the Nova music festival gathered Monday at the site of the attack, where nearly 400 were gunned down during Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault. Families gathered around photos of their loved ones, which were arranged in a semicircle around what was the DJ stage. Many lit candles and added mementos or photos, crying and embracing. Overhead, army helicopters circled and constant booms echoed across the area, causing many to flinch. 'We can’t understand how a year has passed,' said Shimon Busika, whose son, Yarden, 25, was killed at the festival. 'It’s the most natural place to be, to be here for this moment of silence,' he said. Busika said it took them a long time, piecing together testimony from other survivors, to understand what happened in Yarden’s last moments. They now know he was killed around 9:20 near a yellow container at the festival where many others were killed, and they will hold a second minute of silence there at the moment he was killed. The last sounds of the trance track that was playing at the Nova site on Oct. 7 one year ago stopped abruptly, as hundreds of family members and friends of the more than 300 victims stood in a moment of silence. One woman’s piercing wail broke the silence as booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers (miles) away. 20 Indonesians who were evacuated from Lebanon arrive in Jakarta JAKARTA, Indonesia — Twenty Indonesian nationals and a Lebanese evacuated from Lebanon arrived in Jakarta on a commercial flight early Monday and will likely be followed by 20 more in the afternoon, officials said. President Joko Widodo has called to prioritize the evacuation of Indonesians in Lebanon as hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalate and fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East grow. 'I have directed the foreign affairs minister to take immediate action to ensure the safety and protection of our citizens and expedite their evacuation,' Widodo said last week. Indonesia’s Embassy in Beirut had prepared evacuation procedures for citizens as part of its contingency planning since August. The Embassy evacuated 25 Indonesian citizens who returned safely to Indonesia last month, said Judha Nugraha, Director of Indonesian Citizen Protection at the Foreign Affairs Ministry. There are 116 registered Indonesian citizens in Lebanon, most of them students, migrant workers and people married to Lebanese nationals. Many of them have chosen to remain there for various reasons, Nugraha said. Australian PM Albanese condemns Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement Monday that the day carried 'terrible pain' and his government 'unequivocally' condemned Hamas' attack on Israel a year ago. Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns on Oct. 7 a year ago, killing dozens and abducting others in an unprecedented surprise attack. Albanese said that since the attack, Jewish Australians have 'felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day — and as a nation we say never again.' 'We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred. There is no place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith,' Albanese said. He added that 'every innocent life matters' and the number of civilians killed in the conflict was 'a devastating tragedy.' 'Today we reflect on the truth of our shared humanity, of the hope that peace is possible, and the belief that it belongs to all people,' Albanese said. New Israeli strikes hit Beirut suburbs as Hezbollah claims blasts in Israel's Haifa BEIRUT — A new round of airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs late Sunday as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon. Palestinian officials said a strike on a mosque in Gaza killed at least 19 people. Rocket sirens and blasts were heard in Haifa in northern Israel late Sunday, and Hezbollah claimed the attack. Israel’s military said at least five projectiles were identified coming from Lebanon and 'fallen projectiles' were found in the area. The military showed what appeared to be rubble along a street. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating a teen with shrapnel injuries to the head and a man who fell from a window due to a blast.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-palestinian-militants-in-gaza-fire-4-rockets-into-israel-as-mourners-mark-oct-7/	2024-10-07T07:35:30-07:00	
Ukraine strikes a Russian oil hub as Zelenskyy says the war is in...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s military said it struck a major oil terminal Monday in Crimea that provides fuel for Russia’s war effort as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the war has entered a key phase. Both sides are facing the issue of how to sustain their costly war of attrition — a conflict that started with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and that shows no signs of a resolution. Ukraine’s General Staff said on social media that the oil terminal in Feodosia, on the south coast of the Russia-occupied Crimea Peninsula, has been supplying the Russian army with fuel and that the strike was part of an ongoing effort to 'undermine the military and economic potential of the Russian Federation.' Russian-installed authorities in the city of Feodosia on the coast of the Black Sea reported a fire at the terminal on Monday morning but did not say what might have caused it. Ukraine has increasingly targeted rear areas that are essential for Russia’s onslaught, now deep into its third year. It has developed long-range drones that have hit oil depots and refineries as well as armories. Ukraine's aim is to impair Russia’s ability to support its front-line units, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where the main Russian battlefield effort is stretching weary Ukrainian forces. Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil. Developments on that question could come next weekend at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, when defense leaders from the 50-plus partner nations that coordinate military aid to Ukraine are due to meet. The conflict has largely been a war of attrition, which requires large amounts of ammunition. Late on Sunday, Zelenskyy said the war is in 'a very important phase' as the Ukrainian army works hard to hold the bigger Russian forces at bay in the east while also holding ground in Russia’s Kursk border region, which it captured two months ago. Ukraine needs to 'put pressure on Russia in the way that’s necessary for Russia to realize that the war will gain them nothing,' Zelenskyy said in a video statement. 'We will continue to apply even greater pressure on Russia — because only through strength can we bring peace closer,' he added. Meanwhile, Russia fired six missiles of various types and 74 Shahed drones at Ukraine overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Missile debris fell in three districts of Kyiv, causing minor damage to civilian infrastructure and starting a fire, Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said. He said nobody was hurt. Three missile fragments fell on a kindergarten, he said without elaborating. The acting head of the Communications Department of Ukraine’s Air Force, Yurii Ihnat, said that two of the hypersonic Kinzhal missiles that were shot down over the Kyiv region were aimed at the capital city. 'Despite the fact that it’s getting harder, despite (Russia's) improvements and the use of new tactics, today we have two shoot-downs,' Ihnat said. Despite Ukraine’s high interception rates, some weapons still get through. 'They are learning from their mistakes and from our mistakes. They are improving their technology so that we are able to shoot down fewer of them,' Ihnat told AP. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it shot down almost two dozen Ukrainian drones overnight. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraine-strikes-a-russian-oil-hub-as-zelenskyy-says-the-war-is-in-a-very-important-phase/	2024-10-07T06:16:31-07:00	
War rages on multiple fronts as Israel marks a year since Hamas' ...	RE'IM, Israel (AP) — Israelis held somber ceremonies on Monday to mark a year since the deadliest attack in the country's history, a Hamas-led raid that shattered its sense of security and ignited wars on two fronts with no end in sight. Hamas marked the anniversary of its Oct. 7, 2023, attack by firing a barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv, underscoring its resilience after a year of war and devastation in Gaza. Lebanon's Hezbollah, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8 in support if its ally Hamas, vowed to keep up the barrages despite its recent losses. The surprise cross-border attack one year ago — which caught Israelis unprepared on a major Jewish holiday — shook their faith in their leaders and their military, and its aftershocks are still rippling across the region. Around 100 hostages captured that day have not been returned, a third of whom are believed to be dead, and cease-fire efforts have ground to a halt. The war in Gaza rages on and Israel is fighting a new war against Hezbollah. There is also an escalating conflict with Iran — which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah — that threatens to drag the region into an even more dangerous conflagration. No formal commemorative event is planned in Gaza, where fighting is still underway, huge areas have been completely destroyed and most of the population have been driven from their homes. In Lebanon, meanwhile, an Israeli strike killed at least 10 firefighters, the latest in a series of strikes that have killed dozens of first responders, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. It said they were in a municipality building in the southern town of Baraachit that was hit as they prepared for a mission. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israelis hold memorials and call for the return of hostages Israelis flocked to ceremonies, cemeteries and memorial sites around the country, remembering the hundreds of victims, the dozens of hostages still in captivity and soldiers killed in battle. Commemorations were also planned across Europe and elsewhere. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted another 250. Before dawn, hundreds of families of those killed at the Nova music festival, joined by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, gathered at the site where at least 364 revelers were killed and many others were taken hostage. As the sun rose, organizers played the same trance track that was abruptly halted when the barrage of rockets began. At 6:29 a.m. — the exact minute Hamas launched its attack — the crowd observed a moment of silence. A woman’s piercing wail broke the quiet and booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers (miles) away. 'When we are here, we are near our loved ones,' said Sigal Bar-On, whose niece, Yuval Bar-On, 25, and her fiancé Moshe Shuva, 34, were killed in the attack two months before they were to be married. 'We can’t understand how a year has passed,' said Shimon Busika, whose 25-year-old son Yarden was killed at the festival. At 6:31 a.m., four projectiles were launched from Gaza toward the same communities that came under attack last year, without disrupting the ceremony. The military said another five rockets were launched from the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis toward central Israel, setting off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv. Two women were lightly wounded, according to first responders, and there was minor damage. The military said it struck the launch sites. Meanwhile, the families of hostages still held in Gaza gathered near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence and stood during a two-minute siren. 'We are here to remind (the hostages) that we haven’t forgotten them,' said Shiri Albag, whose daughter Liri is among the captives. In a speech addressing Netanyahu, she said: 'We wont let you rest until all of them are back, every last one of them.' Netanyahu, who has come under heavy criticism for the security lapses on Oct. 7 and for not yet returning all the hostages, spoke at a small ceremony in Jerusalem, saying: 'We went through a terrible massacre a year ago and we arose as a nation as lions.' An official state ceremony is set to air on Monday. It was prerecorded without an audience — apparently to avoid potential disruptions — in the southern city of Ofakim, which was among several communities and army bases that were attacked a year ago. Anger at Netanyahu's government prompted families of those killed and taken captive to hold a separate event in Tel Aviv. That event had been set to draw tens of thousands of people but was scaled back due to the threat of missile attacks from Iran and Hezbollah. Hamas and Hezbollah vow to fight on Israel responded to the Oct. 7 attack by launching one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. The war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, displaced most of the territory's 2.3 million people and caused widespread hunger. 'We lost everything we have,' said Liyala al-Shanar, who fled her home in Gaza City. 'We live in a tent that doesn’t protect us from the winter cold or the summer heat.' Hamas remains in control of the territory and its forces have repeatedly regrouped in areas where Israel carried out major operations. On Sunday, Israeli forces encircled the northern town of Jabaliya and launched another major operation there that the military says is aimed at rooting out militants. In Lebanon, Hezbollah has continued to fire rockets, missiles and drones at Israel even after a wave of Israeli strikes in recent weeks killed most of its top command — including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah — and pounded large areas of Lebanon. Israel launched what has so far been a limited ground operation across the border last week. At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group from its border so tens of thousands of Israeli citizens can return home. Israel has also vowed to respond to a ballistic missile attack last week that Iran said was in response to the killing of Nasrallah, top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and one of its own Revolutionary Guard generals. In a statement on Monday, Hezbollah vowed to continue its attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, saying Israel 'was and will remain a deadly, aggressive, cancerous gland that must be eliminated, no matter how long it takes.' ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Russian court sentences a 72-year-old American to nearly 7 years ...	MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian court on Monday sentenced a 72-year-old American in a closed trial to nearly seven years in prison for allegedly fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine. Prosecutors said Stephen Hubbard signed a contract with the Ukrainian military after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and he fought alongside them until being captured two months later. He was sentenced to six years and 10 months in a general-security prison. Prosecutors had called for a sentence of seven years in a maximum-security prison. Hubbard, from the state of Michigan, is the first American known to have been convicted on charges of fighting as a mercenary in the Ukrainian conflict. The charges carried a potential sentence of 15 years, but prosecutors asked that his age be taken into account along with his admission of guilt, Russian news reports said. Arrests of Americans have become increasingly common in Russia in recent years. Concern has risen that Russia could be targeting U.S. nationals for arrest to use later as bargaining chips in talks to bring back Russians convicted of crimes in the U.S. and Europe. Also on Monday, a court in the city of Voronezh sentenced American Robert Gilman to seven years and 1 month for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers while serving a sentence for another assault. According to Russian news reports, Gilman was arrested in 2022 for causing a disturbance while intoxicated on a passenger train and then assaulted a police officer while in custody. He is serving a 3 1/2-year sentence on that charge. Last year, he assaulted a prison inspector during a cell check, then hit an official of the Investigative Committe, resulting in the new sentence, state news agency RIA-Novosti said. The U.S. and Russia in August completed their largest prisoner swap in post-Soviet history, a deal involving 24 people, many months of negotiations and concessions from other European countries, which released Russians in their custody as part of the exchange. Several U.S. citizens remain behind bars in Russia following the swap.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russian-court-sentences-a-72-year-old-american-to-nearly-7-years-in-prison-for-fighting-in-ukraine/	2024-10-07T03:23:00-07:00	
Mideast violence is spiraling a year since the Gaza war began	JERUSALEM (AP) — A year after Hamas’ fateful attack on southern Israel, the Middle East is embroiled in a war that shows no signs of ending and seems to be getting worse. Israel's retaliatory offensive was initially centered on the Gaza Strip. But the focus has shifted in recent weeks to Lebanon, where airstrikes have given way to a fast-expanding ground incursion against Hezbollah militants who have fired rockets into Israel since the Gaza war began. Next in Israel's crosshairs is archenemy Iran, which supports Hamas, Hezbollah and other anti-Israel militants in the region. After withstanding a massive barrage of missiles from Iran last week, Israel has promised to respond. The escalating conflict risks drawing deeper involvement by the U.S., as well as Iran-backed militants in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. When Hamas launched its attack on Oct. 7, 2023, it called on the Arab world to join it in a concerted campaign against Israel. While the fighting has indeed spread, Hamas and its allies have paid a heavy price. The group’s army has been decimated, its Gaza stronghold has been reduced to a cauldron of death, destruction and misery and the top leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah have been killed in audacious attacks. Although Israel appears to be gaining the edge militarily, the war has been problematic for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, too. Dozens of Israeli hostages are languishing in Hamas captivity, and a year after Netanyahu pledged to crush the group in 'total victory,' remnants of the militant group are still battling in pockets of Gaza. The offensive in Lebanon, initially described as 'limited,' grows by the day. A full-on collision with Iran is a possibility. At home, Netanyahu faces mass protests over his inability to bring home the hostages, and to many, he will be remembered as the man who led Israel into its darkest moment. Relations with the U.S. and other allies are strained. The economy is deteriorating. Here are five takeaways from a yearlong war that has upended longstanding assumptions and turned conventional wisdom on its head. A region is torn apart by unthinkable death and destruction A long list of previously unthinkable events have occurred in mind-boggling fashion. The Oct. 7 attack was the bloodiest in Israel’s history. Young partygoers were gunned down. Cowering families were killed in their homes. In all, about 1,200 people died and 250 were taken hostage. Some Israelis were raped or sexually assaulted. The ensuing war in Gaza has been the longest, deadliest and most destructive in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Gaza health authorities say nearly 42,000 people have been killed — roughly 2% of the territory’s entire population. Although they do not give a breakdown between civilians and combatants, more than half of the dead have been women and children. Numerous top Hamas officials have been killed. The damage and displacement in Gaza have reached unseen levels. Hospitals, schools and mosques – once thought to be insulated from violence – have repeatedly been targeted by Israel or caught in the crossfire. Scores of journalists and health workers have been killed, many of them while working in the line of duty. Months of simmering tensions along Israel's northern border recently boiled over into war. A growing list of Hezbollah officials – including the group’s longtime leader -- have been killed by Israel. Hundreds of Hezbollah members were killed or maimed in explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies. Israel's ground offensive is its first in Lebanon since a monthlong war in 2006. Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis and over 1 million Lebanese. Israel promises to keep pounding Hezbollah until its residents can return to homes near the Lebanese border; Hezbollah says it will keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza. The leaders of Hamas and Israel appear in no rush for a cease-fire When the war erupted, the days appeared to be numbered for both Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Netanyahu's public standing plummeted as he faced calls to step aside. Sinwar fled into Gaza’s labyrinth of tunnels as Israel declared him a 'dead man walking.' Yet both men — facing war crimes charges in international courts — remain firmly in charge, and neither appears to be in a rush for a cease-fire. The end of the war could mean the end of Netanyahu's government, which is dominated by hard-line partners opposed to a cease-fire. That would mean early elections, potentially pushing him into the opposition while he stands trial on corruption charges. Also looming is the prospect of an unflattering official inquiry into his government's failures before and during the Oct. 7 attack. Fearing that, his coalition has hung together even through mass protests and repeated disagreements with top security officials pushing for a deal to bring home the hostages. After a brief period of post-Oct. 7 national unity, Israel has returned to its divided self — torn between Netanyahu’s religious, conservative, nationalist right-wing base and his more secular, middle-class opposition. Sinwar, believed to be hiding in Gaza’s tunnels, continues to drive a hard bargain in hopes of declaring some sort of victory. His demands for a full Israeli withdrawal, a lasting cease-fire and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for scores of hostages have been rejected by Israel — even as much of the international community has embraced them. With cease-fire efforts deadlocked and Netanyahu’s far-right coalition firmly intact, the war could go on for some time. An estimated 1.9 million Palestinians remain displaced in Gaza while an estimated 68 hostages remain captive in Gaza, in addition to the bodies of 33 others held by Hamas. Bitter enemies experience the limits of force Early in the war, Netanyahu promised to destroy Hamas' military and governing abilities. Those goals have been achieved in many ways. Israel says it has dismantled Hamas’ military structure, and its rocket barrages have been diminished to a trickle. With Israeli troops stationed indefinitely in Gaza, it is difficult to see how the group could return to governing the territory or pose a serious threat. But in other ways, total victory is impossible. Despite Israel’s overwhelming force, Hamas units have repeatedly regrouped to stage guerrilla-style ambushes from areas where Israel has withdrawn. Across the Middle East, bitter enemies are witnessing the limits of force and deterrence. Israel’s deepening invasion of Lebanon and repeated strikes on Hezbollah have failed to halt the rockets and missiles. Missile and drone attacks by Iran and its allies have only deepened Israel’s resolve. Israel is vowing to strike Iran hard after its latest missile barrage, raising the likelihood of a broader, regionwide war. Without diplomatic solutions, the fighting is likely to persist. Israel and Gaza will never be the same Israel is still deeply traumatized as people try to come to terms with the worst day in its history. The Oct. 7 killings and kidnappings had an outsized impact on a tiny country founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Israelis' sense of security was shattered, and their faith in the military was tested like never before. Photos of Israeli hostages are everywhere, and mass demonstrations are held each week calling on the government to reach a deal to bring them home. The prospect of ongoing war looms over families and workplaces as reserve soldiers brace for repeated tours of duty. The trauma is far more acute in Gaza – where an estimated 90% of the population remains displaced, many of them living in squalid tent camps. The scenes have drawn comparisons to what the Palestinian call the Nakba, or catastrophe – the mass displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the war surrounding Israel’s creation in 1948. The Palestinians now find themselves looking at a tragedy of even greater scale. It remains unclear when displaced Palestinians in Gaza will be able to return home and whether there will be anything to return to. The territory has suffered immense destruction and is littered with unexploded bombs. Children are missing a second consecutive school year, virtually every family has lost a relative in the fighting and basic needs like food and health care are lacking. After a hellish year, the Palestinians of Gaza have no clear path forward, and it could take generations to recover. Old formulas for pursuing Mideast peace no longer work The international community’s response to this bloodiest of wars has been tepid and ineffective. Repeated cease-fire calls have been ignored, and a U.S.-led plan to reinstate the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza has been rejected by Israel. It remains unclear who will run the territory in the future or who will pay for a cleanup and reconstruction effort that could take decades. One thing that seems clear is that old formulas will no longer work. The international community’s preferred peace formula – the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel – seems hopelessly unrealistic. Israel’s hard-line government opposes Palestinian statehood, says its troops will remain in Gaza for years to come and has further cemented its undeclared annexation of the West Bank. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority has been pushed to the brink of irrelevance. For decades, the United States has acted as the key mediator and power broker in the region – calling for a two-state solution but showing little political will to promote that vision. Instead, it has often turned to conflict management, preventing any side from doing anything too extreme to destabilize the region. This approach went up in smoke on Oct. 7. Since then, the U.S. has responded with a muddled message of criticizing Israel’s wartime tactics as too harsh while arming the Israeli military and protecting Israel against diplomatic criticism. The result: The Biden administration has managed to antagonize both Israel and the Arab world while cease-fire efforts repeatedly sputter. This approach has also alienated the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, complicating Kamala Harris’ presidential aspirations. The warring sides appear to have given up on the Biden administration and are waiting for the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election before deciding their next moves. Whoever wins the race will almost certainly have to find a new formula and recalibrate decades of American policy if they want to end the war. ___ Follow AP's coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-mideast-violence-is-spiraling-a-year-since-the-gaza-war-began/	2024-10-06T21:26:44-07:00	
Highland Park remembers Hamas attacks on 1-year anniversary	HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. (WGN) — On the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, events were held across Chicagoland in remembrance of a dark day that kicked off an extended period of unrest in the Middle East, including one in Highland Park. On this day 365 days ago, Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people and took at least another 250 hostage. It's believed around 100 are still being held captive, but it's estimated a third of them have likely been killed. On Sunday, many gathered in Highland Park for a memorial service in Port Clinton Square. Organized by Shamash — a group of North Shore residents who've organized vigils and marches over the past 12 months calling for the release of hostages — said they planned to unveil a temporary memorial in the area nearby. More from Bronagh: Chicago closes two migrant shelters, reducing available beds to 2,600 This followed a Pro-Palestinian march just 24 hours earlier in downtown Chicago, where thousands gathered in the Gold Coast neighborhood to demand an end to the violence and US aid to Israel. The Pro-Palestinian march in Chicago was mirrored by several other major demonstrations around the world, which included a demonstration in London that reportedly drew more than 40,000 people.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/highland-park-remembers-hamas-attacks-on-1-year-anniversary/	2024-10-06T16:01:56-07:00	
Middle East latest: A Hamas official is killed in an Israeli stri...	An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed Hamas official Saeed Atallah Ali and his family, the militant group said Saturday. The early morning strike came a day after another Israeli airstrike cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, leaving two huge craters on either side of the road. Israel began a ground incursion Tuesday into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. As the Israel-Hamas war reaches the one-year mark, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. ___ Here is the latest: Israel conducts more ground raids in southern Lebanon TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said on Saturday its special forces were carrying out ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon, destroying missiles, launchpads, watchtowers and weapons storage facilities. The military said troops also dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border. Some 1,400 Lebanese, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September aiming to cripple Hezbollah and push it away from the countries’ shared border. On Tuesday, Israel launched what it calls a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon. Nine Israeli troops have been killed in close fighting in the area in the past few days, which is saturated with arms and explosives, the military said. Israeli strikes in Lebanon have hit civilian areas and infrastructure including hospitals and paramedics. Israeli strikes hammer Beirut suburbs BEIRUT — Beirut’s southern suburbs was hit by 12 Israeli airstrikes early Saturday, including one that badly damaged a large hall Hezbollah has used to hold ceremonies, Lebanon’s state news agency said. Later in the day, more strikes hit the area, from which tens of thousands of people have fled over the past two weeks. Israeli airstrikes also hit areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, according to state media. At least six people were killed, according to NNA. Israeli strikes in Gaza kill 9, including 2 children CAIRO — Palestinian medical officials say Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza early Saturday have killed at least nine people, including two children. One strike hit a group of people in the northern town of Beit Hanoun, killing at least five people, including two children, according to the Health Ministry’s Ambulance and Emergency service. Another strike hit a house in the northern part of Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four people, the Awda hospital said. The strike also left a number of wounded people, it said. The Israeli military did not have any immediate comment on the strikes, but has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas. Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the almost year-long war, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. Israel orders more evacuations in central Gaza CAIRO — The Israeli military on Saturday warned residents in parts of central Gaza to evacuate, saying its forces will soon operate there in response to Palestinian militants. The warnings cover areas along a strategic corridor in central Gaza, which was at the heart of obstacles to a ceasefire deal earlier this summer. The military warned Palestinians in areas of Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps, located along the Netzarim corridor, to evacuate to an along Gaza's shore called Muwasi, which the military has designated a humanitarian zone. It’s unclear how many Palestinians are currently living in the areas affected by the order, parts of which were evacuated previously. Less than an hour after the evacuation order, Palestinians reported Israel’s artillery shelling and smoke bombing in the northern areas of Nuseirat camp. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to heavily destroyed areas of Gaza where they fought earlier battles against Hamas and other militants since the start of the war one year ago. The vast majority of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people has been displaced in the war, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps. Others have remained in their homes despite being ordered to leave, saying nowhere in the isolated coastal territory feels safe. An Israeli strike on a refugee camp kills a Hamas official BEIRUT — An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed a Hamas official and his family, the militant group said Saturday. Hamas said in a statement that the early Saturday strike on the Beddawi refugee camp struck the home of Saeed Atallah Ali, an official with Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades. Ali’s wife, Shaymaa Azzam, and their two daughters, Zeinab and Fatima — whom the statement described as children — were also killed in the attack. Beddawi camp is near the northern city of Tripoli. It was the first such strike on the camp in the recent conflict. Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023.
