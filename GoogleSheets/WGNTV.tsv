Pro-Ukraine lawmakers make last-ditch effort to safeguard US supp...	Pro-Ukraine lawmakers in both parties are working to get key provisions surrounding U.S. support for Kyiv passed into law by January, an effort to safeguard assistance that is under threat in a transition to a Trump administration and full GOP control of Congress. If passed into law, the Stand With Ukraine Act would compel the president to request ongoing military and economic support for Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia. The bill's goal is to help overcome increasing partisanship around the passage of supplemental aid packages. The legislation is bipartisan and bicameral, sponsored in the House by Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) and Mike Quigley (D-Ill.). It’s sponsored by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in the Senate. Some lawmakers are working to transform the bill's provisions to amendments for the National Defense Authorization Act, a House aide told The Hill. The NDAA is considered must-pass, end-of-year legislation that authorizes appropriations for the Pentagon and other defense-related activities. It’s not yet clear if lawmakers would seek to put most of the Stand with Ukraine Act provisions into one amendment or file a few separate amendments. Other supporters of the bill said it should be brought up for a standalone floor vote. 'Just have [Senate Majority Leader Chuck] Schumer (D-N.Y.) bring it up and let's vote,' Graham told The Hill. Either way, time is running out to secure passage of the bill before President-elect Trump — who is openly critical of how much aid the U.S. has provided to Ukraine — comes into office. The House and Senate have three more working weeks in December. Trump has pledged to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, saying he’ll bring together Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to make a peace deal. While support for Ukraine in the Senate remains fairly robust, Trump’s skepticism is shared by many Republicans in the House. It’s not clear if House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) would support putting stand-alone legislation on the floor, given that approximately half of the conference voted against a $60 billion aid package for Ukraine that passed in April. Also, passage of the bill could be viewed as constraining Trump’s future moves on Ukraine and Russia. 'I don’t expect we’ll see anything before the end of the year,' said Quigley. Wilson also said it’s better to wait for Trump’s return before moving on the legislation, but added he will push hard for the bill to be considered in the next Congress. 'It's not that the bill is not good, it is just that, there is a deferral when you have a new Congress elected, a new president, elected a new majority in the U.S. Senate,' he said. 'I think it's more crucial and more obvious than ever that war-criminal Putin is not to be trusted.' But Republican attitudes are trending away from Ukraine, and that’s unlikely to change in the next Congress. In April, 112 Republicans voted against the Ukraine supplemental aid package — more than half the conference. On Wednesday, 37 Republican senators voted in favor of a joint resolution of disapproval, sponsored by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky), that aimed to force Ukraine to pay back loans provided by the U.S. Blumenthal said passage of the bill could help put Ukraine in a better negotiating position with Russia, demonstrating bipartisan backing from the U.S. Congress. 'If there are negotiations, as President-elect Trump has said there should be, then Ukraine’s position at the bargaining table should be one of strength as a result of gains on the battlefield and also support in Congress, so I think that kind of measure from Congress could be very important,' he said. 'I’ll take any course,' he said of his preference for how it gets passed. The bill itself doesn’t authorize new funding for Ukraine. But it directs the president to submit budget requests to Congress on what amount is needed to execute the provisions of the bill. Some of the topline provisions of the Stand with Ukraine Act include prioritizing sending air defense, artillery and long-range missiles, armored vehicles, among other fighting systems. The text of the bill also commits the U.S. to help in modernizing Ukraine’s security capabilities, strengthening joint military relationships, prioritizing excess U.S. defense article transfers to Ukraine and fast-tracking foreign military financing sales to Ukraine. The bill’s drafting is an attempt by Congress to codify the 10-year bilateral security agreement that President Biden signed with Zelensky in June — safeguarding the agreement from any effort by a potential Trump administration to retreat from the commitments. Other provisions include treating Ukraine as a major non-NATO ally for the purpose of transferring defense assistance; reauthorizing the Lend-Lease for Ukraine, which would allow the transfer of U.S. weapons to Ukraine and allow payback at a later date; and supporting Ukraine in its reconstruction and recovery efforts. U.S. support for Ukraine is seen by its backers as indispensable in the country’s efforts to push back against Russia’s nearly three-year invasion. Zelensky has warned against a disruption of the US-Europe alliance that has held firm under Biden. 'This period, this moment depends, I think, on our unity in Ukraine,' Zelensky said in an interview Wednesday with Fox News. 'And I think that what is very dangerous if we will lose unity in Europe and what is most important, unity between Ukraine and the United States.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/pro-ukraine-lawmakers-make-last-ditch-effort-to-safeguard-us-support/	2024-11-21T14:02:58-08:00	
Top war-crimes court issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu, ex-def...	THE HAGUE (AP) — The world’s top war-crimes court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the 13-month war in Gaza. The warrants said there was reason to believe Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have used 'starvation as a method of warfare' by restricting humanitarian aid and have intentionally targeted civilians in Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza — charges Israeli officials deny. The action by the International Criminal Court came as the death toll from Israel’s campaign in Gaza passed 44,000 people, according to local health authorities, who say more than half of those killed were women and children. Their count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. Experts say hunger has become widespread across Gaza and may have reached famine levels in the north of the territory, which is under siege by Israeli troops. Netanyahu condemned the warrant against him, saying Israel 'rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions' by the court. In a statement released by his office, he said: 'There is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza.' Gallant, in a statement, said the decision 'sets a dangerous precedent against the right to self-defense and moral warfare and encourages murderous terrorism.' The decision turns Netanyahu and the others into internationally wanted suspects and could further isolate them, putting them at risk of arrest when they travel abroad. Its practical implications could be limited since Israel and its major ally, the United States, are not members of the court. Still, the warrant marked the first time that a sitting leader of a major Western ally has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by a global court of justice. It put Israel's allies, including some of its closest European friends, in an awkward position. Several leaders, including France, welcomed the court's decision and signaled they might arrest Netanyahu if he visited. The move 'represents the most dramatic step yet in the court’s involvement in the conflict between Israel and Hamas,' said Anthony Dworkin, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Israeli leaders, politicians and officials across the spectrum denounced the warrants and the ICC. The new defense minister, Israel Katz, who replaced Gallant earlier this month, said Thursday’s decision is 'a moral disgrace, entirely tainted by antisemitism, and drags the international judicial system to an unprecedented low.' Human rights groups applauded the move. The warrants against both sides 'break through the perception that certain individuals are beyond the reach of the law,' the associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, Balkees Jarrah, said in a statement. The decision came six months after ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan requested the warrants. The court issued a warrant for Mohammed Deif, head of Hamas’ armed wing, over the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that triggered Israel’s offensive in Gaza. It said it found reasonable grounds to believe Deif was involved in murder, rape, torture and the taking of hostages amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity. In the Hamas-led attack, militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and taking some 250 others hostage. Around 100 Israelis remain captive in Gaza, around a third of them believed to be dead. Khan withdrew requests for warrants for two other senior Hamas figures, Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, who have both since been killed. Israel says it also killed Deif in an airstrike, but Hamas has never confirmed his death. The warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were issued by a three-judge panel in a unanimous decision. The panel said there were reasonable grounds to believe that both men bear responsibility for the war crime of starvation and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. The judges said the lack of food, water, electricity, fuel and specific medical supplies created conditions 'calculated to bring about the destruction of part of the civilian population in Gaza,' including the deaths of children due to malnutrition and dehydration. They also found that by preventing hospital supplies and medicine from getting into Gaza, doctors were forced to operate, including performing amputations, without anesthesia or with unsafe means of sedation that led to 'great suffering.' The judges also rejected an Israeli petition challenging the court’s jurisdiction on the grounds that Israel is not a member state in the tribunal. Despite the warrants, none of the suspects is likely to face judges in The Hague anytime soon. Member countries are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. For example, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is wanted on an ICC warrant for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, recently visited Mongolia, a member state in the court but also a Russian ally. He was not arrested. Still, the threat of arrest now complicates any travel abroad by Netanyahu and Gallant — including to close allies of Israel. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the warrants are binding on all 27 members countries of the European Union. France signaled it could arrest Netanyahu if he came to its territory. Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine called it a 'complex legal issue' but said France supports the court’s actions. 'Combating impunity is our priority,' he said. 'Our response will align with these principles.' Hamas in a statement welcomed the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant but made no mention of the one against Deif. Israel’s opposition leaders fiercely criticized the ICC’s move. Benny Gantz, a retired general and political rival to Netanyahu, said it showed 'moral blindness' and was a 'shameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten.' Yair Lapid, another opposition leader, called it a 'prize for terror.' Israel’s campaign has caused heavy destruction across Gaza, decimated parts of the territory and driven almost the entire population of 2.3 million people from their homes, leaving most dependent on aid to survive. Two days after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel, Gallant announced a total seal on Gaza, vowing not to let in food, fuel or other supplies. Under U.S. pressure, Israel began allowing a trickle of humanitarian aid to enter a few weeks later. Israel now says it puts no limit on the amount of supplies into Gaza. Still, the flow of food and other goods is at nearly the lowest levels of the war, and the U.N. and other groups have said Israeli military restrictions are largely to blame, along with widespread lawlessness that has led to theft of aid shipments. The case at the ICC is separate from another legal battle Israel is waging at the top U.N. court, the International Court of Justice, in which South Africa accuses Israel of genocide, an allegation Israeli leaders staunchly deny. Lawyers for Israel argued in court that the war in Gaza was a legitimate defense of its people and that it was Hamas militants who were guilty of genocide. ___ Associated Press journalists Raf Casert in Brussels, Mike Corder in The Hague and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-international-criminal-court-issues-arrest-warrants-for-netanyahu-and-hamas-officials/	2024-11-21T09:59:43-08:00	
Ukraine says Russia launched an intercontinental missile in an at...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine claimed Thursday that Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile overnight at a city. If confirmed, it would be the first time Moscow has used such a weapon in the war. Ukraine did not provide any evidence that an ICBM was used in the attack on the central city of Dnipro, apparently armed with conventional warheads. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a missile used 'matches the speed and altitude' of an ICBM. The Kremlin refused to comment on the strike. The attack comes in a week when tensions have repeatedly soared, as the U.S. eased restrictions on Ukraine's use of American-made longer-range missiles inside Russia and the Kremlin lowered its threshold for launching nuclear weapons. In this photo provided by Ukraine's 24th Mechanised Brigade press service, servicemen of the 24th Mechanised Brigade fire 120mm mortar towards Russian positions near Chasiv Yar town, in Donetsk region, Ukraine, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024. (Oleg Petrasiuk/Ukrainian 24th Mechanised Brigade via AP) The range of an ICBM — which can exceed 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles) — is beyond what is needed to attack Ukraine. But such missiles are designed to carry atomic warheads, and the use of one, even with a conventional payload, would serve as a chilling reminder of Russia’s nuclear capability and a powerful message of potential escalation. In a statement Thursday on the Telegram messaging app, Ukraine's air force said an intercontinental ballistic missile was fired at Dnipro, along with eight other missiles, and that the Ukrainian military shot down six of them. Two people were wounded in the attack, and an industrial facility and a rehabilitation center for people with disabilities were damaged, according to local officials. The air force statement did not specify the exact type of ICBM but said it was launched from Russia’s Astrakhan region, on the Caspian Sea. 'Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is,' Zelenskyy said. 'And how afraid he is.' US to give antipersonnel mines to Ukraine to help slow the Russian advance U.K. officials did not immediately confirm what kind of missile Russia had fired. Defense Secretary John Healey said there were 'unconfirmed reports … of Russia firing a new ballistic missile into Ukraine, which we know they have been preparing for months.' Ballistic missiles can have a range of anywhere from under 500 kilometers (310 miles) to over 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles) in the case of intercontinental ones. 'Ballistic' refers to the shape of their trajectory.

(Oleg Petrasiuk/Ukrainian 24th Mechanised Brigade via AP) Since the Cold War era, Moscow and Washington have given each other advance notice about ICBM launches to prevent the other side from perceiving a test launch as a nuclear attack. They have stuck to exchanging such warnings despite increasing tensions — which ratcheted up again in recent days. Earlier this week, the Biden administration authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied, longer-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia — a move that drew an angry response from Moscow. Days later, Ukraine fired several of the missiles into Russia, according to the Kremlin. The same day, President Vladimir Putin signed a new doctrine that allows for a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. The doctrine is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons. In response, Western countries, including the U.S., said Russia has used irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behavior throughout the war to intimidate Ukraine and other nations. They have also expressed dismay at the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine. Also, Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that its air defense systems shot down two British-made Storm Shadow missiles, six HIMARS rockets, and 67 drones. The statement didn’t say when or where the Storm Shadows were shot down or what they were targeting. Russia earlier reported downing some of the missiles over the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ukraine-says-russia-launched-an-intercontinental-missile-in-an-attack-for-the-first-time-in-the-war/	2024-11-21T05:27:09-08:00	
Death toll in Gaza from Israel-Hamas war passes 44,000, Palestini...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 13-month-old war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000, local health officials said Thursday. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The Health Ministry said 44,056 people have been killed and 104,268 wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. The Israeli offensive has caused heavy destruction across wide areas of the coastal territory, leading many to wonder when or how it will ever be rebuilt. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are living in squalid tent camps with little food, water or basic services. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas, where they have built tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. Palestinian officials and rights groups accuse Israeli forces of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the United Nations’ top court is considering allegations of genocide brought by South Africa. The Israeli government adamantly denies the allegations, accusing critics of being biased against it. In recent weeks, the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza has plummeted, prompting the United States to threaten to reduce its military support for Israel before backing down, citing limited progress. Experts have warned that isolated, war-ravaged northern Gaza could already be experiencing famine. The United States, Egypt and Qatar spent months trying to broker a cease-fire agreement in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war. Those talks ground to a halt over the summer, with Israel and Hamas each accusing the other of making unacceptable demands. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how. His previous administration gave unprecedented support to Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-line policies toward the Palestinians. ___ Khaled reported from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-death-toll-in-gaza-from-israel-hamas-war-passes-44000-palestinian-officials-say/	2024-11-21T05:01:38-08:00	
US vetoes UN resolution demanding a cease-fire in Gaza because th...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States on Wednesday vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire in the war in Gaza because it was not linked to an immediate release of hostages taken captive by Hamas militants in Israel in October 2023. The council voted overwhelmingly in favor of the resolution — 14 of its 15 members voted 'yes' including U.S. allies Britain and France — but it was doomed by the veto. U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood said the United States worked for weeks to avoid a veto of the resolution sponsored by the council’s 10 elected members, and expressed regret that compromise language was not accepted. 'We made clear throughout negotiations we could not support an unconditional cease-fire that failed to release the hostages,' he said. 'Hamas would have seen it as a vindication of its cynical strategy to hope and pray the international community forgets about the fate of more than 100 hostages from more than 20 member states who have been held for 410 days.' The resolution that was put to a vote 'demands an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire to be respected by all parties, and further reiterates its demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.' The emotional response to the veto by the Palestinian deputy U.N. ambassador, Majed Bamya, reflected the widespread anger and disappointment at the failure of the U.N.’s most powerful body to demand an end to the more than 13-month war, which has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, and left most of the territory in ruins. The absence of a cease-fire is allowing a 'full-fledged Israeli assault against the Palestinian people and the Palestinian land' to continue, Bamya told the council. 'A cease-fire will allow to save lives — all lives. This was true a year ago. This is even more true today.' Stressing the tens of thousands of Palestinian deaths, Bamya asked, 'Do they have the right to kill, and the only right we have is to die?' He told council members: 'You are witnessing the attempt to annihilate a nation, destroy a nation.' Israel’s U.N. ambassador, Danny Danon, countered that the resolution 'was not a path to peace, it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed.' He thanked the United States, Israel's closest ally, 'for exercising its veto, for standing on the side of morality and justice, for refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.' The reason the council was meeting and 'the pain that the people are suffering (is) because of Hamas,' Danon said, stressing that the only future for Gaza is without the Palestinian militant group. In a statement, Hamas strongly condemned the veto, claiming the United States again demonstrated 'its direct involvement in the aggression against our people, acting as an accomplice in the killing of children and women and the complete destruction of civilian life in Gaza.' 'We demand the U.S. to stop this clumsy hostile policy if it truly seeks to end wars and achieve security and stability in the region, as we heard from the upcoming administration,' Hamas added, a reference to President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to end the war in Gaza. The Security Council has adopted several resolutions on Gaza, including for a cease-fire during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and demanding humanitarian access. The United States as well as Russia and China have vetoed several previous resolutions on the war. The council in June adopted its first resolution on a cease-fire plan aimed at ending the war between Israel and Hamas. That U.S.-sponsored resolution welcomed a cease-fire proposal announced by President Joe Biden that the United States said Israel had accepted. It called on Hamas to accept the three-phase plan, but the war goes on. The Palestinian deputy ambassador put the blame on Israel, saying, 'It is pretty clear that Israel had never an intention to accept a cease-fire, and has found every reason not to have a cease-fire.' The 10 elected council members said in a statement read by Guyana’s U.N. ambassador, Carolyn Rodrigues Birkett, after the vote that they all supported the June resolution 'with the expectation that a cease-fire deal would have been agreed and implemented swiftly.' But months later, the 10 elected members decided a new resolution should go further and make an unequivocal demand for an unconditional cease-fire not limited to any time period. Notwithstanding the U.S. veto, the elected members underscored that the war in Gaza must end immediately, hostages must be released immediately, humanitarian aid must be delivered everywhere in Gaza and civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected. 'Our collective efforts to end the hostilities will not stop,' they said. Algeria’s U.N. ambassador, Amar Bendjama, the Arab representative on the council, said the message to Israel after the veto is: 'You may continue your genocide. You may continue your collective punishment of the Palestinian people with complete impunity. In this chamber, you enjoy immunity.' But he vowed that the elected members will return soon with an even stronger resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which is militarily enforceable — and they will not stop until the council takes action. ____ Matthew Lee in Washington and Fatma Khaled in Cairo contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-us-vetoes-un-resolution-demanding-a-cease-fire-in-gaza-because-theres-no-link-to-a-hostage-release/	2024-11-20T11:58:18-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israel insists on right to act against Hezbol...	Israel’s defense minister says his country insists on the right to act militarily against Hezbollah in any agreement to end the fighting in Lebanon. Lebanon’s government is likely to view any such demand as an infringement on its sovereignty, complicating efforts to end more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that erupted into all-out war in September. Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement Wednesday that 'the condition for any political settlement in Lebanon is the preservation of the intelligence capability and the preservation of the (Israeli military’s) right to act and protect the citizens of Israel from Hezbollah.' Lebanese officials mediating between Israel and Hezbollah have called for a return to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between the sides. It calls for Hezbollah militants and Israeli forces to withdraw from a buffer zone in southern Lebanon patrolled by U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who has spent months trying to broker a cease-fire, held a second round of talks on Wednesday with Lebanon’s parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who has been mediating on their behalf. Hochstein told reporters the talks had made 'additional progress,' and that he would be heading to Israel 'to try to bring this to a close, if we can.' He declined to say what the sticking points are. Israeli strikes and combat in Lebanon have killed more than 3,500 people and wounded 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The war has displaced nearly 1.2 million people, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians, including some foreign farmworkers, have been killed by attacks involving rockets, drones and missiles. Hezbollah began firing on Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza. That attack killed some 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and another 250 were abducted. Around 100 hostages remain inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed nearly 44,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. ___ Here’s the Latest: Israeli bill targets families of minors convicted of security offenses JERUSALEM — The Israeli parliament has passed a bill stripping some insurance benefits from families of minors convicted of security offenses. A rights group denounced the legislation as a form of collective punishment of Palestinians. The bill, which passed 29-8 late Monday, bans direct family members of minors convicted of security offenses from receiving a child allowance, study grants, or other welfare benefits under Israel’s National Insurance program while the minor is imprisoned. It was passed to 'cause parents to supervise their children and make sure that they do not engage in terrorist activity,' according to a press release on the website of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Legal group Adalah, which called on Israel’s attorney general to withdraw the law, said the true aim of the legislation was 'to impose punitive measures under the pretext of counterterrorism by denying welfare benefits.' Adalah said that because the legislation only applies to those convicted of security offenses, who are overwhelmingly Palestinian, it 'creates a distinction on the basis of nationality.' It’s the latest in a series of measures passed by the Knesset that have been denounced by rights groups as draconian. A law passed earlier this month would allow Israel to deport family members of Palestinian attackers to Gaza or other locations. In late October, the Knesset passed two laws banning UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, from operating on Israeli soil. Lebanese army says one of its soldiers was killed by an Israeli airstrike BEIRUT — A Lebanese army soldier was killed Wednesday by an Israeli airstrike that hit his vehicle on the road linking Burj al-Muluk and Qalaa in southern Lebanon, the army said in a statement. The Israeli military said it was looking into reports. A day earlier, three soldiers were killed by an airstrike that targeted an army post in the town of Sarafand, near the coastal city of Saida. Wissam Khalifa, a resident of Sarafand who lives next to the army post and was injured in the strike, said he was shocked that it was targeted. 'It’s a safe residential neighborhood. There is nothing here at all' that would present a target, he said. 'Regarding the martyred soldiers, I don’t even know if there was a gun in the center. Why did this strike happen? We have no idea.' The Lebanese army has not been an active participant in the fighting between Israeli forces and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah over the past 13 months, but more than 40 soldiers have been killed in the conflict. Altogether, more than 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon since Oct. 8, 2023, the vast majority of them in the past two months. Wounded Al Jazeera reporter to be evacuated to Jordan for treatment AMMAN, Jordan: Israel has allowed an Al Jazeera journalist wounded in an airstrike in Gaza last month to be evacuated to Jordan for medical treatment. Jordan’s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Ali al-Attar had been transferred to the kingdom with his sister in coordination with the World Health Organization. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Al-Attar was wounded by shrapnel when Israeli forces struck makeshift points used by Hamas-run police outside a hospital in central Gaza early on Oct. 7. There were no police present at the time. Israel banned Al-Jazeera earlier this year, accusing it of serving as a mouthpiece of Hamas. It has also accused six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being current or former fighters for Hamas and another armed group. Al Jazeera has denied the allegations and accused Israel of trying to silence critical coverage. The Qatar-based network has reported round-the-clock from Gaza since the start of the war, with its field correspondents focusing on the killing of civilians in Israeli strikes. Several Al Jazeera reporters have themselves been killed or wounded. Al Jazeera has also regularly broadcast videos released by militant groups in their entirety, including some that show Israeli hostages speaking under duress.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israel-insists-on-right-to-act-against-hezbollah-in-any-deal-to-end-fighting/	2024-11-20T05:26:29-08:00	
US support for Ukraine and Israel is eating into weapons stockpil...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East are eating away at critical U.S. weapons stockpiles and could hamper the military's ability to respond to China should a conflict arise in the Indo-Pacific, the top U.S. commander for that region said Tuesday. Head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Adm. Samuel Paparo cautioned Tuesday that the U.S. providing or selling billions of dollars worth of air defenses to both Ukraine and Israel is now impeding his ability to respond in the Indo-Pacific, such as if China invades Taiwan. 'Up to this year, where most of the employment of weapons were really artillery pieces and short-range weapons, I had said, ‘not at all,'' when asked if the conflicts were hampering U.S. ability to respond to threats in the Indo-Pacific, Paparo said. 'It’s now eating into stocks, and to say otherwise would be dishonest,' he told an audience at the Brookings Institution in Washington. China has ramped up its military pressure against Taiwan, including a massive military exercise that involved 125 warplanes in October, and has said annexing Taiwan is a historical inevitability. China’s military has increased its encircling of Taiwan’s skies and waters in the past few years, holding joint drills with its warships and fighter jets on a near-daily basis near the democratically run island. The U.S., like most countries, does not recognize Taiwan as a country but is the island’s main partner and is bound by U.S. laws to provide it with the means to defend itself. Ukraine just passed its 1,000th day since Russia invaded, and in that timeframe the U.S. has provided more than $60.4 billion in military assistance, including three Patriot air defense systems and missiles, more than 40 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems and ammunition, and the coveted longer-range Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, which Ukraine deployed in Russia for the first time on Tuesday. In October, after Iran launched hundreds of ballistic missiles into Israel, the U.S. deployed one of its few Terminal High Altitude Area Defense batteries to Israel and about 100 troops to help operate it. The U.S. also has regularly shipped air defense munitions as Israel presses its offensives against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The conflicts have killed tens of thousands of civilians. The outgoing Biden administration has committed to spending the remaining $7.1 billion in presidential drawdown authority — meaning weapons pulled from U.S. stockpiles — to send weapons to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. It will announce another package this week, according to U.S. officials. However, the ability to send the weapons will be limited by what is on the shelves, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Tuesday. Paparo told the think tank audience that the push to get weapons to Ukraine and Israel has left the U.S. with too few munitions in reserves. 'We should replenish those stocks and then some,' Paparo said. 'I was already dissatisfied with the magazine depth. I’m a little more dissatisfied with the magazine depth,' he said, referring to the numbers of munitions in reserve.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-support-for-ukraine-and-israel-is-eating-into-weapons-stockpiles-indo-pacific-commander-says/	2024-11-19T14:57:27-08:00	
US-Israel panel to look into civilian harm in Gaza is set for fir...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration says a U.S.-Israel panel to look into reports of civilian harm from the war in Gaza will meet for the first time in early December, missing by more than a month a U.S. call for the channel to be set up by the end of October. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday that the upcoming meeting had been agreed to after much discussion between U.S. and Israeli officials on specific incidents and reports of civilian casualties involving American-made or -supplied weapons. 'The purpose of this channel is to inform the ongoing work that the State Department has to make assessments about the use of U.S.-provided weapons,' Miller told reporters. 'It’s to gather information about incidents that have been raised that are cause of concern or cause of questions.' He said the information gathered through that channel will inform U.S. policy decisions about any response to potential violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict that has been raging since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which led to its retaliatory offensives in Gaza. Experts say famine may already have set in in northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging a weekslong offensive that has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes. In October, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent a letter to top Israeli officials warning them that the Biden administration might limit the provision of some U.S. weapons systems to Israel, a close ally, if action to improve humanitarian conditions was not taken within 30 days. That deadline expired last week with no decisions being made on military aid and officials saying that Israel had taken some positive steps but was still not meeting the criteria for improvements laid out in the letter. Aid groups say the situation in Gaza has actually deteriorated instead of improved and urged the U.S. to respond accordingly. The theft in Gaza over the weekend of nearly 100 trucks loaded with food and other much-needed humanitarian aid sent prices soaring and caused shortages in central Gaza, where most of the population of 2.3 million people have fled and where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. Miller said reports of such incidents demonstrated a breakdown in law and order in Gaza and underscored the need to end the fighting and restore functioning governance to the territory. 'You are not going to fully, finally solve this problem without an end to the war and the establishment of a new governance and security authority inside Gaza, because ultimately that is the problem,' he said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-us-israel-panel-to-look-into-civilian-harm-in-gaza-is-set-for-first-meeting-next-month/	2024-11-19T13:54:04-08:00	
Middle East latest: US envoy holds talks in Lebanon about an Isra...	A U.S. envoy held talks in Beirut on Tuesday with Lebanese officials about a possible cease-fire in the Israel-Hezbollah war. Amos Hochstein, a senior advisor to United States President Joe Biden, arrived in the Lebanese capital a day after the militant Hezbollah group reportedly gave a positive response to a U.S. draft proposal to end the war, which has been ongoing for more than 13 months. The U.S. has been working on a proposal to end hostilities that would remove Israeli ground forces from Lebanon and push Hezbollah forces away from the Israeli border. More Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers would be sent to the buffer zone in southern Lebanon as part of the deal. Hochstein’s main meeting in beirut was with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who is mediating for the militants. Hours earlier, an Israeli strike in central Beirut killed five people and wounded others. It was the third Israeli strike in the heart of Beirut in two days. Since late September, Israel has dramatically escalated its bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to severely weaken Hezbollah and end its rocket barrages into Israel. Hezbollah began firing rockets, and drawing Israeli retaliation, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel ignited the war in Gaza. Both groups are supported by Iran. The fighting has left more than 3,500 dead in Lebanon and almost 15,000 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It also has displaced nearly 1.2 million, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians, including some foreign laborers who work in agriculture, have been killed by attacks involving rockets, drones and missiles. ___ Here's the Latest: Rockets hit headquarters of Italy's peacekeepers in Lebanon; no one is injured ROME — Italy says eight rockets struck the headquarters of Italy’s U.N. peacekeeping contingent in southern Lebanon. No one was injured. According to the Italian defense ministry, the eight 107-millimenter rockets hit outdoor areas and a warehouse at the base in Shama, where no soldiers were present. Five soldiers were being kept under observation, the statement said. Italy said it was investigating from where the rockets originated, and who was responsible. It was the second time in a week that Italy has complained about rockets or shells hitting its peacekeepers' base. Last week, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani spoke with his Israeli counterpart to demand an investigation after an artillery shell hit the gym on the base. No one was injured in that incident and the shell did not detonate. Also on Tuesday, the Israeli military said another U.N. peacekeeper's position was hit by a Hezbollah rocket, causing damage and 'several injuries.' The army said it had received a report from the peacekeeping mission, known as UNIFIL, that a post in the area of Ramyeh in southern Lebanon was hit. The military said it conducted a review and determined the location was hit by a Hezbollah rocket fired in a barrage aimed at Israel. There was no immediate comment from UNIFIL on the incident. Iraqi prime minister slams Israel's complaint over attacks by Iraqi Iran-backed militias BAGHDAD — Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has dismissed an Israeli complaint to the U.N. Security Council about strikes by Iraq's Iran-backed Shiite militias on Israel as a 'pretext and argument to attack Iraq' and to 'expand the war in the region.' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar had earlier posted on X a letter to the Security Council saying that 'Israel has the inherent right to self-defense ... and to take all necessary measures to protect itself and its citizens against the ongoing acts of hostilities by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq.' An umbrella group of Iraqi militias known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has regularly launched drone strikes on targets in Israel in recent months in support of its Hamas and Hezbollah allies in the ongoing wars in the Middle East. Saar said some of the militias are part of the Popular Mobilization Forces — a coalition of mostly Shiite armed groups that's technically part of the Iraqi army although it operates in practice largely outside state control — and urged the Iraqi government to 'take immediate action to halt and prevent these attacks.' Al-Sudani’s office said in a statement on Tuesday that Iraq has refused to enter into the regional conflict while 'seeking to provide relief to the Palestinian and Lebanese people.' Lebanese official mediating on behalf of Hezbollah says the situation looks positive regarding a US cease-fire proposal BEIRUT — Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is mediating on the group’s behalf, says some unresolved details remain following his meeting with U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein over an American proposal on a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel. Berri, in remarks to the pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat, said that representatives from his side and the American side are still working to address technical issues before progressing to the next stage. This would involve Hochstein traveling to Israel for further discussions, he said. 'We are waiting for what he will bring from there,' Berri said, emphasizing that the overall outlook remains positive. Berri and Hochstein met for nearly two hours on Tuesday to discuss the U.S. proposal. Berri also told that Lebanon holds the American negotiators responsible for guarantees regarding the Israeli position. Berri said that though Hochstein 'coordinated with the Israelis regarding the draft... It would not be the first time that the Israelis have reneged their commitments.' Yemen's Houthis say they targeted a Panama-flagged vessel twice on Monday DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels on Tuesday claimed responsibility for an attack that twice targeted a Panama-flagged bulk carrier traveling through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden the day before. Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree made the claim about the attack on the Anadolu S in a prerecorded statement. Missiles twice splashed down near the ship on Monday, causing no damage or injuries. Tuesday marked the first anniversary of the Houthis’ attacks on shipping in the Middle East waters. The attacks have targeted shipping through a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion in goods pass through it a year over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Israel’s ground offensive in Lebanon. Qatar says Hamas leaders have left Doha but denies closure of the group's office BEIRUT — Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson says Hamas leaders have left Doha but denied reports that Qatar has ordered a permanent closure of the Palestinian militant group’s political office or expulsion of its previously Doha-based leadership. Qatar, which had served as a mediator in indirect cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas for a cease-fire and hostage exchange deal, has suspended its efforts after growing frustration with the lack of progress on a cease-fire deal for Gaza. The Qatari spokesman, Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, told reporters on Tuesday that 'if there is decision to close the office permanently you will hear this news from this platform or in an official statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.' 'The leaders of Hamas that are in the negotiating team are now not in Doha and as you know, they move between the different capitals,' he said. '...The office in Doha was created for the purpose of the mediation process — obviously when there is no mediation process, the office itself doesn’t have any function.' Al-Ansari did not say where the Hamas leaders went nor did he rule out that Doha might return to its mediating role. 'The suspension of negotiation efforts does not in any way mean that there is a Qatari position to withdraw from de-escalation efforts or that there is a change in the position of the State of Qatar on the need to end this war,' he said. Israel's military says it sent 1,000 units of blood to a northern Gaza hospital JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has facilitated the delivery of blood units to a hospital in isolated northern Gaza. Israel has imposed a tight siege on the northernmost part of the territory since launching an offensive there in early October. Aid groups say very little humanitarian assistance has been allowed in and have warned of famine. The military agency in charge of transferring aid to Gaza, COGAT, said it had sent 1,000 units of blood through a northern crossing on Monday. The U.N.’s health cluster said the blood shipment was delivered to Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahiya. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled the northernmost reaches of the strip since the offensive began, and hospitals there have struggled to function. Israeli forces kill three militants in the West Bank JERUSALEM — Israeli forces have killed three militants during a raid Tuesday in the occupied West Bank, the military said. The militant Hamas group later identified the three as its fighters. They were killed in the area of Jenin, in the north of the occupied territory, which has been a flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian violence in recent years, even before the israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The military said the militants shot at them first, drawing return fire that killed a wanted suspect and two others. The military said it found rifles and military equipment at the site. It said it also destroyed two facilities used to manufacture explosives and dismantled explosives it said were buried under the roads. Since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza, Israeli fire has killed at least 784 Palestinians in the West Bank, including 167 children, according to the Palestinian Authority’s Health Ministry. Most appear to have been militants killed during Israeli raids, but the dead also include people killed during violent protests as well as civilian bystanders. There has also been a rise in stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis. Israel seized the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want it as part of their future state. Israel issues veiled warning to Iranian-backed militias in Iraq JERUSALEM — Israel has issued a veiled threat to strike Iraq in response to recent attacks by Iran-backed militant groups based there. In a letter to the United Nations Security Council posted on X, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said his country has the right to 'take all necessary measures to protect itself and its citizens against the ongoing acts of hostilities by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq.' Militants in Iraq have launched several rocket and drone attacks against both Israel and U.S. forces since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza. An Oct. 3 drone attack launched from Iraq on an army base in northern Israel killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded 24, Saar said. Israel is believed to have struck militants in Iraq in 2019, but it has not acknowledged any such strikes since the start of the war in Gaza. Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on Iran-backed militants in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. In his letter, Saar called on the U.N. to take 'immediate action' to address the situation. US envoy says a conclusion to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict is ‘within our grasp’ BEIRUT — A U.S. envoy to the Middle East says he had 'very constructive talks' in Lebanon and that reaching an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war 'is now within our grasp.' 'Specifically today, we have continued to significantly narrow the gaps. The meeting was very constructive and very helpful,' Amos Hochstein, the U.S. envoy to Lebanon and Israel, told reporters Tuesday. He spoke after a two-hour meeting with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is mediating on the group’s behalf. The emerging agreement would apparently restore a U.N. buffer zone patrolled by international peacekeepers and Lebanese troops in southern Lebanon, with Israel withdrawing its ground forces and Hezbollah militants pulling back to the north. Hochstein, who has been shuttling back and forth for several months, said he came back to the region because 'we have a real opportunity to bring this conflict to an end.' 'I’m here in Beirut to facilitate that decision-making, but it’s ultimately the decisions of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict,' he said. 'It is now within our grasp.' Hochstein was scheduled to meet Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and other officials. 'I am committed to do everything I can to work with the government here in Lebanon and in Israel to bring this conflict to a close,' he said. UN peacekeeping force says it's maintaining positions in Lebanon GENEVA — The U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, under pressure from an Israeli military campaign against militant group Hezbollah in its area of operations, says Argentina has asked three of its officers in the contingent to return home, while all other contributing countries are maintaining their commitments. Spokesman Andrea Tenenti of UNIFIL said its 'operational capabilities have not changed' after the move by Argentina, and U.N. forces have not moved from their positions – despite Israeli Defense Forces asking them to move from positions near the 'blue line' along the Lebanon-Israel border about a month ago. 'The posture of our more than 10,000 peacekeepers from nearly 50 countries remain unchanged,' he told a U.N. briefing in Geneva by video conference from Beirut. The UNIFIL forces have not left the 50 positions across their area of operations, aiming to monitor and report on this situation since Israeli forces began their military campaign in Lebanon in September. He said UNIFIL has limited means to monitor the situation amid the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. While Israeli forces have at times moved deeper into Lebanon, it’s not 'permanently,' and the level of destruction in UNIFIL zones was 'huge' and 'shocking.' Separately, UNICEF spokesman James Elder told the U.N. briefing that more than 200 children have been killed in Lebanon in less than the last two months, saying 'their deaths are being met with inertia from those able to stop this violence.' 'It’s become a silent normalization of horror,' Elder said. Tuesday marks 1-year anniversary of Houthi attacks on shipping in Red Sea DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of Yemen’s Houthi rebels beginning their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor. On Nov. 19, 2023, the Houthis seized the car carrier Galaxy Leader in a helicopter-borne attack in the Red Sea. The ship and its 25 crew remain held until today, something the United Nations Security Council noted in a statement calling on the rebels to release the ship and its crew. The Houthis have attacked over 90 commercial vessels in the time since. They sank two vessels in the campaign, which also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-us-envoy-arrives-in-lebanon-to-meet-with-officials-about-possible-cease-fire/	2024-11-19T08:15:30-08:00	
What does Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range U...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia said Ukraine has fired U.S.-made longer-range weapons inside its territory, days after the U.S. said it would allow Kyiv to use those systems to conduct deeper strikes, a long-sought request by Kyiv. It remained unclear if there are limits on Ukraine's use of the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, as there have been on other U.S. missile systems. Their deployment could — at least initially — be limited to curtailing Russia's advance in its Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops seized territory earlier this year. Ukraine fired six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles at Russia’s Bryansk region, Moscow said Tuesday, in what would be Kyiv’s first use of the weapon inside Russia. Ukraine's General Staff did not confirm whether the weapon was used, but said the armed forces struck an ammunition warehouse in the Bryansk region, which neighbors Kursk and was likely feeding Russian forces fighting there. Since the first year of the war, Ukrainian leaders have lobbied Western allies to allow them to use advanced weapons to strike key targets inside Russia — which they hope would erode Moscow’s capabilities before its troops reach the front line and could make it more difficult for the Russian forces to strike Ukrainian territory. It could also serve as a deterrent force in the event of future cease-fire negotiations. The U.S. has long opposed the move, with President Joe Biden determined to avoid any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. The Kremlin warned on Monday that the decision adds 'fuel to the fire.' The decision comes in the waning days of Biden’s presidency, before President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. Trump has said he would bring about a swift end to the war, which many fear could force unpalatable concessions from Kyiv. What are ATACMS? The ballistic missiles, developed by U.S. aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin, have nearly double the striking distance — up to 300 kilometers (190 miles) — of most of the weapons in Ukraine's possession. They carry a larger payload and have more precise targeting for pinpoint attacks on air fields, ammunition stores and strategic infrastructure. The United States has supplied Ukraine with dozens of ATACMS (pronounced attack-ems) and they have been used to destroy military targets in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine such as Crimea — but not on Russian soil. What is Biden allowing Ukraine to do? Biden authorized Ukraine to use the ATACMS to strike deeper inside Russia, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter. The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to send troops to support Kremlin forces, according to one of the people familiar with the development. Pyongyang’s troops are apparently being deployed to help the Russian army drive Ukrainian forces out of Russia’s Kursk border region, where they launched an incursion in August. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly. It was the second time that Washington has expanded Ukraine's authority to use its U.S.-provided weapons systems inside Russian territory. In May, after Russia’s offensive into the Kharkiv region threatened to stretch Ukrainian forces thin, Biden permitted the use of HIMARS systems — with a range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) — to quell that advance. That decision helped Ukrainian soldiers stabilize the fight for a time by forcing Russian forces to pull back military assets. Why does Ukraine need longer-range weapons? Ukraine has been asking its Western allies for longer-range weapons in order to alter the balance of power in a war where Russia is better resourced, and strike with precision air bases, supply depots and communication centers hundreds of kilometers (miles) over the border. It hopes the weapons would help blunt Russia’s air power and weaken the supply lines it needs to launch daily strikes against Ukraine and to sustain its military ground offensive into Ukraine. If used in Kursk, the weapons would likely require Russian forces preparing for counterattacks to push back valuable equipment and manpower and complicate battle plans. In lieu of Western weapons, Ukraine has been regularly striking Russia with domestically produced weapons, with some capable of traveling up to 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), but still lacks sufficient quantities to do serious long-term harm. Will the decision change the course of the war? Ukrainian leaders are being cautious about the announcement — and senior U.S. defense and military leaders have persistently argued that it won't be a gamechanger. They also have noted that Russia has moved many key assets out of range. 'I don’t believe one capability is going to be decisive and I stand by that comment,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said, noting that the Ukrainians have other means to strike long-range targets. Analysts have also suggested the effect could be limited. 'Today, many in the media are talking about the fact that we have received permission to take appropriate actions. But blows are not inflicted with words. Such things are not announced. The rockets will speak for themselves,' said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the announcement. The effect of the decision depends on the rules set for the weapons' use. If strikes are allowed across all of Russia, they could significantly complicate Moscow's ability to respond to battlefield demands. If strikes are limited to the Kursk region, Russia could relocate its command centers and air units to nearby regions, blunting the effect of those logistical challenges. That would also mean many of the valuable targets Ukrainian officials have expressed desire to hit may still be beyond reach. Either way, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Charlie Dietz has noted the ATACMS wouldn’t be the answer to the main threat Ukraine faces from Russian-fired glide bombs, which are being fired from more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) away, beyond the ATACMS' reach. In addition, the overall supply of ATACMS is limited, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference — though some proponents say that even a few strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources. Jennifer Kavanagh, director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, said the U.S. decision would not alter the course of the war. 'To really impose costs on Russia, Ukraine would need large stockpiles of ATACMS, which it doesn’t have and won’t receive because the United States’ own supplies are limited,' she said. 'Moreover, the biggest obstacle Ukraine faces is a lack of trained and ready personnel, a challenge that neither the United States nor its European allies can solve and that all the weapons in the world won’t overcome,' she added. What are the key remaining questions? In addition to it being unclear what, if any, restrictions the U.S. will impose on the weapons’ use, it’s also not known how many the U.S. will give to Ukraine. While the U.S. has provided ATACMS to Ukraine in various military aid packages, the Defense Department will not disclose how many have been sent or exactly how many of those missiles the Pentagon has. Estimates suggest the U.S. has a number that is in the low thousands. Also, the outcome of the recent American election raises questions over how long this policy will be in place. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration’s spending to support Ukraine — and could reverse moves like this one. On the other hand, it’s also not clear whether other allies might step up. The U.S. decision may encourage Britain and France to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles, also known as SCALP missiles, with a range of 250 kilometers (155 miles). ___ Associated Press writers Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv, Ukraine; Aamer Madhani in Manaus, Brazil; and Colleen Long, Zeke Miller, Matthew Lee, Ellen Knickmeyer and Lolita C.

US envoy says a truce in Lebanon is 'within our grasp' as Gaza's ...	BEIRUT (AP) — A United States envoy said an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war is 'within our grasp' after talks in Lebanon on Tuesday. There was no such optimism in the Gaza Strip, where the looting of nearly 100 aid trucks by armed men worsened an already severe food crisis. Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration’s pointman on Israel and Lebanon, arrived as Hezbollah’s allies in the Lebanese government said it had responded positively to the proposal, which would entail both the militants and Israeli ground forces withdrawing from a U.N. buffer zone in southern Lebanon. The buffer zone would be policed by thousands of additional U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops. Israel has called for a stronger enforcement mechanism, potentially including the ability to operate against any Hezbollah threats, something Lebanon is likely to oppose. Hochstein said he held 'very constructive talks' with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is mediating on the group’s behalf. 'Specifically today, we have continued to significantly narrow the gaps,' he told reporters after the two-hour meeting. 'It’s ultimately the decisions of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict. ... It is now within our grasp.' In Gaza, meanwhile, the theft of nearly 100 trucks loaded with food and other humanitarian aid over the weekend sent prices soaring and caused shortages in central Gaza, where most of the population of 2.3 million people have fled and where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. Experts say famine may already have set in in the north, where Israel has been waging a weekslong offensive that has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes. Food prices soar in central Gaza after looting On Monday, a crowd of people waited outside a shuttered bakery in the central city of Deir al-Balah. A woman who had been displaced from Gaza City, identifying herself as Umm Shadi, said the price of flour had climbed to 400 shekels (over $100) a bag, if it can even be found. Nora Muhanna, another woman displaced from Gaza City, said she was leaving empty-handed after waiting five hours for a bag of bread for her children. 'From the beginning, there are no goods, and even if they are available, there is no money,' she said. The United Nations said armed men stole food and other aid from 98 trucks over the weekend, the largest single incident of its kind since the start of the war. It did not say who was behind the theft. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the convoy of 109 trucks was instructed by the Israeli military to take an 'alternative, unfamiliar route' after the aid was brought through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and that the trucks were robbed near the crossing itself. Israel has long accused criminal gangs and Hamas of stealing aid, allegations denied by the militant group. Al-Aqsa TV, a media outlet operated by the militants, said Hamas-run security forces in Gaza had launched an operation against looters, killing 20 of them. Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official based abroad, said the looters were young men from Bedouin tribes in the area, emphasizing that they do not necessarily represent the tribes. He said they operate east of Rafah near Israeli military positions. The Hamas-run government had a police force of tens of thousands that maintained a high degree of public security before the war, but they have vanished from the streets in many areas after being targeted by Israeli strikes. Hamas says it has taken measures to prevent both looting and price-gouging in local markets. But the biggest problem is not theft – it’s the low amount of aid Israel allows into Gaza, said Tamara Alrifai, communications director for UNRWA, the U.N. agency with the biggest role in the aid operation. 'Take aid into a war zone a few trucks at a time, what do we expect a displaced, hungry and traumatized population to do?' she said of the theft. The flow of aid is at nearly the lowest level of the entire 13-month war. So far this month, Israel says it let into Gaza an average of 88 trucks a day – less than half the highest rate of the war, in April, which aid groups say was still too low. From the aid that does enter, UNRWA says only about half actually reaches Palestinians because Israeli military restrictions and fears of theft often prevent the agency from collecting truck cargos at the border. Israel says it puts no restrictions on the quantity of aid entering Gaza and that it is working to increase the amount. This month, it opened a new crossing into central Gaza. So far it has reported a few dozen trucks entering through it. Wars rage on in Biden administration’s final months Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their toll. The war has left much of the territory in ruins and forced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million to flee, often multiple times. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after the Hamas attack in what it said was solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes, and all-out war erupted in September. Israeli bombardment has killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and wounded almost 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It also displaced nearly 1.2 million, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians have been killed by rockets, drones and missiles. The Biden administration has spent several months trying to broker cease-fires on both fronts. It appears to have made some progress in Lebanon, while talks over a cease-fire and the release of hostages held in Gaza stalled over the summer. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how he would do it. He was a staunch supporter of Israel and its hawkish government during his first term. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip and Khaled from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-us-envoy-pushes-for-cease-fire-in-lebanon-as-food-crisis-worsens-after-looting-in-gaza/	2024-11-19T06:38:18-08:00	
Russia says Ukraine fired 6 US-made ATACMS at the Bryansk region,...	Ukraine fired six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles at Russia’s Bryansk region, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday, days after U.S. President Joe Biden eased restrictions on Ukrainian use of American-made weapons in the war that has reached its 1,000-day milestone. Ukraine claimed it hit a military weapons depot in Bryansk in the middle of the night, though it didn't specify what weapons it used. The Ukrainian General Staff said that multiple explosions and detonation were heard in the targeted area. In a statement carried by Russian news agencies, the Russian Defense Ministry said the military shot down five Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, and damaged one more. The fragments fell on the territory of an unspecified military facility, the ministry said. The falling debris sparked a fire, but didn’t inflict any damage or casualties, it said. Neither side's claims could be independently verified. The announcement came after Biden authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons after Russia deployed thousands of North Korean troops in the conflict. Earlier on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials reported a third Russian strike in three days on a civilian residential area in Ukraine killed at least 12 people, including a child. The strike by a Shahed drone in the northern Sumy region late Monday hit a dormitory of an educational facility in the town of Hlukhiv and wounded 11 others, including two children, authorities said, adding that more people could be trapped under the rubble. Ukrainian civilians have repeatedly been clobbered by Russian drones and missiles during the war, while on the battlefield it is under severe Russian pressure at places on the about 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line where its army is stretched thin against a bigger adversary. On Sunday, a Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions struck a residential area of Sumy in northern Ukraine, killing 11 people and wounding 84 others. On Monday, a Russian missile barrage sparked apartment fires in the southern port of Odesa, killing at least 10 people and wounding 43. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the series of aerial strikes proved that Russian President Vladimir Putin wasn't interested in ending the war. 'Each new attack by Russia only confirms Putin’s true intentions. He wants the war to continue. Talks about peace are not interesting to him. We must force Russia to a just peace by force,' Zelenskyy said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-a-3rd-russian-strike-in-3-days-kills-more-ukrainian-civilians-as-the-war-hits-a-milestone/	2024-11-19T04:45:39-08:00	
Middle East latest: Children and parents among 8 killed in Israel...	Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed eight people, including two children aged 7 and 9 and their parents, Palestinian officials said Monday. A third child, 10 years old, was wounded in an overnight strike on a tent where displaced people were sheltering in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to the Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government. An Associated Press reporter saw the children's bodies at nearby Nasser Hospital. A separate strike early Monday killed four people, including a woman and a child, in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The Israeli military blames civilian deaths on Hamas, accusing militants of hiding among civilians and fighting from residential areas. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. They do not distinguish between militants and civilians but say most of those killed are women and children. The fighting has left some 76 people dead in Israel, including 31 soldiers. ___ Here's the Latest: Death toll rises to 7 in Israeli strike in central Beirut BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry said the toll from Sunday’s Israeli strike in central Beirut rose to seven killed, including a woman, and 26 wounded. The Health Ministry also said Monday that three people were killed and 29 wounded in a separate strike Sunday in the Mar Elias area of central Beirut. The Hezbollah militant group said five members were killed including its spokesperson Mohammad Afif in the strike in the Ras Al Nabaa area. 9 members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad killed in Israeli strikes are buried in Damascus DAMASCUS — Nine members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group who were killed in Israeli airstrikes in Damascus were buried Monday in the Syrian capital. Women in the crowd wept as the dead were transported to the Yarmouk cemetery in the Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus. Some held images of slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. Israeli strikes on Thursday targeted two buildings with the offices of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, killing 15 people, including Syrian civilians, and wounding 20 others, officials said. The funeral on Monday was held for the nine Islamic Jihad members, including two high-ranking officials — commander Abdel Aziz Saeed Minawi and Rasmi Youssef Abu Issa, who was in charge of the group's Arab affairs. The wife of Ali Kabalan, a 44-year-old fighter who was killed Thursday, told The Associated Press that while the loss was unbearable, she and their five children were 'proud' that he died 'a martyr for the cause of Palestine’s liberation.' The Israeli military claimed the strikes dealt significant damage to its group’s leadership. Israel has accused the Islamic Jihad, alongside Hamas, of coordinating the Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel that ignited the ongoing war. Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria targeting members of Lebanon’s Hezbollah and officials from Iranian-backed groups. Head of UNRWA says banning the agency would leave Israel responsible for the needs of Palestinians GENEVA — The head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says Israel would have the 'responsibility' to respond to their needs if it goes through with plans to ban the agency. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, on Monday stepped up appeals to the international community to help convince Israeli authorities not to go through with the ban. Measures passed by the Knesset, if carried out as anticipated in January, would ban UNRWA from operating and cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. 'The clock is ticking,' Lazzarini told reporters in Geneva. Critics say the Knesset moves culminated a long-running campaign against UNRWA, which Israel contends has been infiltrated by Hamas. They say Israel’s real aim is to sideline the issue of Palestinian refugees. Lazzarini all but suggested that the considerable work helping Palestinian refugees would otherwise fall to Israel under international humanitarian law. 'I keep being asked, Is there yes, or not, a Plan B? There is no plan B within the U.N. agency -- within the U.N. family because there is no other agency geared to provide the same activities,' he said. 'UNRWA is the response of the international community to the plight of the Palestinian refugees, through the mandate provided by the GA (United Nations General Assembly) resolution,' Lazzarini added. 'So, if there is no U.N. or international community response, the responsibility will go back to the occupying power, being Israel.' 'And that’s where we have to ask: Where does a plan B sit today?' he said. Israeli troops deliver fuel and medical equipment to hospitals in northern Gaza, military says TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said Monday it had delivered fuel and medical equipment to hospitals in a besieged part of northern Gaza, where troops have launched an intense operation since October. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza said, said they delivered 10,000 liters of fuel and 149 packages of medical equipment to two hospitals, and helped oversee the evacuation of 64 patients and their escorts, along with the U.N., from hard-hit hospitals in the north. The hospitals that serve the area have been largely inaccessible because of the fighting, and a raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital last month left it barely functional. Israel has faced international pressure to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, particularly in the war-ravaged north. Last week, the United States said it would not limit arms transfers to Israel as it had threatened to do in October if aid was not significantly stepped up. In November, COGAT said they facilitated at least two aid deliveries to the far north, after a month in which virtually no supplies reached these areas. But international aid groups warned much more is needed, and famine is imminent in parts of northern Gaza. Funeral held for the Hezbollah main spokesman killed in an Israeli strike BEIRUT — A funeral was held Monday in southern Lebanon for Mohammad Afif, Hezbollah’s head of media relations, a day after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike in central Beirut. Afif’s coffin, draped in Hezbollah’s yellow flag, was carried through the streets of Sidon on the shoulders of mourners. 'Resistance is the response, and the convoys of martyrs create victory,' Afif’s brother, Sadiq al-Naboulsi, said at the funeral. 'Hajj Mohammad Afif was a big figure in the media, and therefore the Israelis and Americans were hurt by his voice. For that reason, they assassinated him. The killing of Hajj Mohammad Afif and all the martyrs and leaders will not turn (us) back at all,' he said. The strike that hit central Beirut for the first time in over a month also killed three other people on Sunday, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Afif had been a prominent spokesperson for Hezbollah, especially during the recent escalation of tensions with Israel. Days before his death, he held a press conference in Beirut’s southern suburbs, where he declared that Hezbollah was prepared for a prolonged war and denied claims that the group had lost its missile capabilities. Lebanon will convey its positive response to a US cease-fire proposal, minister says BEIRUT — A government minister close to Hezbollah says Lebanon will convey its 'positive position' on a United States-backed cease-fire proposal this week. The Biden administration is trying to halt the war between Israel and the militant group after months of sputtering cease-fire efforts. Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who is mediating for the militants, is expected to meet with U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein in the Lebanese capital on Tuesday. Labor Minister Mostafa Bayram, who met with Berri on Monday, said Hezbollah’s function 'is to make sure the (Israeli) aggression fails to achieve its goals, while negotiation is for the state and the government.' A Western diplomat familiar with the talks told The Associated Press there is a sense of 'cautious optimism.' 'Diplomatic efforts are converging towards a cease-fire, but it’s still in the hands and heads of key players to decide if it’s in their interest or not to stop things right now,' said the diplomat, who was not authorized to brief media and so spoke on condition of anonymity. The efforts are aimed at reestablishing a U.N. buffer zone in southern Lebanon established after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Israel is said to be pushing for guarantees it can continue to act militarily against Hezbollah if needed, a demand the Lebanese are unlikely to accept. — By Kareem Chehayeb Turkey denies overflight permission for a plane carrying Israel’s president ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey has denied Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s plane the right to use its airspace, preventing him from traveling to Azerbaijan, the Turkish state-run news agency reported. The Anadolu Agency report late Sunday said Israeli authorities requested permission for the plane to access the Turkish airspace on its way to Baku, Azerbaijan, where Herzog was scheduled to attend the COP29 conference on climate change. The agency based its report on unnamed Turkish officials. It did not say when the permission was denied. A statement from Herzog's office said the decision to cancel the president's trip to Baku was due to 'the situation assessment and for security reasons.' It did not comment on the Turkish report. Turkey has emerged as one of the strongest critics of Israel’s military actions in Gaza and Lebanon. It has suspended trade relations with Israel, accused the country of genocide and voiced support to Hamas. Children and their parents among 8 killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza, officials say KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip have killed eight people, including two children aged 7 and 9 and their parents, Palestinian officials said. A third child, 10 years old, was wounded in the same strike. The Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government, said Monday that the two children were killed in an overnight strike on a tent where displaced people were sheltering in the southern city of Khan Younis. An Associated Press reporter saw the bodies at nearby Nasser Hospital. The two children were beheaded by the blast and their remains were placed in one body bag. A separate strike early Monday killed four people, including a woman and a child, in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.

Moscow warns the US over allowing Ukraine to hit Russian soil wit...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The Kremlin warned Monday that President Joe Biden’s decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles adds 'fuel to the fire' of the war and would escalate international tensions even higher. Biden’s shift in policy added an uncertain, new factor to the conflict on the eve of the 1,000-day milestone since Russia began its full-scale invasion in 2022. It also came as a Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions struck a residential area of Sumy in northern Ukraine, killing 11 people, including two children, and injuring 84 others. Another missile barrage sparked apartment fires in the southern port of Odesa, killing at least 10 people and injuring 43, including a child, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said. Washington is easing limits on what Ukraine can strike with its American-made Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Sunday, after months of ruling out such a move over fears of escalating the conflict and bringing about a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO. The Kremlin was swift in its condemnation. 'It is obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps and they have been talking about this, to continue adding fuel to the fire and provoking further escalation of tensions around this conflict,' spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. The scope of the new firing guidelines isn’t clear. But the change came after the U.S., South Korea and NATO said recently that North Korean troops are in Russia and apparently are being deployed to help Moscow drive Ukrainian troops out of Russia’s Kursk border region. Russia also is slowly pushing Ukraine’s outnumbered army backward in the eastern Donetsk region. It has also conducted a devastating aerial campaign against civilian areas in Ukraine. Peskov referred journalists to a statement made by President Vladimir Putin in September in which he said allowing Ukraine to target Russia would significantly raise the stakes. It would change 'the very nature of the conflict dramatically,' Putin said at the time. 'This will mean that NATO countries — the United States and European countries — are at war with Russia.' Peskov claimed that Western countries supplying longer-range weapons also provide targeting services to Kyiv. 'This fundamentally changes the modality of their involvement in the conflict,' he said. Putin warned in June that Moscow could provide longer-range weapons to others to strike Western targets if NATO allowed Ukraine to use its allies' arms to attack Russian territory. He also reaffirmed Moscow’s readiness to use nuclear weapons if it sees a threat to its sovereignty. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office in about two months, has raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue vital military support to Ukraine. He has also vowed to quickly end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave a muted response to the approval that he and his government have been requesting of Biden for more than a year. 'Today, much is being said in the media about us receiving permission for the relevant actions,' Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address Sunday. 'But strikes are not made with words. Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves,' he said. The new policy's consequences on the battlefield are uncertain. ATACMS, which have a range of about 300 kilometers (190 miles), can reach targets far behind the about 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line in Ukraine, but they have relatively short range compared with other types of ballistic and cruise missiles. The policy change came 'too late to have a major strategic effect,' said Patrick Bury, a senior associate professor in security at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom. 'The ultimate kind of impact it will have is to probably slow down the tempo of the Russian offensives which are now happening,' he said. Ukraine could target enemy troops concentrated in Kursk or logistics hubs or command headquarters, Bury added. The cue for the policy change was the arrival in Russia of North Korean troops, according to Glib Voloskyi, an analyst at the CBA Initiatives Center, a Kyiv-based think tank. 'This is a signal the Biden administration is sending to North Korea and Russia, indicating that the decision to involve North Korean units has crossed a red line,' he told AP. Russian lawmakers and state media bashed the West over what they called an escalatory step, and threatened a harsh response. 'Biden, apparently, decided to end his presidential term and go down in history as ‘Bloody Joe,’' senior lawmaker Leonid Slutsky told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Vladimir Dzhabarov, deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of Russian parliament, called it 'a very big step toward the start of World War III' and an attempt to 'reduce the degree of freedom for Trump.' Russian newspapers offered similar predictions of doom. 'The madmen who are drawing NATO into a direct conflict with our country may soon be in great pain,' Rossiyskaya Gazeta said. Some NATO allies welcomed the move. Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna of Russian neighbor Estonia said easing restrictions on Ukraine was 'a good thing.' 'We have been saying that from the beginning — that no restrictions must be put on the military support,' he said at a meeting of senior European Union diplomats in Brussels. 'And we need to understand that situation is more serious (than) it was even maybe like a couple of months ago.' Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said he’s not 'opening the champagne' yet as it is unclear exactly what restrictions have been lifted and whether Ukraine has enough of the U.S. weapons to make a difference. ___ Lorne Cook in Brussels, Danica Kirka in London and Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-a-russian-ballistic-missile-with-cluster-munitions-kills-11-people-and-injures-84-in-ukraines-north/	2024-11-18T06:36:39-08:00	
A makeshift memorial grows in Ukraine’s capital after 1,000 days ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Before Russia’s invasion, this was an ordinary green lawn in the heart of Ukraine’s capital. Tourists would visit to take photos, and locals would stroll there on weekends. But 1,000 days of war have transformed it into a makeshift memorial, dotted with blue-and-yellow flags — each honoring a soldier who died fighting Russia. Many were volunteers who left their civilian lives behind to answer to defend their country. Their loved ones, left alone with grief, hope their sacrifices won’t be forgotten. They plant small, simple flags, hand-marked with the names and dates they died. Over time, the flags have multiplied, fluttering in the wind as the seasons change and the war drags on. 'I put it so that someone might pass by and see that this person once lived and gave their life for us,' said Svitlana Kirichenko, who traveled from Cherkasy to replace the weathered flag she had planted over a year ago in honor of her son, who died fighting. She carefully placed a new one in its place. 'So we can live peacefully among our own people, and not have Russians dictate how we should live and what to do.' Associated Press archives show that the first flags appeared on the lawn in May of the war’s first year, shortly after Russian forces withdrew from the Kyiv region and the capital was no longer under the threat of occupation. Photos from that time show dozens of flags neatly arranged in rows across the grassy field. As the war continued, the place has transformed. The grass has faded away, replaced by well-worn paths resembling those in a cemetery, winding through thousands of flags. Among them, many portraits have appeared — brought by relative — showing confident, smiling faces in military uniforms. Svitlana Kanevska, cloaked in a black hood against the drizzly autumn rain, bent over a portrait of her boyfriend, Serhii Ivanytskyi, who had died months earlier in eastern Ukraine. The photo — a selfie he had sent her during one of their chats — showed him standing in a sunlit Ukrainian field. Kanevska carefully wiped droplets from the image. Since Serhii joined the army early in the war, their time together had been scarce, mostly confined to messages. He kept his location and activities hidden, and their conversations centered largely on love. Last December, during a brief leave in Kyiv, they passed by this very memorial. 'He said he felt so sorry for the guys,' Kanevska recalled. He was killed in the summer of 2024. 'You feel so much pain that you don’t know where to go or what to do,' she said. That’s what brought her here months ago, to place his flag and photo among the countless others. Kanevska, who works nearby, often visits to mourn. She’s not alone. The place is strewn with fresh and dried flowers, a concentration of grief and an epicenter of Ukrainian history. Independence Square, after all, has long been the heart of Ukraine’s revolutions. For many, it is the only fitting place for their loved ones to be remembered. City authorities have no control over this memorial. It was created by people themselves, driven by a deep need to honor their fallen in the absence of an official government memorial. Soldiers and families come here to sit for long stretches, gazing quietly into the distance. New flags are added almost daily. Nearby, funeral ceremonies take place almost every day, followed by moments of silence. Passersby stop, kneel and observe in quiet reverence. But soon, life in the capital moves on, returning to its usual pace. The memorial keeps growing with each passing day, a reminder of the price Ukraine pays for its freedom. 'If someone thinks of him, it brings him light where he is. He knows he hasn’t been forgotten,' said Andrii Pedychenko, who came to the memorial to put a new flag for his friend who was killed in action about one year ago. 'Each flag is a tragedy. And it reminds us that this is just a small piece because there wouldn’t be enough space here for everyone.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-a-makeshift-memorial-grows-in-ukraines-capital-after-1000-days-of-war/	2024-11-17T21:12:18-08:00	
Biden authorizes Ukraine to use US-supplied long-range missiles f...	MANAUS, Brazil (AP) — President Joe Biden has authorized the use of U.S.-supplied long-range missiles by Ukraine to strike even deeper inside Russia, the latest easing of limitations meant to prevent the conflict from further spiraling, according to one U.S. official and three people familiar with the matter. The decision allowing Ukraine to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, for attacks farther into Russia comes as thousands of North Korean troops have been sent into a region along Ukraine's northern border to help Russia retake ground and as President-elect Donald Trump has said he would bring about a swift end to the war, expressing skepticism over continued support by the United States. The weapons are likely to be used in response to the decision by North Korea to support Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, according to one of the people. The official and the people familiar with the matter were not authorized to discuss the decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Biden becomes first sitting US president to visit the Amazon rainforest Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters have been pressing Biden for months to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles, saying the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids. Some supporters have argued that this and other U.S. constraints could cost Ukraine the war. The debate has become a source of disagreement among Ukraine’s NATO allies. Biden had remained opposed, determined to hold the line against any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with Russia. But North Korea has deployed thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year. The introduction of North Korean troops to the conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict. As many as 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian assessments. U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Trump, who takes office in January, spoke for months as a candidate about wanting Russia’s war in Ukraine to be over, but he mostly ducked questions about whether he wanted U.S. ally Ukraine to win. He also repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid. His election victory has Ukraine’s international backers worrying that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Putin. Deadly E. coli outbreak linked to organic carrots sold in multiple states America is Ukraine’s most valuable ally in the war, providing more than $56.2 billion in security assistance since Russian forces invaded in February 2022. Worried about Russia’s response, however, the Biden administration repeatedly has delayed providing some specific advanced weapons sought by Ukraine, only agreeing under pressure from Ukraine and in consultation with allies, after long denying such a request. That includes initially refusing Zelenskyy’s pleas for advanced tanks, Patriot air defense systems, F-16 fighter jets, among other systems. The White House agreed in May to allow Ukraine to use ATACMS for limited strikes just across the border with Russia.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/biden-authorizes-ukraine-to-use-us-supplied-long-range-missiles-for-deeper-strikes-inside-russia/	2024-11-17T11:41:08-08:00	
Pope Francis calls for investigation to determine if Israel's att...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has called for an investigation to determine if Israel’s attacks in Gaza constitute genocide, according to excerpts released Sunday from an upcoming new book ahead of the pontiff's jubilee year. It's the first time that Francis has openly urged for an investigation of genocide allegations over Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip. In September, he said Israel's attacks in Gaza and Lebanon have been 'immoral' and disproportionate, and that its military has gone beyond the rules of war. The book, by Hernán Reyes Alcaide and based on interviews with the Pope, is entitled 'Hope never disappoints. Pilgrims towards a better world.' It will be released on Tuesday ahead of the pope's 2025 jubilee. Francis’ yearlong jubilee is expected to bring more than 30 million pilgrims to Rome to celebrate the Holy Year. 'According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,' the pope said in excerpts published Sunday by the Italian daily La Stampa. 'We should investigate carefully to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies,' he added. Last year, Francis met separately with relatives of Israeli hostages in Gaza and Palestinians living through the war and set off a firestorm by using words that Vatican diplomats usually avoid: 'terrorism' and, according to the Palestinians, 'genocide.' Francis spoke at the time about the suffering of both Israelis and Palestinians after his meetings, which were arranged before the Israeli-Hamas hostage deal and a temporary halt in fighting was announced. The pontiff, who last week also met with a delegation of Israeli hostages who were released and their families pressing the campaign to bring the remaining captives home had editorial control over the upcoming book. The war started when the militant Hamas group attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250 as hostages and taking them back to Gaza, where dozens still remain. Israel’s subsequent yearlong military campaign has killed more than 43,000 people, according to Gaza health officials, whose count doesn’t distinguish between civilians and fighters, though they say more than half of the dead are women and children. The Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza has triggered several legal cases at international courts in The Hague involving requests for arrest warrants as well as accusations and denials of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. In the new book, Francis also speaks about migration and the problem of integrating migrants in their host countries. 'Faced with this challenge, no country can be left alone and no one can think of addressing the issue in isolation through more restrictive and repressive laws, sometimes approved under the pressure of fear or in search of electoral advantages,' Francis said. 'On the contrary, just as we see that there is a globalization of indifference, we must respond with the globalization of charity and cooperation,' he added. Francis also mentioned the 'still open wound of the war in Ukraine has led thousands of people to abandon their homes, especially during the first months of the conflict.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-pope-francis-calls-for-investigation-to-determine-if-israels-attacks-in-gaza-constitute-genocide/	2024-11-17T02:43:00-08:00	
Middle East latest: Workers search through rubble in eastern Leba...	Rescue teams were searching Friday through rubble for missing people near the city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon where an Israeli strike hit a civil defense center the night before, killing at least 13. All those killed in the strike on the town of Douris near Baalbek were employees and volunteers of the emergency services agency, according to the Lebanese Civil Defense. Some other remains were also recovered and will require DNA testing, it said in a statement. The General Directorate of Civil Defense expressed 'deep regret over this direct attack on its members.' Staffers 'will continue to respond to relief calls and continue with its humanitarian mission, no matter how great the challenges and sacrifices are,' it said. Israel has accused Hezbollah of using ambulances and medical facilities to transport and store weapons. The Israeli military has not commented on the strike on the civil defense center in Baalbek. Israel has been striking deeper inside Lebanon since September as it escalates the war against Hezbollah. After 13 months of war, more than 3,300 people have been killed and more than 14,400 wounded, Lebanon’s Health Ministry says. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Lebanon’s Hezbollah group began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Israel’s blistering 13-month war in Gaza has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The fighting has left some 76 people dead in Israel, including 31 soldiers. ___ Here's the Latest: Iranian official says Tehran backs Lebanese government and its people BEIRUT — A visiting Iranian official said after meeting top Lebanese officials Friday that Tehran 'stands by Lebanon's government and people' and that it backs any decision taken by the Lebanese government and the militant Hezbollah group. Asked if he was trying to disrupt U.S. efforts to end the Israel-Hezbollah war, Ali Larijani, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei, said: 'We are not trying to blow up any effort but we want to solve the problem and whatever the circumstances are we will stand by Lebanon.' He added that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters and allies are responsible for igniting the conflict. He also expressed hope after meeting Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri that difficulties facing Lebanon will be solved. Larijani denied reports that Iran has abandoned Hezbollah, dismissing such claims by saying: 'You take jokes seriously.' He added that Iran 'will back the resistance (Hezbollah) under all circumstances.' Najib Mikati, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister, said he urged Iran Friday to help his government implement a U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the summer 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. The resolution says that no side should have armed presence in southern Lebanon along the border with Israel apart from the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers. Mikati said Lebanon also wants Iran to help the country’s national unity and not take any stance that backs one Lebanese side against another. Israeli military aid says blood supplies have been transported into Gaza to ease humanitarian crisis JERUSALEM — Israeli authorities said blood supplies have been transported into Gaza in the latest move to ease the humanitarian suffering in the Palestinian territory. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, said the blood supplies entered via Kerem Shalom crossing on Thursday and are expected to reach Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis in the coming days. Throughout the 13 month conflict, hospitals in Gaza have been struggling to treat Palestinian casualties without basic medical supplies, including blood and bandages. The announcement from COGAT comes as Israel faces mounting international pressure to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, particularly in the war-ravaged northern areas of Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya where Israel has intensified its military operations against Hamas. COGAT facilitated at least two aid deliveries to the far north during November after a month where virtually no supplies reached these areas. Iranian official in Beirut in talks to end Israel-Hezbollah war BEIRUT — An Iranian official flew to Beirut on Friday to discuss the ongoing Israel-Hezbollah war with top Lebanese officials as Israel’s air force struck areas on the edge of the Lebanese capital. The visit of Ali Larijani, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei, comes amid attempts led by the United States to end the 13-month war that broadened in September into southern and eastern Lebanon as well as Beirut’s southern suburbs. Lebanese media reported that the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon has handed over a draft of a proposed deal to end the Israel-Hezbollah war to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. A Lebanese official confirmed that the U.S. ambassador to Beirut, Lisa Johnson, visited Berri but refused to say whether a draft was handed over. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media about the ongoing talks. The U.S. Embassy refused to either confirm or deny the reports. Larijani flew in Friday from neighboring Syria where he held similar talks a day earlier with President Bashar Assad. Syria’s state news agency said Assad and Larijani discussed the 'ongoing aggression on Palestine and Lebanon and the necessity of stopping it.' Iran is a main backer of Hezbollah and for decades has been funding and arming the Lebanese militant group. Search continues in eastern Lebanon town where an airstrike killed 13 BEIRUT — Rescue teams were searching for missing people through rubble near the city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon where an Israeli strike hit a civil defense center the night before. Thirteen bodies were recovered, all of them employees and volunteers of the emergency services agency, according to the Lebanese Civil Defense. Some other remains that will require DNA testing were also recovered, it said in a statement. The General Directorate of Civil Defense expressed 'deep regret over this direct attack on its members.' Staffers 'will continue to respond to relief calls and continue with its humanitarian mission, no matter how great the challenges and sacrifices are,' it said. Rafik Shehada, head of the union of municipalities in the Baalbek region, described the strike as 'barbaric' and said that rescue teams were still searching for missing people who had been inside the center at the time and were presumed dead. Human Rights Watch in a report issued in late October said that it had documented three incidents that it described as 'apparent war crimes' in which Israeli forces struck medica 'medical personnel, transports, and facilities.' At that time, it said that Israeli strikes had killed at least 163 health and rescue workers across Lebanon and damaged 158 ambulances and 55 hospitals during a year of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Israel has accused Hezbollah of using ambulances and medical facilities to transport and store weapons. The Israeli military has not commented on the strike on the civil defense center near Baalbek. UN Security Council draft resolution demands 'immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire' in Gaza UNITED NATIONS – The U.N. Security Council’s 10 elected members have circulated a draft resolution demanding 'an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire' in Gaza. The draft resolution, which was sent to the council’s five permanent members Thursday, reiterates the council’s demand 'for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages' seized during Hamas’ surprise attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel says about 100 are still being held, though not all are believed to be alive. The council’s 10 elected members – Ecuador, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, Switzerland, Algeria, Guyana, South Korea, Sierra Leone and Slovenia – circulated the draft after they agreed to it. The United States, Israel’s closest ally, holds the key to whether the Security Council adopts the resolution. The four other permanent members – Russia, China, Britain and France -- are expected to support it or abstain. The draft, obtained Thursday by The Associated Press, also demands immediate access for Gaza’s civilian population to humanitarian aid and services essential for their survival. It 'underscores' that the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA 'remains the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza.' Israel’s parliament passed two laws last month banning UNRWA’s operations in the Palestinian territories, which take effect in 90 days. The draft resolution would also express the council’s 'deep alarm over the ongoing catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza including the lack of adequate healthcare services and the state of food insecurity creating a risk of famine notably in the north.' ___ For more Middle East news:	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-workers-search-through-rubble-in-eastern-lebanon-where-israeli-strike-killed-13/	2024-11-15T05:04:51-08:00	
Top Iranian official vows support for Lebanon on Israel-Hezbollah...	BEIRUT (AP) — A top Iranian official pledged his country's unwavering support for Lebanon after talks Friday with Lebanese leaders on the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah, which came as the United States continued actively pushing both sides to agree to a new cease-fire deal. Ali Larijani, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, said that he hoped circumstances would soon improve in Lebanon so that displaced people could return home. 'The main aim of our visit is to loudly say that we will stand by Lebanon’s government and people,' Larijani told reporters after separate meetings with parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati. The U.S. has been trying to broker an end to the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which came as the 13-month Israel-Hamas war broadened in September into southern and eastern Lebanon as well as Beirut’s southern suburbs. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, and Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 ignited the war in Gaza. According to reports in Lebanese media, U.S. Ambassador Lisa Johnson has handed over a draft of a proposed deal to end the Israel-Hezbollah war to Berri, who has been leading the talks representing Hezbollah. A Lebanese official confirmed Friday that Johnson visited Berri, but refused to say whether a draft was handed over. Another Lebanese official confirmed that Beirut has received a copy of a draft proposal that the U.S. sees as suitable to end the Israel-Hezbollah war based on U.N. Security Council resolution 1701 that ended the war in summer of 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah. The official did not give details other than to say Israel was insisting that some guarantees be included. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, because they weren't authorized to speak to the media about the ongoing talks. The U.S. Embassy refused to either confirm or deny the reports. Larijani flew in Friday from neighboring Syria where he held similar talks a day earlier with President Bashar Assad. Syria’s state news agency said that Assad and Larijani discussed the 'ongoing aggression on Palestine and Lebanon and the necessity of stopping it.' In addition to supporting Hamas, Iran is a main backer of Hezbollah and for decades has been funding and arming the Lebanese militant group. Asked if he was visiting to try and thwart U.S. efforts to end the Israel-Hezbollah war, Larijani said, 'We are not trying to blow up any effort, but we want to solve the problem and we will stand by Lebanon, whatever the circumstances.' Mikati, who in recent weeks has become more critical of Iran’s role in Lebanon and has been calling on Tehran not to intervene in the country’s internal affairs, told Larijani that Lebanon wants the ongoing war to end and that work is ongoing to reach a cease-fire, according to comments released by his office. 'Contacts are ongoing in this framework with the aim of reaching an understanding,' Mikati said. He added that Lebanon wants to see implemented the U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war 'in all its details.' That resolution says that there should be no armed presence in southern Lebanon along the border with Israel other than the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers. Larijani's visit to the Lebanese capital was punctuated with a renewed aerial attack by Israel on the southeastern edge of the city. An image captured by an Associated Press photographer showed what appeared to be an 11-story residential building in the Tayouneh area, a few kilometers or miles from central Beirut, about to be hit by a bomb, then bursting into flames. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but the bomb hit a lower level of the building, turning much of it to rubble. The Israeli military had issued a warning before the attack, saying it was a facility that belonged to Hezbollah. Funerals were held Friday for 11 people killed Thursday in a series of Israeli airstrikes in and around the central Gaza Strip city of Deir al-Balah. The wounded and dead were all taken to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital where they were seen by an AP reporter. Two children were among the dead. The health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza said Friday that a total of 28 people had been killed and 120 others wounded in the past 24 hours. On Thursday, the U.N. Security Council’s 10 elected members circulated a draft resolution demanding 'an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire' in Gaza as well. The draft resolution, which was sent to the council’s five permanent members, reiterates the council’s demand 'for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages' seized during Hamas’ attack on southern Israel in 2023. Israel says about 100 are still being held, though not all are believed to be alive. The U.S., Israel’s closest ally, holds the key to whether the U.N. Security Council adopts the resolution. The four other permanent members — Russia, China, Britain and France — are expected to support it or abstain. The draft, obtained Thursday by the AP, also demands immediate access for Gaza’s civilian population to humanitarian aid and services essential for their survival. The draft resolution would also express the council’s 'deep alarm over the ongoing catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza including the lack of adequate healthcare services and the state of food insecurity creating a risk of famine notably in the north.' It would deplore all attacks against civilians and 'civilian objects' and all acts of terrorism. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. The officials don't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed have been women and children. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,200 people have been killed and more than 14,000 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reported. Lebanon has also suffered around $8.5 billion in physical damage and economic loss, according to a World Bank report released Thursday. In the town of Douris near the city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, rescue teams continued searching through the rubble Friday at the site of an Israeli strike that hit a civil defense center the night before. The Lebanese Civil Defense said in a statement that 13 bodies had been recovered, all of them employees and volunteers of the emergency services agency, as well as some other remains that will require DNA testing. In a statement, the General Directorate of Civil Defense expressed 'deep regret over this direct attack on its members' and said that its centers 'will continue to respond to relief calls and continue with its humanitarian mission, no matter how great the challenges and sacrifices are.' ___ Rising reported from Bangkok.

A France-trained force aims to strengthen Ukraine's defenses at a...	A FRENCH MILITARY BASE, France (AP) — A French military task force with a festive name — 'Champagne' — is wrapping up a mission that's no party: training a whole new brigade of several thousand Ukrainian troops who will be joining the fight against Russia's invasion armed with France-supplied tanks, artillery canons and other heavy weaponry. The approaching return to Ukraine of the 'Anne of Kyiv' brigade, after more than two months of intense military training in eastern and southern France, comes at another critical juncture in the almost three-year war. Russian forces are driving westward in an effort to capture all of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. They've been bolstered by up to 12,000 North Korean troops that have been deployed to Russia’s Kursk border region to help beat back Ukrainian forces there, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments. The reelection of Donald Trump is also keeping Ukraine and its allies guessing about the impact he'll have as U.S. president on the war's future trajectory, following his campaign pledges to swiftly end the fighting and suggestions that Kyiv should cede territory to Moscow in return for peace. When deployed, the French-trained and -equipped brigade named after a Kyiv princess who became a queen of France could prove to be a formidable force on the battlefields. It will eventually be made up of 4,500 troops, formed of infantry battalions, plus engineers, artillery teams and other specialists, French authorities have previously said. The more than 2,000 soldiers who have been training in France are being put through final paces before their return to Ukraine. The majority of them were recently mobilized and previously had just a few weeks of basic training before their arrival in France in September, the French military says. The Ukrainian military is also training other troops for the brigade back in Ukraine, according to French authorities. The French military dedicated around 1,500 of its own soldiers to the 'Champagne' task force that has been teaching the Ukrainians how to fight effectively together and how to use and maintain their France-supplied weaponry. The French military says the brigade's arsenal will include 18 AMX 10 light tanks, 18 truck-mounted Caesar artillery pieces, 128 armored troop carriers, anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile systems, plus other weaponry and equipment. With observation drones buzzing overhead and amid clouds of smoke and bursts of gunfire and explosions, the Ukrainian soldiers conducted exercises this week at a French military training camp, showing how they have learned to defend and storm a complex of trenches like those on the battlefronts in Ukraine. The French military wouldn't allow visiting journalists to interview the Ukrainians. French officers involved in the training said the troops are now better prepared for combat that they'll likely experience in months ahead. 'They have improved a lot,' said Col. Paul. The French military withheld his last name, citing security reasons. 'Now they are able to fight, they are able to maneuver,' he said. 'They are able to use the different specialists and to use the different equipment they will have on the battlefield.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Ukraine at and coverage of the war at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-a-france-trained-and-armed-force-aims-to-strengthen-ukraines-defenses-at-critical-juncture-in-war/	2024-11-14T12:40:01-08:00	
Hostages freed from Gaza meet with Pope Francis and press campaig...	ROME (AP) — A delegation of former hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and their relatives met Thursday with Pope Francis and expressed hope that the incoming and outgoing U.S. administrations would work together to bring the remaining hostages home. The freed hostages included Yelena Troufanov, who was released last November but whose son Sasha remains in Gaza and appeared in a video released Wednesday by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group. 'You see in the picture how my child has changed over the course of this year,' Yelena Troufanov told a news conference in Rome after the papal audience. 'I am very worried about his condition, I see that he is not in a good mental state and not in a good physical state.' She and the other former hostages and relatives renewed their calls for a deal to bring the remaining hostages home, especially with winter approaching. They said they hoped the incoming Trump administration would work with the outgoing Biden administration to push the process forward. The war started when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and kidnapping 250, with dozens still in Gaza. Israel’s subsequent campaign has killed more than 43,000 people, according to Gaza health officials, whose count doesn't distinguish between civilians and fighters, though they say more than half of the dead are women and children. The war has ignited a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, driven Israel into increasing international isolation, with two world courts examining charges of war crimes, and had sparked a wave of protests on American campuses that have fueled debate over the U.S. role as Israel’s key military and diplomatic supporter. 'We hope that with the election of Trump, together with Biden — this is not about left and right — we hope that Biden and Trump work together now to get the hostages back before the winter,' said Sharone Lifshitz, who accompanied her mother, Yocheved Lifshitz, to the audience. Her mother, a longtime peace activist, was released Oct. 23, 2023, but her father Oded remains in Gaza. Sharone Lifshitz, who wasn't kidnapped, thanked Francis for meeting with the delegation and said that he promised to pray for each of the hostages still being held. Israel says that Hamas is holding about 65 hostages and the remains of about 35 others either killed on Oct. 7, 2023, or who died in captivity. 'The pope is a few years older than my father. Both of them are men who spent a lifetime making this world a place that cares for the weak, that cares for each other, that reaches across religions and creeds to make it a place where humans, real humans, can live in dignity,' she said. Louis Har, an Argentine-Israeli who was freed during an Israeli army raid in Rafah last February, said that he never imagined that he would meet the Argentine pope. He wept at one point recounting his ordeal to reporters gathered at the Rome headquarters of Italy's Jewish communities. He said that he had given the pope a necklace with a charm signifying hope. 'I felt his sincerity, his care, and that we didn’t come in vain,' he said. 'There is someone listening to us. I hope that his prayers and his message will reach the whole world, because he has an impact on the whole world.' Francis has tried to strike a balance in his comments on the Hamas attack in 2023 and the Israeli response, and conflicts in Gaza and southern Lebanon that have ensued. He has called for an immediate cease-fire, for the release of hostages and for humanitarian aid to get to Gaza. He has also suggested that Israel’s actions in Gaza and southern Lebanon are disproportionate and immoral, and says that he calls a Catholic parish in Gaza every day to check in on the people it is sheltering. He has met twice before with relatives of the hostages, and once with Palestinians whose families were affected by Israel's operations in Gaza. ___ Natalie Melzer reported from Tel Aviv, Israel. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Middle East latest: Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of war crim...	Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday that Israel has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip, including massive forced displacements that amount to ethnic cleansing. A new report released by the New York-based rights group said people have been killed while evacuating under Israeli orders and in Israeli-designated humanitarian zones, where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. The report said the widespread, deliberate demolition of homes and civilian infrastructure in Gaza -– some of them to carve a new road bisecting the territory and establish a buffer zone along Israel’s border -– was likely to 'permanently displace' many Palestinians. 'Such actions of the Israeli authorities amount to ethnic cleansing,' Human Rights Watch said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the report. Israel’s blistering campaign in Gaza has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Around 90% of the territory’s population has fled their homes, with many displaced multiple times. The Israeli offensive has also damaged or destroyed around two-thirds of homes and other buildings in Gaza, according to U.N. assessments. Israel says it does not deliberately target civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths, saying the militants hide among civilians and operate in residential areas. On Wednesday, 15 trucks carrying aid were allowed into northern Gaza, where aid groups have warned that a monthlong Israeli offensive could cause a famine. The trucks entered Gaza with aid from the United Arab Emirates, according to the military body handling aid deliveries into the territory, COGAT. It said the aid consisted of food and water as well as hygiene, shelter and medical supplies. U.N. agencies did not immediately confirm the delivery of the aid. Israeli forces have encircled the Gaza Strip’s northernmost areas for the past month, saying Hamas militants have regrouped there. Experts say the Israeli military campaign has caused a new wave of displaced civilians and warn that famine is imminent or may already be happening there. Israel has also been striking deeper inside Lebanon since September as it escalates the war against Hezbollah. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Lebanon's Hezbollah group began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Since then, more than 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than 14,200 wounded, the country's Health Ministry reported. In Israel, 76 people have been killed, including 31 soldiers. ___ Here's the latest: 2 Israeli airstrikes in Syria kill at least 15, state media report DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria’s state news agency says Israel carried out two airstrikes on a western neighborhood Damascus and one of the capital’s suburbs, killing at least 15 people. One of the strikes targeted an office of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group. Sixteen people were also wounded in the airstrikes, state news agency SANA said, quoting an unnamed military official. SANA said the airstrikes on the Mazzeh neighborhood in Damascus and the suburb of Qudsaya northwest of the capital struck two buildings. An Associated Press journalist at the scene in Mazzeh said a five-story building was damaged by a missile that hit the basement. An official with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Group said the strike in Mazzeh targeted one of their offices, and that several members of the group were killed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media about the group’s affairs. SANA said Syria’s air defenses were activated against a 'hostile target' south of the central city of Homs. It gave no further details.

EU's top diplomat proposes suspending political dialogue with Israel BRUSSELS — The European Union’s top diplomat is proposing that the bloc suspend political dialogue with Israel over concerns about human rights abuses and breaches of international law in its war against Hamas. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell will put the proposal to foreign ministers from the 27 member countries at a meeting he will chair in Brussels on Monday. Borrell 'will ask ministers to consider whether Israel is violating human rights, whether Israel is respecting or not international humanitarian law, and he will invite the ministers to express their views on his proposal to suspend political dialogue,' his spokesman said. The EU is deeply divided over Israel and the Palestinians and it’s unlikely that all the ministers would agree to halt the dialogue. 'Any kind of decisions regarding the political parts of this agreement are subject to unanimity of all the member states,' the spokesman, Peter Stano, told reporters on Thursday. Under the pact, the dialogue covers 'all subjects of common interest, and shall aim to open the way to new forms of cooperation with a view to common goals, in particular peace, security and democracy.' It’s meant to strengthen EU-Israeli relations. Israeli police complete demolition of Arab Bedouin village in the Negev Desert JERUSALEM — Israeli police completed the demolition of the Arab Bedouin village of Umm Al-Hiran Thursday, ending a years-old legal battle. Many in the minority community had seen the village as a symbol of their larger struggle against Israeli plans to relocate them. On Thursday, Israeli bulldozers entered the 400-person village in the Negev Desert and demolished the last building left standing –- the mosque. Residents had dismantled their makeshift homes earlier this week to avoid having to pay fees for the state to demolish them. Israel says the hundreds of villagers were squatting on public land and has offered them plots in a nearby Bedouin township. The villagers accuse the authorities of forcibly displacing them so the land can be developed for Israel’s Jewish majority. Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, celebrated the move, posting on X that there has been a 400% increase in the issuance of such demolition orders so far this year. 'Proud to lead a strong policy of demolishing illegal houses in the Negev!' he wrote. Or Hanoch, an Israeli activist who witnessed the demolition, said drones and helicopters hovered overhead as seven police bulldozers took down the mosque. 'After the mosque was demolished, the rest of the heavy machinery started re-destroying the rest of the houses, which were already demolished,' Hanoch said. Three members of the village council were arrested early Thursday before the demolition began, said Nati Yefet, the spokesperson for the Regional Council for Unrecognized Villages in the Negev. The council has accused Israel of clearing the land for the construction of a Jewish community. 'The destruction of Umm al-Hiran to make way for the settlement of Dror is part of a systematic population replacement program in the Negev,' it said. Four other Bedouin villages have been demolished this year as part of a larger plan to raze unrecognized villages and build new Jewish communities in their place, it said. Umm al-Hiran was founded in its current location in 1956, after the Israeli military relocated the village clan multiple times following the 1948 war that led to Israel’s creation. Israel’s more than 200,000 Bedouin are the poorest members of the country’s Arab minority, which also includes Christian and Muslim urban communities. Israel’s Arab population, which makes up roughly 20% of the country’s 10 million people, are citizens with the right to vote but often suffer discrimination and tend to identify with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Syrian state media report explosions near Damascus and Homs DAMASCUS, Syria — Syrian state media are reporting explosions near the capital, Damascus, and the central city of Homs in what appeared to be Israeli airstrikes. State news agency SANA said the country’s air defenses were activated against a 'hostile target' south of Homs on Thursday. It gave no further details. The agency later reported an explosion near Damascus, adding that the cause of the blasts was not immediately clear. Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria targeting members of Lebanon’s Hezbollah and officials from Iranian-backed groups. Israel says it has allowed 15 trucks carrying aid into northern Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel says 15 trucks loaded with aid have been allowed into northern Gaza, where aid groups have warned that a monthlong offensive could cause a famine. The military body handling aid deliveries into the territory, COGAT, said the 15 trucks entered Gaza on Wednesday with aid shipped in by sea by the United Arab Emirates. It said the aid consists of food and water, as well as hygiene, shelter and medical supplies. U.N. agencies did not immediately confirm that the aid was delivered to its destination inside northern Gaza. Over the past week, the U.N. says aid trucks have entered the north but have not reached their final destinations due to Israeli movement restrictions and hungry crowds taking items from the trucks. Israel has scrambled to ramp up aid to Gaza after a monthlong stretch during which aid plunged to its lowest levels this year. The U.S. Biden administration warned Israel to increase the aid last month, saying a failure to do so could lead to a reduction in military support. The White House backed down this week, citing some improvements and ruling out any reduction in arms supplies, even after international aid groups said Israel had fallen far short of the American demands. Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of war crimes, crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip JERUSALEM — Human Rights Watch says Israel has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip, including massive forced displacements that amount to ethnic cleansing. A report released by the New York-based rights group on Thursday says Israeli evacuation orders have often caused 'grave harm' to civilians. People have been killed while evacuating and in Israeli-designated humanitarian zones, where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. 'The Israeli government cannot claim to be keeping Palestinians safe when it kills them along escape routes, bombs so-called safe zones, and cuts off food, water, and sanitation,' said Nadia Hardman, refugee and migrant rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. The report said the widespread, deliberate demolition of homes and civilian infrastructure in Gaza -– some of them to carve a new road bisecting the territory and establish a buffer zone along Israel’s border -– was likely to 'permanently displace' many Palestinians. 'Such actions of the Israeli authorities amount to ethnic cleansing,' Human Rights Watch said. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. Human Rights Watch called on governments to stop supplying weapons to Israel and to comply with a July opinion by the International Court of Justice saying Israel’s presence in the Palestinian territories is unlawful and must end. The group says its researchers interviewed 39 displaced Palestinians in Gaza, reviewed evacuation orders Israel has released throughout the war and analyzed satellite imagery and video of attacks along evacuation routes and in 'safe zones.' US military says it conducted strikes against Houthi rebels DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The U.S. military says it has conducted several days of strikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The strikes included U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy aircraft, including the Navy’s F-35C stealth fighter jet, it said Thursday. The military also released video showing a strike by an MQ-9 Reaper drone on a mobile missile launcher placed on the back of what appeared to be a truck. A person standing next to the launcher is seen running away after the strike. 'This targeted operation was conducted in response to the Houthi’s repeated and unlawful attacks on international commercial shipping, as well as U.S., coalition and merchant vessels in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden,' the U.S. military’s Central Command said. 'It also aimed to degrade the Houthi’s ability to threaten regional partners.' The strikes happened Saturday and Sunday. The Houthis launched an attack this week targeted two U.S. Navy destroyers entering the Red Sea. The Americans said they 'engaged and defeated' eight bomb-carrying drones, five anti-ship ballistic missiles and four cruise missiles that the Houthis used to target the vessels. ___ For more Middle East news:	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israel-says-15-trucks-carrying-aid-have-been-allowed-into-northern-gaza/	2024-11-14T06:31:38-08:00	
Ukrainian soldiers focus on keeping Russian advances at bay and b...	KHARKIV REGION, Ukraine (AP) — The four drones were designed to carry bombs, but instead the men of Ukraine's Khartia brigade pack them with food, water and handwarmers and launch them in darkness toward the front line, a 15-minute flight away. The unit commander who goes by the callsign Kit, or 'cat,' pilots the tiny uncrewed aircraft from a basement room he jokingly calls their Airbnb. Guided by the drone's night-vision camera, he drops the 10-kilogram (22-pound) packages one by one as close as he can to the position where as many as five infantrymen battle Russian forces in the late autumn chill. The delivery will hold them for two or three days. That's about as far as Kit dares look into the future. He knows that the reelection of Donald Trump will change something in his life, but as far as he and other Ukrainian soldiers on the front are concerned, trying to figure out how is a game for politicians. For him, all that matters is the distance he measures in the meters (yards) that Russian forces advance or retreat in the front-line sector that is his responsibility. 'We are trying with all our might to destroy them and win back our territories, so that it does not go any further, so that there are no more destroyed cities and destroyed lives,' Kit said. 'We need to focus on the present in our work and try to do it effectively in the here and now.' But he cannot escape the sense of a gathering storm. Russia is increasingly hitting the Kharkiv region with unstoppable, building-leveling glide bombs and swarms of drones and chipping away at territory there. Its troops are advancing in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia's Kursk border region to help beat back Ukrainian forces there, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments. Trump, who has called President Vladimir Putin 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized American backing of Ukraine. He characterized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for winning U.S. aid. Zelenskyy was among the first world leaders to publicly congratulate Trump, and said the two discussed how to end 'Russian aggression against Ukraine' when they met in September. Between now and Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the Biden administration has said it will send as much aid to Ukraine as possible to help hold back Russian forces and possess a strong hand in any potential peace negotiations. But Russia is pressing just as hard for an advantage in what most believe are crucial weeks to come. Aviator, a Khartia soldier launching the supply drones, said he can only do his job and hope for the best. His attention is fixed on how many hours remain before the coming dawn, when Russian forces will be able to spot the uncrewed aircraft and shoot them down. If his mission fails, he knows that the men he calls brothers will suffer. 'You feel you’re useful, that you are in the right place, that the lives and health of our brothers depend on your work,' said Aviator, who returned to Ukraine from a job in Poland to join the army. 'We’re just doing our job, we don’t have time to worry about the election.' Tolstiy, who runs a drone repair workshop not far away, knows firsthand what happens to territory captured by Russia.

Protests erupt in Paris over pro-Israel gala organized by far-rig...	PARIS (AP) — Protests erupted in Paris on Wednesday against a controversial gala organized by far-right figures in support of Israel. The event, intended to raise funds for the Israeli military, included Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich among its invited guests. The demonstrations came on the eve of a high-stakes soccer match at France's national stadium against the Israeli national team, overshadowed by tensions around the wars in the Middle East. Authorities in Paris announced that more than 4,000 police officers and 1,600 stadium staff will be deployed for the game. Smotrich, a vocal advocate of Israeli settlements, had been expected to attend Wednesday's gala, dubbed 'Israel is Forever,' which was planned by an association of the same name. The group’s stated goal is to 'mobilize French-speaking Zionist forces.' After days of growing criticism of the event, Smotrich's office confirmed Wednesday that the minister would not travel to Paris to participate. But the invitation to Smotrich drew sharp criticism from local associations, unions and left-wing political parties, prompting two protests in the French capital. The minister, a hard-line settler leader, has been accused of inflaming tensions in the West Bank and drew international condemnations this week by saying he hopes the election of Donald Trump will clear the way for Israeli annexation of the West Bank — a step that would extinguish Palestinian statehood dreams. The French Foreign Ministry called Smotrich’s remarks 'contrary to international law' and counterproductive to efforts to reduce regional tensions. 'France reiterates its commitment to the implementation of the two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security, which is the only prospect for a just and lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,' the ministry said in a statement. Critics also pointed at Nili Kupfer-Naouri, president of the 'Israel is Forever' association, who sparked outrage in 2023, after the Israel-Hamas war started, when she tweeted that 'no civilian in Gaza was innocent.' On Wednesday night, several hundred protesters marched through central Paris, denouncing the event as a 'gala of hatred and shame.' 'Imagine if an association were hosting a gala for Hezbollah or Hamas — there’s no way the police would allow that,' said Melkir Saib, a 30-year-old protester. 'The situation is just unfair.' The march was largely peaceful, but some demonstrators broke windows at a McDonald's along the route. A separate group, including Jewish leftist organizations opposed to racism and antisemitism, gathered near the Arc de Triomphe chanting slogans against the gala and Smotrich. French authorities defended the event, with Paris police chief Laurent Nunez stating that the gala posed 'no major threat to public order.' The protests came days after tensions flared in Paris and Amsterdam related to the conflicts in the Mideast. A massive 'Free Palestine' banner was displayed during a Paris Saint-Germain Champions League match against Atletico Madrid, while violence broke out in Amsterdam last week targeting fans of an Israeli soccer club.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-protests-erupt-in-paris-over-pro-israel-gala-organized-by-far-right-figures/	2024-11-13T18:34:45-08:00	
Middle East latest: 3 young siblings killed in Gaza as Israeli st...	An Israeli strike on a home in northern Gaza killed three siblings aged 6 and under, among at least six people killed in airstrikes in the war-ravaged territory, Palestinian medics said. In Lebanon, an Israeli airstrike on an apartment building south of Beirut on Wednesday killed at least six people and wounded 15, the Health Ministry said. The Biden administration said Tuesday it won’t limit weapons transfers to Israel because it has made limited progress in increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Eight international aid groups had earlier said that Israel failed to meet U.S. demands for greater humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip, where hunger experts say the north may already be experiencing famine. Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. The officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Lebanon's Hezbollah group began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Since then, more than 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than 14,200 wounded, the country's Health Ministry reported. In Israel, 76 people have been killed, including 31 soldiers. ___ Here's the latest: Blinken says Israel should end the war in Gaza and allow displaced to return home BRUSSELS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is urging Israel to allow displaced Palestinians and aid back into Gaza and says it should end the war against Hamas now that it’s achieved its main security aims. 'The situation is so difficult and so dramatic that to fully redress it, to fully answer the needs of people, the best way to do that is to end the war,' Blinken told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday. He said that Israel has accomplished its goals of dismantling the military wing of Hamas and ensuring that an attack like the one the militant group launched on Oct. 7 last year cannot happen again. 'Israel, by the standards it set itself, has accomplished the strategic goals it set for itself,' Blinken said. 'So this should be a time to end the war.' He said that hundreds of aid trucks in Gaza are unable to distribute relief supplies due to looting and other crime. 'It’s imperative that that be addressed. Israel has responsibilities to do that. We’re also working with Egypt,' he said. Blinken called for 'real and extended pauses' in the fighting in much of Gaza 'so that the assistance can effectively get to people who need it.' A new video shows an Israeli hostage in Gaza CAIRO — The Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group has released a new video showing an Israeli hostage who has been held in Gaza for over a year. The video shows Sasha Troufanov, likely speaking under duress, describing the harsh conditions inside Gaza, warning against military operations to free him and calling on Israelis to protest for his release. It was the first such video to be released in several weeks. It was not clear when it was filmed, but Troufanov appeared to refer to Israel’s war against Hezbollah in Lebanon and its recent exchange of fire with Iran, which occurred in October. Islamic Jihad took part in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 250 people hostage. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Islamic Jihad released two previous videos of Troufanov earlier this year. He turned 29 on Monday, marking his second birthday in captivity. His mother, grandmother and girlfriend were also taken captive, but they were released during a November 2023 cease-fire. His father was killed in the Oct. 7 attack. The U.S., Egypt and Qatar have spent most of this year trying to broker a cease-fire and the release of the remaining hostages. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in return for a lasting cease-fire, the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to retain Israeli control over parts of Gaza and to continue the war until 'total victory' over Hamas and the return of the remaining captives. At least 6 dead and 15 wounded in an Israeli strike south of Beirut BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in the town of Aramoun, just south of Beirut, killed at least six people and wounded 15 others Wednesday, Lebanon’s Health Ministry said. The state-run National News Agency reported that there were children missing after the strike and it wasn't clear if they are under the rubble or were transferred to a hospital. There was no warning issued before the strike, and it was not clear what the target was. There was no immediate statement from the Israeli military. Also Wednesday morning, the Israeli military struck several sites in Beirut’s southern suburbs, an area known as Dahiyeh, after issuing evacuation warnings. It said the strikes were targeting 'Hezbollah facilities and interests.' There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israeli forces and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began launching rockets across the border in support of its ally, Hamas, in Gaza. The conflict escalated beginning in mid-September. Israel has launched a widespread aerial bombardment of Lebanon and a ground invasion that it said is intended to push Hezbollah back from the border. 3 young siblings were killed in an Israeli strike in northern Gaza, Palestinian medics say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medics say an Israeli strike on a home in northern Gaza killed three siblings aged 6 and under. They were among at least six people killed in Israeli strikes on Tuesday in the war-ravaged territory, where Israel has been at war with Hamas for more than 13 months. The Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service says the three children were killed in a strike on a home near a clinic in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, where Israel has been waging an offensive for over a month. In the central city of Deir al-Balah, a strike hit a tent in the western side of the city, killing at least two people, including a 15-year-old boy, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said. Another strike on a tent in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp killed a man, the hospital said. An Associated Press journalist counted the three bodies at the hospital. Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It accuses Hamas militants of hiding among civilians in homes and shelters. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 people hostage. Around 100 captives are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. They do not distinguish between militants and civilians in their count but say women and children make up more than half of those killed. US forces conduct strikes in Syria against Iranian-aligned militia groups WASHINGTON — U.S. forces conducted strikes in Syria against Iranian-aligned militia groups for a second day in a row Tuesday in response to further attacks on U.S. personnel, U.S. Central Command said late Tuesday. In the latest retaliatory strikes, U.S. forces hit a weapons storage and logistics facility after militia groups launched a rocket attack on U.S. personnel at Patrol Base Shaddadi in eastern Syria. Earlier Tuesday, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said that over the weekend the militias had also targeted U.S. personnel with a drone attack and indirect fire at another base, Green Village, where U.S. troops are operating — which prompted the U.S. to strike nine militia targets on Monday in self-defense. There are about 900 U.S. troops deployed in Syria. No U.S. troops were wounded in either attack. ___ For more Middle East news:	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-3-young-siblings-among-6-killed-in-israeli-strikes-in-gaza-medics-say/	2024-11-13T05:16:31-08:00	
Biden is sending aid to help Ukraine keep fighting next year, Bli...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The Biden administration is determined in its final months to help ensure that Ukraine can keep fighting off Russia's full-scale invasion next year, sending it as much aid as possible so that it might hold Russian forces at bay and possess a strong hand in any potential peace negotiations, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday. 'President Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and Jan. 20,' when president-elect Donald Trump is due to be sworn in, Blinken said. NATO countries must focus their efforts on 'ensuring that Ukraine has the money, munitions and mobilized forces to fight effectively in 2025, or to be able to negotiate a peace from a position of strength,' Blinken said during a visit to Brussels. The U.S. will 'adapt and adjust' with the latest equipment it is sending, Blinken said, without providing details. The almost three-year war has shown no signs of winding down. Russia attacked the Ukrainian capital Kyiv with a sophisticated combination of missiles and drones for the first time in 73 days on Wednesday. That came a day after the Pentagon said most of the North Korean troops sent to help Moscow's war effort are fighting to drive Ukraine's army off Russian soil in the Kursk border region. Ukraine is also straining to hold back a monthslong Russian onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region. Political uncertainty over how a U.S. administration under Trump will change Washington’s policy on the war is a key new factor in the conflict. U.S. military aid is vital for Ukraine, but Trump has signaled that he doesn’t want to keep giving tens of billions of dollars to Kyiv. Air raid warnings blared for hours as Russia targeted eight regions of Ukraine on Wednesday, firing six ballistic and cruise missiles and 90 drones, the Ukrainian air force said. Air defenses downed four missiles and 37 drones, and another 47 drones were stopped by electronic jamming, the statement said. The damage was being assessed. The air assault came as most of the more than 10,000 North Korean troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow in the war are engaged in combat in Russia's Kursk border region, according to the Pentagon. A Ukrainian army incursion into Kursk three months ago has succeeded in holding a broad area of land and has embarrassed the Kremlin. Russia’s military has trained the North Korean soldiers in artillery, drone skills and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, Pentagon deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told a briefing Tuesday. The cooperation faces challenges, according to the Pentagon, including how to achieve military interoperability and overcoming the language barrier. Kyiv officials say that Russia has deployed around 50,000 troops to Kursk in a bid to dislodge the Ukrainians. Russia has in recent months been assembling forces for a counteroffensive in Kursk, according to the Institute for the Study of War think tank, though the timescale of the operation isn't known. ___ Lorne Cook reported from Brussels. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-strikes-kyiv-with-a-combined-drone-and-missile-attack-the-first-in-months/	2024-11-13T05:07:37-08:00	
Why is only limited aid getting to Palestinians inside Gaza?	JERUSALEM (AP) — The United States said Tuesday it wouldn't punish Israel over the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. But it urged Israel to increase the flow of aid into the besieged territory. The White House last month gave Israel 30 days to improve conditions or risk losing military support. As the deadline expired, leading international aid groups said that Israel had fallen far short, with the humanitarian situation in Gaza the worst it has been since the war erupted. Late Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said that Israel has made limited progress and that it wouldn't take any punitive action against its close ally. However, it called for more steps. 'We are not giving Israel a pass,' said Vedant Patel, a State Department spokesman. 'We want to see the totality of the humanitarian situation improve.' After 13 months of war, aid groups accuse the Israeli military of hindering and even blocking shipments in Gaza. Almost the entire population of around 2.3 million Palestinians is relying on international aid for survival, and food security experts and rights groups caution that famine may already be underway in hard-hit north Gaza. 'It’s really frustrating because by almost every objective metric, all agencies say that the humanitarian situation has gotten worse in that time frame that the U.S. has specified,' Aseel Baidoun, a senior manager of the aid group Medical Aid for Palestinians, said on Wednesday. 'Even though we have provided all the evidence that there is a risk of famine ... still the U.S. miraculously finds Israel not violating the humanitarian aid law.' Israel, which controls all crossings into Gaza, says it is committed to delivering humanitarian assistance and has scrambled to ramp up aid. It says the U.N. and international aid groups need to do a better job of distributing supplies. Where do aid levels stand? Aid into Gaza is typically measured in terms of truckloads of food and supplies entering the territory. The U.S. has demanded 350 trucks daily. Israeli government figures show roughly 57 trucks a day entering on average in October and 75 a day in November. The U.N. counts trucks differently and says it has only received 39 trucks daily since the beginning of October. In northern Gaza, where the Israeli military has been carrying out a major offensive over the past month, the figures were even lower. No aid entered the northernmost areas of Gaza – Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun – in October, the U.N. says. Israel says it closed all the Gaza crossings for the Jewish high holidays in October and couldn’t send aid to the north because of the offensive against Hamas fighters. Over the last two days, the military body handling aid deliveries to Gaza — COGAT — says it has allowed aid trucks to enter the hardest-hit northern areas. But only three of the trucks have made it to their destination successfully, according to the World Food Program. Denial of passage and entry Aid groups accuse the Israeli army of blocking aid trucks from reaching areas where the fighting is most intense, including northern Gaza, where hunger is most acute. 'There can be aid sitting at the border ready to come in. But if we are not provided a safe passage to go and collect it, it’s not possible for us to have it. And it will not reach the people who need it,' said Louise Wateridge, a spokesperson for UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. UNRWA has been the main agency procuring and distributing aid in Gaza, and a feud between Israel and the agency, led Israel to take steps toward banning it last month. Israel says Hamas has infiltrated UNRWA -- a charge the agency denies. During October, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that Israeli authorities rejected roughly 43% of all humanitarian movement requests, and impeded a further 16%. Israeli authorities have also prohibited some vehicles and goods from entering the enclave, aid groups say, often without explanation. Rachel Morris, of the aid group Mercy Corps, said trucks carrying the group’s tent supplies have been turned away more than five times. Israel says it denies entry to supplies that could be weaponized by Hamas. Under intense international pressure, Israel has since taken measures to up aid delivery, with COGAT saying it was allowing trucks into the hard-hit north. On Tuesday, it said had opened a fifth border crossing to increase the flow of aid. But aid groups say access is still an issue. The World Food Program said vehicles filled with its supplies were denied access to Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun, and Beit Lahiya on Tuesday. The day before, the U.N. agency said it received approval from the army to deliver supplies to Beit Hanoun only to be stopped by troops on route in Jabaliya and ordered to offload the stockpile there. 'I witnessed during my visit to Gaza last week the deliberate starvation of almost 2 million civilians, whilst the bombardment continues,' said Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, a major relief provider. 'There is barely any aid crossing into Gaza.' Lawlessness along aid routes Also stymying distribution is theft and criminality along aid routes. Israel accuses UNRWA of failing to pick up hundreds of trucks worth of supplies piling up at the territory’s main southern aid crossing. It says the aid has been waiting there for months. But the military and aid agencies both acknowledge that aid deliveries are treacherous, because family-based crime groups are robbing the trucks. An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under military briefing guidelines, estimated that 30% to 40% of aid supplies are stolen by members of criminal families. COGAT spokesperson Shani Sasson said that the Israeli army has tried to secure part of the route and find alternate routes for drivers, but can't accompany each aid truck and the criminal groups are always moving. Many aid groups that use the crossing now say it's too dangerous for their staff to collect aid. Baidoun, with MAP, said that drivers sometimes have to pay fees to move their aid from the crossing into Gaza. He said that the Israeli military was 'failing to provide an enabling environment to bring in sufficient humanitarian goods to Gaza.' Aid groups also say their warehouses and workers have come under attack from Israeli forces. OCHA says that at least 326 aid workers have been killed since the start of the war. It's not clear how many have been killed while working. ___ Melanie Lidman contributed to this report from Tel Aviv, Israel. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the international aid groups said that Israel had fallen far short, not the U.S.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-why-is-only-limited-aid-getting-to-palestinians-inside-gaza/	2024-11-13T03:56:09-08:00	
US says it intends to shore up support for Ukraine until Trump ta...	BRUSSELS (AP) — President Joe Biden intends to bolster U.S. military support to Ukraine in the final months of his administration, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday, after Russia launched a sophisticated missile and drone attack on Kyiv. The U.S. will 'continue to shore up everything we’re doing for Ukraine to make sure that it can effectively defend itself against this Russian aggression,' Blinken told reporters at NATO headquarters, before planned meetings with allied envoys and Ukrainian officials. Blinken warned that North Korea’s decision to send its troops into combat operations alongside Russian forces 'demands and will get a firm response.' He didn't elaborate. U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments say up to 12,000 North Korean combat troops are being sent to the war. The bulk of those troops were expected to be deployed in Russia’s Kursk region where Ukrainian troops have seized a swathe of territory. Russia’s early morning missile and drone attack was the first on Kyiv in 73 days. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that Russia is intensifying its strikes, apparently in an effort to discourage Ukrainians from continuing the war, which is approaching its 1,000-day milestone. Russia appears to be pressing its advantage as doubt swirls about how Washington might change policy on the war after Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president in January. The U.S. is the biggest provider of military help to Ukraine. Trump has slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid and has promised to quickly end the conflict. Ukraine’s international backers fear that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Russian President Vladimir Putin. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-says-it-intends-to-shore-up-support-for-ukraine-until-trump-takes-office/	2024-11-13T01:07:25-08:00	
Biden meets with Israeli president	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) - President Joe Biden met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Tuesday, as international aid organizations said conditions in Gaza are worse than at any point in Israel’s war with Hamas. Last month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin wrote a letter threatening to withhold aid to Israel if humanitarian conditions in Gaza didn’t improve within 30 days. That deadline ended on Tuesday. Among the requirements, Blinken and Austin wanted Israel to allow 350 aid trucks into Gaza every day. U.S. State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel said Israel allowed 404 aid trucks into Gaza between Nov. 1 and Nov. 9, well short of the goal. Still, Patel said the U.S. is not withholding military aid to Gaza. 'We, at this time, have not made an assessment that the Israelis are in violation of U.S. law,' Patel said. 'We’re not giving Israel a pass.' Both Presidents Herzog and Biden have blamed Iran for increasing instability in the Middle East. 'They are doing whatever they can to derail stability and security and peace,' Herzog said. Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hamas is the group responsible for the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. President Herzog said 101 hostages are still in Gaza. On Monday, the Pentagon announced the U.S. launched attacks at another Iran-backed group, the Houthis in Yemen. U.S. Central Command says the military is responding to attacks on U.S. personnel, but nobody was injured.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/biden-meets-with-israeli-president/	2024-11-12T13:46:54-08:00	
Israeli strikes hit Beirut suburbs and kill 31 Palestinians in th...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes killed at least 31 people in the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, including 11 at a makeshift cafeteria in an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone, medics said. In Lebanon, warplanes struck Beirut’s southern suburbs on Tuesday after the military warned people to evacuate a number of homes. The new bombardment on both fronts comes on the verge of a deadline set by the United States for Israel to dramatically ramp up humanitarian aid allowed in Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. A group of eight international aid agencies said in a report on Tuesday that Israel has failed to meet the U.S. demands. In Lebanon, large explosions shook Beirut’s southern suburbs — an area known as Dahiyeh, where Hezbollah has a significant presence — soon after the Israeli military issued evacuation warnings for 11 houses there. There was no immediate word on casualties. The military said the houses contained Hezbollah installations, but the claim could not be independently confirmed. Late Monday night, a strike hit the village of Ain Yaacoub in northern Lebanon, killing at least 16 people, the Lebanese civil defense said. Four of the killed were Syrian refugees, and there were another 10 people wounded. There was no immediate Israeli military comment on the strike. Israel has been carrying out intensified bombardment of Lebanon since late September, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and put a stop to more than year of cross-border fire by the Lebanese militant group. Israeli strikes across Gaza kill 31 At the same time, Israel has continued its campaign in Gaza, now more than 13 months old, triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. An Israeli strike late Monday hit a makeshift cafeteria used by displaced people in Muwasi, the center of a 'humanitarian zone' that Israel’s military declared earlier in the war. At least 11 people were killed, including two children, according to officials at Nasser Hospital, where the casualties were taken. Video from the scene showed men pulling bloodied wounded from among tables and chairs set up in the sand in an enclosure made of corrugated metal sheets. In the southern city of Khan Younis, another 11 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a three-wheeled vehicle with a trailer known as a tuk-tuk, according to the Nasser Hospital. Tuk-tuks are widely used as taxis in Gaza. Another strike early Tuesday hit a house in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people including a woman, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The strike also wounded 11 others, it said. Another strike hit a group of people near a clinic run by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees in the central city of Deir al-Balah, killing at least six people, including two children, according to the city's Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strikes. Under US pressure, Israel allows more aid into Gaza Hours earlier, the Israeli military announced a small expansion of the humanitarian zone, where it has told Palestinians evacuating from other parts of Gaza to take refuge. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering in sprawling tent camps in and around Muwasi, a largely desolate area of dunes and agricultural fields with few facilities or services along the Mediterranean coast. Israeli forces have also been besieging the northernmost part of Gaza since the beginning of October, battling Hamas fighters it says regrouped there. With virtually no food or aid allowed in for more than a month, the siege has raised fears of famine among the tens of thousands of Palestinians believed to still be sheltering there. An Oct. 13 letter signed by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin gave Israeli 30 days to, among other things, allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods to enter Gaza each day. So far, Israel has fallen short. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, and 75 a day so far in November, according to Israel’s official figures. The United Nations puts the number lower, at 39 trucks daily since the beginning of October. Israel has announced a flurry of measures in recent days to increase aid, including opening a new crossing into central Gaza. But so far the impact is unclear. The military said Tuesday it had allowed hundreds of packages of food and water into Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, two areas under siege in the far north of Gaza. The Palestinian civil defense agency said three trucks carrying flour, canned food and water reached Beit Hanoun. It was only the second delivery allowed into the area since the beginning of October; a smaller cargo was let in last week, though not all of it reached shelters in the north, according to the U.N. More forced evacuations in isolated northern Gaza The military announced Tuesday that four soldiers were killed in Jabaliya, bringing to 24 the number of soldiers killed in the assault there since it began. Palestinian health officials say hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, though the true numbers are unknown as rescue workers are unable to reach buildings destroyed in strikes. Israel has ordered residents in the area to evacuate. But the U.N. has estimated some 70,000 people remain. Many Palestinians there fear Israel aims to permanently depopulate the area to more easily keep control of it. On Tuesday, witnesses told The Associated Press that Israeli troops had encircled at least three schools in Beit Hanoun, forcing hundreds of displaced people sheltering inside to leave. Drones blared announcements demanding people move south to Gaza City, said Mahmoud al-Kafarnah, speaking from one of the schools as sounds of gunfire could be heard. 'The tanks are outside,' he said. 'We don’t know where to go.' Hashim Afanah, sheltering with at least 20 other people in his family home, said the forces were evicting people from houses and shelters. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities that do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count but say more than half the dead are women and children. Israel says it targets Hamas militants who hide among civilians. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 250 as hostages. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of them believed to be dead. ___ Associated Press reporters Samy Magdy in Cairo and Melanie Lidman in Jerusalem contributed to this report. ___ This story has corrected to show that the span of the war is now 13 months, not 19 months, and that 75 aid trucks have entered per day in November, according to Israeli figures, not 87.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israeli-strikes-kill-14-palestinians-in-gaza-medical-officials-say/	2024-11-12T06:27:03-08:00	
Aid groups say Israel misses US deadline to boost humanitarian ai...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel has failed to meet U.S. demands to allow greater humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip, where conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war, international aid organizations said Tuesday. The obstacles facing aid distribution were on this display this week. Even after the military gave permission for a delivery to the northernmost part of Gaza — virtually cut off from food for more than a month by an Israeli siege — the United Nations said it couldn't deliver most of it because of turmoil and restrictions from Israeli troops on the ground. Hunger experts have warned the north may already be experiencing famine. Meanwhile, in the south, hundreds of truckloads of aid are sitting on the Gaza side of the border because the U.N. says it cannot reach them to distribute — again because of the threat of lawlessness, theft and Israeli military restrictions. The Biden administration last month set a deadline expiring Tuesday for Israel to 'surge' more food and other emergency aid into the Palestinian territory. The administration warned that failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back military support as Israel wages offensives against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has announced a series of steps — though their effect was unclear. On Tuesday, it opened a new crossing in central Gaza, outside the city of Deir al-Balah for aid to enter. It also announced a small expansion of its coastal 'humanitarian zone,' where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are sheltering in tent camps. It connected electricity for a desalination plant in Deir al Balah. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said last week that Israel had made some progress but needs to do more. Still U.S. officials haven’t said if they will take any action. Israel’s new foreign minister, Gideon Saar, appeared to downplay the deadline, telling reporters Monday that he was confident 'the issue would be solved.' The Biden administration may have less leverage after the reelection of Donald Trump, who was a staunch supporter of Israel in his first term. Eight international aid organization said in their report Tuesday that 'Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria' but also took actions 'that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza. … That situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago.' The report listed 19 measures of compliance with the U.S. demands. It said that Israel had failed to comply with 15 and only partially complied with four. The report was co-signed by Anera, Care, MedGlobal, Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam, Refugees International and Save the Children. In an Oct. 13 letter, the U.S. gave Israel 30 days to, among other things, allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods into Gaza each day; open a fifth crossing; allow people in coastal tent camps to move inland before the winter; and ensure access for aid groups to northern Gaza. It also called on Israel to halt legislation that would hinder operations of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Aid levels remain far below the U.S. benchmarks. Access to northern Gaza remains restricted, and Israel has pressed ahead with its laws against UNRWA. Israel launched a major offensive last month in the north, where it says Hamas militants had regrouped. The operation has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands. Through October and the first days of November, Israel allowed no food to enter the area, where tens of thousands of civilians have stayed despite evacuation orders. Last week, Israel allowed 11 trucks to go to Beit Hanoun, one of the north’s hardest-hit towns. But the World Food Organization said troops at a checkpoint forced its trucks to unload their cargo before reaching shelters in the town. On Tuesday, COGAT — the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza — announced it allowed a new delivery of food and water to Beit Hanoun a day earlier. Again, the WFP said that while it tried to send 14 trucks, only three made it to the town 'due to delays in receiving authorization for movement and crowds along the route.' When it tried to deliver the rest on Tuesday, Israel denied it permission, it said. Aid into all of Gaza plummeted in October, when just 34,000 tons of food entered, only a third of the previous month, according to Israeli data. U.N. agencies say even less actually gets through because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and lawlessness that makes it difficult to collect and distribute aid on the Gaza side. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, and 75 a day so far in November, according to Israel’s official figures. The U.N. says it only received 39 trucks daily since the beginning of October. COGAT said 900 truckloads of aid are sitting uncollected on the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south. 'Before the organizations give out grades, they should focus on distributing the aid that awaits them,' COGAT said in response to the aid groups’ report. COGAT blamed the drop in October on closures of the crossings for the Jewish high holidays and memorials marking the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the war. An Israeli official also pointed to theft by Hamas and organized crime families in Gaza, he said. He estimated as much as 40% of aid is stolen on some days. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations. The war began last year when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s bombardment and ground invasion have killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who don’t say how many of those killed were militants. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps, with little food, water or hygiene facilities. The United States has rushed billions of dollars in military aid to Israel during the war and has shielded it from international calls for a cease-fire, while pressing it to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. The amount of aid entering Gaza increased under U.S. pressure last spring after Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers before dwindling again. Trump has promised to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how. He was a staunch defender of Israel during his previous term, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says they have spoken three times since his reelection last week. Israeli President Isaac Herzog, whose role is mostly ceremonial, is scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden on Tuesday. Former U.S. State Department official Charles Blaha, who ran the office in charge of ensuring that U.S. military support complies with U.S. and international law, predicted the Biden administration would find that Israel violated U.S. law by blocking humanitarian aid from reaching Palestinians in Gaza. 'It’s undeniable that Israel has done that,' Blaha said. 'They would really have to torture themselves to find that Israel hasn’t restricted ... assistance.' But he expected the administration to cite U.S. national security interests and waive restrictions on military support. 'If the past is prologue — no restrictions, and then kick the can down the road to the next administration.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to Europe for urgent meetings on Ukraine with NATO and European Union officials following last week’s U.S. presidential election and the return of Donald Trump to the White House in January. The State Department will hold talks in Brussels on Wednesday on how to boost support for Ukraine as President-elect Trump has suggested U.S. military assistance to the country fighting off Russia's invasion could be severely curtailed after he takes office. After less than a day in Brussels, Blinken will fly to Peru and Brazil to join outgoing President Joe Biden at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and a summit of leaders from the Group of 20 top economies.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-blinken-is-heading-to-europe-for-urgent-talks-on-ukraine-after-trumps-election/	2024-11-12T05:39:13-08:00	
Doctor accused of criticizing Russia's war in Ukraine is convicte...	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A doctor accused of criticizing the war in Ukraine in front of a patient was convicted Tuesday of spreading false information about the Russian military and sentenced to 5 1/2 years in prison, part of an unrelenting Kremlin crackdown on dissent. Dr. Nadezhda Buyanova, 68, was arrested in February after Anastasia Akinshina, the mother of one of her patients, reported the pediatrician to authorities. Akinshina alleged that Buyanova told her and her son that his father, a Russian soldier who was killed in Ukraine, was a legitimate target for Kyiv’s troops and had blamed Moscow for the war. A video of the outraged Akinshina complaining about Buyanova was widely publicized, and chief of Russia’s Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin personally demanded a criminal case be brought against the doctor. Buyanova, who was born in western Ukraine, denied the accusation, insisting she never said what she was accused of saying. In a tearful closing statement to the court last week, she had urged it to acquit her. Her defense argued that the prosecution failed to present evidence that the purported conversation took place, including any recordings of it, and alleged that her accuser fabricated the story out of animosity toward Ukrainians, according to the independent news site Mediazona, which reported all of the hearings in the trial. In her closing statement to the court, Buyanova said it was 'painful' to read the accusations in the indictment, and broke down. 'A doctor, especially a pediatrician, is not capable of wishing harm to a child, his mother, or traumatizing the child’s psyche. Only a monster is capable of this -- and of the words that I allegedly said to them,' Mediazona quoted her as saying. 'Spreading false information' about the army has been a criminal offense since March 2022, when Russia adopted a series of laws prohibiting any public expression about the invasion that deviated from the official narrative. Authorities started actively using them against critics and protesters. According to OVD-Info, one of Russia’s leading rights groups that tracks political arrests, more than 1,000 people have been implicated in criminal cases on charges related to speaking or acting out against the war.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-doctor-accused-of-criticizing-russias-war-in-ukraine-is-convicted-and-given-over-5-years-in-prison/	2024-11-12T05:36:07-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes kill 11 in Gaza, hit Beirut s...	Palestinian medical officials said two Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 14 people, including two children and a woman. The deaths came as eight international aid groups said in a report on Tuesday that Israel has failed to meet U.S. demands that it allow greater humanitarian access to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, where conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war. A late Monday strike hit a cafeteria in the so-called Muwasi humanitarian zone west of the Gaza city of Khan Younis, killing at least 11 people, including two children, according to officials at Nasser Hospital, where the casualties were taken. Another strike early Tuesday hit a house in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people including a woman, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Biden administration last month called on Israel to 'surge' more food and other emergency aid into Gaza, setting a 30-day deadline that was expiring Tuesday. It warned failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back American military support as Israel wages war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has announced some steps toward improving the situation. But in recent days, U.S. officials signaled Israel still isn’t doing enough, though they have not said if they will take action against it. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. The officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. In Lebanon, to the north, the Iran-backed militant Hezbollah group, began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,200 people have been killed and more than 14,000 wounded in Lebanon, the country's Health Ministry reported. ___ Here's the latest: A drone fired from Lebanon smashes into a nursery school near the Israeli city of Haifa; no injuries are reported TEL AVIV, Israel — A drone fired from Lebanon smashed into a nursery school near the northern Israeli city of Haifa on Tuesday morning, but no children were injured as they were inside a bomb shelter at the time of the attack. That's according to an Associated Press reporter who visited the scene. The impact scattered debris across the playground. Hezbollah launched at least four drones toward Israel during the day, the Israeli military said, with the air force intercepting some of them. The Lebanese militant group has so far not claimed responsibility for the drones fired Tuesday but has said it fired rockets into Israel. Drones have challenged Israel’s robust aerial defense systems, and many have evaded interception, causing damage and killing people, including one of the worst mass-casualty strikes in Israel during the past year of war, when four soldiers were killed and dozens wounded by a drone strike. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,200 people have been killed and more than 14,000 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reported. In Israel, 73 people have been killed and over 600 wounded by Hezbollah fire, according to the prime minister’s office. Israel announces the opening of a fifth crossing point for aid into Gaza TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military announced on Tuesday the opening of a fifth crossing for humanitarian aid into Gaza, one of key demands by the United States for Israel to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza. The crossing, across from Kibbutz Kissufim, and closest to the city of Deir al Balah in Gaza, will allow for the delivery of food, water, medical supplies, and shelter equipment to central and southern Gaza, the military said. The aid will undergo a security check at the Kerem Shalom crossing and then be brought into Gaza via the new crossing. Trucks picking up aid at Kerem Shalom have repeatedly been attacked and supplies stolen as they travel to distribution hubs inside Gaza, according to an Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military briefing rules. Israel has come under intense criticism from the aid groups and the international community for failing to allow enough aid into Gaza, creating famine conditions in the northern part of the coastal strip. Israel has announced a series of steps toward improving the situation. But U.S. officials have signaled that Israel still is not doing enough, though they have not said if they will take any action against it. —Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel; Israeli warplanes strike Beirut's southern suburbs BEIRUT — Israeli airstrikes set off large explosions on Tuesday in Beirut’s southern suburbs — an area known as Dahiyeh where Hezbollah has a significant presence — soon after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for 11 houses there. There was no immediate word on casualties. The military said the houses contained Hezbollah installations, but the claim could not be independently confirmed. Late Monday night, a strike hit the village of Ain Yaacoub in northern Lebanon, killing at least 16 people, the Lebanese civil defense said. Four of the killed were Syrian refugees, and there were another 10 people wounded. There was no Israeli military comment on the strike. Israel has been carrying out intensified bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and put a stop to more than year of cross-border fire by the Lebanese militant group onto northern Israel. Israel's military says it delivered aid to northern Gaza on a US-imposed deadline TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said on Tuesday that hundreds of packages of food and water were brought to a besieged area in northern Gaza where the military has been carrying out a concentrated operation since October. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza said aid trucks were brought to the areas of Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, where the military has carried out an intense operation since Oct. 6. On Monday night, the Israeli security Cabinet approved more aid for Gaza, which will increase the number of trucks that enter the battered enclave each day, according to an official familiar with the matter. At least 700 Palestinians have been killed in northern Gaza since the operation began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and tens of thousands have been displaced. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its counts. An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military briefing rules, said the army estimates there are approximately 5,000–10,000 Palestinians still living in northern Gaza. The aid was delivered on a U.S.-imposed deadline that called on Israel to 'surge' more food and other emergency aid into Gaza. It warned that failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back military support as Israel wages war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Aid groups have accused Israel of falling short on aid distribution, especially in northern Gaza. —Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel; Israel denied or impeded 85% of aid convoys to northern Gaza last month, UN says UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. humanitarian office says 85% of its attempts to coordinate aid convoys and humanitarian visits to northern Gaza — where hunger is acute and Israel is carrying out a major offensive — were denied or impeded last month. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs made 98 requests to Israeli authorities for authorization to go through the checkpoint along Wadi Gaza but only 15 made it, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday. The humanitarian office, known as OCHA, 'is worried about the fate of Palestinians remaining in North Gaza, as the siege there continues, and urgently calls on Israel to open up the area to humanitarian operations at the scale needed, given the massive needs.' Dujarric said. In a new report published Monday, OCHA said humanitarian organizations submitted 50 requests to the Israeli authorities to enter North Gaza governorate in October and 33 were rejected while eight were accepted but faced impediments including delays that prevented their completion, he said. Over the past three days, Dujarric said, teams from OCHA, the U.N. human rights and de-mining agencies and other humanitarian groups visited nine sites in Gaza City to assess the needs of hundreds of displaced families, many from North Gaza. The teams say that some were in shelters, abandoned homes, destroyed clinic and some were sleeping in the streets or open fields where they feared stray dogs at night, Dujarric said. In a severely damaged structure, the team found more than a dozen families — including people with disabilities and some in urgent need of medical care — sheltering in the basement which had no electricity and was full of sewage, he said,. ___ For more Middle East news:	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-strikes-kill-11-in-gaza-as-us-deadline-to-israel-to-surge-aid-expires/	2024-11-12T05:33:29-08:00	
North Korea ratifies major defense treaty with Russia	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea ratified a major defense treaty with Russia stipulating mutual military aid, the North’s state media reported Tuesday, as the U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Russia had completed the ratification of the treaty last week after it was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. It is considered both countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership treaty will take effect when both sides exchange documents on the ratification, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said. North Korea ratified the treaty through a decree signed Monday by the country's president of state affairs, KCNA said, using one of Kim's titles. North Korea’s rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People’s Assembly, has the right to ratify treaties but Kim can unilaterally ratify major ones, according to South Korea’s Unification Ministry. The treaty requires both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. It also calls for the two countries to actively cooperate in efforts to establish a 'just and multipolar new world order' and strengthen cooperation on various sectors including peaceful atomic energy, space, food supply, trade and economy. Some observers speculate the treaty’s ratification in both countries could signal North Korea could formally enter the Russia-Ukraine war soon. According to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments, up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia likely as part of the June treaty. Last week, Ukrainian officials said Ukraine and North Korean troops engaged in small-scale fighting while Ukraine’s army fired artillery at North Korean soldiers in Russia’s Kursk border region. North Korea’s troop dispatch threatens to escalate the almost three-year war. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners also worry about what Russia could give North Korea in return. Possible Russian transfer of sensitive technology to enhance North Korea’s already-advancing nuclear and missile programs would be an alarming development for the U.S. and its allies. North Korea and Russia have been significantly strengthening their military and other cooperation. South Korea’s spy agency said last month that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-north-korea-ratifies-major-defense-treaty-with-russia/	2024-11-11T19:20:23-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli minister reports some progress toward...	Israel’s new foreign minister said Monday that there has been 'certain progress' in efforts to end the fighting with Lebanon’s Hezbollah. But a spokesman for the militant group said it had not received any official proposal and was prepared to wage a long war if needed. The Biden administration has spent months trying to broker a cease-fire, and there were reports that U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein might return to the region in the coming days. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said any agreement would have to include enforcement mechanisms to prevent Hezbollah from reconstituting its military infrastructure near the border. 'There is certain progress on the issue. We are working with the Americans,' he told reporters. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

A senior Israeli diplomat meets with top U.S. officials in Washington as Lebanon cease-fire efforts appear to gain momentum WASHINGTON — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s top strategic adviser met with U.S. officials on Monday in Washington. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer was meeting Monday with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the State Department said. He also met White House senior advisers Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk at the White House, according to a U.S. official. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, said that Dermer is also expected to meet on Tuesday with national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Dermer is also expected to meet with Trump officials during his time in the U.S. Earlier Monday, Israel’s new foreign minister told reporters there has been 'certain progress' in cease-fire efforts with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Dermer is a close confidant of Netanyahu and last week traveled to Russia as part of cease-fire efforts, said an official familiar with the matter. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes diplomacy, said Dermer is trying to rally Russian support for enforcing a cease-fire by helping ensure that Iran will no longer smuggle weapons to Hezbollah through Syria, which is a Russian ally. ___ Aamer Madhani in Washington and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed. UN peacekeeping chief will travel to Lebanon UNITED NATIONS – The U.N. peacekeeping chief is heading to Lebanon for a three-day visit to support peacekeepers on the front line monitoring the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict and to amplify U.N. calls for de-escalation and a cease-fire. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Monday that’s the message Undersecretary-General Jean-Pierre Lacroix will be delivering starting on Tuesday when he arrives in Lebanon. In Beirut, Lacroix is scheduled to meet with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati; Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, the caretaker foreign and defense ministers, armed forces chief and the diplomatic corps, Dujarric said. Lacroix is also scheduled to visit the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Naqoura in southern Lebanon and front-line positions along the U.N.-drawn boundary between Lebanon and Israel to meet peacekeepers and 'thank them for their dedication in carrying out their work under extremely difficult conditions.' Dujarric said. The force, known as UNIFIL, has continued to monitor the escalating conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah across the boundary known as the Blue Line despite Israeli calls for peacekeepers to pull back 5 kilometers (3 miles) for their safety. UNIFIL has accused Israel of deliberately destroying observation equipment, and a number of peacekeepers have been injured in the military action. Israeli strike in northern Lebanon kills at least 8, health officials say BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike destroyed a home in northern Lebanon on Monday, killing at least eight people and wounding 14 others, the Health Ministry said. Rescue teams scrambled to pull survivors from under the rubble, Lebanon’s state media said, and video widely circulated on social media showed the Lebanese Red Cross moving corpses encased in body bags. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike and the target was not clear. The strike hit the village of Ain Yaaqoub in the northern Akkar region, which is home to Greek Orthodox and Sunni Muslim communities and is far from the Hezbollah militant group’s main areas of influence in the south and east. Israel has struck deeper into Lebanon since its military escalation and ground invasion against Hezbollah in late September. Israel's first strike in the Akkar region was on Nov. 2 and targeted a bridge near a Lebanese army checkpoint, cutting a key road leading to Syria. On Monday, another Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in southern Lebanon, killing seven people and wounding seven others, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Israel's military said 190 rockets were fired from Lebanon on Monday, with rescue services saying at least five people were injured. Israeli minister says he will push to annex parts of the occupied West Bank once Trump takes office RAMALLAH, West Bank — Israel’s finance minister says he will push for Israel to annex parts of the occupied West Bank after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Bezalel Smotrich said in a speech Monday that he will push 'for the inclusion of Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,' using the biblical term for the territory. '2025 will be the year ... of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,' he added. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has built scores of settlements to cement its control over the area. But it has never annexed the territory, which is home to 3 million Palestinians who live under military rule. The Palestinians seek the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and Gaza, for an independent state. The international community overwhelmingly considers the settlements, where some 500,000 Israelis live, to be illegal and obstacles to peace. Smotrich, along with other settler leaders, are counting on Trump to resume the pro-settler positions he took during his first term as president. During the first Trump administration, the U.S. reversed longstanding U.S. policy and said settlements do not violate international law. Trump's secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, made an unprecedented visit to a Jewish settlement. Lebanon death toll jumps to more than 3,240 people, Health Ministry says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry said Monday that 54 people were killed and 56 wounded on Sunday, raising the total toll from a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 3,243 killed and 14,134 wounded. One-quarter of them were women and children, the ministry said, with 2,325 men, 634 women and 201 children killed since the Israel-Hezbollah war began 13 months ago. Before the war intensified on Sept. 23, Hezbollah had said that nearly 500 of its members were killed but the group has stopped updating its death toll since. On Monday, an Israeli airstrike on a residential building in Al-Saksakiyeh town in Sidon province, South Lebanon, killed seven people and wounded seven others, the Health Ministry said. Most of those casualties were women and children, Lebanon’s state media said, adding that rescue teams were still searching for more missing people under the rubble. In the health care sector, the ministry said that 191 health workers have been killed, 308 wounded and 244 medical vehicles damaged since Oct. 8, 2023. Additionally, 88 medical and ambulatory centers have been affected, along with 65 hospitals. Israel says 190 rockets were fired from Lebanon, with reports that nearly half targeted the area around Haifa TEL AVIV — Israel’s military said at least 190 rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel on Monday, just as the country’s new foreign minister said efforts to reach a cease-fire deal with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah were moving forward. At least 90 rockets were fired toward Haifa, one of the largest barrages towards the northern port city since the war began last year, according to Israeli media. Israel’s rescue services said four people were wounded in the area around Haifa, and another person earlier in the day. Israel's military said most of the rockets were intercepted, without elaborating. The volley came the same day Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said 'certain progress' was being made toward a U.S.-brokered cease-fire with Lebanon’s Hezbollah. The group's leader has said it had not received a proposal and is prepared to keep fighting. Hezbollah did not immediately claim the volley on Monday evening, but said it was responsible for two rocket attacks in the afternoon it said targeted Israeli military bases near Haifa. Israel said its forces had targeted the Hezbollah launchers responsible for the attack. Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel's foreign minister isn't worried over US deadline for increased aid to Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel’s new foreign minister appeared to downplay a looming U.S. deadline for increased aid to Gaza, saying he was confident 'the issue would be solved.' The Biden administration warned Israel last month to increase the amount of food and other urgently needed aid entering Gaza to 350 trucks per day or risk a scaling back of American military support. It set a 30-day deadline that expires this week. The amount of aid entering the war-ravaged territory plummeted in October to its lowest level since the first month of the war, with an average of 57 trucks entering each day, according to Israeli figures. U.N. agencies say even less is actually being distributed because Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and lawlessness often prevent them from retrieving the aid on the Gaza side of the border. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday that he was 'sure we can also reach understanding with our American friends and that issue will be solved.' U.S. President Joe Biden may have less leverage over Israel as it awaits Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January. Trump was a staunch supporter of Israel during his previous term. He has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how. Lebanon's caretaker prime minister calls for a cease-fire along the border with Israel BEIRUT — Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Monday called for an immediate cease-fire along the Lebanon-Israel border, saying the war has had devastating effects on the small nation. Mikati called for the implementation of a U.N. resolution that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war in the summer of 2006, and the deployment of Lebanese troops along the border with Israel in coordination with U.N. peacekeepers. Mikati spoke at the opening session of the Arab-Islamic summit in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. He said the war has caused 'unprecedented losses' with more than 3,000 people dead, including 775 women and children. He said the war also had caused $8.5 billion in losses, including $3.4 billion caused by the destruction or damage of about 100,000 housing units in different parts of the country. 'No state can take the burden of this huge destruction,' Mikati said, adding that Beirut is about to set up a fund that will be funded by friendly states for the reconstruction process. He said the fund will be under international supervision and subject to international auditing. Mikati urged other nations to support the Lebanese state rather than the country’s political factions. Saudi Arabia hosts a summit to discuss Mideast wars RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Saudi Arabia on Monday hosted a summit over the ongoing Mideast wars. Speaking before leaders, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom renewed 'its condemnation and categorical rejection of the genocide committed by Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people, which has claimed the lives of 150,000 martyrs, wounded and missing, most of whom are women and children.' 'We affirm that Israel’s continued crimes against innocent people, its persistence in violating the sanctity of the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque, and its detraction from the pivotal role of the Palestinian National Authority in all Palestinian territories will undermine the efforts aimed at obtaining the Palestinian people’s legitimate rights and establishing peace in the region,' he added. The summit is a follow-up from the 2023 Arab-Islamic Summit. The new Israeli foreign minister says there's ‘certain progress’ in efforts to end war with Hezbollah JERUSALEM — Israel’s new foreign minister says there has been 'certain progress' in efforts to end the fighting with Lebanon’s Hezbollah. But a spokesman for the militant group said Monday that it had not received any official proposal and was prepared to wage a long war if needed. The Biden administration has spent months trying to broker a cease-fire, and there were reports that U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein might return to the region in the coming days. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said any agreement would have to include enforcement mechanisms to prevent Hezbollah from reconstituting its military infrastructure near the border. 'There is certain progress on the issue. We are working with the Americans,' he told reporters. 'The most important thing will not (be) the words but the enforcement,' he said, adding that if any agreement is breached, Israel 'will act immediately, militarily.' The U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war required both Hezbollah and Israeli forces to withdraw from a buffer zone in southern Lebanon that was to be patrolled by U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army. Israel says Hezbollah maintained a military presence right up to the border, while Lebanon accused Israel of violating other terms of the resolution. Lebanese officials are opposed to any changes to the resolution. In Beirut, Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Afif said the group has enough weapons and supplies to fight a long war with Israel. He said Israeli forces had failed to hold territory six weeks into their ground invasion, pointing to what he said was a failed Israeli attempt last week to enter the southern town of Khiyam. 'As long as you are not able to control areas in the field you will not achieve your political goals,' Afif said. He also denied claims by Israeli officials that Hezbollah has lost most of its missile capabilities, pointing to the fact that it is still launching dozens of projectiles a day and targeting areas in central Israel. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, and drawing retaliatory strikes, the day after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. All-out war erupted in September, when Israel carried out a wave of heavy airstrikes and killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. An Israeli strike closes Syria’s main north-south highway DAMASCUS, Syria — Israel’s air force attacked an aid convoy and forced the closure of Syria’s main north-south highway, Syria state media reported. There was no immediate word on casualties from Monday’s strike, and state TV did not provide details about the convoy. Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria in recent years. Israeli officials rarely acknowledge them, but say Israel is determined to disrupt arms shipments to Lebanon’s Hezbollah and to prevent Iran from developing military infrastructure near its borders. Monday’s airstrike occurred in Shamsin, around 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the border with Lebanon. People often gather there after fleeing the war, state TV said. It said the strike forced the closure of the M5 highway that links the capital, Damascus, with the northern city of Aleppo. On Sunday, an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in the Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab. The Syrian Defense Ministry said seven civilians were killed. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor linked to the Syrian opposition, suggested that Hezbollah was targeted. UN says more than 200 children have been killed in war in Lebanon BEIRUT — The United Nations children’s agency says the war between Israel and Hezbollah has killed more than 200 children in Lebanon. They include seven children who were among 23 people killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Lebanon on Sunday. UNICEF said protecting children from harm during war is a legal obligation and called for a cease-fire. Lebanon’s Health Ministry says at least 3,189 people have been killed and over 14,000 wounded in Lebanon in more than a year of conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. Some 1.2 million people have been displaced. On the Israeli side, 68 soldiers and 41 civilians have been killed in the fighting since October 2023, according to the prime minister’s office. More than 60,000 people have been displaced from their homes. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, and drawing retaliatory strikes, the day after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies backed by Iran. Hezbollah acknowledged the killing of nearly 500 of its fighters in the first 11 months of the conflict but stopped updating that toll after all-out war erupted in September. Yemen's Houthi rebels say they launched a missile targeting Israel DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Monday claimed they launched a missile targeting Israel. Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree made the claim in a prerecorded video message, claiming that the rebels launched a Palestine-2 ballistic missile he described as a 'hypersonic' toward a military base. The Israeli military said it 'intercepted one projectile that approached Israel from the direction of Yemen.' The Israelis also said the fire did not enter Israeli territory. The Houthis have launched missiles and targeted ships through the Red Sea corridor over the ongoing Mideast wars. The rebels separately said sites in the country came under attack in likely U.S. airstrikes early Monday morning, something not immediately acknowledged by the Americans. Senior UAE diplomat calls for de-escalation in Mideast wars DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A senior diplomat for the United Arab Emirates called on the world to focus on the plight of civilians and de-escalate the ongoing Mideast wars. Anwar Gargash’s remarks Monday, made at the Abu Dhabi Strategic Debate, followed the pattern of comments made by the UAE amid the Mideast wars. The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms home to Dubai, diplomatically recognized Israel in 2020. 'The complexities of the region require a steady hand and a clear and consistent vision,' Gargash said. 'The recent cycle of escalation between Israel and Iran cannot become a permanent feature of the strategic landscape of our region. This must be addressed through a political framework.' He called for 'pragmatism' and a 'serious political horizon' to resolve the wider Israeli-Palestinian conflict and reach a two-state solution. He described the war in the Gaza Strip as being 'driven by extremists on both sides, from the Israeli and Arab side.' Yet he also called the 'systemic violence' faced by Palestinians in Gaza 'criminal and unacceptable.' He added: 'At the present time, it is vital to identify that not all crises stem from the Palestinian issue, yet it undeniably remains central to the conflict in our region.' The UAE has provided aid for both the Gaza Strip and Lebanon in the wars, while maintaining its diplomatic ties with Israel. The UAE has, however, strenuously criticized Israel’s conduct at times in public in the wars. Gargash also offered criticism of governance in both the Palestinian territories and Lebanon. 'In both Palestine and Lebanon, a drastic reform is essential for the world to step in and provide considerable support,' Gargash said. ___ For more Middle East news:	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-strike-kills-3-people-in-central-gaza-palestinian-officials-say/	2024-11-11T17:00:50-08:00	
Israeli strikes kill dozens in Lebanon and isolated northern Gaza...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes killed dozens of people including children on Sunday in Lebanon and isolated northern Gaza, as the world watched for signs of how the U.S. election might affect the wars between Israel and Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he has spoken three times with Donald Trump since Tuesday’s election and they 'see eye-to-eye regarding the Iranian threat and all of its components.' Israeli President Isaac Herzog is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday. The Israeli airstrike in Lebanon killed at least 23 people, including seven children, in Aalmat village north of Beirut, far from the areas in the east and south where Hezbollah has a major presence. There was no Israeli evacuation warning. Israel’s military said that it hit a Hezbollah site used to store weapons, and the strike was under review. Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel after war broke out in Gaza, in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas. Israel retaliated, and a series of escalations have led to all-out war. In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people, including nine women, according to Dr. Fadel Naim, director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City. Israel's military said that it targeted a site where militants were operating, without providing evidence. It said the details of the strike were under review. A separate strike hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense first responders who operate under the government. Israel strikes deeper into Lebanon Israel has struck deeper inside Lebanon since September, when it killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire from northern to central Israel. The fighting has killed more than 3,100 people in Lebanon, according to the Health Ministry, and more than 70 people in Israel. After Israel's strike in Aalmat, around 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Beirut, legislator Raed Berro denied that any Hezbollah personnel or assets were in the building hit. 'Everyone can see, in front of cameras, that what is being pulled from under the rubble are women, children and elderly people who have nothing to do with weapons or rocket warehouses,' Berro said. Hassan Ghaddaf, who lived next door and was slightly wounded while heading to his balcony with morning coffee, said displaced people were in the building. 'I had seen them and got to know them the other day,' Ghaddaf said. 'They were peaceful. On the contrary, they had someone from the Lebanese Internal Security Forces that works for the state, and we saw their garb and clothes in the rubble.' In Syria, an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in the Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab, and the Defense Ministry said that seven civilians were killed, state news agency SANA reported. Britain-based opposition war monitor The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights suggested that Hezbollah was targeted. Israel didn't immediately comment. Fears of famine in northern Gaza The mid-month deadline is approaching for the Biden administration's ultimatum for Israel: Allow more aid into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby northern Gaza towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Experts from a panel that monitors food security say famine is imminent or may already be happening. The northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, has suffered the heaviest destruction of the 13-month war. Israel has sent forces back in, saying Hamas has regrouped. Israeli strikes often kill women and children. The military says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians. Also on Sunday, Israel's military released what it called footage of Hamas abusing detainees. The soundless footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, appears to show hooded detainees chained in stress positions. In some clips, men beat or poke them with batons. It wasn't possible to independently verify the videos, which the military said that it recovered during operations in Gaza. Rights groups have long accused the Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank of abusing detainees and violently quashing dissent. Israel has been accused of similar abuses, especially since the start of the war. Israeli prison authorities say they follow relevant laws and investigate allegations of wrongdoing. The toll of war The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities who don't distinguish between civilians and militants in their count, but say more than half the dead were women and children. Israeli bombardment and ground invasions have left vast areas of Gaza in ruins and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands live in tent camps with few if any services. Cease-fire talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled, as have parallel efforts by the U.S. and others to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, said Saturday that it had suspended its efforts and would resume them when 'the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war.' Some Palestinians in Gaza responded with frustration. 'The Arab silence that controls the Arab capitals, that’s because of the fear of the American administration and Israel,' said Akram Jarada, displaced from Gaza City. ___ Samy Magdy reported from Cairo and Chehayeb from Beirut.

Drones strike Moscow as top UK official highlights Russian casual...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A massive drone strike rattled Moscow and its suburbs overnight into Sunday, injuring several people and temporarily halting traffic at some of Russia's busiest airports, officials reported. Meanwhile, a huge nighttime wave of Russian drones targeted Ukraine. This came after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a pact with North Korea Saturday night, obliging the two countries to provide immediate military aid using 'all means' if either is attacked. The agreement marks the strongest link between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War. Earlier this week, Ukraine reported that its troops engaged for the first time with North Korean units. U.S. officials earlier confirmed the deployment of at least 3,000 North Korean troops to Russia, while Kyiv has repeatedly said the number is far higher. This has fueled concerns of a marked escalation in Moscow's war on Ukraine, and tensions spilling over into the Asia-Pacific. U.K. estimates Russian troop losses at 700,000 Both Moscow and Kyiv have kept a tight lid on casualty figures since the start of the full-scale war despite regular reports of Russian forces taking huge losses following 'human wave' attacks that aim to exhaust Ukrainian defenses. However, the chief of the U.K. defense staff, Tony Radakin, told the BBC that Russian forces had suffered their worst month of casualties in October since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He said Moscow’s troops suffered an average of 1,500 dead and wounded per day, bringing their total losses in the war to 700,000. According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying 'an extraordinary price' for the war, even as a grueling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine’s industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how U.K. officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures. 'There is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,' he said. But he added that they were 'tiny increments of land,' and Moscow’s mounting defense and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country. Radakin insisted that Ukraine’s Western partners should stand by it for 'as long as it takes' to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have signaled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace. Russia is cautiously optimistic about Trump’s forthcoming presidency On Sunday, the Kremlin’s official spokesman voiced cautious optimism about Trump’s upcoming presidency, saying: 'At least he talks about peace. … He does not talk about confrontation.' 'The signals are positive. Trump, during his election campaign, said that he perceives everything through deals, that he can make deals that will lead everyone toward peace,' Dmitry Peskov told reporters at a briefing. 'He does not talk about a desire to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, and this favorably distinguishes him from the current (U.S.) administration,' Peskov said. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday insisted that 'strong decisions' from Kyiv’s Western partners are needed to stop the 'terror' of Russian drone and missile strikes, and secure 'reliable peace' for Ukraine. 'The killing of children, the loss of family members cannot simply be forgotten,' Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. 'Without strong decisions, there is no security from terror, and this is equally clear in every country. There is no reliable peace without justice,' he said. Continuing fighting causes damage and casualties on both sides Fierce fighting has continued near the eastern Ukrainian cities of Toretsk and Kurakhove, Ukraine’s General Staff reported Sunday. Between 700 and 1,000 residents remain in Kurakhove, a front-line city surrounded on three sides and battered into ruin. Most of them live underground with no running water, heating or electricity. Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said a total of 84 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight in Russian territory, following what it called a 'mass strike on civilian infrastructure.' A man died under rubble after drones struck his apartment block in Russia’s Belgorod region, just kilometers from the Ukrainian border, local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported. Five other people were injured in the Moscow suburb of Ramenskoe and a nearby village, according to local officials. Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram carried eyewitness reports of drone debris setting fire to suburban homes. Russia's aviation authority said flights were briefly grounded at major international airports including Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo. At least 14 flights bound for Moscow were rerouted to Nizhnyi Novgorod, a city over 490 kilometers (300 miles) east, airport representatives there reported. Ukraine’s General Staff claimed on Sunday that Ukrainian drones caused a fire at an arms depot in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine and Belarus. The online update featured a photo showing thick plumes of reddish smoke rising into the night sky. The AP could not verify the circumstances in which it was taken, and there was no immediate comment from Russia. Separately, Russia’s emergencies ministry on Sunday said that a major fire broke out at a warehouse outside of Moscow. There were no immediate reports of casualties, and it was not clear whether the blaze was linked to the Ukrainian drone strikes. Russia overnight launched a 'record' 145 drones at Ukrainian territory, according to Ukraine’s air force, 62 of which were shot down. A further 67 were 'lost,' the air force said, a likely reference to electronic jamming that caused the drones to veer off course. At least one person was injured as Russian drones struck residential areas in Ukraine’s southern port of Odesa, local Gov. Oleh Kiper reported. And at least five civilians, including a 17-year-old girl and 10-year-old boy, were injured by falling drone debris and shelling in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region Sunday, its Gov. Oleh Syniehubov and local prosecutors said. Russia later on Sunday said that it had struck a large deployment of Ukrainian soldiers in the Kharkiv province with thermobaric rockets, but didn't immediately provide evidence. ___ Joanna Kozlowska reported from London. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-drones-strike-moscow-as-top-uk-official-highlights-russian-casualties-in-ukraine/	2024-11-10T09:26:34-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli defense minister officially steps dow...	Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant officially stepped down Friday in a ceremony that replaced him with Israel Katz, the former foreign minister, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired Gallant earlier this week. Israel has been rocked by Gallant’s dismissal, with the news setting off mass protests across the country. Many in Israel view Gallant as the sole moderate voice in a far-right government, and see his removal as a sign that the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu has lost interest in returning hostages still held in Gaza. Israel Katz, his replacement, currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. Also Friday, the Israeli military body handling aid to Gaza, COGAT, said it is preparing to open a new aid crossing into Gaza as the deadline for a U.S. deadline to increase desperately-needed aid into the war-ravaged territory approaches. But the body did not say when the crossing will open nor if aid will be delivered to north of Gaza, where the UN and aid groups say the humanitarian situation is most dire. The United Nations humanitarian office says Israel's monthlong offensive in northern Gaza is preventing the estimated 75,000 to 95,000 Palestinians in the north from receiving essential items for their survival. On Thursday, the Israeli military says it will allow 300 truckloads of humanitarian aid supplied by the United Arab Emirates to enter the Gaza Strip in the coming days. That’s less than the 350 trucks per day that the United States said it wants to see enter the war-ravaged territory. The Israel-Hamas war began after militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,100 people have been killed and some 13,800 wounded in Lebanon, the health ministry reported. ___ Here’s the latest: UN analysis finds 70% of Gaza deaths were women and children GENEVA — The U.N. human rights office released a report Friday that found that 70% of verified war deaths in the Gaza Strip were women and children. The agency examined 8,119 Palestinian deaths between Oct. 7, 2023, and Sept. 2, 2024, including 2,036 women and 3,588 children. Most died in attacks that killed five or more people and about 80% were in residential buildings, the report said. It blamed the Israeli military’s 'use of weapons with wide area effects in densely-populated areas,' though some of the deaths may also have been caused by rockets fired by Palestinian militant groups in Gaza that fell short. The youngest death was a 1-year-old boy and the oldest a 97-year-old woman. Most of the children were 5 to 9 years old. According to Gaza's health ministry, the overall death toll is over 43,500. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. 'Our monitoring indicates that this unprecedented level of killing and injury of civilians is a direct consequence of the failure to comply with fundamental principles of international humanitarian law,' U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk said. Israel’s diplomatic mission in Geneva said it 'categorically rejects' the report and accused the U.N. human rights office of disregarding the impact of activities of the militant group Hamas on civilians in Gaza. The mission also accused the agency of relying on 'unverified information.' The report comes as two world courts examine charges of war crimes against Israel. It also says Hamas and other militant groups 'committed serious violations of international law' when they stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Netanyahu appoints aide as new Israeli ambassador to the US JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday he was appointing Yechiel Leiter as Israel’s new ambassador to the U.S. U.S.-born Leiter will replace ambassador Michael Herzog, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Leiter has been a close aide to Netanyahu and was formerly the deputy director general of Israel’s education ministry and chief of staff to the minister of finance. His son was killed while fighting in Gaza in November. Netanyahu said Leiter was a 'highly talented diplomat, an eloquent speaker,' with a 'deep understanding of American culture and politics.' Leiter has been a senior fellow at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a conservative Jerusalem think tank. He lives in the settlement of Eli in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel prepares to open new aid crossing into Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel says it is preparing to open a new aid crossing into Gaza as the deadline for a U.S. deadline to increase desperately-needed aid into the war-ravaged territory approaches. The Israeli military body handling aid to Gaza, COGAT, said it has built inspection facilities and paved roads around the Kissufim crossing, located near the center of the Gaza. It says food, aid, and fuel will soon be able to be delivered through the crossing, but did not say when it will open nor if aid will be delivered to north of Gaza, where the UN and aid groups say the humanitarian situation is most dire. Since Israeli forces unleashed a fierce offensive on north Gaza in early October, no aid has made it to the northernmost reaches of the territory, where the UN says roughly 70,000 Palestinians still remain. The opening of the crossing likely reflects an Israeli desire to ramp up aid ahead of a US-imposed deadline. In an Oct. 13 letter sent to Israeli officials, US officials said Israel had 30 days to increase the daily number of aid trucks entering the Gaza Strip to 350 or risk the US reconsidering arms shipments to Israel -- which have been key to Israel’s war against Hamas militants in Gaza. Israel has so far fallen far short of this benchmark, with COGAT figures showing an average of 57 trucks a day entering Gaza. In the first seven days of November, the average has been 81. Israeli defense minister officially steps down JERUSALEM — Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant officially stepped down Friday in a ceremony that replaced him with Israel Katz, the former Foreign Minister, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Gallant earlier this week. Israel has been rocked by Gallant’s firing, with the news setting off mass protests across the country. Many in Israel view Gallant as the sole moderate voice in a far-right government, and see his dismissal as a sign that the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu has lost interest in returning hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas militants. Gallant thanked the military and warned that the war’s 'mission is not yet complete; we must meet our moral and traditional obligation, and the war’s objective is to bring home the remaining 101 hostages who haven’t yet seen their families and homes.' Israel Katz, his replacement, currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. Katz thanked Gallant and said the war’s objectives were to 'stop Iranian aggression and deny its capabilities, continue dismantling Hamas as a governing and military force, and defeat Hezbollah.' He added that returning the hostages was a top 'moral priority.' 'Yoav, we were friends and will remain friends because we believe in the same things that will secure Israel’s security and future, the Jewish state,' he said. 'I promise that the entire State of Israel will emerge from this war and from the pain to much higher places.' Turkey's Erdogan hopes Trump will fulfil promises to end Middle East conflicts ANKARA, Turkey - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he hopes US President-Elect Donald Trump will fulfil promises to end the conflict in the Middle East and tell Israel to 'stop' its aggression. Speaking to a group of journalists on a return flight from Hungary, Erdogan also said that cutting off U.S. arms support to Israel 'would be a good start' toward ending the conflict in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. 'We want that promise to be fulfilled and for Israel to be told to ‘stop,’' Hurriyet newspaper and other media quoted Erdogan as saying on Friday. Erdogan also called on Trump to abandon what he said were the Biden administration’s 'erroneous policies.' 'We expect my dear friend Trump to abandon the erroneous policies of the former administration during his second term as president,' Erdogan said in a televised address. 'We sincerely believed that the president will do his part to end the wars.' Turkey has become one of Israel’s most vocal critics, accusing the country of committing genocide in Gaza and strongly criticizing Western nations for backing Israel. ___ For more Middle East news:	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israeli-defense-minister-officially-steps-down/	2024-11-08T08:41:40-08:00	
Hungary's leader Orbán predicts Trump will end support for Ukrain...	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Donald Trump's biggest European fan, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, predicted on Friday that a new U.S. administration under Trump will cease providing support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia's full-scale invasion. Orbán's comments were a signal that Trump's recent election could drive a wedge among European Union leaders on the question of the war. Hungary's leader hosted the second of two days of summits on Friday in the capital, Budapest, just days after Trump's election victory. The war in Ukraine was high on the agenda for the gathering of the EU's 27 leaders, most of whom believe continuing to supply Kyiv with weapons and financial assistance are key elements for the continent's security. The nationalist Hungarian leader has long sought to undermine EU support for Ukraine, and routinely blocked, delayed or watered down the bloc’s efforts to provide weapons and funding and to sanction Moscow for its invasion. He has sought to use the summits to make his case to other leaders that they should rethink their commitments to the war-ravaged country. In comments to state radio before Friday's summit, Orbán, who is considered close to both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, reiterated his long-held position that an immediate cease-fire should be declared, and suggested that Ukraine has already lost its fight. 'The situation on the front is obvious, there’s been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war,' Orbán said. The Hungarian leader has cast himself as the exemplar of some in the EU who are skeptical of providing indefinite support to Ukraine, especially in light of uncertainty over whether U.S. assistance could evaporate under Trump. He said Friday that Trump's reelection had created a 'new situation' for Europe, and that the continent 'cannot finance this war alone.' But numerous EU leaders made a point to downplay the risk of a shift in U.S. policies drifting across the Atlantic into European capitals. Arriving at the summit, the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said a new U.S. administration wouldn't lead Europe to change course. 'We cannot outsource our capacity of action. Whatever happens in the U.S., we have our interests, we have our values,' Borrell said. Italy’s hard-right leader, Premier Giorgia Meloni, who is aligned with Orbán on many issues but breaks with him sharply on Russia’s war, said: 'As long is there is a war, Italy is on the side of Ukraine.' Western support is crucial for Kyiv to sustain the costly war of attrition, but Trump's repeated statements criticizing U.S. aid, and his claims that he could bring the conflict to a rapid end, have led to uncertainty over how long the help will continue. At a gathering on Thursday of European leaders in Budapest, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy objected to Trump’s claim that Russia’s war with Ukraine could be ended in a day, something he and his European backers fear would mean peace on terms favorable to Putin and involving the surrender of territory. 'If it is going to be very fast, it will be a loss for Ukraine,' Zelenskyy said. Despite Orbán's attempts to throttle aid packages, EU leaders have largely found workaround solutions to any obstruction to providing Zelenskyy with assistance, and have been able to signal their commitment to supporting Ukraine in its fight, regardless of who occupies the White House. Closing out the summit on Friday, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said the EU would 'discuss with our American friends also the fact that Russia is not only a threat to Europe, but a threat to the global security as a whole' in an effort to dissuade a new Trump administration from abandoning aid to Ukraine. 'We see that technology from China and Iran is used by Russia on the battlefield,' she continued. 'It shows that the security of the Indo-Pacific and Europe are interconnected, and so are the European and the United States interests in this course.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-hungarys-orban-predicts-trumps-administration-will-end-us-support-for-ukraine/	2024-11-08T08:19:47-08:00	
Russia blasts Ukraine with more aerial attacks as part of an inte...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian missiles, bombs and drones battered three regions of Ukraine in targeted nighttime attacks, officials said Friday, as Russia mounts an intensified aerial campaign that Ukrainian officials say they need more Western help to counter — even as doubts deepen over what Kyiv can expect from a new U.S. administration. Since the war began almost three years ago following Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor, the Russian military has repeatedly used its superior air power to blast civilian targets across Ukraine. More than 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the conflict, according to the United Nations. A 500-kilogram (about 1,000 pounds) glide bomb severely damaged a high-rise apartment building in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, in the middle of the night, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. At least 25 people, including an infant, were injured, he said. Glide bombs, for which Ukraine has no effective countermeasure, obliterate their targets, sending out a powerful shock wave and often leaving a wide crater. In the southern city of Odesa, a Russian drone attack killed one person and injured nine others overnight, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said. In the capital Kyiv, falling wreckage from intercepted missiles injured four people, regional Gov. Ruslan Kravchenko said. In total, Russia fired 92 drones and five missiles at Ukraine during the night, Ukraine’s air force said. Four missiles and 62 drones were intercepted, and 26 drones were jammed electronically, it claimed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country needs more help to fight back against Russia’s military might, even as uncertainty deepens about what Western aid Ukraine can expect after Donald Trump was elected this week as the next U.S. president. 'It is important to act together and decisively at the international level every time Russia tries to destroy our lives,' Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. 'This is the only way to achieve a just peace and stop the deaths of our people.' Russia launched about 2,000 drones at Ukraine in October, about one-third more than the previous month, making it the third month in a row that there was a significant rise, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Friday. Russian fire rates have climbed since the middle of the year, it said, adding that the latest high monthly numbers will likely become the norm. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-blasts-ukraine-with-more-aerial-attacks-as-part-of-an-intensified-campaign/	2024-11-08T03:03:34-08:00
