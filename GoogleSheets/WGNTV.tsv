Jeffries amps up call for two-state solution after Trump push to ...	House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday flatly rejected President Trump’s proposal for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip, suggesting it would undermine ongoing efforts to free Israeli hostages and bring peace to the volatile region. The Democratic leader instead promoted more aid for Palestinians in Gaza and amplified his previous calls for a two-state peace deal — two facets of the multipronged strategy advanced by former President Biden throughout Israel’s war with Hamas. 'I strongly support the Biden peace plan, and we need to make sure that it is fully implemented with respect to surging humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza; making sure every single hostage is brought back home; and a foundation is laid to create a just and lasting peace,' Jeffries said. 'I support a two-state solution,' he added, 'which is a safe and secure Israel as a Jewish and democratic state existing side-by-side in peace and prosperity with a demilitarized Palestinian state that meets their aspirations for self-determination.' Jeffries’s preferred strategy clashes diametrically with the bombshell proposal offered by Trump a day earlier, when the president met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington and suggested the millions of Palestinians living in Gaza should leave their homes. In their wake, he said, the United States would assume ownership of the war-torn territory and rebuild it with a massive 'economic development' project. 'I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East — and maybe the entire Middle East,' Trump said during a press conference at the White House. 'This was not a decision made lightly,' he continued. 'Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.' Trump’s proposal marked a stunning reversal in U.S. policy toward the Middle East stretching back across decades of administrations of both parties. And it triggered an international debate about whether Trump was advancing a serious foreign policy objective or merely floating a bombastic threat as a negotiating tactic aimed at winning more concessions from the region’s Arab states. Amid the debate, many Democrats on Capitol Hill dismissed the idea as irrational, as best. 'I don't take it seriously at all,' said Rep. Gregory Meeks (N.Y.), senior Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee. 'This guy just talks off the top of his head.' Meeks pointed out that a major theme of Trump’s campaign was to end foreign entanglements and overseas spending for the sake of concentrating taxpayer resources on domestic priorities. The president’s proposal to seize Gaza, he noted, would do just the opposite. 'They're all talking about, 'We've got to stop nation-building and all of those kinds of things.' And then he comes out of the room talking about what would cost billions — trillions — of dollars of the taxpayers' money,' Meeks said. 'It just doesn't make any rational and common sense.' Republicans on Capitol Hill have different ideas, and many rushed to Trump’s support on Wednesday, including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.). 'That area is so dangerous, and he’s taking bold, decisive action to try to ensure the peace of that region,' Johnson said. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, pointed to one impediment to Trump’s plan: It would violate international laws that prohibit the forced removal of the legal residents of occupied territories, of which Gaza is one. 'If this country can't learn what happens when we put a major presence, unwelcomed, in the Middle East — or in Afghanistan or in Iraq — we can't learn anything,' Himes said. 'So I don't really know whether to take his proposal seriously, because obviously moving Palestinians against their will is a violation of the Geneva Conventions.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/jeffries-amps-up-call-for-two-state-solution-after-trump-push-to-seize-gaza/	2025-02-05T10:17:15-08:00	
U.S. allies, adversaries reject Trump suggestion to 'take over' G...	(The Hill) — Both U.S. allies and adversaries alike rejected President Donald Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. 'take over' the war-torn Gaza Strip and turn it into the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' Trump floated the idea during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Tuesday. He said the U.S. would be involved in clearing the territory where not only Palestinians but 'the world’s people' would benefit from it as an access point to the Mediterranean coast. 'I think you’ll make that into an international, unbelievable place. … I don’t want to be cute, I don’t want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle East … this could be so magnificent,' Trump said in his first major Middle East policy announcement since his return to the Oval Office. Among U.S. friends and foes, the message was not well received. 5 takeaways from the Trump, Netanyahu joint presser Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry refused to forge a diplomatic relationship with Israel without a path for Palestinians to get an independent state. 'The kingdom of Saudi Arabia also stresses what it had previously announced regarding its absolute rejection of infringement on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, whether through Israeli settlement policies, annexation of Palestinian lands or efforts to displace the Palestinian people from their land,' the ministry said in a statement shortly after Trump’s remarks. Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also reaffirmed his backing for a two-state solution on Wednesday. 'Australia played, historically, a very important role in the creation of the state of Israel. It's something that … governments consistently since then have supported,' he told reporters, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 'But those governments have also supported what happened then, which was the creation of two states, not just one, and that remains my position, and it has been a bipartisan position up to this point,' Albanese added. Trump's comments on Gaza came as the fragile ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas is underway, with Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners while the Palestinian militant group has freed many of the hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, which sparked war in the region. Some of the U.S.'s biggest adversaries also reiterated their backing of a two-state solution. 'We oppose the forced relocation of people in Gaza and hope that the relevant parties will take the ceasefire and post-war governance in Gaza as an opportunity to push the Palestinian issue back on the right track,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in a statement, according to The Associated Press. Protests against Trump, Project 2025 planned in cities across the country A spokesperson for Hamas' Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that Trump’s remarks were 'ridiculous and absurd,' emphasizing the group’s commitment to a three-step-phase ceasefire with Israel. When the president was asked about possibly sending in U.S. troops to Gaza, Trump said America will 'do what is necessary.' 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job — whether we’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out,' Trump said Tuesday. Trump also suggested that Palestinians who have been displaced be permanently relocated from Gaza, echoing his previous proposals to have other countries in the region take in refugees. Reconstruction in the region, he added, will also likely take longer than the ceasefire suggests.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/u-s-allies-adversaries-reject-trump-suggestion-to-take-over-gaza-strip/	2025-02-05T06:54:09-08:00	
Trump's suggestion the US 'take over' the Gaza Strip is rejected ...	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — President Donald Trump's proposal that the United States 'take over' the Gaza Strip and permanently resettle its Palestinian residents was swiftly rejected and denounced on Wednesday by American allies and adversaries alike. Trump's suggestion came at a White House news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who smiled several times as the president detailed a plan to build new settlements for Palestinians outside the Gaza Strip, and for the U.S. to take 'ownership' in redeveloping the war-torn territory into 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too,' Trump said. 'We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs.' The comments came amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, during which the militant group has been turning over hostages in exchange for the release of prisoners held by Israel. Egypt, Jordan and other American allies in the Middle East have already rejected the idea of relocating more than 2 million Palestinians from Gaza elsewhere in the region. Following Trump's remarks, Egypt's Foreign Ministry issued a statement stressing the need for rebuilding 'without moving the Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.' Saudi Arabia, an important American ally, weighed in quickly on Trump's expanded idea to take over the Gaza Strip in a sharply worded statement, noting that its long call for an independent Palestinian state was a 'firm, steadfast and unwavering position.' 'The kingdom of Saudi Arabia also stresses what it had previously announced regarding its absolute rejection of infringement on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, whether through Israeli settlement policies, annexation of Palestinian lands or efforts to displace the Palestinian people from their land,' the statement said. The prime ministers of Australia and Ireland, foreign ministries from China, New Zealand and Germany, and a Kremlin spokesman all reiterated support for a two-state solution. 'Australia's position is the same as it was this morning, as it was last year, as it was 10 years ago,' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said. Trump has already made waves — and upset longtime allies — suggesting the purchase of Greenland, the annexation of Canada and the possible takeover of the Panama Canal. It was not immediately clear whether the idea of taking over the Gaza Strip was a well thought out plan, or an opening gambit in negotiations. 'The comments last night were, of course, very concerning,' said Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin. 'I always adopt the approach when it comes to the U.S. administration of: judge them based on what they do and not what they say.' Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told state-run Anadolu Agency that Trump's proposal on 'deportations from Gaza is not something that either the region or we would accept.' 'Even thinking about it, in my opinion, is wrong and absurd,' Fidan said. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the United Nations to 'protect the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights,' saying that what Trump wanted to do would be 'a serious violation of international law.' Hamas, which sparked the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, said Trump's proposal was a 'recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region.' 'Instead of holding the Zionist occupation accountable for the crime of genocide and displacement, it is being rewarded, not punished,' the militant group said in a statement. In its attack on Israel, Hamas killed some 1,200 people, primarily civilians, and took about 250 hostages. Israel's ensuing air and ground war has has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities who do not say how many of the dead were fighters. The war has left large parts of several cities in ruins and displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people. In the U.S., opposition politicians quickly rejected Trump's idea, with Democratic Sen. Chris Coons calling his comments 'offensive and insane and dangerous and foolish.' The idea 'risks the rest of the world thinking that we are an unbalanced and unreliable partner because our president makes insane proposals,' Coons said, noting the irony of the proposal coming shortly after Trump had moved to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development. 'Why on earth would we abandon decades of well-established humanitarian programs around the world, and now launch into one of the world’s greatest humanitarian challenges?' Coons said. Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American member of Congress from Michigan, accused Trump in a social media post of 'openly calling for ethnic cleansing' with the idea of resettling Gaza's entire population. ___ Rising reported from Bangkok.

UK foreign secretary visits Ukraine as Zelenskyy discloses troop ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday, bringing a new support package for Ukraine a day after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 45,000 of his country’s troops had died in the almost three-year war with Russia. Lammy was due to announce 55 million pounds ($69 million) in new support, including 3 million pounds to send Ukrainian grain to war-ravaged Syria through the World Food Program. British officials say the goal is to replace grain Syria received from Russia when it was ruled by deposed President Bashar Assad, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.K. says much of that grain was stolen from Ukrainian land occupied by Russia’s invading army. Lammy is also pledging 17 million pounds to help repair Ukraine’s energy system, which Russia has repeatedly pounded. Lammy’s trip followed last month’s visit by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, when the U.K. and Ukrainian leaders signed what they called a '100-year partnership.' It was part of a European show of support for Ukraine as the return of U.S. President Donald Trump brought questions about continued backing for the country by Washington. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said in an interview broadcast Tuesday night that the war has killed 45,100 Ukrainian troops. The fighting also has injured close to 390,000 troops, he told Piers Morgan Uncensored on YouTube. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-top-uk-diplomat-visits-ukraine-as-president-zelenskyy-discloses-troop-losses/	2025-02-05T03:02:57-08:00	
The Gaza Strip has long been a powder keg. Here's a look at the h...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Gaza has long been a powder keg, and it exploded after Hamas fighters stormed southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and began killing and abducting people, sparking a crushing Israeli military operation there that's only recently reached an uneasy ceasefire. President Donald Trump 's suggestion Tuesday that that displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and the U.S. take 'ownership' may spark new tension over the enclave on the Mediterranean Sea. Here’s a look at the troubled modern history of the Gaza Strip: 1948 - 1967: Egyptian rule of Gaza Before the war surrounding Israel's establishment in 1948, present-day Gaza was part of the large swath of the Middle East under British colonial rule. After Israel defeated the coalition of Arab states, the Egyptian army was left in control of a small strip of land wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean. During the war, some 700,000 Palestinians either fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel — a mass uprooting that they call the Nakba, or 'catastrophe.' Tens of thousands of Palestinians flocked to the strip. Under Egyptian military control, Palestinian refugees in Gaza were stuck, homeless and stateless. Egypt didn't consider them to be citizens and Israel wouldn't let them return to their homes. Many were supported by UNWRA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, which has a heavy presence in Gaza to this day. Meanwhile, some young Palestinians became 'fedayeen' — insurgency fighters who conducted raids into Israel. 1967 - 1993: Israel seizes control Israel seized control of Gaza from Egypt during the 1967 Mideast war, when it also captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem — areas that remain under Israeli control. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, which administers semi-autonomous areas of the occupied West Bank, seeks all three areas for a hoped-for future state. Israel built more than 20 Jewish settlements in Gaza during this period. It also signed a peace treaty with Egypt at Camp David — a pact negotiated by U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi has referenced this 40-year old treaty when he declined to permit Palestinian refugees from Gaza into Egypt, saying the potential entrance of militants into Egypt would threaten longstanding peace between Israel and Egypt. The first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation erupted in Gaza in December 1987, kicking off more than five years of sustained protests and bloody violence. It was also during this time that the Islamic militant group Hamas was established in Gaza. 1993 - 2005: The Palestinian Authority takes charge For a time, promising peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders made the future of Gaza look somewhat hopeful. Following the Oslo accords — a set of agreements between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat that laid the groundwork for a two-state solution — control of Gaza was handed to the fledgling Palestinian Authority. But the optimism was short lived. A series of Palestinian suicide attacks by Hamas militants, the 1995 assassination of Rabin by a Jewish ultranationalist opposed to his peacemaking and the election of Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister the following year all hindered U.S.-led peace efforts. Another peace push collapsed in late 2000 with the eruption of the second Palestinian uprising. As the uprising fizzled in 2005, then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon led a unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, uprooting all of Israel's troops and roughly 9,000 settlers in a move that bitterly divided Israel. 2005 - 2023: Hamas seizes power Just months after Israel's withdrawal, Hamas won parliamentary elections over Fatah, the long-dominant Palestinian political party. The following year, after months of infighting, Hamas violently seized control of Gaza from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority. Israel and Egypt imposed a crippling blockade on the territory, monitoring the flow of goods and people in and out. For nearly two decades, the closure has crippled the local economy, sent unemployment skyrocketing, and emboldened militancy in the region, which is one of the most densely populated places on the planet. Through previous wars and countless smaller battles with Israel that devastated Gaza, Hamas has only grown more powerful. In each subsequent conflict, Hamas has had more rockets that have traveled farther. The group has displayed a growing array of weapons. Its top leaders have survived, and ceasefires have been secured. In the meantime, it has built a government, including a police force, ministries and border terminals equipped with metal detectors and passport control. 2023 Hamas attack sparks the Israel-Hamas war The Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw around 250 people taken hostage. Over 100 hostages were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, eight have been rescued alive and dozens of bodies have been recovered by Israeli forces. Israel’s air and ground war has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many of the dead were fighters. The war has left large parts of several cities in ruins and displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people. Under the first phase of the latest ceasefire, which went into effect on Jan. 19, Hamas is to release a total of 33 hostages, eight of whom Hamas says are dead, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most areas and allowed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to devastated northern Gaza while aid flows in. Negotiations on the second phase, which would end the war and see the remaining 60 or so hostages returned, are set to begin Monday. If mediators the United States, Qatar and Egypt are unable to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas, the war could resume in early March. ___ The Associated Press is republishing this story from Oct. 21, 2023, to update with the ceasefire and President Donald Trump’s comments about the Gaza Strip.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-the-gaza-strip-has-long-been-a-powder-keg-heres-a-look-at-the-history-of-the-embattled-region/	2025-02-05T01:08:36-08:00	
Inside the operations that took captive 2 North Korean soldiers f...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — When Ukrainian soldiers captured two North Korean prisoners of war last month, it provided the first undeniable proof of Pyongyang’s direct involvement in the war against Ukraine. It also shed some light on the mindset and training of the conscripted North Korean soldiers sent to fight Russia’s war a continent away from their home. Highly disciplined, ready to die but also very young and with little battlefield experience they elicited curiosity and even some pity from the Ukrainian soldiers who captured them during two separate missions on Jan. 9. Their capture confirmed what Ukraine, South Korea and the U.S. had been saying for months: Thousands of North Korean troops were fighting alongside Kremlin forces in the battle for Russia’s Kursk border region — something Moscow had never confirmed. ‘You will live,’ one North Korean captive is assured Capturing a North Korean prisoner had long been an objective for the Ukrainian special forces, even as the North Koreans seemed willing to kill themselves or a wounded comrade to elude capture. Only one had been taken captive, in December, but he died of his wounds. Then intelligence came about three soldiers stranded in the so-called gray zone — a dangerous no-man’s-land on the front line controlled by neither side. The soldiers were identified as North Koreans because they, not Russians, were operating in that sector of Kursk. 'They were likely abandoned,' said a Ukrainian soldier who participated in the mission and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because special forces members are not authorized to reveal their names. The team advanced through a barren winter forest toward the coordinates where a drone had spotted the three lost soldiers. 'Koreans are incredibly tough,' the soldier said. 'We’ve seen them carrying enormous loads: one soldier as small as a child, with a heavy backpack and a machine gun, yet sprinting.' As they closed in, the Ukrainians came under enemy fire, and two of the North Koreans were killed in the firefight. The third soldier was wounded in his legs. When the Ukrainians reached him, his only remaining weapon was a single grenade. Disoriented, he didn’t resist as the group began providing first aid and their commander discreetly removed the grenade. The North Korean, unaware of this, continued searching his pockets for it afterward. The Ukrainian soldier said he tried to communicate with the captured man. He first spoke in Russian, eliciting a faint response. Then he heard the soldier muttering phrases in English and switched to his own broken English. He asked the soldier's age and how long he had been serving. The soldier said he was 21 years old and had already spent four years in the military. 'He said conscription starts at 16 and lasts eight years,' the Ukrainian soldier said. Despite his own 12 years of service and being a father of three, the soldier felt an unexpected wave of compassion. 'I looked at him, and honestly, I felt sorry for him,' he said. 'He asked for water, and we gave him some. Then he asked for a cigarette, and we gave him one. He called us ‘brothers.’' The team bandaged the North Korean soldier's legs and were carrying him toward Ukrainian-controlled territory when they were detected by a Russian reconnaissance drone, prompting a barrage of enemy fire. 'They must have realized we’d captured him and were desperate to take him out,' the soldier said. The team eventually reached a Ukrainian evacuation vehicle. They loaded the wounded North Korean into it. Only then, noticing the blue armbands on their sleeves, did he grasp he was in Ukrainian hands. He began searching frantically for his grenade again. 'When I handed him over to the medics, he looked terrified that I wasn’t going with him,' the soldier said. 'I told him, ‘Everything will be fine, you will live.’' With that, the vehicle drove off, concluding the operation after eight tense hours. 'I do feel sorry for him, but damn, they came to our land,' the soldier said. 'Still, I’d like to meet him again someday.' A North Korean soldier attempts suicide rather than be captured On the same day, soldiers from an airborne unit captured another North Korean soldier, this time by chance and without initially realizing who they were taking prisoner. It all began around 5 a.m., when a North Korean assault struck their position. 'The battle was intense and dragged on for hours,' recalled 27-year-old paratrooper Maksym Didorchuk. The air thundered with explosions, and the sky buzzed with drones. The North Koreans attacked relentlessly. 'Their assaults are massive, but they’re treated as expendable,' Didorchuk said. 'They’re tough because they rely on sheer numbers' 'They follow orders,' and never retreat, he said. 'They’re likely being used as training material.' Around noon, a reconnaissance drone spotted a lone soldier moving erratically from the Russian side toward the rear of the Ukrainian position. 'He was zigzagging, moving left and right,' Didorchuk said. 'Nobody knew who he was. The order was to intercept him, provide medical assistance if necessary, and decide what to do next.' Didorchuk and another paratrooper set off toward the soldier, guided by a Ukrainian reconnaissance drone. They eventually reached an area near destroyed Russian weaponry, where they saw the soldier sitting, his face hidden from view. The paratroopers approached cautiously, asking in Ukrainian if the soldier needed help. No response. They tried Russian. The soldier glanced at them but remained silent. Switching to English also yielded no reaction. Finally, as they drew closer, they saw his features clearly — and realized he was North Korean. The soldier’s arm was wounded, and his jaw bandaged, likely before he was separated. His movements were slow and uncoordinated, possibly the result of a concussion, Didorchuk said. 'He didn’t seem to know where he was going.' Attached to his armor were a grenade and a knife. The paratroopers gestured for him to remove them, but he appeared confused. 'He didn’t know if we were allies or enemies,' Didorchuk said. After repeated gestures, the soldier dropped the grenade and the knife. The paratroopers motioned for him to follow, and he complied. They maintained a cautious distance, aware that Russian drones could spot them and attack to prevent the North Korean from being captured. 'From what I understand, they don’t want Koreans taken prisoner. They quickly evacuate their wounded and dead to erase all traces,' Didorchuk said. As they waited in a trench for transport, the North Korean asked for a cigarette, then another, while the paratroopers kept a vigilant eye not only on him but on the skies for Russian drones. When the vehicle arrived, the North Korean soldier grew nervous. Suddenly he lunged at a concrete pillar, striking his head against it. 'I saw it as an attempt at self-destruction,' Didorchuk said. The soldiers secured him in the vehicle to be transferred to the authorities. Ukraine’s SBU security service, which interrogated the POWs, said one had no documents, while the other carried a Russian military ID in the name of a man from Tuva, a Russian region bordering Mongolia. It said one of the soldiers claimed he was told he was going to Russia for training, not to fight against Ukraine. He said his combat unit only received one week of training alongside Russian troops before being sent to the front.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-inside-the-operations-that-took-captive-2-north-korean-soldiers-fighting-ukraine/	2025-02-04T21:04:06-08:00	
Trump floats US taking over Gaza Strip	President Trump on Tuesday floated the idea of the U.S. taking over the Gaza Strip, saying America should be responsible for clearing the territory of rubble and unexploded bombs and proposing an 'economic development.' Trump’s remarks are some of his most extreme rhetoric regarding the future of the territory where nearly 2 million Palestinians live and hope to be part of a future Palestinian state. Trump also suggested the U.S. would develop the land but gave no details on who would be allowed to live there. The president said he envisioned Palestinians will live there but seemed to describe the territory as an international hub where 'the world’s people' would use it for access to the Mediterranean coast. The idea appears to build on Trump’s 2020 peace plan that envisioned Gaza’s coastline developed for commercial and leisure resorts. The plan was developed by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose background is in real estate development. 'I think you'll make that into an international, unbelievable place… I don't want to be cute, I don't want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle East… this could be so magnificent.' Asked about the possibility of sending U.S. troops to Gaza, Trump said the U.S. will 'do what is necessary' as he laid out plans for the U.S. to take the area over, and suggested he would visit the territory. 'As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that,' Trump said. 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job — whether we'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out,' Trump said. 'Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area, do a real job, do something different.' Trump made the statements during his opening remarks at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. 'I do see a long-term ownership position,' Trump continued. 'This was not a decision made lightly. Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent in a really magnificent area that nobody would know, nobody can look because all they see is death and destruction and rubble and demolished buildings falling all over.' Earlier, Trump said Palestinians in Gaza could be relocated and settled elsewhere, and that they should not want to return to Gaza. Trump called for countries 'of interest with humanitarian hearts' to build 'various domains' that could 'be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza.' Netanyahu praised Trump as a leader who thinks outside the box. 'You say things others refuse to say and after the jaws drop, people scratch their heads and they say, ‘You know, he’s right,’' Netanyahu said. Asked if he supports Trump's proposal, Netanyahu said 'President Trump is taking it to a much higher level. ... He sees a different future for that piece of land.' Arab nations have publicly rejected displacing Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. 'Palestinians do not want to leave their land,' a senior Palestinian official and the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio this week. 'We support their position unequivocally,' they wrote in the letter, which called for Palestinians to 'live in their land and help rebuild it.' Trump later in his remarks from the White House reiterated that the U.S. would rebuild the strip. 'As far as Gaza’s concerned, we will do what’s necessary. … We’re going to take over that piece and we’re going to develop it. Create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it’s going to be something that [the] entire Middle East can be proud of,' Trump said. 'I think we’ll be a great keeper of something that is very, very strong,' he said, adding that jobs created in Gaza will be 'for everybody.' Alex Gangitano contributed to this story.

Trump and Netanyahu hold talks as US president warns 'no guarante...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet Tuesday as the Israeli prime minister faces competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want the remaining hostages home and the 15-month conflict to end. Trump is guarded about the long-term prospects for the truce, even as he takes credit for pressuring Hamas and Israel into the hostage and ceasefire agreement that went into effect the day before he returned to office last month. 'I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,' Trump told reporters on Monday. The leaders' talks are expected to touch on a long-sought Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization deal and concerns about Iran's nuclear program, but hammering out the second phase of the hostage deal will be at the top of the agenda. Netanyahu's arrival in Washington for the first foreign leader visit of Trump's second term comes as the prime minister's popular support is lagging. Netanyahu is in the middle of weekslong testimony in an ongoing corruption trial that centers on allegations he exchanged favors with media moguls and wealthy associates. He has decried the accusations and said he is the victim of a 'witch hunt.' Being seen with Trump, who is popular in Israel, could help distract the public from the trial and boost Netanyahu’s standing. It's Netanyahu's first travel outside Israel since the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in November for him, his former defense minister and Hamas’ slain military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza. The U.S. does not recognize the ICC's authority over its citizens or territory. Netanyahu and Trump's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff on Monday began the daunting work of brokering the next phase of a ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu said in a statement that the meeting with Witkoff and U.S. national security adviser Michael Waltz was 'positive and friendly.' The Israeli leader said he would send a delegation to Qatar to continue indirect talks with Hamas that are being mediated by the Gulf Arab country, the first confirmation that those negotiations would continue. Netanyahu also said he would convene his security Cabinet to discuss Israel’s demands for the next phase of the ceasefire when he returns to Israel at the end of the week. Netanyahu is under intense pressure from hard-right members of his governing coalition to abandon the ceasefire and resume fighting in Gaza to eliminate Hamas. Bezalel Smotrich, one of Netanyahu’s key partners, vows to topple the government if the war isn’t relaunched, a step that could lead to early elections. Hamas, which has reasserted control over Gaza since the ceasefire began last month, has said it will not release hostages in the second phase without an end to the war and Israeli forces’ full withdrawal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, maintains that Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war. Mira Resnick, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli and Palestinian affairs, said Trump may 'have little patience for political woes of Netanyahu if it gets in the way of the broader goals of this administration.' 'The president started his term by saying that he wanted the ceasefire to be in place by Jan. 20. That's what he got,' Resnick said. 'He is invested in this because he was able to take credit for it.' Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among the hostages, called on Trump to use American leverage to keep Netanyahu committed to the agreement. Matan, 24, is among those who are expected to be included in the second phase of the deal, when all remaining living hostages — including men under the age of 50 and male soldiers — are to be exchanged for a yet-to-be-determined number of Palestinian prisoners. The second phase is also expected to include the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. 'I want President Trump to know there are certain extreme elements from within Israel who are trying to torpedo his vision,' said Zangauker, who traveled to Washington from Israel to join a planned Tuesday rally outside the White House. 'We are representative of the vast, vast majority of Israel. The ultra-extremists are blackmailing the prime minister to do their bidding.' Since returning to office, Trump has called for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, even as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II have rejected it. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League have joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Yet Trump insists he can persuade Egypt and Jordan to come around to accept displaced Palestinians because of the significant aid that the U.S. provides Cairo and Amman. Hard-line right-wing members of Netanyahu's government have embraced the call to move displaced Palestinians out of Gaza. Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, said the push by Trump to move Palestinians out of Gaza is helpful to Netanyahu. But he added that it undercuts Trump and Netanyahu's desire to land a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis, the biggest Arab power in the Middle East, have said they would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank. 'This push by Trump doesn’t square with the idea of a Palestinian state as we know it,' Telhami said. 'It's hard to see the Saudis going along with it.' Netanyahu on Monday met with Trump’s pick to serve as ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and evangelical leaders. Huckabee has long rejected a Palestinian state in territory previously seized by Israel. The prime minister is also expected to press Trump to take decisive action on Iran. Tehran has faced a series of military setbacks, including Israeli forces significantly degrading Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon as well as an operation that decimated Iran's air defenses. The moment, Netanyahu believes, has created a window to decisively address Tehran's nuclear program. 'This is one of the most important and critical meetings between an American president and an Israeli prime minister,' said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. 'What’s at stake here is not just bilateral relations between Israel and the United States but the reshaping of the Middle East.' ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

US aid freeze puts at risk Ukraine’s wartime help for frontline e...	PAVLOHRAD, Ukraine (AP) — In what used to be the concert hall in this town in eastern Ukraine, cots are arranged on stage. Instead of music, the room is filled with the muffled sobs of local people driven from their homes by fighting in the country’s almost three-year war with Russia. The Russian army’s recent advances have engulfed towns and villages in the area. The Pavlohrad concert hall was requisitioned as a temporary center for local civilians fleeing the relentless Russian bombardment. 'It’s good here. There’s food, warmth, and a place to wash,' said 83-year-old Kateryna Odraha, who lived through the Nazi German occupation of her village during World War II. That refuge may now be in peril. The shelter costs the equivalent of $7,000 a month to run, and 60% of that was being covered by U.S. funds sent to help Ukraine. President Donald Trump’s decision last week to freeze for 90 days the humanitarian aid that the United States provides to countries overseas was felt in places far from Washington, including here, a few kilometers (miles) from the front line in eastern Ukraine. Trump’s decision immediately halted thousands of U.S.-funded humanitarian, development and security programs. The consequences have rippled across the world. 'This news was abrupt and unexpected,' said Illia Novikov, the coordinator of the Pavlohrad transit center, which is run by the charity organization Relief Coordination Center. 'At this moment, we have no idea what the future holds.' The U.S. funding covered fuel for evacuation vehicles, salaries for aid workers, legal and psychological support, and tickets to help evacuees reach safer locations, he said. Usually about 60 people pass through the shelter each day, but when the Russian bombardment worsens, that can climb to more than 200, according to Novikov. Many people heading here have spent months living in their basement without electricity, running water or enough food. Vasyl Odraha, 58, remained in his local village for months, even as artillery fire and Russian guided bomb strikes became more frequent as the war moved closer. He said he initially believed that Trump would stop the war within 24 hours of taking office, as he had promised during his election campaign. 'We pinned our hopes on Trump’s election,' he said, sitting on a cot beside his 83-year-old mother. When the fighting didn’t stop, and the front line moved to within less than 3 kilometers (2 miles) of where they lived, they fled at dawn. 'If we hadn’t left, we would have died that very night,' said Kateryna Odraha. Across Ukraine, many other sectors are reeling from the aid freeze, which places additional strain on Ukraine’s stretched wartime finances. Energy projects, veteran support programs, psychological helplines, cybersecurity, healthcare, independent media, and even border infrastructure projects have been affected. The aid was intended to help cushion the war’s impact. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his government expects $300-400 million in aid to be cut. Most of that was for the energy sector that has been targeted by Russia. Ukraine hopes to make up the shortfall from European sources of aid or internal ones, Zelenskyy said. The World Health Organization, a U.N. agency which Trump wants the U.S. to leave, launched an emergency appeal Tuesday to raise $110 million for its humanitarian response in Ukraine where it said almost 13 million people are 'in dire need' of assistance. 'The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine has reached a scale of undeniable severity,' the WHO said in a statement. In the latest devastating Russian attack on a civilian area, authorities said a ballistic missile smashed into an administrative building in downtown Izium, a city in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region, killing five people and injuring 50 others, including three children. U.S. military aid has not been frozen, according to Zelenskyy, but Ukraine has received only about 42% of the money approved by Congress. There is no clear sign the war might be close to ending, and that means Ukrainian civilians will need more help. 'Evacuations will continue for a long time,' Novikov, the transit center’s coordinator, said. 'There may be new front lines, new affected communities, so we must be prepared to keep providing assistance.' ___ Associated Press journalists Samya Kullab, Susie Blann and Illia Novikov in Kyiv contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-aid-freeze-puts-at-risk-ukraines-wartime-help-for-frontline-evacuees/	2025-02-04T07:09:53-08:00	
Trump wants rare earth elements from Ukraine in exchange for mili...	(The Hill) - President Trump indicated Monday he wants a deal for rare earth elements and other items from Ukraine in exchange for continued military aid in the nation’s war against Russia. 'We're handing them money hand over fist. We're giving them equipment,' Trump said Monday. 'We're looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they're going to secure what we're giving them with their rare earth and other things,' he told reporters in the Oval Office. 'I want to have security of rare earth,' he added, appearing to refer to rare earth elements, which refers to a specific group of materials that are only deposited in relatively small quantities and can be used in a variety of applications including electronics, health care and batteries. It’s not clear whether Trump’s desired deal would refer only to the elements that are considered rare earths, or if he is also interested in minerals like lithium and titanium, of which Ukraine has a significant supply. In Ukraine’s existing 'Victory Plan,' the country said it would work to supply its strategic partners with 'natural resources and critical metals worth trillions of U.S. dollars' including uranium, titanium, lithium and graphite. Ukraine may not be the only foreign supplier in Trump’s sights. Mike Waltz, who Trump has tapped as national security adviser, has said that Trump’s quest for Greenland is about minerals and other natural resources.

Middle East latest: At least 6 injured in attack in Israel-occupi...	At least six people were injured in a shooting attack at a checkpoint in the Israeli-occupied West Bank early Tuesday morning, according to the Israeli military and area hospitals. The Israeli military said an attacker fired at soldiers at a checkpoint in the village of Tayasir, which is in the northern West Bank. In a tense exchange, soldiers returned fire and the attacker was killed, the military added. Israeli hospitals said they had received a total of six people injured in the shooting attack. Israeli media reported the injured are soldiers and at least two of them were critically injured. Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group praised the attack but neither claimed responsibility for it. Israel has carried out an extensive operation in nearby Jenin over the past weeks to clamp down on what Israel said is militant activity in the city, as soldiers and armored bulldozers have caused widespread damage and destroyed scores of homes. Palestinian health officials have not released a total death toll, but say Israeli fire has killed at least 20 Palestinians since the start of the raid. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip ignited the war there. ___ Here's the latest: Turkey will host 15 Palestinian prisoners released as part of ceasefire ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey’s state-run news agency says the country will host 15 Palestinian prisoners who were released and deported as part of the ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel. The Turkish intelligence organization, MIT, is taking steps to 'facilitate' the arrival of the 15 Palestinians from Egypt, the Anadolu Agency said Tuesday. Arrangements were made to ensure the Palestinians can live 'peacefully and securely' in Turkey, Anadolu said. The news agency did not name the Palestinians that Ankara was preparing to take in. Those who were deported have been convicted of serious crimes. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Sunday that Turkey was prepared to support the Palestinian people, including providing medical treatment for those wounded in the conflict and taking in released prisoners who would be deported from the region. Unlike its Western allies, Turkey does not consider Hamas to be a terror organization. A strong critic of Israel’s military actions in Gaza, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has hosted several Hamas officials over the years. Family members of Thai hostages released by Hamas visit them in Israeli hospital JERUSALEM — Family members of Thai hostages released by Hamas last week after over 15 months of captivity in the Gaza Strip have visited them at the Israeli hospital where they are recuperating. The Thai Embassy in Israel said the family members flew in on Tuesday and met with the freed hostages at the Shamir Medical Center. Hamas released five Thai hostages last week along with three Israeli captives who were freed as part of a ceasefire agreement in exchange for 110 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas militants kidnapped 31 Thai nationals along with scores of Israelis and a few other foreigners during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel that ignited the war. Tens of thousands of Thai farmers work in Israel, where they can make higher wages than they can at home. Many lived in compounds on the outskirts of southern Israeli farming communities and towns that were overrun by Hamas-led militants. During an earlier ceasefire in November 2023, 23 Thai nationals were released in a deal negotiated between Thailand and Hamas, with assistance from Qatar and Iran. According to Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 46 Thais have been killed during the conflict, including two Thai citizens who were killed on Oct. 7, 2023 and their bodies taken into Gaza.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-at-least-6-injured-in-attack-in-israel-occupied-west-bank-assailant-is-killed/	2025-02-04T05:00:59-08:00	
Middle East latest: Hostages freed from Gaza rarely saw sunlight,...	The families of hostages freed from Gaza over the weekend, the latest release in the ceasefire deal, described difficult conditions — including rarely seeing the sun — during their captivity. The six-week first phase of the truce calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 prisoners, as well as the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory. Israel and Hamas are beginning to negotiate a second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached. ___ Here's the latest: More than 545,000 Palestinians have crossed in northern Gaza, UN says UNITED NATIONS — More than 545,000 Palestinians are estimated to have crossed from southern Gaza to northern Gaza in the past week since the Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect, the United Nations says. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Monday that the U.N. and its humanitarian partners also report that over 36,000 people have been observed moving from northern Gaza to the south during the same period. In North Gaza, U.N. partners said three temporary sites that have been established in Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and Jabalya, each capable of holding 5,000 people. As more humanitarian aid enters Gaza and the ceasefire continues to hold, Dujarric said U.N. partners report that prices have started to fall, though they remain about pre-conflict levels. 'One-third of households reportedly have better access to food, but consumption remains significantly below levels prior to the escalation of hostilities,' he said. 'For most households, the primary obstacle is just lack of cash.' Meanwhile, U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher arrived Monday for a weeklong visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories, Dujarric said. He is expected to visit the West Bank and Gaza Strip and meet with senior officials to see first-hand 'and get a better understanding of the obstacles facing aid partners, and also look at how to best and improve our humanitarian operations.' Hostage endured ‘psychological torture,’ sister says JERUSALEM — The family of Yarden Bibas, a hostage who was released from captivity Saturday, said he was held in very difficult conditions and subject to 'ongoing psychological torture,' according his sister said Monday from the hospital where he is recovering in Tel Aviv. He has lost significant weight and muscle mass because of the conditions, including rarely seeing the sun, Ofri Bibas-Levy said. Yarden Bibas was kidnapped separately from his wife, Shiri Bibas, and his two children, Ariel and Kfir, who were 4 years old and 9 months old when they were kidnapped. Kfir was the youngest of about 30 children taken hostage Oct. 7, and the infant with red hair and a toothless smile become a symbol across Israel. 'Since he was released, he has asked just one question: Where are Shiri and the children?' said Dana Silberman-Sitton, the sister of Shiri Bibas. Bibas-Levy also pleaded for Israel and the US to continue the negotiations for the second stage of the ceasefire. Weapons storage facilities hit in Lebanon, Israeli military says JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said it had located and destroyed several weapons storage facilities in southern Lebanon on Monday, where troops are continuing to operate as a fragile ceasefire enters its third month. Israel said soldiers had found mortar shells, missiles, rockets, explosives, firearms and a large amount of military equipment belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, without providing evidence. The military said it also killed a number of Hezbollah militants located close to Israeli troops. The ceasefire deal for Lebanon gave both sides 60 days to remove their forces from southern Lebanon and for the Lebanese army to move in and secure the area. Israel says Hezbollah and the Lebanese army haven’t met their obligations, while Lebanon accuses the Israeli army of hindering the Lebanese military from taking over. The 60-day deadline expired at the end of January. Israel said the agreement is progressing but, in some sectors, 'it has been delayed and will take slightly longer.' American-Israeli hostage spent long periods in isolation, daughter says JERUSALEM — American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, 65, who was released from captivity Saturday, spent long periods of time alone, rarely saw sunlight and was given very little food, causing him to lose a drastic amount of weight, his daughter said Monday night from the hospital in Tel Aviv where her father is recuperating. Shir Siegel added that her father insisted Monday on knowing what happened to Kibbutz Kfar Aza during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. 'We had to go over a cruel and long list of 64 people, dear to us and loved, and he could not understand that so many of his friends were murdered,' Siegel said. Aviva Siegel, Keith Siegel's wife, who was also kidnapped and released in the weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, thanked U.S. President Donald Trump for help negotiating the ceasefire and pleaded with him to ensure the next stage of the ceasefire will take place. 'The hardest part is ahead of us, and I trust you to see this deal through, because it’s the road to healing for all of us,' she said, in a message to both the Israeli and American governments. Opposition leader says ceasefire won't bring down Netanyahu government JERUSALEM — Israel’s opposition leader says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government will not fall over the continuation of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that brings about the return of more hostages. Yair Lapid spoke Monday, the day before Netanyahu was to meet with Trump at the White House to discuss the truce. His remarks aimed at preventing Netanyahu from citing domestic political pressure as a reason for resuming the war. Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners have vowed to quit the government if he does not resume the war after the first phase ends in early March. Their departure would significantly raise the chances of early elections in which Netanyahu could be voted out. Lapid, speaking from an Israeli community near the border that was devastated in Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, 2023, said 'Netanyahu has a political safety net from the opposition for the deal, for every stage.' 'The deal has the overwhelming support of the people of Israel, and the deal has the overwhelming support of the Knesset of Israel,' he added, referring to Israel’s parliament. Russian diplomat meets with Hamas envoy MOSCOW — A senior Russian diplomat met a visiting Hamas envoy Monday to discuss the ceasefire deal in Gaza. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, President Vladimir Putin’s envoy for the Middle East and Africa, held talks with Hamas’ Musa Abu-Marzouq. The ministry said they discussed the progress of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza 'with an emphasis on the importance of increasing the volume of humanitarian aid to the affected Palestinian population.' The ministry’s statement noted that the Russian side once again 'particularly emphasized the need to fulfill the promises made by the Hamas leadership' regarding the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip. Syria's interim president to meet with Turkish officials ANKARA, Turkey — Syria’s interim president is set to visit Ankara on Tuesday, making his second international trip after his visit to Saudi Arabia, a top Turkish presidential aide has announced. Ahmad al-Sharaa, the newly installed former rebel leader who headed the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham militant group, is scheduled to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other Turkish officials. Talks would focus on steps that can be taken toward Syria’s economic recovery as well as the country’s security and stability, Fahrettin Altun, the aide, announced on the X social media platform Monday. Discussions would also center on how various countries and international organizations can offer assistance to Syria’s transitional administration and its people, he added. Turkey was a strong backer of groups opposed to ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad during the country’s civil war and is considered to be one of the new administration’s key allies.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-hostages-freed-from-gaza-rarely-saw-sunlight-families-say/	2025-02-03T18:13:41-08:00	
ACLU sues University of Michigan over campus bans for pro-Palesti...	LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Jonathan Zou, a second-year student at the University of Michigan, was among the thousands of students who joined pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses nationwide this past year. Although the campus protests have subsided, the repercussions for students like Zou remain. Since his arrest by university police last Oct. 7 after using a megaphone during a pro-Palestinian march, Zou has been banned from all University of Michigan campuses, except for attending class or seeking medical care. Zou is one of five individuals facing similar bans who the American Civil Liberties Union is representing in a lawsuit that accuses the University of Michigan of violating their right to free speech. The lawsuit, filed Monday by the ACLU in federal court, also argues that the university 'abused its authority to ban people from public property.' 'The university says it appreciates this history of activism, but it will arrest students, ban students, surveil students and repress them through legal or school disciplinary means,' Zou said in an interview before the lawsuit was filed. In response to a request for comment, a University of Michigan spokesperson said the university has not been served with the lawsuit and has no comment at this time. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations swept college campuses last spring, with activists setting up tent encampments and, in some cases, escalating their protests further. Thousands were arrested; while many had their cases dismissed, others remain in legal limbo as they pursue their education. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for aggressive action to fight antisemitism on college campuses and promising to prosecute offenders and revoke visas for international students found to be what he called 'Hamas sympathizers.' Michigan has been deeply affected by tensions over the Israel-Hamas war, with metro Detroit home to the nation’s largest Arab American community and a significant Jewish population. These dynamics have sparked unrest on University of Michigan campuses, resulting in police clashes with protesters and demonstrators targeting university regents for protests. Last week, the University of Michigan suspended a pro-Palestinian group for two years and pulled its funding after accusing the group of violating the university’s standards of conduct. The ACLU's lawsuit was brought on behalf of Zou and one other current student, two recent graduates and an Ann Arbor community member. According to the lawsuit, the individuals were each issued trespass bans after being accused of misconduct during protests, but never formally charged for it. Zou was participating in a march on the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus on the one-year anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and another 250 were taken hostage. The 2023 attack sparked a war that has devastated the Hamas-ruled Gaza strip. Zou was arrested after using a megaphone during the march, but never formally charged. The trespass bans have upended individuals 'daily lives, disrupted their, education and work, and are blocking their ability to speak and protest freely on the University’s vast campus,' according to the lawsuit. The individuals are asking the federal court to lift their bans and prevent the university from issuing broad trespassing bans in the future. A ceasefire took effect last month between Hamas and Israel, leading to hostage-for-prisoner swaps and a flood of aid into the Gaza Strip after a 15-month ground war marked by devastation, hunger and mass displacement in the territory. Looming large is the possibility that fighting will resume if the ceasefire breaks down after the six-week first phase.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-aclu-sues-university-of-michigan-over-campus-bans-for-pro-palestinian-protesters/	2025-02-03T15:48:00-08:00	
Ukraine strikes a major Russian oil refinery for a second time in...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian long-range drones struck one of Russia’s biggest oil refineries for the second time in three days, a senior Kyiv official said Monday, as Ukraine tries to slow the Russian army’s push along parts of the front line and the third anniversary of the war approaches. The attack late Sunday hit a refinery in the Volgograd region, which is one of Russia’s 10 biggest refining facilities, processing close to 6% of the country’s oil, an official in Ukraine’s Security Service told The Associated Press. Russian authorities acknowledged only a brief fire at the Volgograd refinery during the drone attack. Ukrainian defenses are creaking under a monthslong Russian drive to occupy more land, especially in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, before the possible start of peace negotiations steered by U.S. President Donald Trump. Ukraine, though heavily dependent on Western military aid, has been developing its own arms industry, including drones that can fly increasingly long ranges with bigger payloads. Ukrainians authorities said they attacked the same Volgograd refinery on Friday, but no further details were immediately available. The Sunday night attack by Ukrainian drones also targeted a major natural gas processing plant in Russia’s Astrakhan region, the security service official said on condition of anonymity to discuss classified operations. The official said that the attack was the security service’s fifth successful operation behind the front lines this year as it looks to disrupt the Russian war machine. The Volgograd refinery is located around 480 kilometers (300 miles) behind the front line. The Astrakhan plant is even further away, roughly 800 kilometers (500 miles) from Ukraine. The Russian military said that it destroyed 70 Ukrainian drones over six Russian regions during the night. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that the Volgograd region and the Astrakhan region on the Caspian Sea coast were targeted, as were sites in the Belgorod, Kursk and Voronezh regions on the border with Ukraine. Authorities temporarily suspended flights in and out of nine Russian airports in different regions. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/business/ap-business/ap-ukraine-strikes-a-major-russian-oil-refinery-for-a-second-time-in-3-days-an-official-says/	2025-02-03T05:56:41-08:00	
Aid is surging into Gaza under the ceasefire. Is it helping?	JERUSALEM (AP) — Two weeks after the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel took effect, aid is flooding into the Gaza Strip, bringing relief to a territory suffering from hunger, mass displacement and devastation following 15 months of war. But Palestinians and aid workers say it’s still an uphill battle to ensure the assistance reaches everyone. And looming large is the possibility that fighting will resume if the ceasefire breaks down after the six-week first phase. As part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel said it would allow 600 aid trucks into Gaza each day, a major increase. Israel estimates that at least 4,200 trucks have entered each week since the ceasefire took hold. Humanitarian groups say aid distribution is complicated by destroyed or damaged roads, Israeli inspections and the threat of unexploded bombs. On Saturday, Samir Abu Holi, 68, watched over a food-distribution point in Jabaliya, an area in northern Gaza razed to the ground during multiple Israeli offensives, the most recent of which cut off nearly all aid for over a month. 'I have more than 10 children. All of them need milk and food. Before the ceasefire, we used to provide food with difficulty,' he said. 'Today there is a little relief.' Here’s a closer look at the aid situation. A surge of aid The main U.N. food agency, the World Food Program, said it dispersed more food to Palestinians in Gaza during the first four days of the ceasefire than it did, on average, during any month of the war. Over 32,000 metric tons of aid have entered Gaza since the ceasefire, the agency said last week. Aid is now entering through two crossings in the north and one in the south. Aid agencies said they are opening bakeries and handing out high-energy biscuits, and Hamas police have returned to the streets to help restore order. Before the ceasefire, aid organizations said delivery was complicated by armed gangs looting the trucks, attacks on aid workers, arduous Israeli inspections and difficulties coordinating with COGAT, the Israeli military body charged with facilitating aid. Israel blamed the U.N. and humanitarian organizations for failing to deliver aid once it reached Gaza. There’s now the 'political will to make everything else work,' said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement. 'COGAT is fast-tracking responses to coordination requests. It’s allowing two crossings instead of one to operate in the north. The ceasefire is allowing Hamas forces to operate freely to stop looting … and the lack of hostilities allow aid agencies to move freely and safely,' Hary said. Food prices are still a challenge Nadine Jomaa, a young woman in Bureij in central Gaza, said the aid is not freely available, and she needs to buy goods in the market, where they are resold for inflated prices. Though prices are coming down, flour and cooking gas still cost roughly triple the amount they did before the war, according to the World Food Program. Her family is eating only cheap canned goods. 'We need more food, water, household items for the kitchen and bathroom and women’s items,' she said. Although humanitarian officials have long said the best way to prevent extortion is to flood Gaza with aid, Palestinians in the north say that, so far, the influx appears to have only boosted shadowy middlemen. Residents complain that there are not nearly enough tents entering Gaza while non-essential items such as chocolate, nuts and soda are suddenly ubiquitous. Ahmed Qamar, 34, who returned to live in the ruins of his former home in Jabaliya, said his area has seen just a few dozen aid trucks. 'Hundreds of families here are sleeping in the open and in the cold,' he said. 'We need electricity and shelter, and meanwhile markets are flooded with chocolate and cigarettes.' Though aid workers say the Israeli inspection process has accelerated, getting certain types of aid into Gaza is still challenging. Some items are deemed 'dual-use,' barring them from Gaza because of concerns they could be diverted by militants for military purposes. Some hospitals and desalination plants still have fuel shortages. And Hamas on Sunday accused Israeli officials of obstructing the delivery of medical supplies and reconstruction machinery. According to a list circulated to humanitarian groups by COGAT and shared with The Associated Press, desalination and water-collection devices, storage units, tools, tent kits, ovens, water-resistant clothing and equipment for shelter construction teams all require 'pre-approval' before entering Gaza. Large tents, sleeping bags, portable toilets, heating pads and vaccines are cleared to enter the strip without Israeli approval. 'While aid is getting in in higher numbers, we also know that those restrictions on essential items are persisting,' said Sophie Driscoll, head of communications for the International Rescue Committee in the Palestinian territories. COGAT acknowledged keeping certain items on the dual-use list but said it is still permitting them into Gaza after screening. The agency said tents are not considered dual-use, and Israel has allowed tens of thousands into Gaza in recent weeks 'without restriction.' It also said Israel has extended the hours crossings are open and allowed road repairs inside Gaza. 'Regarding the distribution of aid inside Gaza, Israel does not control the situation inside,' COGAT said. Destroyed roads, unexploded ordnance Roads have been heavily damaged by the war, and unexploded bombs litter the landscape. The U.N. estimates that 5% to 10% of all ammunition dropped in Gaza has failed to detonate, making the territory potentially perilous for civilians and aid workers. UNMAS, the U.N. agency handling unexploded ordnance, said that since the ceasefire took hold, humanitarian convoys and civilians have reported finding large aircraft bombs, mortars and rifle grenades. As they return home, many Palestinians are living in areas where the water network has been destroyed. That makes dehydration and the spread of disease due to poor sanitary conditions and limited medical care a threat. Speaking from southern Gaza, Jonathan Crickx, chief of communications at UNICEF, recalled being on a road where 'thousands and thousands of children and families were walking.' 'I was seeing them with nothing,' he said, 'only the clothes they’re wearing on their back.' ___ Associated Press writer Isabel DeBre contributed to this report from Ramallah, West Bank.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-aid-is-surging-into-gaza-under-the-ceasefire-is-it-helping/	2025-02-03T03:51:35-08:00	
The Gaza war is paused, but Israel and Hamas keep up a fierce bat...	LONDON (AP) — Arbel Yehoud is achingly close to freedom, but her face is a study of shadow and terror. She is dwarfed by dozens of masked Hamas fighters — and beyond them, a heaving mob of chanting men who surround her and fill the frame. In the next, Yehoud looks up at her captors, pleading. But video suggests they're on the edge themselves, barely able to hold back the people impeding Yehoud's dash to safety under the terms of a ceasefire deal. Cut to photos of her friends and family in Israel, watching the handover live — hands over their mouths, breathless. Yehoud makes it into waiting vehicles, and then to Israel. Cue the government's images of her joyous reunion with her parents. The visuals out of Israel and Gaza during recent hostage-for-prisoner swaps were part of a choreographed battle of optics waged in parallel to the 16-month ground war between Israel and Hamas. Each side uses the light and shadow of images to make themselves look virtuous and strong — and each other monstrous and weak. It's propaganda. But some images also tell the truth: The chaos during Yehoud's release in Gaza on Thursday, for example, reflected the fragility of the ceasefire deal that took effect Jan. 19. 'All of this was filmed and intentionally shared,' said Danielle Gilbert, an expert on hostage-taking at Northwestern University. 'Social scientists talk about the idea of a collapse of compassion. Audience pay more attention and are willing to take more of a risk to recover, or help, individual victims.' Throughout history, both sides of hostage standoffs and POW releases have tried to capitalize on the plight of those in captivity by focusing on details of the names, faces, families and conditions of captivity. Even in war, branding is a potent force. Proof of life, or lack of it, injects urgency into negotiations Since at least the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh's baby son in 1932, images of hostages have been pivotal elements of negotiations because they carry an intense emotional charge. We can’t, for example, unsee images of bound and blindfolded Americans taken captive in Iran in 1979. Or the photo of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl holding up a newspaper, a sign of life, before his Islamic militant captors killed him in 2002. Or the image of a masked Arab commando, captured in black-and-white in 1972, on the balcony of the Munich Olympic Village building. Inside, a Palestinian group called Black September killed 11 Israeli team members. The Israel-Hamas media duel, waged heavily on social media, exploded the moment thousands of Hamas fighters defeated Israel’s borders on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and dragging about 250 back to Gaza. Cameras anchored to the militants themselves, as well as phones hoisted by the Israelis under attack, captured the killing-and-hostage-taking spree in such detail that some viewers reported a type of trauma — called vicarious or secondary trauma — just from seeing them. Billions of American dollars and other aid have been influenced at least in part by public opinion, which has fluctuated over the course of the conflict. Anti-Israel protests raged around the world, antisemitism surged and disinformation about the conflict proliferated. The International Criminal Court last year issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ late military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the Gaza war. The embattled Israeli leader has vowed to fight the allegations. Israel has used images to argue that it was Hamas that waged crimes against humanity. Within a month of the attacks, the army compiled a film of the grisliest moments of the Hamas attack called 'Bearing Witness' in English and 'The Film of Horrors' in Hebrew. The Israeli government invited select journalists, diplomats and Hollywood executives to watch it at screenings in several countries. In Tel Aviv, a briefing on the film came as Israel cut off vital supplies to the Gaza Strip and pounded the territory with airstrikes. The film has provided a justification of sorts for Israel's fierce tactics. Spectacles of strength, chaos and smiles Since the ceasefire began, Hamas has turned each round of hostage releases into a spectacle with large crowds, flags and smiling, waving hostages on stages. For the militants, it’s a chance to show off their survival as a fighting force and ongoing control of Gaza after 15 months of heavy fighting. At least 47,000 people have been killed by Israel’s bombardment of the enclave, according to local health officials, and nearly all of Gaza’s population has been displaced. The destruction has quieted under the ceasefire, but people in Gaza have little to return to after the airstrikes reduced much of the territory to rubble. The images of hostages being led through the crowds Thursday raised the question of whether Hamas is really in control. Netanyahu condemned the 'shocking scenes' and called on international mediators to ensure the safety of hostages in future releases — a commitment he said he later received. Saturday's hostage release proceeded smoothly, providing strong evidence that Hamas remains firmly in charge, and images of the handovers told more of the story. Hamas let three Israeli hostages go while on camera with certificates reading, 'release order.' Ahead of the third release, seven masked men stood on a stage decorated with pictures of dead Hamas leaders and the sign 'Zionism will not win.' Across the border, Israeli TV stations have filmed the emotional reunions, in which family and friends watching their loved ones' releases on live television, shifting from tense quiet to excited cheers and, often, tears. 'There he is!' shouted the wife of Keith Siegel, watching a TV screen as he was released. The government follows up with photos and videos of the traumatized ex-captives reuniting with their families in person, smiles hugs and tears on Israeli TV for hours in a recurring loop. Those scenes are only the start of long and difficult roads toward recovery for the hostages and the families. But the exuberant moments serve a purpose in a country where one stated goal of the war is to bring the hostages home, and where Israelis are bitterly divided over the slow pace of their return. Many hostage families have accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war for his own political survival. In this conflict, the absence of images also tells a story. Yarden Bibas, 35, was one of the three hostages released with full choreography on Saturday. But there's been no word on the fate of his family. Their abduction, filmed by Hamas, has become a symbol of the brutality of the siege. In it, Shiri Bibas tearfully clutches her two red-haired sons — Ariel, then 3, and Kfir, 9 months — as Hamas fighters surround her. In November 2023, Hamas released a video of the boys' father, Yarden, weeping on camera as he is told his family is dead. Israel has not confirmed their condition. On Saturday, Israel aired footage of Yarden in Israel, appearing weary with his eyes closed, stepping into the arms of his waiting family. ___ Associated Press writer Josef Federman contributed from Jerusalem.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-the-gaza-war-is-paused-but-israel-and-hamas-keep-up-a-fierce-battle-of-optics-over-hostage-releases/	2025-02-02T16:31:56-08:00	
Israel's Netanyahu heads to US to discuss 'victory over Hamas' wi...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he will discuss 'victory over Hamas,' countering Iran and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries in his meeting with President Donald Trump. Tuesday's meeting at the White House will be Trump's first with a foreign leader since returning to office. It comes as U.S. and Arab mediators begin the daunting work of brokering the next phase of a ceasefire agreement to wind down the 15-month war in Gaza. Hamas, which has reasserted control over Gaza since the ceasefire began last month, has said it will not release hostages in the second phase without an end to the war and Israeli forces' full withdrawal. Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from far-right governing partners to resume the war after the first phase ends in early March. He has said Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages captured in the militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. It's unclear where Trump stands. He has been a staunch supporter of Israel, but has also pledged to end wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire agreement. The deal has led to the release of 18 hostages as well as hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to Al-Awda Hospital. Israel's military said it fired on the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu embraces Trump's call for ‘peace through strength’ Ahead of his departure, Netanyahu said he and Trump would discuss 'victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis in all its components,' referring to Iran's alliance of militant groups across the region, including Hamas. He said they could 'strengthen security, broaden the circle of peace and achieve a remarkable era of peace through strength.' The war began when thousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Over 100 were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, eight have been rescued alive and dozens of bodies have been recovered by Israeli forces. Israel's air and ground war has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities who do not say how many of the dead were fighters. The war has left large parts of several cities in ruins and displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million. Under the ceasefire's first phase, Hamas is to release 33 hostages, eight of whom Hamas says are dead, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most areas and allowed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to devastated northern Gaza while aid flows in. Negotiations on the second phase, which would end the war and see the remaining 60 or so hostages returned, are set to begin Monday with mediators the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. 'We started already engaging with the parties in order to define the agenda and to start engaging in those discussions,' Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani said Sunday, adding that 'we hope that we start to see some movement in the next few days.' Aspirations for a bigger deal Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, joined the yearlong ceasefire negotiations last month and helped push the agreement over the finish line. He met with Netanyahu in Israel last week and they were expected to formally begin talks on the second phase on Monday. Trump, who brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term, is believed to be seeking a wider agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia. But the kingdom has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. On Sunday, Jordan said its king had been invited to meet with Trump at the White House on Feb. 11. Jordan also supports Palestinian statehood and has rejected Trump's suggestion to relocate Palestinians from Gaza there and to Egypt. Netanyahu's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood, and a key partner, far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to leave the governing coalition if the war is not resumed next month. That would raise the likelihood of early elections in which Netanyahu could be voted out. Relatives of hostages and many other Israelis are impatient. 'The suffering that the families are going through as this drags on is inhuman,' the brother of newly released hostage Ofer Kalderon, Nissan Kalderon, said Sunday. Violence in the West Bank While the Gaza ceasefire has held for two weeks, Israel has increased operations in the occupied West Bank. On Sunday, the military said it was expanding an operation focused on the volatile city of Jenin to the town of Tamun and said it has killed over 50 'terrorists' so far. The Palestinian Health Ministry said a 73-year-old man was shot dead by Israeli troops in Jenin early Sunday. The military said a suspect was approaching soldiers as they operated in a combat zone and was 'stopped,' and the incident was under review. The ministry earlier reported five killed, including a 16-year-old, in Israeli airstrikes overnight. The military said it killed two militants — one of whom had been freed as part of the Gaza ceasefire in 2023 — in an airstrike on a village near Jenin. It said the two were planning an imminent attack, and that additional strikes targeted two other militant cells. Israeli forces on Sunday also carried out a wave of controlled demolitions that destroyed at least a dozen buildings in Jenin, taking down several multi-story residential structures. The military said it destroyed buildings used by militants. The U.N. humanitarian agency last week said Israeli forces have severely damaged or demolished 120 houses in their ongoing raid, and Palestinian security forces have wrecked another 50. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since the start of the war in Gaza, with Israel launching near-daily military arrest raids. There has also been a rise in settler violence against Palestinians and Palestinian attacks on Israelis. ___ Associated Press writers Samy Magdy in Cairo; Omar Akour in Amman, Jordan, Natalie Melzer in Jerusalem and Isabel DeBre in Ramallah, the West Bank, contributed to this report. —— Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israels-netanyahu-heads-to-us-to-discuss-victory-over-hamas-with-trump/	2025-02-02T16:26:15-08:00	
Takeaways from the AP interview with Ukraine’s Zelenskyy	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The Associated Press interviewed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday at a crucial juncture of the nearly three-year war against Russia’s full-scale invasion. U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to end the war within six months of his inauguration, but both sides are far apart, and it is unclear how a ceasefire deal could take shape. Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops continue to lose territory in eastern Ukraine, and the country faces near-daily Russian attacks targeting homes and infrastructure. That raises fears that Russian President Vladimir Putin prefers to wait out the war because he believes he will triumph. Here are some takeaways from AP’s interview with Zelenskyy: He says talks between Moscow and Washington must not exclude Ukraine Zelenskyy said talks between the U.S. and Russia about the war in his country that exclude Ukraine would be 'dangerous,' and he seeks more communication between the Trump administration and Kyiv. His remarks followed comments Friday by Trump, who said American and Russian officials were 'already talking' about ending the war. Trump said his administration has had 'very serious' discussions with Russia, but he did not elaborate. Zelenskyy said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a 'general level,' and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements. A planned visit by Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellog was postponed. Zelenskyy said it will be rescheduled. He also said he and Trump discussed meeting to develop a plan for a ceasefire. Zelenskyy hoped that would led to conversations with Russian officials. He says Trump can force Russia to make concessions A key question underlying any ceasefire proposal will be Russia’s willingness to engage in talks, especially now that its forces appear to have the upper hand on the battlefield. Zelenskyy said Putin interprets negotiating directly with Kyiv as losing. He said Trump could bring Putin to the table through the threat of sanctions targeting Russia’s energy and banking system, as well as continued support of the Ukrainian military. NATO is the 'cheapest' security guarantee option Zelenskyy said NATO membership is the 'cheapest' option for Ukraine's allies, and it would strengthen Trump geopolitically. Other scenarios that involve arming and training Ukraine’s 800,000-strong army would be expensive for U.S. and European allies to maintain over time, Zelenskyy said. He also said Ukraine’s armed forces would be a bonus for the alliance, especially if Trump seeks to bring back home overseas U.S. troops. Approving Ukraine’s NATO bid would be 'a great victory' for Trump, Zelenskyy added, in an apparent appeal to the president’s penchant for winners and business deals. Skepticism about putting European troops in Ukraine Zelenskyy said a French proposal to put European forces in Ukraine as a deterrent force is taking shape, but he expressed skepticism, saying many questions remained about the command-and-control structure and the number of troops and their positions. Zelenskyy said he told both French President Emmanuel Marcon and Trump that the option of putting European troops in Ukraine was welcome, but it would not be a sufficient security guarantee alone. He added: 'Imagine, there is a contingent. The question is who is in charge? Who is the main one? What will they do if there are Russian strikes? Missiles, disembarkation, attack from the sea, crossing of the land borderline, offensive. What will they do? What are their mandates?'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-takeaways-from-the-ap-interview-with-ukraines-zelenskyy/	2025-02-01T14:10:33-08:00	
Middle East latest: Hamas frees 3 hostages, Israel releases Pales...	Hamas freed three hostages in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday and Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners in the fourth round of exchanges during the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The six-week phase one truce calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 prisoners, as well as the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory. Israel and Hamas are set next week to begin negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached. Palestinian health authorities in Gaza also announced that the long-shuttered Rafah border crossing with Egypt would reopen on Saturday for thousands of Palestinians who desperately need medical care — a breakthrough that signals the ceasefire agreement continues to gain traction. —— Here's the latest: Family of Bibas rejoice at his freedom TEL AVIV, Israel — The family of Yarden Bibas says 'there are no words to describe the relief of holding Yarden in our hands, embracing him, and hearing his voice,' after his release from Hamas' captivity on Saturday. Bibas, 35, was taken hostage from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oc. 7, 2023. His wife, Shiri, and their two young boys, Ariel and Kfir, were also taken that day and are still captive in Gaza. It is unknown if they are still alive. 'Yarden has returned home, but the home remains incomplete,' the family wrote. 'Yarden is a father who left his safe room to protect his family, bravely survived captivity, and returned to an unbearable reality.' The family said it 'continues with hope' and made a plea to the public to keep pressing for the release of all remaining hostages. Argentinian officials celebrate the release of an Israeli-Argentine hostage JERUSALEM — Argentinian officials are celebrating the release of Israeli-Argentine Yarden Bibas from Hamas captivity after almost 16 months of the war in Gaza. President Javier Milei of Argentina, a staunch supporter of Israel, posted a stream of emotional videos all morning Saturday on X showing Bibas greeting his relatives after his release with long and tearful hugs. The Israeli Embassy in Argentina says that Bibas obtained Argentine citizenship through his wife, Shiri, and their two small children, Ariel and Kfir, are also Argentinian. The condition of Shiri and their two sons, the youngest hostages to be abducted during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, remains unclear. Hamas claimed last year that they had been killed by an Israeli airstrike, but Israeli officials never confirmed that. Axel Wahnish, a Sephardic rabbi and the Argentine ambassador to Israel, said that Argentine authorities were following Bibas’ release in the exchange closely. He expressed hope that 'all the kidnapped people can return safely to their homes.' Wahnish also praised Milei for his strong condemnations of Hamas, which he said stood in contrast to the 'silence of some leaders of the free world.' Released Palestinians describe harsh prison conditions in Israel RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinians who were sentenced to years in prison over deadly attacks against Israelis and released into the occupied West Bank described harsh conditions, beatings and other abuse in prison. Many appeared frail as they reveled in their homecoming on Saturday. Mohammad Kaskus, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison over his militancy during the second Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s, told The Associated Press that he faced beatings and intimidation during interrogations. He said that the food provisions in prison were insufficient, with meager snacks instead of full meals often leaving him hungry. The Israeli Prison Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Another released prisoner, Murad Hmeidan, who was serving a life sentence plus 25 years in a case also related to his involvement in attacks against Israelis, said 'the treatment was extremely bad.' He said that seeing the deaths of fellow prisoners in detention from wounds or illnesses over the years made him feel that 'there is a serious risk to the lives of everyone in Israeli prisons.' The Palestinian Prisoners' Society, an advocacy group, has recorded the deaths 54 Palestinians inside Israeli prison since Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Israel has previously said that military prosecutors are investigating Palestinian deaths in custody and did not offer further comment on Saturday. Arab nations reject Trump’s suggestion to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan CAIRO — Powerful Arab nations have rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan. Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League released a joint statement on Saturday following a meeting of foreign ministers. They said they reject any plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Yarden Bibas seen arriving in Israeli hospital after release from Gaza TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli army released footage of Yarden Bibas arriving at a hospital in central Israel and meeting his mother for the first time after his release earlier Saturday from 15 months of captivity in Gaza. The two are seen locked in a silent embrace. Bibas, 35, returned to Israel without his wife, Shiri Bibas, or his two young sons, Kfir and Ariel, who remain in captivity. Hamas claims the three were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel has not confirmed their deaths but says it is gravely concerned for their welfare. Ariel was 4 years old and Kfir was 9 months old when they were taken with their mother during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza. In a post on X, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed Bibas along with Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegal, who were also freed on Saturday. He added, 'Our thoughts are now with Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas and all our hostages. We will continue to work to bring them home.' Freed hostage Keith Siegel arrives in hospital in Israel JERUSALEM — Newly released hostage Keith Siegel looked frail and appeared to be walking slowly in footage released by the Israeli military shortly after his release from captivity in Gaza. Still, in Associated Press footage the 65-year-old Israeli-American refused a wheelchair upon landing at the hospital where doctors will check his medical condition. Wrapped in an Israeli flag, we waved to people in nearby balconies waving back at him. Siegel was injured in the Hamas attack October 7, 2023, his ribs broken and hand bleeding when he was dragged into Gaza, according to his wife Aviva Siegel, who was taken hostage with him but released in November 2023. Watching the first moments of her husband’s release on television in a southern border community near Gaza as she waited to reunite with him, Aviva Siegel said, 'There he is, Keith, there he is, wow!' 'They’ve put a hat on him!' she exclaimed. Released hostage thanks the Israeli people for their support JERUSALEM - Israel’s military published a photo of recently freed hostage Yarden Bibas in a military helicopter shortly after his release Saturday, holding a sign thanking Israelis for their support. 'I thank all the people of Israel for the support and help. I’ve heard from my family that you fought for me,' read the message Bibas held up to the camera. Bibas, 35, returns to Israel without his wife, Shiri Bibas, or his two boys, Kfir and Ariel, who remain in captivity. The family’s plight — and the two boys with their shocks of ginger hair — have captivated Israelis, and Yarden’s release dims hopes that the three others are alive. Family of Keith Siegal says they can ‘breathe again’ as he returns to Israel JERUSALEM — The family of Keith Siegel said they could breathe again as he returned to Israel after being released by Hamas. Siegel, an American Israeli from North Carolina, was captured from the communal farming village by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023. 'Finally, after 484 long, terrifying days and nights, full of immense worry for our father, we can breathe again,' his family wrote in a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters. Siegel’s family also thanked U.S. President Donald Trump, the American and Israeli governments, and the Israeli military for securing his return. Israel says all 183 Palestinian prisoners set for release are now free RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Israeli Prison Authority says that all 183 Palestinian prisoners slated for release on Saturday have been freed. Most of them, including 111 arrested after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, were released to Gaza. Just over two dozen returned to cheering crowds in the occupied West Bank. Another seven serving life sentences were transferred to Egypt ahead of their deportation. That concludes the fourth prisoner-for-hostage swap in the six-week initial phase of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Sick and wounded children leave Gaza for treatment as border crossing reopens RAFAH CROSSING, Egypt — A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing to Egypt for treatment through Gaza’s Rafah crossing on Saturday, in the first opening of the border since Israel captured it nearly nine months ago. The reopening of the Rafah crossing represents a significant breakthrough that bolsters the ceasefire deal Israel and Hamas agreed to earlier this month. Israel agreed to reopen the crossing after Hamas released the last living female hostages in Gaza. Egyptian television showed an Palestinian Red Cross ambulance pulling up to the crossing gate, and several children were brought out on stretchers and transferred to ambulances on the Egyptian side. Prisoners released by Israel include aid worker jailed in controversial case RAMALLAH, West Bank — One of the most prominent Palestinians being released on Saturday is aid worker Mohammed el-Halabi, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison in a high-profile case that drew criticism from rights groups. El-Halabi had worked as the Palestinian manager of the Gaza branch of World Vision, a major Christian aid organization. He was was arrested in 2016 and accused of diverting tens of millions of dollars to Hamas. Both el-Halabi, 47, and World Vision vigorously denied the allegations and independent investigations found no proof of wrongdoing. Rights groups say el-Halabi was denied a fair and transparent trial, as he and World Vision had no chance to review the evidence against them. His prolonged detention sent a chill through nongovernmental groups providing aid to Palestinians in Gaza. Israel begins freeing Palestinian prisoners OFER MILITARY PRISON, West Bank — Israel has begun freeing 183 Palestinian prisoners due for release after Hamas freed three hostages as part of the ceasefire deal that has halted 15 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip. A bus departed Ofer Military Prison with some 32 prisoners headed for the West Bank. About 150 other prisoners were being sent to Gaza or deported. According to Palestinian authorities, a total of 183 Palestinian prisoners are to be released, including dozens serving lengthy or life sentences and 111 people from the Gaza Strip who were arrested after Oct. 7, 2023, and held without trial. Palestinian Authority says Israel will begin releasing Palestinians held without trial after Oct. 7 attack RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Palestinian Authority’s commission of prisoners’ affairs says that a total of 183 Palestinian prisoners are slated for release Saturday in exchange for the three Israeli hostages held in Gaza. In a sign that the ceasefire agreement is progressing, this release departs from the previous formula of 30 Palestinian prisoners for each Israeli hostage to include more Palestinian detainees who were rounded up in Gaza after the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that began the war. As part of the ceasefire deal, Israel has agreed to release about 1,000 Palestinians from Gaza who were detained on suspicion of militancy and have been held without trial since the day after the Oct. 7 attack. The Palestinian Authority said that on Saturday, Israel will release 111 of these Palestinians from Gaza on the condition that they did not participate in the Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7, 2023, the first of what will be several such releases staggered over the six weeks of the Phase 1 ceasefire deal. The other 72 Palestinians set to be released Saturday were serving long or life sentences on national security charges connected to their involvement in deadly attacks against Israelis. Of that group, 32 hail from the occupied West Bank, where families and friends on Saturday were anxiously awaiting their return, and another 39 come from Gaza. Seven of the prisoners serving life sentences will be transferred to Egypt before further deportation under the terms of the ceasefire agreement. Freed hostage reunites with father and sister TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military published footage of released hostage Yarden Bibas reuniting with his father and sister at a military base outside of Gaza, where he is undergoing initial medical checks immediately after entering Israel. He closed his eyes as his father, Eli, and sister Ofri hugged him fiercely. 'Sweetheart,' his father said, as the family embraced and cried. Bibas, 35, is the father of the two youngest hostages in Gaza, whose plight has become a rallying cry for Israelis. The Bibas sons — 4 years old and 9 months old at the time of their abduction — and their mother, Shiri, are still in captivity, and feared dead. Shiri Bibas and the two children are the last woman and children held in captivity in Gaza who have not been confirmed dead by Israel. In November 2023, Yarden Bibas was filmed by Hamas as he was told that Shiri Bibas and the children were kidnapped and killed in an Israeli airstrike. In the video, filmed under duress, Yarden is sobbing and pleading with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring their bodies to Israel for burial. Israel dismissed the video as 'psychological terror' and said there was no concrete information about the status of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas, but there have been no signs of life from the three in the past year. Siegel returns to Israel Israel confirmed that American Israeli hostage Keith Siegel had crossed the border from Gaza after being handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross at a ceremony in Gaza City. The Israeli military said in a statement that he was headed to a reception point at a military base, where he would be met by family members before heading to a hospital. Family of French Israeli hostage celebrates his return PARIS — The family of Ofer Kalderon said they were 'overwhelmed with joy, relief and emotion' after his release by Hamas. Kalderon, a 54-year-old French-Israeli citizen, was one of three male hostages released Saturday as part of a ceasefire deal that halted fighting in Gaza after more than 15 months of war. Kalderon was kidnapped by Hamas from the Nir Oz kibbutz on Oct. 7, along with his daughter Sahar and son Erez. The children were released in November 2023 during a temporary ceasefire. 'Today, we finally embrace Ofer, seeing and truly comprehending that he is here with us,' his family said in a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters. 'We have witnessed how, through extraordinary mental strength, he survived this hell. Ofer endured months in a nightmare, and we are proud of his ability to survive and hold onto the hope of embracing his children again.' The family added a note of support for the remaining hostages still being held by Hamas. 'In the midst of this emotional moment, we must remember all the hostages who remain behind. We have no right to stop until all 79 hostages return home — whether for rehabilitation or for burial,' the family said. Kibbutz members cheer as their neighbor is released There were sighs of relief and cheers in the living room where members of Kibbutz Kfar Aza watched Hamas militants hand over hostage Keith Siegel to the Red Cross. Siegel, an American Israeli from North Carolina, was captured from the communal farming village by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023. His neighbors gathered anxiously in front of the television as they watched footage of Siegel, looking thin, emerging from a vehicle and walking through a crowd in Gaza city, flanked by Hamas militants. Many of those in the room were family friends. They applauded upon seeing Siegel’s face. Some teared up. Siegel is one of the highest-profile hostages, now a household name in Israel after his wife Aviva Siegel, also captured in the Hamas attack, mounted a public campaign to bring him home after her own release from captivity in November 2023. Hamas hands over U.S.-Israeli hostage Hamas has handed American Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, 65, over to the Red Cross, the third hostage to be released Saturday as part of a ceasefire deal with Israel. Siegel walked onto a stage set up by the sea in Gaza City before militants handed him over to waiting Red Cross officials. Earlier, the militants released Yarden Bibas, 35, and French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54, to the Red Cross in similar scenes in the town of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. All three had been abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war. Macron hails release of French citizen French President Emmanuel Macron has hailed the release of French-Israeli citizen Ofer Kalderon, while noting that another French citizen remains a hostage. 'Ofer Kalderon is free! We share the immense relief and joy of his family after 483 days of unimaginable hell,' Macron posted on X. Our thoughts are with Ohad Yahalomi, still in the hands of Hamas, and his family. France is doing everything in its power to secure his immediate release.' Red Cross vehicles arrive in Gaza City for planned hostage release Red Cross vehicles have arrived in Gaza City where Hamas is set to release American Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, 65, as part of the fourth round of hostage releases in its ceasefire deal with Israel. Two other hostages — Yarden Bibas, 35, and French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54 — were released earlier Saturday in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. In return for the three, Israel is to release dozens of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-2-freed-hostages-are-back-in-israel/	2025-02-01T07:16:10-08:00	
Russian drone and missile attacks kill 8 in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — At least eight people died overnight as Russian drone and missile strikes pounded Ukraine’s towns and cities, local officials said Saturday. Meanwhile, Moscow’s troops continued their grinding advance through the country’s east. A Russian missile strike on an apartment block in the Ukrainian city of Poltava killed at least seven people and injured 14 more, including three children, Ukraine's Interior Ministry said. Some 22 people were rescued from the five-story building, which partially collapsed following the attack, said the Poltava region’s acting governor, Volodymyr Kohut. He also announced that the region would observe three days of mourning for the victims of the attack. Rescue teams remain at the site. Elsewhere, a 60-year-old woman was killed by falling debris from a downed drone in the Kharkiv region, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov wrote on social media. The bombardment comes as Russian forces continue their monthslong campaign to capture the key Donetsk strongholds of Pokrovsk and nearby Chasiv Yar, fighting their way across farm fields and woodland and engulfing small rural settlements. Russia's Ministry of Defense said Saturday that its troops had taken control of Krymske, a suburb to the north of the contested frontline town of Toretsk in Ukraine's Donetsk region. Russian troops have been fighting for the settlement in a grinding assault throughout the winter of 2024. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said last week that it expected the Russians to take full control of Toretsk 'within days.' 'Last night, Russia launched an attack on our cities using various types of weapons: missiles, attack drones, and aerial bombs,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on social media Saturday. 'Every such act of terror proves that we need greater support in defending against Russian terror. Every air defense system, every interceptor missile, means a life saved.' Ukraine's southern metropolis of Odesa also came under attack late Friday, with Russian missiles falling on the city's historic center, designated a world heritage site by the U.N. cultural organization UNESCO. Seven people were injured in the attack, which also saw debris fall close to the city's ornate 19th-century opera house. Norwegian diplomatic representatives were also in the area during the strike, said local Gov. Oleh Kiper. The full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine, which began nearly three years ago and shows no signs of ending, has killed more than 10,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the United Nations. Many have been evacuated from areas along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line where Ukrainian defenses are straining to hold the bigger Russian army at bay. Civilians have endured hardship caused by Russian attacks on the power grid that have denied them heating and running water. Saturday’s missile attack prompted emergency power grid shutdowns in seven Ukrainian regions, including Poltava, state energy company Ukrenergo said. Ukrainian strikes also hit Russia, with air defenses intercepting nine drones across the country’s Bryansk, Belgorod and Saratov regions, Russia’s Defense Ministry said in a statement Saturday morning. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russian-drone-and-missile-attacks-kill-4-in-ukraine/	2025-02-01T06:37:27-08:00	
Trump says he and Putin could do something 'significant' toward e...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday said his administration has already had 'very serious' discussions with Russia about its war in Ukraine and that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon take 'significant' action toward ending the grinding conflict. 'We will be speaking, and I think will perhaps do something that’ll be significant,' Trump said in an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office. 'We want to end that war. That war would have not started if I was president.' Trump did not say who from his administration has been in contact with the Russians but insisted the two sides were 'already talking.' Asked if he has already spoken directly with Putin, Trump was coy: 'I don't want to say that.' Trump has said repeatedly he wouldn’t have allowed the conflict to start if he had been in office, even though he was president as fighting grew in eastern Ukraine between Kyiv’s forces and separatists backed by Moscow, ahead of Putin sending in tens of thousands of troops in 2022. Trump since returning to office has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying he should have made a deal with Putin to avoid the conflict. The president in a Fox News interview earlier in January ridiculed Zelenskyy as 'talking so brave,' when Ukraine was so dependent on U.S. aid to fight its war. 'They were brave, but we gave them billions of dollars,' Trump said. In a recent interview with Russian state television, Putin praised Trump as a 'clever and pragmatic man' who is focused on U.S. interests. 'We always had a business-like, pragmatic but also trusting relationship with the current U.S. president,' Putin said. 'I couldn’t disagree with him that if he had been president, if they hadn’t stolen victory from him in 2020, the crisis that emerged in Ukraine in 2022 could have been avoided.' The Russian's president's statement was also a blunt endorsement of Trump’s refusal to accept his defeat in the 2020 election. Numerous federal and local officials, a long list of courts, top former campaign staffers and even his own attorney general have all said there is no evidence of the fraud he alleges. Trump in his 2024 campaign vowed to bring a quick end to the war, and repeatedly criticized President Joe Biden's administration for spending billions in U.S. taxpayer money on military and economic aide for Kyiv to help it fight back against Russia. Trump’s relationship with Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. Trump publicly sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence officials on whether Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to help him, and Trump has praised the Russian leader and even called him 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-trump-says-he-and-putin-could-do-something-significant-toward-ending-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-31T14:49:18-08:00	
Middle East latest: Militants in Gaza release 8 Thai and Israeli ...	Militants in the Gaza Strip released eight hostages on Thursday, handing them over to the Red Cross amid chaotic crowds as part of a swap that is set to see 110 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons later in the day. Agam Berger, a 20-year-old soldier, was handed over first at a site in the heavily destroyed urban refugee camp of Jabaliya in northern Gaza, followed hours later by two more Israelis and five Thai farm workers who were handed over amid a chaotic crowd in the city of Khan Younis. It's the third such exchange since a ceasefire took hold in the Gaza Strip earlier this month. The tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is aimed at ending the war in Gaza and securing the release of dozens of hostages held by the militant group, as well as hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned or detained by Israel. Under the ceasefire, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have jubilantly returned to northern Gaza over the past three days. However, their homecoming has been bittersweet as nearly everyone has friends or relatives who died, and many northern neighborhoods have been transformed into an apocalyptic landscape of devastation by more than 15 months of war. ___ Here's the latest: Israeli president thanks Thai government for support JERUSALEM — Israel’s president thanked the Thai government for its support as he met with the Thai ambassador Thursday, ahead of the release of five Thai hostages from captivity in Gaza. The Thai government confirmed Thursday that five Thai hostages were released from Gaza. The hostages, who were pulled from the farming communities in southern Israel where they worked as agricultural laborers on Oct. 7, 2023, were among 31 Thais taken by Hamas. President Isaac Herzog said in a statement posted to X that he told Pannabha Chandraramya, the ambassador of Thailand to Israel, that 'the people of Israel are very moved by the release of our Thai brothers from the hell of captivity.' He thanked the Thai government for its support and vowed to continue trying to secure the release of Thai hostages who remain in Gaza. Twenty-three others were already released. Another two have been confirmed dead, and the status of one remaining person is not clear. Netanyahu puts Palestinian prisoners’ release on hold Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has put the release of Palestinian prisoners on hold until the 'safe release' of hostages is assured after a chaotic handover in Gaza. Netanyahu demanded that mediators intervene after some hostages released Thursday were led through a rowdy crowd of thousands by masked militants. Israel was supposed to release 110 Palestinian prisoners later Thursday, including around 30 serving life sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis. Agam Berger reunites with family at military base TEL AVIV, Israel — 'We’re here and we’re never leaving you,' Agam Berger’s mother, Merav, told her daughter in the moments of their initial reunion on Israeli soil after Agam’s release on Thursday from Hamas captivity. Berger, 20, was among five young female soldiers abducted when militants overran the Nahal Oz military base in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killing over 60 soldiers there. The other four were released Saturday. The family was reunited at a specially prepared reception area in a military base near the Gaza border. A pale looking Berger wiped away tears as she sat on her mother’s lap and held her father’s hand, as seen in footage released by the Israeli army. From the military base, Berger was flown to a hospital in central Israel, where she will meet her fellow released soldiers. Netanyahu condemns chaos during the release of hostages TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the chaotic scenes at the site of a second hostage release in Gaza on Thursday. Seven hostages were handed over to the Red Cross in Khan Younis and were then transferred to Israeli forces, the Israeli military said. Their release was delayed after armed militants struggled to contain the large Palestinian crowds that gathered around the Red Cross cars. The hostages were eventually led through the crowd surrounded by a ring of gunmen. 'I view with utmost severity the shocking scenes during the release of our hostages,' Netanyahu said in a statement released by his office shortly after the handover was completed. He said he 'demands that the mediators make certain that such terrible scenes do not recur and guarantee the safety of our hostages.' Israeli Red Cross says it has received 7 more hostages JERUSALEM — The Israeli army said the Red Cross has reported receiving seven more hostages, including two Israelis and five Thais, hours after an Israeli soldier was handed over at another location. Israel protests chaotic scenes surrounded hostage release JERUSALEM — Israeli officials have filed an angry complaint to international mediators over chaotic scenes surrounding the release of hostages. An Israeli official confirmed the protest, speaking on condition of anonymity because the release was still taking place. Militants lead second hostage through crowd ahead of release Militants led Israeli hostage Arbel Yehoud through a chaotic crowd in Gaza ahead of her release, hours after Hamas handed a captive Israeli soldier over to the Red Cross in the Gaza Strip. Yehoud was at the center of the dispute about the sequence of releases that briefly rocked the ceasefire over the weekend. Israel says she was supposed to have been freed Saturday and delayed the opening of crossings to northern Gaza when she was not. Israelis watch anxiously as friend nears departure from Gaza CARMEI GAT, Israel — A group of friends of Arbel Yehoud, a hostage set to be released Thursday, watched in tears and worried silence as the Israeli hostage appeared to be freed, surrounded by a large crowd of Palestinians. The friends sat in anxious silence at a private home in southern Israel as they watched a TV showing the large crowd of Palestinians gathered at the release point in Gaza. Some cried, others had their hands over their eyes or mouths. When a news anchor said the situation appeared dangerous, one yelled at her to 'shut up.' People began crying when Yehoud was seen walking through the crowd, escorted by gunmen, followed by reports that she had been turned over to the Red Cross. Most of the 20 or so people were survivors of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, including three former hostages released in a November 2023 ceasefire. The Associated Press was granted access to the event. Thai ambassador says she's ‘holding her breath’ BEER YAAKOV, Israel — Thailand’s ambassador to Israel said she was 'holding her breath' along with the entire country of Israel for the release of five Thai agricultural workers who were kidnapped on Oct. 7. 'We have nothing to do with this conflict, they just happened to be there, and they are working tirelessly on the farms and kibbutzes,' said Ambassador Pannabha Chandraramya as she watched footage from Gaza at the Israeli hospital where the Thai workers will be brought upon their return to Israel. She added that despite the war, Thai agricultural workers are continuing to come to Israel. Prior to the attack, less than 30,000 Thai workers were in Israel, mostly in the agricultural sector, and that number has grown to 38,000 today. Chandraramya said the Thai government had notified the families of all six surviving Thai hostages, because they are not sure which five will be released. The bodies of another two Thai hostages who were killed on Oct. 7, 2023 are also being held in Gaza. The Shamir Medical Center, outside of Tel Aviv, has a number of Thai-speaking social workers and psychologists to assist the hostages being released. Emir of Qatar meets with Syria's new interim leader DAMASCUS — The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, visited Syria on Thursday and met with newly installed interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa. He was the first head of state to visit Syria since the fall of former President Bashar Assad in a lighting rebel offensive last month. Qatari Minister of State Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al Khulaifi told journalists that the wealthy Gulf country 'will continue to provide the required support at all economic and service levels, as well as in terms of infrastructure and electricity' to Syria. Qatar had cut off relations with Damascus and backed rebel groups seeking to overthrow Assad in Syria’s nearly 14-year civil war. On Wednesday, the Syrian factions that toppled Assad named al-Sharaa, an Islamist former rebel leader who headed the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham militant group, as the country‘s interim president. Qatar was among the first countries to welcome al-Sharaa’s appointment. Israel says it intercepted Hezbollah surveillance drone JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it has intercepted a surveillance drone launched toward Israeli airspace by the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah reached a ceasefire in late November that ended some 14 months of fighting. Under the deal, both sides were to withdraw forces from southern Lebanon within 60 days. The deadline passed this week with Israeli troops still in Lebanon. But the U.S. said the sides had agreed to extend the ceasefire through Feb. 18 while Israel continues its withdrawal. Israel and Hezbollah have repeatedly accused each other of violating the deal. Red Cross arrives at site of second hostage handover KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Red Cross vehicles arrived at a location in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis where hostages are set to be released. The second handover site is in front of the destroyed home of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Hundreds of militants from Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group arrived earlier with a convoy in a show of force, and thousands of people gathered to watch, some from the tilted rooftops of bombed-out buildings. Israeli soldier Agam Berger released in Gaza Strip DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Hamas handed captive Israeli soldier Agam Berger over to the Red Cross at a ceremony in the heavily destroyed urban refugee camp of Jabaliya in northern Gaza. Berger, 20, was abducted alongside four other female soldiers, who were freed on Saturday. At a gathering in Tel Aviv, people cheered, clapped and whistled as they saw images of Berger being released on a TV screen, next to a large clock that’s counted the days the hostages have been in captivity. Some held signs saying 'Agam we’re waiting for you at home.' A short time later, Israel confirmed that Berger was with its military. Red Cross arrives at site of hostage release DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Red Cross vehicles arrived at the northern refugee camp of Jabaliya, where hundreds of masked militants and onlookers had gathered ahead of a planned release of hostages held in Gaza. Hamas set up two locations for the release, one in Jabaliya and the other in the southern city of Khan Younis in front of the destroyed home of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Video shows hostages set to be released JERUSALEM — The Islamic Jihad militant group has released a brief video of two hostages set to be released Thursday as part of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The video, without sound, shows Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Gadi Moses, 80, smiling and embracing one another. They were among scores of people abducted in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war. Islamic Jihad is a smaller and more extreme militant group allied with Hamas. It took part in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack. Mother of Thai hostage hears he's about to be freed BANGKOK — Khammee Lamnao, the mother of Thai hostage Surasak Lamnau, said the Thai embassy in Israel had called her Wednesday to let her know her son was one of the five who were to be released. 'I cannot wait to see my son,' the 53-year-old said. 'I’ve been waiting for him.' Surasak had been working in the agricultural sector in Israel for 15 months when he was taken hostage during the October 2023 attack. Thirty-one Thai nationals are believed to have been taken hostage when Hamas attacked Israel in October, 2023. Of those, 23 have been released, and two of the remaining hostages have been confirmed dead. Five surviving hostages are due to be released, and it is not clear at the moment what the status of the sixth person is. There were about 30,000 Thai workers — mostly laborers in the agricultural sector — in Israel prior to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, when militants stormed through a border fence and killed hundreds of Israelis and foreign nationals, including 41 Thai workers. At least 7,000 Thai workers are known to have returned home on government evacuation flights, but many others decided to stay for the opportunity to earn wages far higher than at home. Who's set to be released today? DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — The Israelis set to be released are Agam Berger, 20, a female soldier; Arbel Yehoud, a 29-year-old civilian woman; and Gadi Moses, an 80-year-old man. The names of the Thai hostages who were set to be freed were not released. Yehoud was at the center of the dispute about the sequence of releases that briefly rocked the ceasefire over the weekend. Israel says she was supposed to have been freed Saturday and delayed the opening of crossings to northern Gaza when she was not. Berger was abducted alongside four other female soldiers, who were freed on Saturday. Of the 110 people set to be released from prisons in Israel, 30 are serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis. Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent former militant leader and theater director who took part in a dramatic jailbreak in 2021 before being rearrested days later, is also among those set to be released. Ceasefire holds for now but next phase will be harder DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Today's exchange is part of a deal that paused fighting in Gaza on Jan. 19. Israeli forces have pulled back from most of Gaza, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remains of their homes and humanitarian groups to surge assistance. It calls for Hamas to release a total of 33 hostages, including women, children, older adults and sick or wounded men, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the hostages to be released in this phase are dead. The initial Phase One ceasefire paused fighting for six weeks, calling for the sides to use that time to negotiate a second phase in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages and the ceasefire would continue indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached. Negotiating a phase two deal could be difficult. Hamas says it won’t release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, after reasserting its rule over Gaza within hours of the truce. Meanwhile, Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, and a key far-right partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition is already calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase. ___ Corrects that 41, not 38, Thai workers were killed during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack and its aftermath.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-hostages-and-prisoners-set-to-be-released-as-ceasefire-holds/	2025-01-30T05:43:00-08:00	
Hamas frees 8 more hostages but Israel puts prisoner release on h...	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas-led militants freed eight hostages on Thursday as part of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, but the chaotic handover of some of the captives, who were shuttled through a rowdy crowd of thousands by masked militants, drew an angry protest from Israel. Israel was supposed to release 110 Palestinian prisoners later in the day, including around 30 serving life sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that was put on hold until the 'safe release' of hostages can be assured and called on mediators to intervene. Hamas released seven of the hostages in front of the destroyed home of its slain leader, Yahya Sinwar, as thousands pressed in. Hamas called it a 'message of determination,' but it triggered the latest in a series of disputes that have sent U.S. and Arab mediators scrambling to patch up the truce. The ceasefire is aimed at eventually ending the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas, and securing the release of dozens of hostages abducted in the militant group's Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. A show of force as hostages are released The first hostage — female soldier Agam Berger, 20 — was released after Hamas paraded her in front of a smaller crowd in the heavily destroyed urban Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza. Hours later, a chaotic scene unfolded at a handover of the other seven in the southern city of Khan Younis. Hundreds of militants from Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group arrived with a convoy, and thousands of people gathered to watch, some from the tilted rooftops of bombed-out buildings. Footage showed hostage Arbel Yehoud, 29, looking stunned as masked militants hustled her through the shouting crowd, pushing people back. Also released were Gadi Moses, an 80-year-old Israeli man, and five Thai laborers, identified by Israel as Watchara Sriaoun, 33; Pongsak Tanna, 36; Sathian Suwankam, 35; Bannawat Seathao, 27; and Surasak Lamnau, 32. A number of foreign workers were taken along with dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers during Hamas’ attack. Twenty-three Thais were among more than 100 hostages released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israel says three Thais remain in captivity, two of whom are believed to be dead. Yehoud had been at the center of a dispute earlier this week over the sequence in which the hostages would be released. The United States, Egypt and Qatar, which brokered the ceasefire after a year of tough negotiations, resolved it with an agreement that Yehoud would be released with the others on Thursday. About 20 friends of Yehoud gathered in southern Israel watched as the tense scene unfolded on live television. Some cried. Others had their hands over their eyes or mouths. The crowd then burst into tears after she was turned over to the Red Cross. Netanyahu condemned the 'shocking scenes' and called on international mediators to ensure the safety of hostages in future releases. Ceasefire holds for now but next phase will be harder In the first phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is set to release a total of 33 Israeli hostages, including women, children, older adults and sick or wounded men, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the hostages to be released in this phase are dead. Among those set to be released from prisons is Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent former militant leader and theater director who took part in a dramatic jailbreak in 2021 before being rearrested days later. Palestinians have cheered the release of the prisoners, who they widely see as heroes who have sacrificed for the cause of ending Israel’s decades-long occupation of lands they want for a future state. Israeli forces have meanwhile pulled back from most of Gaza, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remains of their homes and humanitarian groups to surge assistance. The deal calls for Israel and Hamas to negotiate a second phase in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages and the ceasefire would continue indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached. Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the truce. A key far-right partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition is already calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase. Hamas says it won't release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Tens of thousands killed Hamas started the war when it sent thousands of fighters storming into Israel. The militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Israel’s ensuing air and ground war was among the deadliest and most destructive in decades. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants. The Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence, and that it went to great lengths to try to spare civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in dense residential neighborhoods and put military infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques. The Israeli offensive has transformed entire neighborhoods into mounds of gray rubble, and it’s unclear how or when anything will be rebuilt. Around 90% of Gaza’s population has been displaced, often multiple times, with hundreds of thousands of people living in squalid tent camps or shuttered schools. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

A Russian drone strikes an apartment building in Ukraine, killing...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian drone blasted a hole in an apartment building in northeastern Ukraine during a nighttime attack, killing at least four people and injuring nine others, officials said Thursday. The Shahed drone blew out a wall and surrounding windows in the apartment block in Sumy, a major city, just after 1 a.m., the Sumy regional administration said. Four people were rescued from the rubble, and a child was among the injured, it said, adding that 120 people were evacuated. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it 'a terrible tragedy, a terrible Russian crime.' The war between Russia and Ukraine, which enters its fourth year next month and shows no signs of ending, has killed more than 10,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the United Nations. Civilians have also endured hardship caused by Russian attacks on the power grid that have denied them heating and running water. Many have been evacuated from areas along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line where Ukrainian defenses are straining to hold the bigger Russian army at bay. The fighting has been especially fierce in recent times in the eastern Donetsk region, which Russian forces partly occupy and appear bent on capturing completely in coming months. A Russian artillery strike on the Donetsk city of Kramatorsk injured eight people, including two young children, Donetsk regional head Vadym Filashkin wrote on his Telegram channel Thursday. 'Anyone who still remains in the Donetsk region is putting themselves in mortal danger,' Filashkin said. 'Take care of yourself! Evacuate.' Russia launched more than 80 drones at Ukraine overnight, the air force reported, in what are common nighttime barrages. Most of the drones were shot down or stopped by electronic jamming, it said. In Ukraine’s southern Odesa region, Russian drones damaged a hospital and two apartment buildings, regional head Oleh Kiper wrote on Telegram. No one was injured, he said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-a-russian-drone-strikes-an-apartment-building-in-ukraine-killing-at-least-4/	2025-01-30T04:12:52-08:00	
How did so many Thai farmers end up held hostage by Hamas?	BANGKOK (AP) — Five Thai nationals held hostage by Hamas since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel were released on Thursday. They were among 31 Thais taken by the militant group, of whom 23 have already been released. Another two have been confirmed dead, and the status of one remaining person is not clear. According to Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 46 Thais have been killed during the conflict, including the two who died in Hamas captivity. They were among tens of thousands of Thai workers in Israel. Here’s a look at what they were doing there. Why are there so many Thais in Israel? Israel once relied heavily on Palestinian workers, but it started bringing in large numbers of migrant workers after the 1987-93 Palestinian revolt known as the first Intifada. Most came from Thailand, and Thais remain the largest group of foreign agricultural laborers in Israel today, earning considerably more than they can at home. Thailand and Israel implemented a bilateral agreement a decade ago to ease the way for workers in the agriculture sector. Israel has come under criticism for the conditions under which the Thai farm laborers work. In a 2015 report, Human Rights Watch said they often were housed in makeshift and inadequate accommodations and 'were paid salaries significantly below the legal minimum wage, forced to work long hours in excess of the legal maximum, subjected to unsafe working conditions and denied their right to change employers.' A watchdog group found more recently that most were still paid below the legal minimum wage. How many Thais work in Israel? There were about 30,000 Thai workers, primarily working on farms, in Israel prior to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas. In the wake of the attack, some 7,000 returned home, primarily on government evacuation flights, but higher wages have continued to attract new arrivals. Thai ambassador to Israel Pannabha Chandraramya said Thursday that there are now more than 38,000 Thai workers in the country. What happened after they left? Faced with a labor shortage in the wake of the exodus after the Hamas attack, Israel’s Agriculture Ministry announced incentives to try and attract foreign workers back to evacuated areas. Among other things, it offered to extend work visas and to pay bonuses of about $500 a month. Thailand's Labor Ministry granted 3,966 Thai workers permission to work in Israel in 2024, keeping Israel in the top four destinations for Thais working abroad last year. Thai migrant workers generally come from poorer regions of the country, especially the northeast, and even before the bonuses the jobs in Israel paid many times what they could make at home. ___ Chalida Ekvitthayavechnukul contributed to this story.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-how-did-so-many-thai-farmers-end-up-held-hostage-by-hamas/	2025-01-30T03:32:43-08:00	
Hamas will free 3 Israelis and 5 Thais in next hostage release Th...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Hamas will release three Israelis, including two women and an 80-year-old man, as well as five Thai nationals during the next hostage release set for Thursday, Israel and Hamas said Wednesday as their tenuous ceasefire moves ahead. The Israeli women are Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Agam Berger, 20, and the man is Gadi Moses. The identities of the Thai nationals were not immediately known. A number of foreign workers were taken captive along with dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack that set off the war in Gaza. Twenty-three Thai hostages were released in the first ceasefire in November 2023. Israel says eight remain. Thursday's release would keep up the momentum of the ceasefire that began earlier this month and paused the 15-month war in Gaza. Hamas is releasing hostages in phases in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The prisoners range from individuals detained over minor offenses in recent months to senior militants serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks on Israeli civilians. Some have been held without charge or trial. Hostages and prisoners will be released twice this week The deal had been negotiated for months under the Biden administration but was finally sealed after incoming President Donald Trump threatened there would be 'hell to pay' if the hostages weren't returned. Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Israel on Wednesday and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who heads to Washington next week as the first foreign leader to meet Trump in his second term. The White House meeting on Feb. 4 comes a day after talks on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, aimed at ending the war, are meant to resume. Thursday's hostage release wasn't originally scheduled but came as a result of a standoff between Israel and Hamas over the identities of the hostages released last weekend. Israel had demanded that Yehoud, a civilian, be part of that group. When she wasn't freed, it held up the return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to war-battered northern Gaza. International mediation efforts brought about the plan for an additional release on Thursday and cleared the way for Palestinians to stream north. Another release occurs Saturday, which Netanyahu's office said would free male hostages. Dozens of Palestinian prisoners are set to be freed both Thursday and Saturday. Among the prisoners slated for release Thursday is Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent former militant leader and theater director whose dramatic jailbreak in 2021 thrilled Palestinians and stunned the Israeli security establishment. Egypt rejects Trump's suggestion that it take in Palestinians The pause in fighting has exposed the vastness of the destruction to Gaza's urban landscape, prompting Trump's suggestion over the weekend that neighboring Jordan and Egypt take in displaced Palestinians so that 'we just clean out that whole thing,' calling the territory 'a demolition site.' Egypt and Jordan, important U.S. allies, have rejected the suggestion, defying a U.S. president who has shown little patience for dissent from international partners. The Palestinians also rejected it amid fears it would undermine the notion of Palestinian statehood. In his first public comments on the issue, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi on Wednesday called the idea 'an injustice' and said the transfer of Palestinians 'can’t ever be tolerated or allowed.' He said the solution is the establishment of a Palestinian state. Trump has said he would urge the leaders of both countries, which are major recipients of U.S. aid, to accept the idea, saying the resettlement could be temporary or long term. It is not clear if Trump could force Egypt or Jordan to agree, but he has threatened hefty tariffs against other American allies to get his way. Egypt and Jordan receive billions of dollars in American aid each year. Military assistance to Egypt and Israel was exempted from a U.S. funding freeze to global aid programs. Palestinians fear they may never return if they leave The war has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their count. The fighting has obliterated vast areas of Gaza, displacing some 90% of its 2.3 million population, often multiple times. During its attack, Hamas took 250 people hostage and killed roughly 1,200. The theme of displacement has been recurrent in Palestinian history, and the idea of staying on one's land is integral to the Palestinian identity. Palestinians fear that if they leave, they may never be allowed to return. Those fears have been compounded by far-right members of Israel's government who support rebuilding Jewish settlements in Gaza, from which Israel withdrew troops and settlers from in 2005. Netanyahu says that idea is unrealistic. Egypt and Jordan have each made peace with Israel but support the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem. They fear that the permanent displacement of Gaza’s population could make that impossible. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Middle East latest: 2 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in occu...	The Palestinian Health Ministry says two Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in the occupied West Bank overnight and into Wednesday. A 23-year-old man was shot dead in Tulkarem and a 25-year-old man was killed in a strike on Jenin, where Israel launched a large operation earlier this month. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its reports. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip ignited the war there. The ministry says over 800 Palestinians have been killed. Most appear to have been militants killed in battle during Israeli arrest raids, but the dead also include people killed during violent protests, as well as civilian bystanders. There has also been an uptick in settler violence against Palestinians and Palestinian attacks on Israelis since the start of the war. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. ___ Here's the latest: Kremlin says Russian visit to Syria was important for building dialogue MOSCOW — Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that a Russian delegation’s visit to Damascus the day before, the first since the fall of former President Bashar Assad, an ally of Russia, was 'an important trip' for building dialogue with Syrian authorities. Peskoy refused to comment on reports that the Syrian authorities demanded that Moscow pay some kind of compensation to Syria or on unnamed sources claiming another demand was to extradite Assad, who fled to Russia and was granted asylum there. 'I am leaving this without any comment. We will continue the dialogue with the Syrian authorities,' Peskov said in a response to a reporter's question. Syrian state-run news agency SANA reported Wednesday that the discussions had included 'Russia’s role in rebuilding trust with the Syrian people through concrete measures such as reparations, reconstruction and recovery.' It said the talks were also on 'transitional justice mechanisms aimed at ensuring accountability and justice for the victims of the brutal war waged by the Assad regime.' Israeli authorities say they arrested 12 Palestinians in east Jerusalem JERUSALEM — Israeli authorities say they have arrested 12 Palestinians in east Jerusalem who celebrated the release of prisoners under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal. Israel’s internal Shin Bet security service and the police said they arrested the men late Tuesday after videos taken earlier in the week showed the men celebrating the release of the prisoners by waving Hamas flags and firing guns into the air. They say the Palestinians who celebrated the release had violated the ban on 'expressions of joy' and 'identification with Hamas' that Israel has imposed since the ceasefire took hold. They said a search revealed Hamas flags, posters, fireworks, a BB gun and cash. Under the first phase of the deal, Hamas is releasing 33 hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war in exchange for the release for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including some serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. Palestinians generally view the prisoners as heroes imprisoned for fighting against Israel’s decades-long occupation of lands they want for a future state.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-2-palestinians-killed-by-israeli-fire-in-occupied-west-bank-officials-say/	2025-01-29T03:40:35-08:00	
Western officials warn Ukraine over weapons procurement dispute	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Western officials have warned Ukraine that an escalating rift between the defense minister and procurement chief may jeopardize trust in the country and urged the government to resolve the situation quickly so as not to disrupt weapons supplies. The conflict began last week when the Defense Procurement Agency’s board unanimously voted to extend director Maryna Bezrukova’s contract for another year. However, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov overruled the decision, refusing to renew her contract. He accused her of poor performance and failing to deliver weapons and ammunition to front-line troops. The decision provoked an outcry from lawmakers and anti-corruption watchdogs who said the minister's move was illegal because Bezrukova had her contract extended by the agency’s supervisory board in January. They also came to Bezrukova’s defense, saying she has been instrumental in creating greater transparency and reforms within the DPA, which has long faced corruption allegations. Under Ukrainian law, Umerov’s decision to go ahead with her dismissal is illegal. The incident comes at a politically sensitive time for Ukraine as the country’s leadership is eagerly watching the Trump administration’s next moves, and as Ukrainian troops continue to face challenges in holding the line in the east amid fierce Russian attacks. In a statement posted Monday on social media platform X, the ambassadors representing Group of Seven nations urged the government to resolve the situation 'expeditiously and focus on keeping defense procurement going.' 'Consistency with good governance principles and NATO recommendations is important to maintain the trust of the public and international partners,' they said. Following Umerov's decision, the Anti-Corruption Action Center filed a complaint urging the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) to investigate him for alleged abuse of power. Local media reported that NABU opened proceedings against Umerov at the Anti-Corruption Action Center's request. Anastasiia Radina, a lawmaker and head of the Committee on Anti-Corruption Policy, called for Umerov’s dismissal, a decision that ultimately will fall to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 'What I see as a parliamentarian and as an observer is that his actions do not strengthen the agency and its independence. And that is just unacceptable for a country at war,' she told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine exchanged drone barrages overnight in an attempt to strike deeper into their enemy’s territory. The Russian military said Wednesday it intercepted and destroyed 104 Ukrainian drones over nine Russian regions in one of the biggest drone attacks on Russia this year. No casualties or significant damage was reported. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 57 Shahed and other drones overnight. Moscow also attacked with missiles overnight. In southern Mykolaiv, a Russian ballistic missile struck a food enterprise Tuesday night, killing two female workers, regional head Vitalii Kim said. Odesa authorities said Russian drones attacked port infrastructure in the Ismail district of the region that borders NATO member Romania Romania’s Ministry of National Defense said two F-16 fighter jets were dispatched at 3:20 a.m. to monitor airspace for about two hours, and emergency authorities issued text alerts to some residents living in Tulcea county, which is across the Danube river near Ukrainian ports. The ministry condemned the Russian attacks, calling them 'unjustified and in serious contradiction with the norms of international law,' and said NATO allies have been informed. Since the war next door started in February 2022, Romania has reported multiple airspace violations and confirmed drone fragments in its territory on several occasions. ___ Associated Press reporter Stephen McGrath in Sighisoara, Romania contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-western-officials-warn-ukraine-over-weapons-procurement-dispute/	2025-01-29T02:40:16-08:00	
Israeli father says even in Hamas captivity, his daughter heard h...	RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) — For more than 470 days, Eitan Gonen publicly pleaded with his daughter to stay alive while in Hamas captivity. He didn't know if she would hear him, but he ended every interview he gave with the same hopeful message: Romi is coming home alive. When he finally got to speak to his daughter for the first time in 15 months after she and two other women were freed Jan. 19, he got his answer. 'She said, ’Dad, I came home alive,'' Eitan Gonen told The Associated Press on Tuesday in his first interview with an international news outlet since her release. 'I know that my interview back then gave Romi a lot of strength, a lot of hope, something to cling on,' he said. Romi Gonen, 24, was among the first hostages to be freed from Gaza and one of seven women so far released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners as part of the ceasefire, a long and uncertain process aimed at eventually ending the war. Some 250 people were kidnapped during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. About 90 hostages remain in Gaza, although at least a third of them are believed to be dead. During the ceasefire's first phase, Hamas agreed to gradually release 33 hostages in exchange for Israel freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Six more hostages are expected to be released this week in exchange for hundreds of prisoners. Israel has been preparing for the hostages to return, with the expectation that after more than a year in captivity, many would likely be dealing with life-threatening health issues or other physical and psychological problems. This week, Dr. Ami Benov, who is working with the hostages, told reporters that the women were in poor physical condition and would face a lengthy recovery process, as they suffered from 'mild starvation' and vitamin deficiencies. Sitting in a complex in central Israel where his daughter and some of the other freed hostages are staying, Eitan Gonen wouldn't comment on Romi's health but said there's a long road ahead. 'The rehabilitation status just started,' he said. Because she spent so long in captivity, the family isn't pressuring her to speak. Instead, they are trying to give her autonomy and control, and to let her take things at her own pace, he said. Like many others, Romi was taken captive at the Nova music festival. That morning, her sister and mother, Merav Leshem Gonen, spent nearly five hours speaking to Romi as militants marauded through the festival grounds. Romi told her family that she would try to hide in the bushes, as the roads being clogged with abandoned cars made escape impossible. For nearly two months, her family had no idea if she was dead. They only learned she was alive from other hostages who were freed during a weeklong ceasefire a month after the attack, Eitan Gonen said. Praising his daughter's strength, he said she survived in part by learning Arabic, as it was the only way to communicate with her captors. 'Human beings will do anything to survive. Anything. And since the terrorists don’t speak any other language other than Arabic, she didn’t have any chance in order to communicate with them — to start learning their language,' he said, noting that she has even spoken it at times since being freed, likely out of habit. Something else that helped her stay alive was the support from other hostages, Eitan Gonen said. For a period, Romi was held with Emily Damari, a British-Israeli hostage who was released along with her. 'I believe God set it up somehow that Emily and Romi ... had each other to survive. ... It’s a dynamic duo,' he said. Other released hostages expressed similar sentiments about their own time in captivity. Israeli soldier Naama Levy, who was released Saturday, wrote in an Instagram post that after spending 50 days mostly alone, she was given strength when she was reunited with other kidnapped soldiers. Being held hostage with someone can provide strength through a shared fight for survival in the face of unimaginable adversity, said Dr. Einat Yehene, a psychologist who specializes in trauma and loss and who is head of rehabilitation at the Hostages Families Forum. Even though he finally got his daughter back, Eitan Gonen is still urging the Israeli government to keep working to bring home all of the remaining hostages. And he urges the families of hostages to keep giving interviews in all languages and mediums, to maintain the pressure and let their relatives know they haven't been forgotten. But he's mostly focusing on spending time with his daughter. 'I just enjoy being with her even in silence, touching, hugging, watching her,' he said. 'I missed it so much.' ___ Associated Press reporter Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israeli-father-says-even-in-hamas-captivity-his-daughter-heard-his-pleas-to-come-home-alive/	2025-01-29T00:25:24-08:00	
Trump invites Israel's Netanyahu to meet with him at the White Ho...	WADI GAZA, Gaza Strip (AP) — President Donald Trump has invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House next week as the first foreign leader to visit in Trump's second term, Netanhayu and the White House said Tuesday. The announcement came as the United States pressures Israel and Hamas to continue a ceasefire that has paused a devastating 15-month war in Gaza. Talks about the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, which aims to end the war, begin next Monday. The White House letter shared by Netanyahu's office, dated Tuesday, said 'I look forward to discussing how we can bring peace to Israel and its neighbors, and efforts to counter our shared adversaries.' The meeting on Feb. 4 is a chance for Netanyahu, under pressure at home, to remind the world of the support he has received from Trump over the years, and to defend Israel's conduct of the war. Last year, the two men met face-to-face for the first time in nearly four years at Trump’s Florida Mar-a-Lago estate. Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. military aid, and Netanyahu is likely to encourage Trump not to hold up some weapons deliveries the way the Biden administration did, though it continued other deliveries and overall military support. Netanyahu also wants Trump to put more pressure on Iran, and renew efforts to deliver a historic normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a rival of Iran and the Arab world’s most powerful country. Even before taking office this month, Trump was sending his special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region to apply pressure along with the Biden administration to get the current Gaza ceasefire achieved. But Netanyahu has vowed to renew the war if Hamas doesn’t meet his demands in negotiations over the ceasefire's second phase, meant to discuss a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' Over 375,000 return to northern Gaza Under the deal, more than 375,000 Palestinians have crossed into northern Gaza since Israel allowed their return on Monday morning, the United Nations said Tuesday. That represents over a third of the million people who fled in the war’s opening days. Many of the Palestinians trudging along a seaside road or crossing in vehicles after security inspections were getting their first view of shattered northern Gaza under the fragile ceasefire, now in its second week. Trump this week suggested that Egypt and Jordan take in Palestinians from Gaza, at least temporarily, so that 'we just clean out that whole thing' — which Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians swiftly rejected, fearing Israel would never allow a return. Instead, Palestinians were determined to pitch makeshift shelters or sleep outdoors amid the vast piles of broken concrete or perilously leaning buildings. After months of crowding in squalid tent camps or former schools in Gaza’s south, they would finally be home. 'It’s still better for us to be on our land than to live on a land that’s not yours,' said Fayza al-Nahal as she prepared to leave the southern city of Khan Younis for the north. At least two Palestinians set off for the north by sea, crowding into a rowboat with a bicycle and other belongings. Hani Al-Shanti, displaced from Gaza City, looked forward to feeling at peace in whatever he found, 'even if it is a roof and walls without furniture, even if it is without a roof.' One newly returned woman hung laundry in the ruins of her home, its walls blown out. Next steps Under the ceasefire, the next release of hostages held in Gaza, and Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody, is set to occur on Thursday, followed by another exchange on Saturday. In the ceasefire’s six-week first phase, a total of 33 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that ignited the war should be released, along with almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel this week said a list provided by Hamas confirmed the fears that eight of the 33 hostages to be freed are dead, bringing fresh grief to Israeli families who have long pressed the government to reach a deal to bring everyone home before time runs out. On Tuesday, one of the first hostages to be released under the current ceasefire – just the second in the war – shared a glimpse of life in captivity. Naama Levy, 20, wrote on social media that she spent most of the first 50 days alone before being reunited with other soldiers kidnapped from her military base on Oct. 7, well as other civilian captives. 'We strengthened each other until the day of our release, and also afterwards,' she wrote. Aid flows in A surge in humanitarian aid into Gaza continued under the ceasefire. 'In this past week alone, approximately 4,200 trucks carrying aid have entered the Gaza Strip following inspections,' said Israel’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel. Under the deal, 600 trucks of aid are meant to enter per day. The government of Qatar, a mediator in the ceasefire talks, said Tuesday that while complaints have been raised by both sides, no confirmed ceasefire violations have occurred that could cause the agreement to collapse. The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas. Militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 assault and abducted another 250. Israel responded with an air and ground offensive that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Lidman reported from Nahariya, Israel.

Tens of thousands return to shattered northern Gaza for the first...	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Tens of thousands of Palestinians streamed into Gaza’s most heavily destroyed area on Monday under a fragile ceasefire after Israel opened the north for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas. Israel, meanwhile, announced that eight of the hostages to be freed in the weeks ahead are dead. Massive crowds of Palestinians, some holding babies or pushing wheelchairs, walked with their belongings along a seaside road in a dramatic reversal of the mass exodus from the north that many had feared Israel would make permanent. Associated Press footage showed people still moving northward eight hours after the crossing opened. They were watched over by Israeli tanks on a nearby hill. Palestinians who have been sheltering in squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters are eager to return to their homes — even though they are likely damaged or destroyed. Yasmin Abu Amshah, a mother of three, said she walked 6 kilometers (nearly 4 miles) to reach her home in Gaza City, where she found it damaged but habitable. She also saw her younger sister for the first time in over a year. 'It was a long trip, but a happy one,' she said. Many saw their return as an act of steadfastness after Israel’s military campaign, which was launched in response to the Hamas militant group's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The return was also seen as a repudiation of U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion that large numbers of Palestinians be resettled in Egypt and Jordan, which those countries have rejected. Families of dead hostages are informed Whether hostages are still alive inside Gaza has been a heartbreaking question for waiting families who have pushed Israel’s government to reach a deal to free them, fearing that time was running out. Before Monday’s announcement, Israel believed that at least 35 of the about 90 hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack and still held in Gaza were dead. Government spokesman David Mencer told journalists that a list received overnight from Hamas on the status of the 33 hostages being freed under the ceasefire's first phase showed eight were dead, and 25 were alive. The families have been informed, he said. The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas and securing the release of dozens of hostages captured in the Oct. 7 attack. Militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in that assault and abducted another 250. Israel responded with an air and ground war that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ‘The joy of return’ Ismail Abu Matter, a father of four who waited for three days near the crossing point before moving into northern Gaza, described scenes of jubilation on the other side, with people singing, praying and crying as they were reunited with relatives. 'It’s the joy of return,' said Abu Matter, whose relatives were among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. 'We had thought we wouldn’t return, like our ancestors.' The opening was delayed for two days over a dispute between Hamas and Israel, which said the militant group changed the order of the hostages it released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Local medical officials said Israeli forces opened fire at the waiting crowd and killed several Palestinians over the weekend. Israel's military said it fired warning shots at approaching groups it deemed a threat. Mediators resolved the dispute overnight. Hamas said the return was 'a victory for our people, and a declaration of failure and defeat for the (Israeli) occupation and transfer plans.' In the opening days of the war, Israel ordered the evacuation of the north and sealed it off shortly after ground troops moved in. Around a million people fled to the south in October 2023, while hundreds of thousands remained in the north, which had some of the heaviest fighting and the worst destruction of the war. In all, around 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced. 'This is our house, four stories. You can’t see them,' one man, gesturing to a pile of rubble, said in an AP video. Hostage dispute rattled week-old ceasefire Palestinians were crossing on foot without inspection through part of the Netzarim corridor, a military zone bisecting the territory just south of Gaza City that Israel carved out early in the war. A checkpoint for vehicles opened later on Gaza’s main north-south highway, where traffic was backed up for around 3 kilometers (2 miles). Under the ceasefire agreement, vehicles are to be inspected for weapons before entering the north, but the mechanism for that was not immediately clear. Israel had delayed the opening of the crossing, which was supposed to happen over the weekend, saying it would not allow Palestinians north until a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was released. Israel said she should have been released before four young female soldiers who were freed on Saturday. Israel also accused Hamas of failing to provide information on hostages to be freed. Hamas in turn accused Israel of violating the agreement by not opening the crossing. Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, announced early Monday that an agreement had been reached to release Yehoud along with two other hostages by Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the hostage release — which will include female soldier Agam Berger — will take place on Thursday. Another three hostages should be released on Saturday as previously planned. Hamas also handed over information about the hostages to be released in the first phase. Defense Minister Israel Katz said anyone violating the ceasefire or threatening Israeli forces 'will bear the full cost.' Israel's military has warned Palestinians not to approach its forces, which have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza. ___ Shurafa reported from Wadi Gaza, Gaza Strip, and Magdy from Cairo.

Middle East latest: Hamas says 8 hostages to be freed in first ph...	Israel says a Hamas list shows that eight of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire are dead. An Israeli government spokesperson told reporters Monday that Hamas says the other 25 are alive. Israel has said the next release of hostages will take place on Thursday, followed by another on Saturday. The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas and securing the release of dozens of hostages captured in the militants’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which triggered the fighting. Israel on Monday began allowing Palestinians to return to the heavily destroyed north of the Gaza Strip for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas, in accordance with a fragile ceasefire. Thousands of Palestinians headed north after waiting for days to cross. Here's the latest: Israel says Hamas list shows 8 of 33 hostages who were to be freed in first phase of Gaza ceasefire are dead JERUSALEM — Israel says a Hamas list shows that eight of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire are dead. Government spokesman David Mencer told journalists Monday that Hamas said the other 25 are alive. Israel overnight said it had received a list of information on the status of the hostages from Hamas. Israel has said the next release of hostages will take place on Thursday, followed by another on Saturday. Whether hostages are alive or dead inside Gaza has been a heartbreaking question for waiting families who have pushed Israel’s government to reach a deal to free them, fearing that time was running out. Approximately 90 hostages are still in captivity. Prior to this announcement, Israel believed at least 35 of them were dead. An Israeli strike in the West Bank kills 2 RAMALLAH, West Bank — Israel has carried out a strike on a vehicle in the occupied West Bank, killing two people and wounding another three. The Palestinian Health Ministry reported the casualties from Monday’s strike in the built-up Nur Shams refugee camp. It has been the scene of several Israeli military raids in recent months targeting Palestinian militants. Hamas said the two killed were fighters in its armed wing. Another Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire in the urban Qalandiya refugee camp near Jerusalem overnight, according to the Health Ministry. The ministry does not say whether those killed by Israeli fire are militants or civilians. The Israeli military confirmed the strike in Nur Shams but did not immediately provide further details. It referred questions about the shooting in Qalandiya to the Israeli police, who did not immediately respond. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip ignited the war there. Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza along with east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. An Israeli ex-general says the war did not end well for his country JERUSALEM — A former Israeli general who had proposed a surrender-or-starve strategy for northern Gaza says 'the war has ended very badly' for Israel. Giora Eiland spoke to Israeli Army Radio on Monday as tens of thousands of Palestinians returned to the heavily destroyed north in accordance with a ceasefire reached with Hamas. Eiland said that by opening the Netzarim corridor, an Israeli military zone bisecting the territory, Israel had lost leverage over Hamas and would not be able to restore it, even if it resumes the war. 'We are at the mercy of Hamas,' he said. Eiland was the main author of the so-called Generals’ Plan, which called for giving civilians in the northern third of Gaza a week to evacuate. The whole area would then be declared a closed military zone, sealed off from humanitarian aid, and anyone remaining would be considered a combatant. Last fall, the plan was presented to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, which has not said whether it adopted parts of it. The Israeli military has denied carrying out the plan. Around the time it was publicized, in October, Israel launched a major operation in northern Gaza and sealed it off, allowing in hardly any aid. Tens of thousands of people were forced out, and the operation caused heavy destruction. Eiland said Israel had failed to achieve its stated goals, including destroying Hamas, removing it from power, restoring a sense of safety to Israeli border communities or safely returning dozens of hostages abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. He said that Hamas, by contrast, 'has largely achieved everything it wanted.' Israeli fire kills 1 in southern Lebanon as residents try to return to their homes BEIRUT — Israeli troops killed one person in southern Lebanon on Monday as residents tried to enter villages where Israeli troops remain, Lebanon's Health Ministry said. On Sunday, Israeli troops opened fire on protesters who insisted on accessing their villages, killing 24 people and wounding more than 130, the Health Ministry said. A U.S.-brokered ceasefire that went into effect on Nov. 27, ending a 14-month war between Hezbollah and Israel, stipulates that Israeli forces withdraw from southern Lebanon by Jan. 26. Israel blamed delays on the Lebanese army’s failure to deploy to the area, while the Lebanese army accused Israel of stalling its withdrawal, complicating its deployment. Lebanon later agreed to extend the deadline to Feb. 18. Despite that, residents on Monday tried to return to their villages and Israeli troops opened fire, killing one person in Odaisseh and wounding seven others across four southern villages, according to the Health Ministry. An Israeli doctor says released hostages are in poor physical condition JERUSALEM — An Israeli military doctor who has treated the returning hostages released by Hamas in recent days says they are in poor physical condition and face a lengthy recovery process. Dr. Ami Benov told reporters on Monday that the seven young women were suffering from 'mild starvation' and vitamin deficiencies. He says all of them suffered injuries in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack and that the medical care they received was poor. 'They’re not in a good shape. They’re not good physically,' he said. Benov says their mental states are 'very complicated.' He says the women were held in tunnels and deprived of sunlight for at least eight months. He says one of the challenges will be the 'grounding' process in which they gradually understand they have regained control over such decisions as what to eat, what to wear and where and when to meet their families. 'We feel obligated to give them the option to do whatever they feel right,' he said. But he said everything is being done in 'very small steps.' Death toll rises to 24 in the southern Lebanon confrontation with Israeli troops BEIRUT — The death toll in the confrontation between protesters and Israeli troops who remained in southern Lebanon has risen to 24 with 134 wounded, the Lebanese Health Ministry said Monday. Under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah was to move north of the Litani River by Jan. 26, with the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers deploying in the south. However, implementation delays left Israeli forces in over a dozen villages, sparking violent protests Sunday by residents expecting to return home by the deadline. Lebanon has subsequently agreed to extend the ceasefire deadline until Feb. 18. A Hezbollah lawmaker said Monday that his group, alongside the Lebanese army, is prepared to liberate villages where Israeli troops remain. 'The residents of these villages where the occupation remains are getting ready with our national army to liberate it,' Hassan Fadlallah said, speaking at an event in the southern city of Bint Jbeil, where Hezbollah’s reconstruction arm launched a rebuilding project. Israel arrests 2 citizens on suspicion of working for Iran TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli authorities say they have arrested two Israeli citizens for allegedly conducting missions on behalf of Iran, the latest in a string of similar cases announced in recent months. A statement from the Israeli police and the Shin Ben internal security agency on Monday said that Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreev, residents of northern Israel, were in contact with an Iranian agent and carried out various missions under his instruction. The missions included passing on classified military material obtained during Eliasfov’s military service in an air defense unit. It said the suspects also spray-painted graffiti and hung banners with pro-Iranian messages in various locations across the country, all allegedly in return for financial compensation. The prosecution is expected to file an indictment against them in the coming days. In September, an Israeli citizen was indicted for involvement in an Iranian assassination plot against top Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One month later, authorities arrested another Israeli who was allegedly involved in an Iranian plot to assassinate an Israeli scientist. The Shin Bet says Iranian agents are known to use social media and promises of cash to try to enlist Israelis to carry out such missions. Israel and Iran’s long-running shadow war has burst into the open over the past year, with the two countries directly exchanging fire in April and again in October. Tens of thousands return to devastated northern Gaza as Israel lifts its closure under truce DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Tens of thousands of Palestinians streamed into the most heavily destroyed part of the Gaza Strip on Monday as Israel lifted its closure of the north for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas in accordance with a fragile ceasefire. Massive crowds of people walking with their belongings stretched along a main road running next to the coast in a stunning reversal of the mass exodus from the north at the start of the war that many Palestinians had feared Israel would make permanent. Palestinians who have been sheltering in squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters for over a year are eager to return to their homes — even though they have likely been damaged or destroyed. Yasmin Abu Amshah, a mother of three, said she walked 6 kilometers (nearly 4 miles) to reach her home in Gaza City, where she found it damaged but still habitable. She also saw her younger sister for the first time in over a year. 'It was a long trip, but a happy one,' she said. 'The most important thing is that we returned.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israel-allows-palestinians-to-return-to-heavily-destroyed-north-of-gaza-strip/	2025-01-27T06:26:20-08:00	
Middle East latest: Deal reached to release Israeli hostage and a...	Mediator Qatar announced early Monday that an agreement has been reached to release an Israeli civilian hostage and allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, easing the first major crisis of the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Qatar’s statement said Hamas will hand over the civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, along with two other hostages before Friday. And on Monday, Israeli authorities will allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement said the hostage release — which will include soldier Agam Berger — will take place on Thursday, and confirmed that Palestinians can move north on Monday. Israel’s military said people can start crossing on foot at 7 a.m. Under the ceasefire deal, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza. But Israel put that on hold because of Yehoud, who Israel said should have been released on Saturday. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement. Here is the latest: Qatar says agreement reached to release Israeli hostage, allow Palestinians to return to north Gaza JERUSALEM — Mediator Qatar announced early Monday that an agreement has been reached to release an Israeli civilian hostage and allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, easing the first major crisis of the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Qatar’s statement said Hamas will hand over the civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, along with two other hostages before Friday. And on Monday, Israeli authorities will allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement said the hostage release — which will include soldier Agam Berger — will take place on Thursday, and confirmed that Palestinians can move north on Monday. Israel’s military said people can start crossing on foot at 7 a.m. Egypt rejects any transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza CAIRO — Egypt has rejected any transfer of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip or the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in its response to President Donald Trump’s suggestion that Egypt and Jordan take in Palestinians from war-ravaged Gaza. A statement by Egypt's foreign ministry on Sunday said the 'temporary or long-term' transfer of Palestinians 'threatens stability, risks expanding the conflict in the region and undermines prospects of peace and coexistence among its people.' Egypt stressed its rejection of any violation of Palestinian's rights 'whether through settlement or annexation of territories' or 'encouraging the transfer or uprooting of Palestinians from their land.' The statement, which didn’t address Trump’s comments directly, urged the international community to work toward 'the practical implementation of the two-state solution' to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Relatives of 4 female Israeli soldiers freed from captivity in Gaza express joy at their release TEL AVIV, Israel— In their first public comments since reuniting with their loved ones, relatives of the four female Israeli soldiers freed from captivity in Gaza expressed joy and gratitude at their release but said their struggle will not end until all the hostages are back home. 'Our Liri is home, but there are 90 more hostages, and they should have already been freed,' said Eli Albag, father of released hostage Liri Alabg, in a statement to the press at the hospital where the women are still undergoing medical evaluations. He said he has contempt for the ministers who voted against the ceasefire deal. Karina Ariev, 20, Daniella Gilboa, 20, Naama Levy, 20, and Liri Albag, 19, were released by Hamas on Saturday after more than 15 months in captivity. In exchange, Israel released 200 Palestinian prisoners. Hospital officials have described the four women’s condition as stable. Orly Gilboa, Daniella’s mother, said her daughter 'came back thin and pale,' but that she was 'still the same wonderful kid.' The families expressed their gratitude to everyone who made the release possible, singling out U.S. President Donald Trump and his Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff for special thanks. 'Because of your powerful actions, we have our lives back,' said Sasha Ariev, sister of Karina Ariev, addressing Trump directly, in English. 'You made this deal possible after so many months, when it felt like all hope was gone.' Earlier on Sunday, the first three women freed from Gaza in the current ceasefire were released from the hospital, a spokesman for the Sheba Medical Center said. Palestinian president condemns Trump's suggestion to ‘clean out’ the Gaza Strip RAMALLAH, West Bank — The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has sharply condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion to 'clean out' the Gaza Strip and request that Egypt and Jordan take in more Palestinians. In a statement, the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited control over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, says the prospect of mass displacement from the Gaza Strip 'constitutes a violation of the red lines that we have repeatedly warned against.' 'Our people will not leave,' the statement said. 'We warn of the repercussions of such a dangerous Israeli policy that contributes to severing the ties of the Gaza Strip, and displacing its people, which will lead to destabilization and security.' Trump’s remarks suggesting that Palestinians be encouraged to leave Gaza gets at the core of Palestinian fears that they will be driven from their remaining homeland. The Palestinian presidency said it was 'ready to assume its full duties in the Gaza Strip' in hopes of eventually establishing an independent Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank city of Ramallah, briefly controlled Gaza after Israeli troops withdrew in 2005, only to be driven out by its rival Hamas two years later. France will consider allowing Israeli companies to take part in Paris Air Show PARIS — France will consider allowing Israeli companies to participate in the Paris Air Show in June, thanks to ceasefire agreements in Gaza and Lebanon, the French president’s office said Sunday. That was among the results of a conversation Sunday between French President Emmanuel Macron and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Macron said France hopes to help speed up the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, two of whom are French citizens. Macron also urged Israel to allow for a ″massive″ facilitation of aid to Gaza’s population, and to fulfill its promises to withdraw troops from Lebanon under a truce brokered by the U.S. and France. Netanyahu asked about Israeli participation in the upcoming Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, a major industry event. The French president said Israeli participation ″could be favorably considered, as a consequence of the cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon,″ according to Macron's office. Tensions surrounded Israel’s participation in two arms shows in France last year, Eurosatory and Euronaval. The French government did not want Israel displaying any weapons used in its wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Islamic Jihad group says the dispute over a hostage has been settled RAMALLAH, West Bank — A spokesman for the Islamic Jihad, Gaza’s second-largest militant group, says the dispute over an Israeli hostage that has kept Palestinians from returning home to northern Gaza has been settled. Mohamed al-Hajj Mousa added in a statement that the group told mediators that the hostage, Arbel Yehoud, will be released before Saturday, when the next exchange of hostages from Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody is set to take place. There is no immediate comment from Israel, which has accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire by changing the order of hostages it has released. It expected Yehoud to be freed this weekend, and it has put the movement of Palestinians into northern Gaza on hold. UNRWA warns of far-reaching consequences if Israel goes ahead with its closure RAMALLAH, West Bank — The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says that if Israel carries out its threat to close its east Jerusalem headquarters on Thursday, the outsize effects will be felt acutely and immediately by tens of thousands of Palestinians. The agency, known as UNRWA, runs 12 facilities that provide critical public services across east Jerusalem, including schools enrolling at least 1,200 children and free clinics serving over 70,000 people. 'That’s the thing, it has an impact on people’s lives,' Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, said of the potential closure. In the Shuafat refugee camp, an impoverished neighborhood, 'people today can walk just a few meters and they’re in an excellent clinic,' Touma said. But if it's shuttered, she said, tens of thousands of Palestinians would have to cross a difficult checkpoint, pay for transport and, even if they’re eligible for Israeli primary health care, also pay for medicine in order to see a doctor or get a blood test. 'We’re talking about the poorest of the poor,' Touma said. 'Right now, they have no alternative.' The closure of UNRWA schools would raise all sorts of problems given that there are already too few classrooms in the overcrowded Palestinian areas of east Jerusalem, she said. Touma said much remains unclear about the Israeli order, including whether the closure would apply to operations in east Jerusalem only or to the entirety of the Palestinian territories. Israel says the agency has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. Israeli far-right leaders back Trump's suggestion to resettle Palestinians TEL AVIV, Israel — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both want Israel to establish Jewish settlements in Gaza, supported Trump's remarks, calling it 'voluntary emigration.' Palestinians and many of their supporters view it as code for ethnic cleansing. In a post on X Sunday, Smotrich called the idea of 'helping (Palestinians) find other places to start new, good lives' great and said he would work with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to that end. Ben-Gvir, who quit Netanyahu’s government over the current ceasefire in Gaza, said Trump’s remarks gave Israel the green light to move ahead on 'voluntary emigration.' 'When the president of the world’s largest superpower brings it up himself, the government of Israel should implement it,' he said in a statement. Netanyahu has said building Jewish settlements in Gaza is not realistic. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains a blockade with Egypt on the territory. UNRWA says Israel ordered it to vacate Jerusalem headquarters JERUSALEM — The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees says its staff was directed to vacate the premises by Thursday. Israel passed legislation last year cutting all ties with the agency and barring it from operating in its territory. It says the agency, which is the main provider of aid in the Gaza Strip, has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. In a statement Sunday, the agency, known as UNRWA, said the order to vacate 'is in contradiction to international law obligations of U.N. member states,' including Israel. 'United Nations premises are inviolable and enjoy privileges and immunities under the United Nations Charter.' UNRWA closed its east Jerusalem headquarters last May after Israeli protesters set fire to its perimeter. Senior Hamas official rejects Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Bassem Naim said that 'even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction,' the Palestinian people will never agree to such a proposal. He also said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza 'even better than before' if Israel lifts its blockade. Israeli forces kill 2 Palestinians in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday. Those killed included a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza as part of the ceasefire, which came into force last Sunday, but the military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which are still operating in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-ceasefires-in-gaza-and-lebanon-appear-at-risk-with-disputes-over-deadlines/	2025-01-26T15:20:06-08:00	
Russia says its troops have captured a strategic town in eastern ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia on Sunday claimed its troops had captured a strategically important town in eastern Ukraine as part of a grinding campaign to weaken Kyiv’s grip on the country’s industrial heartland, while uncertainty over the continued flow of U.S. funding has reportedly halted the work of some Ukrainian NGOs, including those helping war veterans. Russia’s Defense Ministry announced the fall of Velyka Novosilka, which had around 5,000 residents before the war, following a monthslong battle. Its statement could not be independently verified, and Ukraine claimed its troops had only strategically withdrawn from certain areas. But if confirmed, it would make Velyka Novosilka the first significant town to capitulate in 2025 under Moscow’s onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region against Ukraine’s weary and short-handed army. The war is set to reach its three-year milestone in February. Ukrainian forces withdrew from certain parts of Velyka Novosilka to avoid encirclement, the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade said in a statement on its official Telegram channel Sunday. The brigade is active in that patch of the frontline. Analysts have long predicted that it’s only a matter of time until Russian forces capture the settlement, which lies only 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region. The brigade said though they have approximate parity with Russian forces in terms of artillery and drones, the Russians have a huge advantage in manpower. 'Our units, using the weather conditions, skillfully withdrew from areas where there was a threat of encirclement. This does not mean that we have completely left the city, the fighting in Velyka Novosilka continues . All actions are aimed at minimizing our own losses and maximum damage to the enemy,' the statement said. The brigade said the withdrawal will make it topographically difficult for Russians to advance by making the river an obstacle for further advance. 'The enemy (…) will have no peace, any movement is cut off by shells and drones,' the statement said. Russia captured the Donetsk cities of Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year after long and grueling battles. Those cities were largely leveled by Russian artillery, glide bombs and drones before they fell. Russian forces have also been trying for months to capture the key Donetsk strongholds of Pokrovsk and Chasiv Yar. Elsewhere, Ukrainian NGOs catering to the needs of war veterans and their families have claimed a suspension of U.S. funding is forcing them to halt their work, days after newly sworn in U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would pause foreign aid grants for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later claimed that military aid to Ukraine would continue, but did not clarify whether humanitarian aid had been paused. Kyiv relies on the U.S. for 40% of its military needs. According to news reports, Ukrainian NGOs receiving funding from Washington this weekend began receiving 'stop work' orders, requiring them to pause all projects and related travel. Veteran Hub, an NGO that provides legal and psychological support to war veterans and their families, was forced to halt operations of two of its three largest service units as a result, the organization said in its official Facebook page. It said the suspension has lead it to ask for public donations for the first time. 'Since 2018, we have refrained from public fundraising because we believe that donations are primarily needed for the military. Today, we are forced to publicly ask for support for the first time,' the organization said. With the Trump administration questioning the future of U.S. aid to Ukraine, stressing the need to quickly broker a peace deal, both Moscow and Kyiv are seeking battlefield successes to strengthen their negotiating positions ahead of any prospective talks. For the past year, Russian forces have been waging an intense campaign to punch holes in Ukraine’s defenses in the eastern Donetsk region. The sustained and costly offensive has compelled Kyiv to give up a series of towns, villages and hamlets.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-says-its-troops-have-captured-a-strategic-town-in-eastern-ukraine/	2025-01-26T12:50:47-08:00	
Trump wants Egypt and Jordan to take in Palestinians from Gaza. H...	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — President Donald Trump's suggestion that Egypt and Jordan take in Palestinians from the war-ravaged Gaza Strip is likely to be met with a hard 'no' from the two U.S. allies and the Palestinians themselves, who fear Israel would never allow them to return. Trump floated the idea on Saturday, saying he would urge the leaders of the two Arab countries to take in Gaza's now largely homeless population, so that 'we just clean out that whole thing.' He added that resettling Gaza's population 'could be temporary or long-term.' 'It’s literally a demolition site right now,' Trump said, referring to the vast destruction caused by Israel's 15-month military campaign against Hamas, now paused by a fragile ceasefire. Middle East latest: Israel says it won’t complete its withdrawal from Lebanon by Sunday 'I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location, where they can maybe live in peace for a change,' Trump said. There was no immediate comment from Egypt, Jordan, Israel or Palestinian officials. The idea is likely to be welcomed by Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right governing partners have long advocated what they describe as the voluntary migration of large numbers of Palestinians and the reestablishment of Jewish settlements in Gaza. Hundreds rally on Michigan Ave. against Trump administration’s Middle East, immigration policies Human rights groups have already accused Israel of ethnic cleansing, which United Nations experts have defined as a policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove the civilian population of another group from certain areas 'by violent and terror-inspiring means.' History of displacement Before and during the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, some 700,000 Palestinians — a majority of the prewar population — fled or were driven from their homes in what is now Israel, an event they commemorate as the Nakba — Arabic for catastrophe. Israel refused to allow them to return because it would have resulted in a Palestinian majority within its borders. The refugees and their descendants now number around 6 million, with large communities in Gaza, where they make up the majority of the population, as well as the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. In the 1967 Mideast war, when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 300,000 more Palestinians fled, mostly into Jordan. The decades-old refugee crisis has been a major driver of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was one of the thorniest issues in peace talks that last broke down in 2009. The Palestinians claim a right of return, while Israel says they should be absorbed by surrounding Arab countries. Hamas frees 4 female Israeli soldiers in exchange for 200 Palestinian prisoners as ceasefire holds Many Palestinians view the latest war in Gaza, in which entire neighborhoods have been shelled to oblivion and 90% of the population of 2.3 million have been forced from their homes, as a new Nakba. They fear that if large numbers of Palestinians leave Gaza, then they, too, may never return. Steadfastly remaining on one's land is central to Palestinian culture and was on vivid display in Gaza on Sunday, when thousands of people tried to return to the most heavily destroyed part of the territory. Red line for Egypt, Jordan Egypt and Jordan fiercely rejected the idea of accepting Gaza refugees early in the war, when it was floated by some Israeli officials. Both countries have made peace with Israel but support the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. They fear that the permanent displacement of Gaza's population could make that impossible. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi has also warned of the security implications of transferring large numbers of Palestinians to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, bordering Gaza. Hamas and other militant groups are deeply rooted in Palestinian society and are likely to move with the refugees, which would mean that future wars would be fought on Egyptian soil, something that could unravel the historic Camp David peace treaty, a cornerstone of regional stability. 'The peace which we have achieved would vanish from our hands,' el-Sissi said in October 2023, after Hamas' attack on southern Israel triggered the war. 'All for the sake of the idea of eliminating the Palestinian cause.' Devastating toll for Gaza’s children: Over 13,000 killed and an estimated 25,000 injured, UN says That's what happened in Lebanon in the 1970s, when Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, the leading militant group of its time, transformed the country's south into a launchpad for attacks on Israel. The refugee crisis and the PLO's actions helped push Lebanon into a 15-year civil war in 1975. Israel invaded twice and occupied southern Lebanon from 1982 until 2000. Jordan, which clashed with the PLO and expelled it under similar circumstances in 1970, already hosts more than 2 million Palestinian refugees, the majority of whom have been granted citizenship. Israeli ultranationalists have long suggested that Jordan be considered a Palestinian state so that Israel can keep the West Bank, which they view as the biblical heartland of the Jewish people. Jordan's monarchy has vehemently rejected that scenario. Can Trump force Egypt, Jordan to accept refugees? That depends on how serious Trump is about the idea and how far he is prepared to go. U.S. tariffs — one of Trump's favorite economic tools — or outright sanctions could be devastating for Jordan and Egypt. The two countries receive billions of dollars in American aid each year, and Egypt is already mired in an economic crisis. But allowing an influx of refugees could also be destabilizing. Egypt says it is currently hosting some 9 million migrants, including refugees from Sudan's civil war. Jordan, with a population of less than 12 million, is hosting over 700,000 refugees, mainly from Syria. Read more: Latest Chicago news and headlines U.S. pressure would also risk alienating key allies in the region with whom Trump has had good relations — not only el-Sissi and Jordan's King Abdullah II, but the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, all of whom support the Palestinian cause. That would potentially complicate efforts to broker a historic agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel to normalize relations, something Trump tried to do during his previous term and expects to complete in his current one.

Devastating toll for Gaza's children: Over 13,000 killed and an e...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The war in Gaza has been devastating for children: More than 13,000 have been killed, an estimated 25,000 injured, and at least 25,000 hospitalized for malnutrition, according to U.N. agencies. As Britain’s deputy U.N. ambassador, James Kariuki, recently told the Security Council, 'Gaza has become the deadliest place in the world to be a child.' 'The children of Gaza did not choose this war,' he said, 'yet they have paid the ultimate price.' The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported Thursday that of the 40,717 Palestinian bodies identified so far in Gaza, one-third – 13,319 – were children. The office said Friday the figures came from Gaza’s Ministry of Health. The U.N. children’s agency, UNICEF, said the estimate of 25,000 children injured came from its analysis based on information collected together with Gaza’s Health Ministry. U.N. deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said nearly 19,000 children had been hospitalized for acute malnutrition in the four months before December. That figure also came from UNICEF, which said it was from data collected by U.N. staff in Gaza focusing on nutrition, in coordination with all pertinent U.N. agencies. The U.N. says thousands of children have also been orphaned or separated from their parents during the 15-month war. Yasmine Sherif, executive director of the U.N. global fund Education Cannot Wait, told a press conference that 650,000 school-age children haven’t been attending classes and the entire education system has to be rebuilt because of the widespread destruction in Gaza. Diplomats from Britain, France and other countries also cited the toll on Israeli children who were killed, injured and abducted during Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 – with some still being held hostage. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon asked the Security Council whether it ever paused to consider the plight of Israeli children 'mutilated, tortured and murdered' on Oct. 7, the 30 who were kidnapped and the tens of thousands who have been displaced, their homes destroyed. 'The trauma they have endured is beyond imagination,' he said. Danon called Thursday's council meeting on children in Gaza 'an affront to common sense,' accusing Hamas of turning Gaza into 'the world’s largest terror base' and using children as human shields. 'The children of Gaza could have had a future filled with opportunity,' he said. 'Instead, they are trapped in a cycle of violence and despair, all because of Hamas, not because of Israel.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-devastating-toll-for-gazas-children-over-13000-killed-and-an-estimated-25000-injured-un-says/	2025-01-25T15:47:49-08:00	
US has not stopped military aid to Ukraine, Zelenskyy says	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday the U.S. has not stopped military aid to Ukraine after newly sworn in U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would pause foreign aid grants for 90 days. Zelenskyy did not clarify whether humanitarian aid had been paused. Ukraine relies on the U.S. for 40% of its military needs. 'I am focused on military aid; it has not been stopped, thank God,' he said at a press conference with Moldovan President Maia Sandu. The two leaders met in Kyiv on Saturday to discuss the energy needs of Moldova’s Russian-occupied Transnistria region, which saw its natural gas supplies halted on Jan. 1 due to Ukraine’s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Ukraine has said it can offer coal to the Transnistrian authorities to make up for the shortfall. The future of U.S. aid to Ukraine remains uncertain as President Donald Trump begins his second term in office. The American leader has repeatedly said he wouldn’t have allowed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to start if he had been in office, although he was president as fighting grew in the east of the country between Kyiv’s forces and separatists aligned with Moscow, ahead of Putin sending in tens of thousands of troops in 2022. On Thursday, Trump told Fox News that Zelenskyy should have made a deal with Putin to avoid the conflict. A day earlier, Trump also threatened to impose stiff tariffs and sanctions on Russia if an agreement isn’t reached to end the fighting in Ukraine. Speaking in Kyiv on Saturday, Zelenskyy said he had enjoyed 'good meetings and conversations with President Trump' and that he believed the U.S. leader would succeed in his desire to end the war. 'This can only be done with Ukraine, and otherwise it simply will not work because Russia does not want to end the war, and Ukraine does,' Zelenskyy said. Grinding eastern offensive With Trump stressing the need to quickly broker a peace deal, both Moscow and Kyiv are seeking battlefield successes to strengthen their negotiating positions ahead of any prospective talks. For the past year, Russian forces have been waging an intense campaign to punch holes in Ukraine’s defenses in the Donetsk region and weaken Kyiv’s grip on the eastern parts of the country. The sustained and costly offensive has compelled Kyiv to give up a series of towns, villages and hamlets. Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed Friday that Russian troops had fought their way into the center of the strategically important eastern of Velyka Novosilka, although it was not possible to independently confirm the claim. Elsewhere, three civilians were killed Saturday in shelling in the Russian-occupied area of Ukraine’s Kherson region, Moscow-installed Gov. Vladimir Saldo said. He urged the residents of Oleshky, which sits close to the frontline in southern Ukraine, to stay in their homes or in bomb shelters. Russia also attacked Ukraine with two missiles and 61 Shahed drones overnight Saturday. Ukrainian air defenses shot down both missiles and 46 drones, a statement from the air force said. Another 15 drones failed to reach targets due to Ukrainian countermeasures. The downed drones caused damage in the Kyiv, Cherkasy and Khmelnytskyi regions, with Ukrainian emergency services saying that five people had to be from a 9-story apartment block in the Ukrainian capital. Russia also struck Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region with drones causing casualties and damage, local authorities said Saturday. Drones targeted the city’s Shevchenkivskyi, Kyivskyi and Kholodnohirskyi districts, said Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Russia used a Molniya drone – an inexpensive weapon that has been developed and recently deployed by Russia – in the Shevchenkivskyi district, sparking a fire. The attacks disrupted the city’s water and electricity supplies, the mayor said. Terekhov said the number of victims was still being determined, while Kharkiv’s governor, Oleh Syniehubov, said three people, two women and a man, were injured in the strikes. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-has-not-stopped-military-aid-to-ukraine-zelenskyy-says/	2025-01-25T09:53:46-08:00	
Middle East latest: Hamas releases 4 Israeli soldiers in exchange...	Hamas militants on Saturday released four female Israeli soldiers they held captive for 15 months in a planned exchange for 200 Palestinian prisoners or detainees in Israel. It's the second exchange since a fragile ceasefire took effect last weekend, halting the fighting in Gaza for at least six weeks during which dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be freed while more aid flows in. In return for the four soldiers, Israel should free 200 Palestinian prisoners or detainees, including 120 militants serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks. The first exchange took place Sunday with the release of three Israeli hostages and 90 Palestinian prisoners. Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities. The ministry doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. The war was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which killed around 1,200 people. ___ Here's the latest: Israel warns Palestinians not to return to northern Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military is warning Palestinians in Gaza not to return to northern Gaza. The army’s Arabic spokesman, Avichay Adraee, published a post on social media telling Palestinians not to approach the east-west Netzarim route, which bisects Gaza. Israel had been expected to open the route by Sunday as part of the latest stage of the ceasefire. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the pullback was on hold because of delays in the release of an Israeli civilian woman from captivity in Gaza. Mediators say they are trying to resolve the dispute. Some Palestinian prisoners being released will be sent to other Arab countries RAMALLAH, West Bank — The head of a Palestinian prisoner advocacy group says that some of the 70 convicted militants being transferred to Egypt after their release from Israeli prison will ultimately be sent to other Arab countries. Abdullah al-Zaghari, the head of the Palestinian Prisoner’s Club, told The Associated Press that Algeria, Tunisia and Turkey have all expressed willingness to receive some of those required to live in exile according to the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. A total of 200 prisoners, 120 of them sentenced to life prison on charges related to deadly attacks against Israelis, were being freed Saturday after Hamas released four female soldiers from captivity in Gaza. Al-Zaghari said that the details of how many of the 70 deported Palestinian prisoners will stay living in Egypt and how many will travel on to other countries are still being worked out. Video shows freed hostages in an Israeli army base JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has released a video showing the freed hostages being welcomed at an army base in southern Israel. Some of the hostages hugged the female soldiers who greeted them. One of them, Liri Albag, 19, smiled, gave two thumbs-up and made a heart shape with her hands before boarding a van. Israel's president welcomes hostages home JERUSALEM — Israel’s president has welcomed home the four female soldiers released from captivity. 'You are heroes,' President Isaac Herzog said in a post on X. Herzog wished them healthy recoveries, but says the nation 'will not rest' until all hostages return. Israel releases 70 Palestinian prisoners into Egypt in Gaza ceasefire deal CAIRO — Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV says Israel has released 70 Palestinian prisoners into Egypt under the Gaza ceasefire deal. The network says they arrived at the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing with the Gaza Strip. Hamas had earlier released four female Israeli soldiers. Israel is expected to release a total of 200 Palestinian prisoners or detainees, many of whom will be sent into exile. Israel says it won't allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza until hostage Arbel Yehoud is released JERUSALEM — Israel says it will not allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza until Arbel Yehoud, one of the dozens of hostages held by Hamas, is released. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Yehoud was supposed to have been released Saturday as part of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Hamas had earlier released four female Israeli soldiers. Israeli army spokesman criticizes Hamas' display of hostages TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s army spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari says the released hostages are 'in our hands' and on their way home. In a televised statement Saturday, Hagari criticized what he called the 'cynical' public display of the young women by Hamas before their release. He also said that Israel is concerned about the fate of the two youngest hostages — Kfir and Ariel Bibas — and their mother Shiri. Kfir Bibas marked his second birthday in captivity earlier this month. Hagari says the army is committed to bringing all hostages home. Palestinians release a list of 200 prisoners to be released from Israel RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian authorities have released a list of 200 Palestinian prisoners and detainees expected to be released from Israel in exchange for four female Israeli soldiers held by Hamas in Gaza. The list includes 120 militants serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis. The rest are serving lengthy sentences. The list shows that 70 of the prisoners will not be allowed to return to their homes in the occupied West Bank or Jerusalem and will be required to live in exile. It’s unclear exactly where they will go. The more notorious militants being released include Mohammad Odeh, 52, and Wael Qassim, 54, both from east Jerusalem. They were accused of carrying out a series of deadly Hamas attacks against Israelis, including a bombing at a cafeteria at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2002 that killed nine people, including five U.S. citizens. Another prisoner set to be released is Mohammed Aradeh, 42, an Islamic Jihad militant, who become something of a Palestinian folk hero in 2021 along with five other prisoners after they used spoons to tunnel their way out of Israel’s most secure prison in an extraordinary escape that stunned Israelis and Palestinians alike. 4 female soldiers freed by Hamas as part of Gaza ceasefire are with Israeli forces DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Four female soldiers freed from captivity in the Gaza Strip are with Israeli forces, the second such release as part of a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. Israel confirmed it had received the freed hostages on Saturday. The truce, which began Sunday, is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the Hamas militant group. The four Israeli soldiers, Karina Ariev, 20, Daniella Gilboa, 20, Naama Levy, 20, and Liri Albag, 19, were captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. Lebanese army blames Israel for delay in deploying troops in southern Lebanon BEIRUT — The Lebanese army on Saturday said it has been unable to deploy its forces throughout southern Lebanon as laid out in a ceasefire agreement that halted the Israel-Hezbollah war because of Israel’s 'procrastination in withdrawal' from the area. Under the deal reached in November, Israel is supposed to complete its withdrawal from Lebanon by Sunday, after which the Lebanese armed forces would patrol the buffer zone in southern Lebanon alongside U.N. peacekeepers to prevent Hezbollah from reestablishing a military presence there. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested Friday that Israel might not withdraw by the deadline, and Washington appears prepared to push for an extension. Netanyahu said the Lebanese government hasn’t yet 'fully enforced' the agreement, an apparent reference to the deployment of Lebanese troops. The Lebanese army statement said 'procrastination in the withdrawal by the Israeli enemy complicates the army’s deployment mission.' It said it 'maintains readiness to complete its deployment immediately after the Israeli enemy withdraws.' It called on displaced Lebanese not to return to their areas until they receive instructions, citing the danger of landmines and explosives. Some 112,000 Lebanese remain displaced. There have been calls for protests on Sunday if Israel does not fully withdraw. Crowds gather in Tel Aviv and Gaza City ahead of the release of hostages and prisoners DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Crowds began to gather in Tel Aviv and Gaza City on Saturday ahead of the expected swap between Israel and Hamas of more hostages for Palestinian prisoners. In Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square, a big screen showed the faces of the four female soldiers expected to be released. Some in the growing crowd wore Israeli flags, others held posters with the hostages’ faces. 'I’m extremely excited, exhilarated,' said onlooker Gili Roman. 'In a heartbeat, in a split of a second, their lives are going to turn upside again, but right now for a positive and a good side.' He said his sister was released in the only other ceasefire in November, but another relative was killed in captivity. In Gaza City’s central Palestine Square, a crowd began to gather early as militants worked to cordon off an area where the hostages were expected to be handed over to the Red Cross. Dozens of armed and masked militants also paraded in vehicles through the streets of the city, said resident Radwan Abu Rawiya who was part of the Palestine Square crowd. Children ran alongside the militants’ vehicles as celebratory gunfire rang out, he said in a telephone interview. 'People are celebrating and waiting to see the hostages,' he said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-4-israeli-female-soldiers-will-be-exchanged-for-200-palestinian-prisoners/	2025-01-25T04:20:42-08:00	
Trump leans in on targeting Russian oil revenue as he tries to fu...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is emphasizing that targeting Russia's oil revenue is the best way to get Moscow to end its nearly three-year war against Ukraine. Trump, who pledged in the campaign that he'd broker a quick end to the grinding conflict, in his first days in office has leaned in on the idea that OPEC+, the alliance of oil producing nations, holds the key to ending the war by reducing oil prices. The president on Friday renewed his call on the group of oil producing exporters, led by Saudi Arabia, to reduce the price of oil. It's a move he says would bleed Russia of much needed revenue to pay for the conflict and force Vladimir Putin to reconsider the war. 'One way to stop it quickly is for OPEC to stop making so much money,' Trump told reporters. 'So, OPEC ought to get on the ball and drop the price of oil. And that war will stop right away.' But the push on OPEC+ is an uphill battle, according to industry experts. The alliance last month put off increasing oil production as it faces weaker than expected demand and competing production from non-allied countries. Trump made similar calls on OPEC+ this week during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the annual gathering of world leaders and corporate elites. Meanwhile, the president's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said Friday that OPEC+ cutting oil prices to $45 per barrel could push Russia to end the war. 'Russia is gaining billions of dollars of money from oil sales,' Kellogg said in a Fox News interview. 'What if you drop that to $45 a barrel, which is basically a baseline break-even point?' The Saudi and Russian relationship is complicated, though the countries have cooperated on oil. In 2016, Russia and other oil producers that weren’t part of the alliance joined with Saudi Arabia and other members of the oil cartel to form OPEC+. Russia and Saudi Arabia are by far the biggest producers in the expanded alliance. That move was largely made in response to dramatically falling oil prices due to U.S. shale oil output. The United States is not a member of OPEC or OPEC+. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said Trump has a better relationship with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, than did his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden. Still, he said, the Saudis 'still have bills to pay,' and Trump is making a 'huge ask.' 'Oil companies respond to economics and not to personal favors,' he added. The Kremlin on Friday dismissed the idea that Russia could be pressed into talks on ending the war by the U.S. and its allies targeting the oil sector. 'The conflict doesn’t depend on oil prices,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a call with reporters. 'The conflict is ongoing because of the threat to Russia’s national security, the threat to Russians living on those territories and the refusal by the Americans and the Europeans to listen to Russia’s security concerns. It’s not linked to oil prices.' The U.S. and its allies have imposed a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil. But Moscow has been able to sustain a steady stream of revenue from sales by relying on buyers, including China and India, who have taken advantage of discounted prices from the Russians. Trump earlier this week spoke by phone with the Saudi crown prince, his first foreign leader call after his return to the White House. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to comment on whether the two leaders discussed Trump's push for slashing oil prices. After the call, the crown prince said the kingdom would look to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, and Trump publicly said he'd like to see the Saudis spend $1 trillion. Trump is also hopeful for landing a long sought Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization deal, to formalize relations between the Middle East's two biggest powers. Trump may be making a risky gambit by publicly pressing the Saudis and other OPEC+ nations. Biden, who was critical of the Saudis' human rights record early in his term, faced an embarrassing setback months into the Ukraine war when the Saudis rejected the Democrat's public push to increase the global flow of oil. Asked why Trump could succeed where Biden failed, Leavitt, Trump's press secretary, offered confidence but no specifics. 'The Biden administration said a lot of things that never actually came to fruition, and President Trump is a man of his word,' she said. 'You’re seeing that already.' It’s possible that Saudi Arabia and other allies would want to answer Washington’s call eventually, but not immediately, said Kevin Book, the managing director who leads the research team at ClearView Energy Partners LLC, a Washington research firm. Global oil supply is currently ahead of demand by about 700,000 barrels per day, according to the International Energy Agency, a surplus that already weighs on the price. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, was trading at about $78 on Friday morning. Book said whether Trump will have better luck than Biden depends on his terms -- what he asks for and what pressure he brings. 'What Biden was essentially asking for was going to divide the two biggest players in OPEC+ and that’s essentially what’s on the table right now, too,' he said. 'It was challenging then. It would be challenging now.' Kellogg said Trump feels strongly that drumming up economic pressure will be more useful to getting Russia to the negotiating table than helping Ukraine score battlefield wins. Both sides have suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. Kellogg expressed doubt that the incredible human cost would have much impact on the Kremlin's calculations. 'This is a nation that was willing to lose 700,000 killed in six months at Stalingrad in World War II. They just throw troops at it,' Kellogg said. He added, 'So when you look at Putin, you can’t just say, 'Well, stop the killing,' because candidly, that’s not their mentality, that’s not how they do things.' Criticism of Biden's handling of the Ukraine conflict was a cornerstone of Trump's 2024 campaign. He regularly pilloried Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the enormous amount of military aid poured into Ukraine in the aftermath of Russia's February 2022 invasion. He boasted on the campaign trail that the war would have never happened if he were president and that he would end the war within 24 hours of being sworn in. Since his election victory, he's acknowledged that the war remains complicated and has said it could take months to find a resolution to the war. In a posting on his Truth Social site, Trump earlier this week said the U.S 'must never forget that Russia helped us win the Second World War.' And he's repeatedly said that he will hold talks with Putin. 'I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon and get that war ... ended,' Trump said at Davos. 'And that’s not from the standpoint of economy or anything else. It’s from the standpoint of millions of lives are being wasted. Beautiful, young people are being shot in the battlefield.' ___ McDermott reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

North Korea prepares to send more troops to Russia after sufferin...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s military said Friday it suspects North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after its soldiers fighting in the Russian-Ukraine war suffered heavy casualties. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff also assessed in a report distributed to journalists that North Korea is continuing its preparations to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile intended to reach the United States. President Donald Trump’s return to the White House may brighten Pyongyang's prospects for high-level diplomacy with Washington, as he met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times during his first term. Many experts say Kim likely thinks his evolving nuclear program and expanding military cooperation with Russian President Vladimir Putin could give him a greater leverage than during his 2018-19 summits with Trump. North Korea has been supplying a vast amount of artillery and other conventional weapons to Russia, and last October it sent about 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia as well, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukraine intelligences. Seoul, Washington and others worry Russia could in return transfer to North Korea sophisticated weapons technologies that can enhance its nuclear program. North Korean soldiers are considered to be highly disciplined and well-trained, but their lack of combat experiences and unfamiliarity with the largely flat plains that make up most battlefields in the Russian-Ukraine war have made them easy targets for drone and artillery strikes. South Korea’s spy agency said last week that it assessed about 300 North Korean soldiers had died and another 2,700 had been injured. Earlier in January, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 4,000, though U.S. estimates were lower at around 1,200. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said that North Korea is believed to be accelerating preparations to send more troops to Russia, without saying how it reached the assessment. Deepening military ties between North Korea and Russia could embolden Kim over his dealings with the U.S. and South Korea. In a major political conference last month, Kim vowed to implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy. But many experts say Kim may eventually want to sit down for talks with Trump if he thinks the U.S. president could make concessions. Their previous talks collapsed after Trump rejected Kim’s offer to dismantle his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearization step, in return for extensive sanctions relief. Kim has since sharply increased the pace of weapons tests to expand an arsenal of nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and South Korea. In South Korea, there are concerns that Trump might give up the goal of a complete denuclearization of North Korea and focus on eliminating its long-range missile program that poses a direct threat to the U.S., while leaving its nuclear attack capabilities against South Korea intact. During a Fox News interview broadcast Thursday, Trump called Kim 'a smart guy' and 'not a religious zealot.' Asked over whether he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied that 'I will, yeah.' On Monday, Trump called North Korea 'a nuclear power' as he boasted of his personal ties with Kim. That created a stir in South Korea, as Washington, Seoul and their partners have long avoided describing North Korea as a nuclear state out of worries that it could be seen as accepting its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. 'I was very friendly with him. He liked me. I liked him,' Trump said during a press availability at the Oval Office after his inauguration. 'Now he is a nuclear power. But we got along. I think he’ll be happy to see I’m coming back.' Jeon Ha Gyu, a spokesperson for the South Korean Defense Ministry, told reporters Tuesday that efforts to achieve North Korea’s denuclearization must be continued as a prerequisite to realize lasting peace not only on the Korean Peninsula but also in the world. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry also said it will closely coordinate with the Trump administration to achieve North Korea's denuclearization. North Korea hasn’t responded to Trump’s comments. A state media report Friday on the closely watched two-day parliament meeting in Pyongyang this week didn’t say whether Kim attended it, and the report made no mention of the U.S., South Korea, Russia or other foreign policy issues.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-north-korea-prepares-to-send-more-troops-to-russia-after-suffering-casualties-south-korea-says/	2025-01-24T04:34:14-08:00	
Israelis await names of next 4 hostages to be released by Hamas a...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Relatives of hostages still being held by militants in Gaza called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Friday to ensure all remaining captives are freed, while also appealing to U.S. President Donald Trump to continue pressing for their release. As a fragile six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas entered its sixth day, Israelis waited anxiously for the names of the next four hostages who will be released from among the more than 90 still held in Gaza. In the Palestinian enclave, civilians in the central and southern part of the Gaza Strip hoping to return to the remnants of their home in the battered north faced an agonizing wait. Israel believes about a third, or possibly as many as half, of the more than 90 hostages still in Gaza have died. Hamas has not released definitive information on how many captives are still alive or the names of those who have died. 'Dear President Trump, first of all we want to say thank you for the happy moments we felt this week. But we want to tell you we still have 94 hostages, we need them all at home,' said Ayelet Samerano, whose son Yonatan Samerano is among those still being held. 'Please do not stop. Please continue to press and do everything so that all the 94 hostages will come home immediately.' In the first phase of the ceasefire deal, 33 hostages are expected to be released gradually in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The first three Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners on Sunday, the first day of the ceasefire that has halted the 15-month war that has devastated Gaza. Wide swathes of the territory have been destroyed, while more than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not differentiate between combatants and civilians but say more than half are women and children. According to the deal, on Friday Hamas is to announce the names of the next four hostages to be released on Saturday, after which Israel will also release a list of which Palestinian prisoners will be freed. The hostages were among about 250 men, women and children captured by militants who burst across the border into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people in an attack that sparked the war in Gaza. About 100 were released during a brief ceasefire in November that year, while the bodies of around three dozen hostages have been recovered in Gaza and eight hostages have been rescued by the army. 'I call from here to the Prime Minister and negotiating team -- you’re doing excellent work -- do whatever is necessary to bring everyone back, to the last hostage,' Samerano said. 'We ask you to ensure phase two of the deal is agreed upon before finishing the current phrase. We cannot continue living in uncertainty. All hostages must return, and none of them has time left.' The 33 to be released in the first phase will include women, children, sick people and those over 50 — almost all civilians, though the deal also commits Hamas to freeing all living female soldiers in Phase 1. Hamas will release living hostages first, but could release some bodies if they don’t have enough living hostages in this category. Male soldiers are not expected to be released in the first phase. 'This week we were moved to watch images of mothers embracing their daughters, but our hearts break thinking that my son Nimrod and other men remain behind, and each day they’re there poses a real danger to their lives,' said Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod Cohen is among the hostages. 'The worry that the deal won’t be fully implemented gnaws at us all. All senior officials openly say that stopping the deal means a death sentence for those left behind.' Under the terms of the deal, Palestinians in Gaza will have more freedom of movement from the north to the south of the enclave. Civilians in the south will be allowed to take a coastal road to northern Gaza from Saturday, when Israeli troops are expected to withdraw from the key route and Hamas is set to release the next four Israeli hostages. Those in other parts of the strip seized on the ceasefire this week to reunite with scattered family members, picking their way through vast swaths of rubble and trying to salvage what remained of their homes and their belongings. But those displaced from the north have had to wait. 'The first thing I’ll do, I’ll kiss the dirt of the land on which I was born and raised,' said Nadia Al-Debs, one of the many people gathered in makeshift tents in Gaza’s central city of Deir al-Balah preparing to set out for home in Gaza City the next day. 'We’ll return so my children can see their father.' Nafouz al-Rabai, another displaced woman in Deir al-Balah from al-Shati, along the coast in Gaza City, said the day she walks home will be a 'day of joy for us.' The return stirs bittersweet emotions. Al-Rabai acknowledged it would be painful to absorb the scale of damage to the home and the urban refugee camp she knew and loved. 'God knows if I’ll find (my house) standing or not,' she said. 'It’s a very bad life.' ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israelis-await-names-of-next-4-hostages-to-be-released-by-hamas-as-part-of-the-ceasefire/	2025-01-24T03:26:11-08:00	
Kremlin scoffs at Trump's claim that a drop in oil prices will he...	MOSCOW (AP) — The Kremlin insisted Friday that a settlement in Ukraine couldn’t be facilitated by a drop in global oil prices as U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested. Speaking by video from the White House to the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said on Thursday that the OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries shares responsibility for the nearly three-year conflict in Ukraine because it has kept oil prices too high. 'If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately,' Trump said. Energy sales form a large part of Russia's earnings. Asked about Trump's comments, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov affirmed Moscow's view that the Ukrainian conflict was triggered by the West's refusal to take into account Russian security interests. 'The conflict doesn't depend on oil prices,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. 'The conflict is ongoing because of the threat to Russia’s national security, the threat to Russians living on those territories and the refusal by the Americans and the Europeans to listen to Russia’s security concerns. It’s not linked to oil prices.' He said Russian President Vladimir Putin remains ready for contacts with Trump. Peskov's comments echoed Putin’s statements that he had to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022 to fend off a threat to Russia’s security resulting from plans for Ukraine to join NATO and to protect Russian speakers living there. Ukraine and the West have denounced Moscow’s action as an unprovoked act of aggression. Asked to comment on Trump’s claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is ready for a peace deal, Peskov pointed out the Ukrainian leader’s earlier decision to rule out any talks with Moscow. 'Zelenskyy can’t be ready for a deal,' Peskov told reporters, adding that 'in order to reach a settlement it’s necessary to conduct talks, and Zelenskyy forbade himself to hold talks by his own decree.' On Wednesday, Trump threatened to impose stiff taxes, tariffs and sanctions on Russia if an agreement isn’t reached to end the war in Ukraine. Peskov said that the Kremlin was closely following Trump's statements and noted that he imposed a slew of sanctions during his first term. He said Moscow 'remains ready for an equal dialogue, for a mutually respectful dialogue.' 'This dialogue took place between the two presidents during Trump’s first presidency. And we are waiting for signals that we have not received yet,' Peskov said.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-kremlin-scoffs-at-trumps-claim-that-a-drop-in-oil-prices-will-help-end-ukraine-conflict/	2025-01-24T03:19:15-08:00	
Ukraine is reforming its recruitment efforts to attract younger s...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine is in the final stages of drafting recruitment reforms to attract 18- to 25-year-olds who are currently exempt from mobilization as it looks for ways to bolster its fighting force, the battlefield commander recently appointed to the President’s Office said. In his first interview with foreign media since taking up his new position last fall, Deputy Head of the Office of the President Colonel Pavlo Palisa said Ukraine is exploring new recruitment options because the current drafting system inherited from Soviet times is hindering progress. While Ukraine passed a mobilization law last spring and lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 years old, the measures have not had the impact needed to replenish its ranks or replace battlefield losses in its war with Russia. One initiative is what Palisa described as an 'honest contract,' a plan that includes financial incentives, clear guarantees for training, and measures to ensure dialogue between soldiers and their commanders. The plan is aimed at attracting mainly 18- to 25-year-olds who are currently exempt from mobilization, and will also target Ukrainians who have the right to deferment or were discharged after the mobilization law was passed. 'To secure the unit commander and the contract soldier, establish open and professional relations between them, and set clear boundaries that are understandable to both,' he said Wednesday. 'In my opinion, this is essential for effective dialogue.' The effort, which Palisa said is in its final stages, could help respond to calls aired by both the Biden and Trump administrations that Ukraine could expand its manpower by lowering the conscription age. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been adamantly opposed to implementing obligatory mobilization starting from 18 years old, saying doing so would radically affect the future prospects of the war-weary country. 'As of now, my view is that we need to start an open dialogue with society,' Palisa said. 'Because the defense of the state is not only the responsibility of the Armed Forces. It is the duty of every Ukrainian citizen, and it is their obligation.' Palisa said his office, in collaboration with the Cabinet and the Ministry of Defense, is reviewing why mobilization efforts have fallen short. 'We actually have a huge mobilization resource. In my opinion, at the moment, it is greater than what we currently need to address certain tasks on the frontline,' he said. 'The mechanism we currently have does not allow us to be as effective as we could be.' Palisa was taken straight from the battlefield to the president’s office, and he sees his appointment as an attempt to tackle systemic issues within the military. Part of a new generation of Ukrainian military leadership, he was studying at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. He graduated remotely in the summer of 2022 while fighting on the frontline. He then commanded the 93rd Brigade 'Kholodnyi Yar,' during the grueling nine-month battle for Bakhmut. 'This is a unique opportunity to bring pressing military issues to the attention of the country’s top leadership,' he said, adding that he intends to return to his battlefield role once his mission is complete. With Russia continuing to make incremental advances in the Donetsk region, some analysts have pointed to structural weaknesses in Ukraine’s command system and faltering communication between the units on the frontline as a key factor in its struggle to hold territory along the 1000 km (620 mile) frontline. Since the beginning of Moscow's full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s army has expanded significantly but years of resisting Russian advances has left little time for strategic management — a gap that now threatens to jeopardize Ukraine’s chances of success. Palisa says there's an urgent need for reforms to improve coordination and effectiveness. '(We need) to adapt the structure to the logic of modern warfare, which will allow us to be more effective and prevent us from making the same mistakes repeatedly,' he said. 'This is what needs to be done. There is no other way.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraine-is-reforming-its-recruitment-efforts-to-attract-younger-soldiers-and-boost-forces/	2025-01-23T20:07:49-08:00	
How the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal will unfold —and why it is so...	CAIRO (AP) — Israeli troops have pulled back to the edges of Gaza, the first hostages have been released and many Palestinians have returned to what remains of their homes in the first few days of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal. If it goes according to plan, there will be no fighting in Gaza for at least six weeks, and dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be freed, while more aid flows in. The question is if the ceasefire will survive beyond the first phase — and an appendix to the deal provided to The Associated Press reveals some of the tensions in it. Extending the ceasefire depends on even more negotiations meant to begin soon and eventually tackling the tough issue of how Gaza will be governed, with Israel still demanding the elimination of Hamas. Hanging over those talks is the possibility Israel could resume its campaign to destroy the militant group — even as dozens of hostages remain in its hands. Here is a look at the plan and the major challenges ahead. Israeli troops pull back and Palestinians return home As part of Phase 1, Israeli troops have pulled back into a buffer zone along Gaza’s borders with Israel. According to the appendix, which AP has verified, the buffer is 700 meters (about 0.4 mi) wide in most areas. That has allowed displaced Palestinians to begin to return to their homes, many of which were destroyed or heavily damaged by Israel’s campaign. But their return has been a complicated point in the negotiations. Israel long demanded it keep control over Palestinians’ movement to ensure Hamas does not move weapons back to northern Gaza close to Israeli communities. Throughout the war, the Israeli military had barred Palestinians from returning to the north by severing Gaza along the Netzarim corridor, a belt that runs east to west across the strip where troops cleared out the Palestinian population and set up bases. According to the appendix, Israel will start on Saturday allowing displaced Palestinians to return to the north without searches, but only on foot via the main north-south coastal road. In the coming weeks, it is supposed to open another route to foot traffic, without inspection. A private company — the details of which are yet to be formally announced — will search Palestinians returning in vehicles to prevent military hardware from reaching the north, according to the appendix. The document says this will also start from Saturday, but it is still unclear how it will work. The appendix was confirmed by multiple officials involved in the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. Swapping hostages for imprisoned Palestinians During the first phase, Hamas is set to free 33 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The first exchange took place Sunday with the release of three Israeli hostages and 90 Palestinian prisoners. By the end of the 42 days, all living women, children and older people held by the militants should be freed. Currently, some 94 hostages remain captive inside Gaza, a mix of civilians and soldiers and foreigners. The military believes at least a third them are dead. The next exchange is set for Saturday. After that, if the deal does not collapse, there will be weekly releases. The 33 will include women, children, sick people and those over 50 — almost all civilians, but the deal also commits Hamas to freeing all living female soldiers in Phase 1. Hamas will release living hostages first, but could release some bodies if they don't have enough living hostages in this category. In exchange, Israel will free 30 Palestinian women, children or older people for each living civilian hostage freed. The deal says those released will include more than 110 Palestinians serving life sentences. For each female soldier freed, Israel will release 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 serving life sentences. Many of the prisoners who will be released were convicted in deadly attacks. A number of Palestinian prisoners will be sent abroad or to Gaza, according to the deal, but it unclear who this will apply to and which country will accept them. According to the appendix, Israel will also release 1,000 people detained from Gaza since the war began, as long as they are not accused of involvement in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Dozens of male hostages, including soldiers, will remain captive in Gaza, pending the second phase. The Philadelphi corridor At the end of the first phase, Israel has also pledged to begin reducing its forces in the Philadelphi corridor, a strategic strip of territory along Gaza’s border with Egypt — and, according to the appendix, they will completely withdraw by Day 50. Israel's demand to maintain a long-term presence in the corridor while Hamas demanded a full withdrawal was one of the knottiest issues in the ceasefire negotiations. At the same time, the document states that the Rafah Crossing into Egypt will be reopened to allow wounded and sick Palestinians — including a few dozen wounded fighters, whose exit would have to be approved by Israel and Egypt — to be evacuated for treatment, but only when all the female hostages have been released, including female soldiers. An Israeli official told the AP that Israeli troops will not be drawn down in Gaza during the initial 42 days, only redistributed. The official, who spoke on condition anonymity to discuss close-door talks, also said that if it does reach a deal with Hamas on Phase 2 that meets Israel’s war aims, which include the full dismantling of the militant group, Israel will stay in the corridor. Humanitarian aid In the first phase, aid to Gaza is ramping up to hundreds of trucks a day of food, medicine, building supplies and fuel to alleviate the humanitarian crisis. This already has begun. The need is great. Malnutrition and diseases are rampant among Palestinians, while hospitals have been damaged and are short of supplies. Implementation, however, could bring problems. Even before the war, Israel restricted the entry of some equipment, arguing it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. Further complicating matters, Israel’s government is still committed to its plan to ban UNRWA — the U.N. agency that is the main distributor of aid in Gaza — from operating and to cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. Beyond Phase 1 Phase 2's broad outlines are laid out in the deal: All remaining hostages are to be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But that seemingly basic exchange opens up much bigger issues. Israel has said it won't agree to a complete withdrawal until Hamas’ military and political capabilities are eliminated. Hamas says it will not hand over the last hostages until Israel removes all troops from Gaza. So both sides will have to agree to a plan for governing Gaza. Hamas has said it would be willing to step aside, but it may still seek a hand in any future government, which Israel has vehemently rejected. And it is unlikely to give up its weapons. Israel has also rejected the alternative of having the Palestinian Authority govern Gaza. If all sides reach the third phase, it is likely to be less contentious: The bodies of remaining hostages would be returned in exchange for a three- to five-year reconstruction plan in Gaza, but who will pay for it also remains unclear. ___ Sewell reported from Beirut.

Middle East latest: Israeli forces kill 2 Palestinian militants w...	Israeli forces have killed two Palestinian militants who carried out a deadly attack on a bus in the West Bank earlier this month. The Israeli military said Thursday that the two men barricaded themselves in a structure in the West Bank village of Burqin and exchanged fire with Israeli troops before they were killed overnight. The army said a soldier was moderately wounded. The military said Mohammed Nazzal and Katiba al-Shalabi were operatives with the Islamic Jihad militant group. The Hamas militant group released a statement claiming the two men were members of its armed wing and praising the bus attack. Hamas and the smaller and more radical Islamic Jihad are allies that sometimes carry out attacks together. The Jan. 6 attack on the bus carrying Israelis killed three people and wounded six others. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. ___ Here's the latest: 24-year-old Hamas attack survivor will represent Israel at Eurovision TEL AVIV — A survivor of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack will represent Israel at the Eurovision Song Contest to be held in Switzerland in May. Yuval Raphael, 24, won first place in a singing contest on Israeli television that determines Israel’s entry to Eurovision, a pan-continental pop extravaganza. She won with a performance of the Swedish group ABBA’s pop hit 'Dancing Queen,' which she dedicated to the victims of the attack. Raphael survived the Nova music festival in southern Israel as Palestinian militants stormed the event, killing hundreds and taking many hostage during Hamas’ cross-border raid. She has testified in the Israeli parliament about her experience on Oct. 7. She described hiding from gunmen under piles of dead bodies for eight hours, and said 'I’m going to deal with this thing for the rest of my life.' Last year’s Eurovision was overshadowed by the war in Gaza, with large demonstrations protesting Israel’s participation. Israel’s representative, Eden Golan, who ended up taking fifth place in the competition, was kept under tight security. Israel will not compromise on dismantling Hamas, foreign minister says BUDAPEST, Hungary - Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Thursday that Israel would not compromise on its objectives of dismantling Hamas’ military and governing capabilities, and that there were no guarantees for the success of the three-phase cease fire in the war in the Gaza Strip. Speaking alongside his Hungarian counterpart in Budapest, Hungary, Saar said Hamas leaders had declared their intent to carry out more attacks on Israel similar to the deadly raids on Oct. 7, 2023, and could therefore not be allowed to retain any military capabilities. 'They are committed to the idea of eliminating the Jewish state,' Saar said. 'Israel will not accept Hamas’ rule in Gaza. As long as Hamas remains in power, there will be no peace, security or stability in the Middle East.' 'We hope that the framework for the hostage release will continue until its end, but of course I cannot guarantee that,' he continued. 'We will not abandon our objectives.' Heavy rain and floods worsen misery for Palestinians displaced in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Although the ceasefire in Gaza has brought an influx of humanitarian aid and a rare respite from Israeli bombardment, it has done little to change the miserable conditions endured by most of the 2 million people displaced by fighting. The winter weather has compounded the hardships of those eking out an existence in tattered tents and makeshift shelters. Heavy rains were flooding tents across the territory, leaving Palestinians shivering in the cold. At one makeshift camp in the central city of Deir al-Balah, the downpour Thursday quickly soaked through flimsy tents that seemed to float on pools of muck. Some used sandbags to keep their tents from washing away, while others tried to clear the huge puddles of mud outside their shelters. Barefoot children trod through paths that had become filthy rivers. A cacophony of coughs emanated from every corner, raising concerns about the spread of illness. Tareq Deifallah, a displaced resident in Deir al-Balah originally from Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza, said water was seeping through his tent from all sides. He said 'the truce is useless' when it came to changing his living conditions. 'Before the truce we were suffering, after the truce we are suffering, from the rain and the winter,' Deifallah said. Monira Faraj, a mother of two young girls, said rain flooded her tent and soaked through her mattress as her family was sleeping. 'We’re afraid we’re going to drown if it becomes too much,' she said. Residents of the tent camp said they had no choice but to stay put. Even though the ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war that took effect Sunday allows Palestinians displaced by the fighting to return to their homes, those who set out to check on their houses in recent days said they found only ruins. Commercial plane from Turkey lands in Damascus for first time in 13 years DAMASCUS, Syria — A commercial plane from Turkey landed in Damascus for the first time in 13 years on Thursday, Syrian state media said. The Turkish Airlines plane flew from Istanbul to the Syrian capital, SANA reported, two weeks after the first international commercial flight landed, from Qatar, since former Syrian President Bashar Assad’s fall. Ankara backed opposition groups in northwestern Syria that fought against Assad and his allies during the uprising-turned-conflict and never restored ties, even when most Mideast countries did in 2023. Now Turkey, a key ally of the new authorities under the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, has expressed its intention to invest in Syria’s economy and help its ailing electricity and energy sectors. Israel's ambassador to US says the 2 countries are discussing Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon JERUSALEM — Israel’s ambassador to the United States says the two countries are in talks about the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon as a deadline in the ceasefire with Hezbollah militants approaches. Israeli media have reported that Israel is seeking to postpone the completion of its pullout. Michael Herzog said in an interview with Israeli Army Radio on Thursday that he believed Israel would 'reach an understanding' with the Trump administration, without elaborating. Under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that ended more than a year of fighting linked to the war in the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces are supposed to complete their withdrawal from southern Lebanon by Sunday. Israeli media have reported that Israel reached an understanding with the Biden administration on staying longer but that President Donald Trump is urging it to withdraw on time. There was no immediate comment from the United States. Israeli officials have said Lebanese troops are not deploying fast enough in the areas Israeli troops are supposed to vacate. Under the ceasefire, the Lebanese army is to patrol a buffer zone in southern Lebanon alongside United Nations peacekeepers. Hezbollah has threatened to resume its rocket and drone fire if Israel does not withdraw on time. Al Jazeera says the Palestinian Authority arrested one of its reporters The Al Jazeera news network says the Palestinian Authority arrested one of its reporters after preventing him from covering an Israeli operation in the occupied West Bank. The Qatar-based news network reported Thursday that its reporter, Mohammed al-Atrash, was arrested from his home. It said Palestinian security forces had earlier prevented him from reporting on a large Israeli military operation in Jenin, an epicenter of Israeli-Palestinian violence in recent years. The Palestinian Authority launched its own crackdown on militants in the city late last year. There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian Authority. Both Israel and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority banned Al Jazeera last year. Israel accuses it of being a mouthpiece of Hamas over its coverage of the war in the Gaza Strip and says some of its reporters are also militants. The pan-Arab broadcaster has rejected the allegations and accused both Israel and the Palestinian Authority of trying to silence critical coverage. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and cooperates with Israel on security matters. It is unpopular among Palestinians, with critics portraying it as a corrupt and authoritarian ally of Israel. Israel’s Netanyahu will probably visit Trump in the next few weeks, official says UNITED NATIONS – Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations believes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Washington to meet President Donald Trump 'in a few weeks.' Danny Danon told reporters Wednesday: 'I’m sure he would be one of the first foreign leaders invited to the White House.' Danon said he expects their discussions to include the current ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and the release of hostages taken during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack in southern Israel.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-al-jazeera-says-the-palestinian-authority-arrested-one-of-its-reporters/	2025-01-23T03:09:39-08:00	
NATO chief says Russian victory over Ukraine would have a costly ...	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned on Thursday that a Russian victory over Ukraine would undermine the dissuasive force of the world’s biggest military alliance and that its credibility could cost trillions to restore. NATO has been ramping up its forces along its eastern flank with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, deploying thousands of troops and equipment to deter Moscow from expanding its war into the territory of any of the organization’s 32 member countries. 'If Ukraine loses then to restore the deterrence of the rest of NATO again, it will be a much, much higher price than what we are contemplating at this moment in terms of ramping up our spending and ramping up our industrial production,' Rutte said. 'It will not be billions extra; it will be trillions extra,' he said, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Rutte insisted that Ukraine’s Western backers must 'step up and not scale back the support' they are providing to the country, almost three years after Russia’s full-fledged invasion began. 'We have to change the trajectory of the war,' Rutte said, adding that the West 'cannot allow in the 21st century that one country invades another country and tries to colonize it.' 'We are beyond those days,' he said. Anxiety in Europe is mounting that U.S. President Donald Trump might seek to quickly end the war in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on terms that are unfavorable to Ukraine, but Rutte appeared wary about trying to do things in a hurry. 'If we got a bad deal, it would only mean that we will see the president of Russia high-fiving with the leaders from North Korea, Iran and China and we cannot accept that,' the former Dutch prime minister said. 'That would be geopolitically a big, big mistake.' Trump’s new envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, criticized allies who talk of continuing the war but still won’t increase their defense spending to NATO guidelines. He said Americans think it is 'outrageous' that the Biden administration refused to talk to Putin. NATO leaders have agreed that each member country should spend at least 2% of gross domestic product on their military budgets. The alliance estimates that 23 members will reach that level this year, although almost a third will still fall short. Poland and Estonia spend most in GDP terms. 'You cannot ask the American people to expand the umbrella of NATO when the current members aren’t paying their fair share,' Grenell said. The United States spends most within NATO on its own budget, in dollar terms, and allies rely on its military might for their defense. 'When we have leaders who are going to talk about more war, we need to make sure that those leaders are spending the right amount of money,' Grenell said. 'We need to be able to avoid war, and that means a credible threat from NATO.' He also insisted that former President Joe Biden was wrong not to talk to Putin, who was indicted for war crimes in 2023 by the International Criminal Court for the 'unlawful deportation' of children from Ukraine to Russia. 'You should be able to talk to people,' Grenell said. 'Talking is a tactic, and you’re not going to be able to solve problems peacefully unless you actually have conversations,' he said. Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski welcomed Trump's acknowledgement that it must be Russia which should make the first peace moves, but he cautioned that 'this is not the Putin that President Trump knew in his first term.' On Wednesday, Trump threatened to impose stiff taxes, tariffs and sanctions on Moscow if an agreement isn’t reached to end the war, but that warning will probably fall on deaf ears in the Kremlin. Russia's economy is already weighed down by a multitude of U.S. and European sanctions. Sikorksi warned that Putin should not be put at the center of the world stage over Ukraine. 'The president of the United States is the leader of the free world. Vladimir Putin is an outcast and an indicted war criminal for stealing Ukrainian children,' Sikorski said. 'I would suggest that Putin has to earn the summit, that if he gets it early, it elevates him beyond his, significance and gives him the wrong idea about the trajectory of this,' he said.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-nato-chief-says-russian-victory-over-ukraine-would-have-a-costly-impact-on-alliances-credibility/	2025-01-23T01:35:00-08:00	
Why is Israel launching a crackdown in the West Bank after the Ga...	In the days since a fragile ceasefire took hold in the Gaza Strip, Israel has launched a major military operation in the occupied West Bank and suspected Jewish settlers have rampaged through two Palestinian towns. The violence comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces domestic pressure from his far-right allies after agreeing to the truce and hostage-prisoner exchange with the Hamas militant group. U.S. President Donald Trump has, meanwhile, rescinded the Biden administration's sanctions against Israelis accused of violence in the territory. It's a volatile mix that could undermine the ceasefire, which is set to last for at least six weeks and bring about the release of dozens of hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, most of whom will be released into the West Bank. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, and Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Escalations in one area frequently spill over, raising further concerns that the second and far more difficult phase of the Gaza ceasefire — which has yet to be negotiated — may never come. A rampage and a military raid Dozens of masked men rampaged through two Palestinian villages in the northern West Bank late Monday, hurling stones and setting cars and property ablaze, according to local Palestinian officials. The Red Crescent emergency service said 12 people were beaten and wounded. Israeli forces, meanwhile, carried out a raid elsewhere in the West Bank that the military said was in response to the hurling of firebombs at Israeli vehicles. It said several suspects were detained for questioning, and a video circulating online appeared to show dozens being marched through the streets. On Tuesday, the Israeli military launched another major operation, this time in the northern West Bank city of Jenin, where its forces have regularly clashed with Palestinian militants in recent years, even before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip triggered the war there. At least nine Palestinians were killed on Tuesday, including a 16-year-old, and 40 were wounded, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The military said its forces carried out airstrikes and dismantled roadside bombs and 'hit' 10 militants — though it was not clear what that meant. Palestinian residents have reported a major increase in Israeli checkpoints and delays across the territory. Israel, meanwhile, says threats from the West Bank against its citizens are on the rise. Earlier this month, Palestinian gunmen opened fire on motorists there, killing three Israelis, including two women in their 70s. That attack fueled calls from settler leaders for a crackdown in the territory. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz cast the Jenin operation as part of Israel's larger struggle against Iran and its militant allies across the region, saying 'we will strike the octopus' arms until they snap.' The Palestinians view such operations and the expansion of settlements as ways of cementing Israeli control over the territory, where 3 million Palestinians live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering cities and towns. Prominent human rights groups call it a form of apartheid since the over 500,000 Jewish settlers in the territory have all the rights conferred by Israeli citizenship. Israel rejects those allegations. Netanyahu's far-right partners are up in arms Netanyahu has been struggling to quell a rebellion by his ultranationalist coalition partners since agreeing to the ceasefire. The agreement requires Israeli forces to withdraw from most of Gaza and release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners — including militants convicted of murder — in exchange for hostages abducted in the Oct. 7 attack. One coalition partner, Itamar Ben-Gvir, resigned in protest the day the ceasefire went into effect. Another, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to bolt if Israel does not resume the war after the first phase of the ceasefire is slated to end in early March. They want Israel to annex the West Bank and to rebuild settlements in Gaza while encouraging what they refer to as the voluntary migration of large numbers of Palestinians. Netanyahu still has a parliamentary majority after Ben-Gvir's departure, but the loss of Smotrich — who is also the de facto governor of the West Bank — would severely weaken his coalition and likely lead to early elections. That could spell the end of Netanyahu's nearly unbroken 16 years in power, leaving him even more exposed to longstanding corruption charges and an expected public inquiry into Israel's failure to prevent the Oct. 7 attack. Trump's return could give settlers a freer hand Trump's return to the White House offers Netanyahu a potential lifeline. The newly sworn-in president, who lent unprecedented support to Israel during his previous term, has surrounded himself with aides who support Israeli settlement. Some support the settlers' claim to a biblical right to the West Bank because of the Jewish kingdoms that existed there in antiquity. The international community overwhelmingly considers settlements illegal. Among the flurry of executive orders Trump signed on his first day back in office was one rescinding the Biden administration's sanctions on settlers and Jewish extremists accused of violence against Palestinians. The sanctions — which had little effect — were one of the few concrete steps the Biden administration took in opposition to the close U.S. ally, even as it provided billions of dollars in military support for Israel's campaign in Gaza, among the deadliest and most destructive in decades. Trump claimed credit for helping to get the Gaza ceasefire agreement across the finish line in the final days of the Biden presidency. But this week, Trump said he was 'not confident' it would hold and signaled he would give Israel a free hand in Gaza, saying: 'It's not our war, it's their war.' ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-why-is-israel-launching-a-crackdown-in-the-west-bank-after-the-gaza-ceasefire/	2025-01-22T19:20:40-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israel says it killed a militant in Gaza as f...	The Israeli military said Wednesday its soldiers killed an alleged militant in Gaza whom it said posed a threat to its forces, as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas stretched into a fourth day. It appeared to be the first time since the ceasefire began Sunday that the Israeli military said it struck targets in Gaza. It was not clear whether the killing would affect the deal. The truce is supposed to bring calm to war-battered Gaza for at least six weeks and see 33 Hamas-held hostages released in return for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Meanwhile, Israeli forces are pressing ahead with a major military operation in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin for a second day. At least 10 people have been killed, Palestinian health officials say. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages still remain in Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed dead. The rest have been released, rescued, or their bodies recovered. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities but do not say how many of the dead were fighters. Israel says it killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the latest: Israel’s Netanyahu will probably visit Trump in the next few weeks, official says UNITED NATIONS – Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations believes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Washington to meet President Donald Trump 'in a few weeks.' Danny Danon told reporters Wednesday: 'I’m sure he would be one of the first foreign leaders invited to the White House.' Danon said he expects their discussions to include the current ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and the release of hostages taken during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack in southern Israel. Israel says it killed a militant in Gaza, an apparent first since the ceasefire began TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said Wednesday its soldiers killed an alleged militant in Gaza whom it said posed a threat to forces, as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas stretched into a fourth day. It appeared to be the first time the Israeli military said it struck targets in Gaza since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began Sunday. It was not clear whether the killing would affect the deal. The military said troops in southern Gaza saw several armed suspects. It said troops then 'eliminated' an alleged militant with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group identified by the military as Akram Atef Farhan Zanon. The militant group had no immediate comment. The ceasefire will see a six-week pause in the war in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israel and Hamas are expected to begin talks soon over extending the truce. Israel's military has said it will uphold the agreement but would act against perceived threats. UN envoy visits Syria and urges forming a new national army DAMASCUS, Syria — U.N. special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen said Wednesday during a visit to Damascus that forming a new national army in Syria should be a priority for the country’s rulers — the former insurgents who toppled President Bashar Assad. Bringing Syria's disparate factions together into one military is 'vital for stability, but it also requires careful management in a way that avoids competing armies and fragmented command structures,' he said. Pedersen said he is concerned about ongoing fighting in northeastern Syria between Turkish-backed groups and U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces. He said Turkey and the U.S. have crucial roles to play in negotiating an end to the fighting 'so this does not end in the full military confrontation that will not serve the interests of the Syrian people,' he said. He also criticized Israel’s occupation of Syrian territory in a buffer zone set up as part of a 1974 ceasefire agreement. Israeli forces captured the area after Assad’s fall, and Israeli officials have said they will remain there until a new arrangement is established to ensure Israel’s security. 'There is no excuse for what is what the Israelis are now doing,' Pedersen said. 'And this needs to stop.' Speaking at Davos, the Syrian foreign minister has high hopes for economic recovery BEIRUT — Syria's new foreign minister said Wednesday at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos that his country hopes it can follow in the footsteps of economic powerhouses like Singapore and Saudi Arabia as it begins rebuilding after nearly 14 years of war. 'We need the help of the international community to help us in this new experiment,' Asaad al-Shibani said. He also pledged that Syria's government and constitution will be representative of all of the country's communities. Western nations, although they have moved to restore ties with Damascus since former President Bashar Assad was overthrown by a lightning insurgent offensive last month, are still somewhat circumspect about the new rulers, led by the Islamist former rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. 'All the time they ask us about the how to guarantee the rights of (this or) that group and how to guarantee the rights of the woman — in Syria all of us will be under the Constitution and under the rule of law,' al-Shibani said. The committee of experts formed to draft a new constitution — a process that could take years — will comprise all 'the different groups of Syria' including women, he said. Israel pulls more troops out of Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Wednesday it was drawing down soldiers from the Gaza Strip, as a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas holds for a fourth day. Also Wednesday, Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said that troops will begin to withdraw Saturday from a corridor that bisects northern Gaza from the south. That will pave the way for Palestinians prevented from heading north to return to their homes. The withdrawal would only happen once the next batch of hostages set to be freed Saturday are in Israeli custody, Shoshani said. The military shared footage of what it said were tanks crossing out of Gaza. It said the force leaving, the Givati Brigade Combat Team, spent weeks in Jabaliya in northern Gaza, where Israel launched a major offensive late last year. Under the first stage of the three-phase ceasefire agreement, Israel is to withdraw troops from parts of Gaza and displaced Palestinians will begin returning to what's left of their homes. Syrian defense minister is open to ‘all possibilities’ in talks with the Kurds DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria’s new defense minister is ready for 'all possibilities' in negotiations with U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces who control northeastern Syria, with the intention of having the war-torn country under one military force. The former rebels who now run Syria’s government have rejected any form of federalism or autonomous regions, and aim to have all weapons solely under state control. 'We want a solution with the administration that runs eastern Syria in order to preserve the Kurdish component and find a peaceful solution with them and not to cause a large-scale war,' Murhaf Abu Qasra told reporters Wednesday. The Kurdish forces have been fighting with Turkish-backed forces in northern Syria in the weeks since President Bashar Assad was overthrown. Turkey wants to create a border buffer zone free of the Kurdish forces, but the Kurds have been a key U.S. ally in combatting Islamic State group sleeper cells. Israeli forces are surrounding a hospital in the West Bank and hundreds of Palestinians are trapped inside, health officials say JENIN, West Bank — Hundreds of Palestinians were trapped in a hospital by an Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank that has killed at least 10 people in two days, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Wednesday. The Israeli military said its forces were trying to detonate explosive devices planted by militants beneath the road outside the hospital in the city of Jenin, and had told patients and doctors not to exit the hospital during the detonations. Dozens of military bulldozers have carved up tracts of roads in Jenin. A nurse inside the Jenin Government Hospital said patients were 'terrified' as hundreds of people were unable to leave for hours. On Wednesday afternoon, pregnant women and older adults, one carrying an infant bundled in a blanket against the winter chill, walked past ambulances and armored vehicles away from the hospital and the Jenin refugee camp, as gunfire echoed down the empty streets and Israeli military drones and aircraft buzzed low overhead. 'There’s no medicine, no food, no supplies, nothing,' said Ashram Abu Sroor, shaking his head as he exited the hospital. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said Israeli forces had begun the large operation in Jenin with the main goal of clearing roadside bombs placed by militants under streets and civilian infrastructure aimed at Israeli soldiers. Israeli forces have regularly clashed with Palestinian militants in Jenin in recent years, even before the war in Gaza. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, and Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Escalations in one area frequently spill over. Yemen’s Houthi rebels release crew of commercial vessel seized in 2023 DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels said they released the crew of the Galaxy Leader, a ship they seized in November 2023 at the start of their campaign in the Red Sea corridor. The rebels said Wednesday they released the sailors after mediation by Oman. The crew of 25 included mariners from the Philippines, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Mexico. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels said they hijacked the ship over its connection to Israel. They then had a campaign targeting ships in international waters, which only stopped with the recent ceasefire in Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel says it will keep control of the Rafah crossing with Egypt JERUSALEM — Israel says it will maintain control of the Rafah crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip during the first phase of the ceasefire with Hamas. A statement issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Wednesday denied reports that the Palestinian Authority would control the crossing. It said local Palestinians not affiliated with Hamas who had been vetted by Israeli security would merely stamp passports at the crossing. It noted that, under international agreements, this stamp 'is the only way Gazans may leave the Strip in order to enter, or be received in, other countries.' The statement said Israeli forces would surround the crossing and that Israel must approve the movement of all people and goods through it. It said European Union monitors would supervise the crossing. Israel captured the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing last May, forcing it to shut down. Egypt, a key mediator in more than a year of negotiations that led to the ceasefire, has demanded that Palestinians control the Gaza side. UN says aid is flowing smoothly into Gaza UNITED NATIONS – The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Gaza says trucks from the U.N., aid groups, governments and the private sector are arriving and no major looting has been reported -– just a few minor incidents. Nearly 900 trucks of aid entered Gaza on the third day of the ceasefire Tuesday, the United Nations said. That's significantly higher than the 600 trucks called for in the deal. Muhannad Hadi, who returned to Jerusalem from Gaza on Tuesday afternoon, told U.N. reporters by video that it was one of the happiest days of his 35-year humanitarian career to see Palestinians in the streets looking ahead with hope, some heading home and some starting to clean up the roads. In his talks with families at a communal kitchen run by the U.N. World Food Program and elsewhere, he said, they all told him they need humanitarian assistance but want to go home, to work and earn money.
