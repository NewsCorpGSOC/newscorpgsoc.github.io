Trump shares AI video envisioning Gaza development with gold stat...	(The Hill) - President Trump on Tuesday evening shared a video using artificial intelligence (AI) that showcases his proposals for the potential development of the war-torn Gaza Strip, complete with a golden statue of his likeness and beachfront skyscrapers rising from the rubble. The 33-second video, which the president shared on Truth Social, starts with a shot of the city in ruins after the Israeli military's 15-month bombardment campaign. Text on the screen then reads 'Gaza 2025 — What’s next.' The AI footage then pans to a scene of presumably tech billionaire and senior advisor Elon Musk enjoying a meal and laughing, as the sun shines and people dance around him. 'No more tunnels, no more fear,' the voice in the video sings. 'Trump Gaza is finally here. Trump Gaza shining bright, golden future, brand new light.' The video also features children holding gold balloons also made to look like Trump and a renovated beachfront with luxury hotels and money flying in the air. It also shows a shot of a 'Trump Gaza' building and toward the end, the U.S. president and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seem to be enjoying drinks in the sun, shirtless. The AI film comes as Trump has doubled down in recent weeks on a plan for the U.S. to take responsibility for the enclave, currently controlled by Palestinian militant group Hamas. The president has proposed turning the Strip into a 'Riviera of the Middle East.' He has also suggested that Palestinians in be permanently relocated after the war between Israel and Hamas is over. The plan invited a bevy of criticism from Arab American and Muslim leaders, heads of Western countries and leaders of nations in the Middle East. During an interview on Fox News, Trump also suggested that Palestinians would not have the right to return to Gaza. 'In other words, I’m talking about building a permanent place for them, because if they have to return now, it’ll be years before you could ever — it’s not habitable,' Trump said during the interview earlier this month. 'It would be years before it could happen.' Israel and Hamas are currently under a fragile ceasefire agreement, which brought an end to the conflict that began on Oct. 7, 2023. The second phase of the deal is expected to begin soon after the remaining hostages and Palestinian prisoners are exchanged.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/trump-shares-ai-video-envisioning-gaza-development-with-gold-statue-of-himself/	2025-02-26T05:55:37-08:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy says framework economic deal with US is ready	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Wednesday that Ukraine and the United States have reached preliminary agreement on a broad economic deal that includes U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals amid its three-year war with Russia. After days of negotiations, Ukraine and the U.S. will sign the preliminary agreement but with further details of a full agreement — including U.S. security guarantees that Kyiv officials view as vital — still to be worked out, Shmyhal said on Ukrainian public television. Since returning to office last month, U.S. President Donald Trump let Ukraine know he wanted something in return for tens of billions of dollars in U.S. help to fend off Russia’s invasion. Trump has abruptly ditched some previous Washington policies. He scrapped efforts to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin and cast doubt on U.S. support for its European allies. That has brought momentous geopolitical shifts that could reset the war’s path this year. The preliminary agreement sets out the terms and conditions of an investment fund for the rebuilding of Ukraine, Shmyhal said. The agreement could be signed as early as Friday and plans are being drawn up for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to travel to Washington to meet Trump, officials have said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-and-ukraine-have-agreed-on-a-preliminary-economic-deal-ukraines-prime-minister-says/	2025-02-26T05:37:45-08:00	
Hamas will turn over bodies of 4 Israeli hostages in exchange for...	CAIRO (AP) — Hamas will return the bodies of four dead Israeli hostages on Thursday in exchange for Israel's release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the group said, just days before the first phase of the ceasefire between the warring parties was to expire. Israel has delayed the release of about 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it says is the cruel treatment of hostages during their release by Hamas. The militant group has said that the delay is a 'serious violation' of their ceasefire and that talks on a second phase aren't possible until the Palestinians are freed. Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Hamas would hand over the bodies of four Israelis the next day. In exchange, Israel would release the Palestinian prisoners, as well as an unspecified number of women and minors detained since the militant group's Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the conflict. An Israeli official confirmed that the bodies of four hostages were expected to be turned over but provided no further details. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak with the media. Israel and Hamas had already said on Tuesday that an agreement had been reached to return the bodies of the hostages, but no date had been announced. Hamas has released hostages, and the bodies of four dead hostages, in large public ceremonies during which the Israelis were paraded and forced to wave to large crowds. Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have said the ceremonies were humiliating to the hostages, and Israel last weekend delayed the scheduled prisoner release in protest. There will be no public ceremony when the four bodies in the latest exchange are returned to Israel in the early hours of Thursday, according to a senior Hamas official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak with the media. A fragile ceasefire in peril The deadlock over the exchange had threatened to collapse the ceasefire when the current six-week first phase of the deal expires this weekend. The latest agreement would complete both sides’ obligations of the first phase of the ceasefire — during which Hamas is returning 33 hostages, including eight bodies — in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. It also could clear the way for an expected visit this week by U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region. Witkoff has said that he wants the sides to move into negotiations on the second phase, during which all remaining hostages held by Hamas are to be released and an end to the war is to be negotiated. The Phase 2 talks were supposed to begin weeks ago, but never did. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of heavy fighting that erupted after Hamas’ 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. About 250 people were taken hostage. Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s population and decimated the territory’s infrastructure and health system. The Hamas-run Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but it says that over half of the dead have been women and children. Another infant in Gaza dies of hypothermia With people are living in tent camps and damaged buildings in the Gaza Strip, health officials said another infant had died of hypothermia Wednesday, bringing the toll to seven over the past two weeks. Dr. Munir al-Boursh, director general of Gaza’s Health Ministry, said a baby less than two months old died due to the 'severe cold wave' that has hit the Palestinian enclave. Temperatures have been below 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) at night and the last few days have been particularly cold. ___ Lidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Israel and Hamas agree on new exchange, leaving fragile ceasefire...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli and Hamas officials said Tuesday they have reached an agreement to exchange the bodies of dead hostages for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, keeping their fragile ceasefire intact for at least a few more days. Israel has delayed the release of 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it says is the cruel treatment of hostages during their release by Hamas. The militant group has said the delay is a 'serious violation' of their ceasefire and that talks on a second phase are not possible until they are freed. The deadlock had threatened to collapse the ceasefire when the current six-week first phase of the deal expires this weekend. But late Tuesday, Hamas said an agreement had been reached to resolve the dispute during a visit to Cairo by a delegation headed by Khalil al-Hayya, a top political official in the group. The breakthrough appeared to clear the way for the return of the bodies of four more dead hostages and hundreds of additional prisoners scheduled to be released under the ceasefire. The prisoners previously slated for release 'will be released simultaneously with the bodies of the Israeli prisoners who were agreed to be handed over,' along with the release of a new set of Palestinian prisoners, the Hamas statement said. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed an agreement to bring home the bodies in the coming days. He gave no further details. But Israeli media reports said the exchange could take place as soon as Wednesday. The Ynet news site said the Israeli bodies would be handed over to Egyptian authorities without any public ceremony. Hamas has released hostages, and the bodies of four dead hostages, in large public ceremonies during which the Israelis were paraded and forced to wave to large crowds. Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have said the ceremonies were humiliating to the hostages, and Israel last weekend delayed the scheduled prisoner release in protest.

Middle East latest: Hamas official says no further talks with Isr...	A Hamas official says Israel’s delay in the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners is a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire agreement and talks on a second phase of the accord are not possible until they are returned. As part of the agreement, Israel was supposed to release the prisoners last weekend after Hamas freed hostages from its Oct. 7, 2023, attack. But Israel delayed the release over the treatment of the captives, who were paraded before crowds. In a written statement, Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said the militant group had 'fully adhered to all provisions of the agreements' and that Israel’s delay 'puts the agreement at risk of collapse, potentially leading to a resumption of war.' Here's the latest: Hamas official says Israel's delay in releasing prisoners puts ceasefire at risk A Hamas official says Israel’s delay in the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners constitutes a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire agreement, and suggested that talks on a second phase of the accord are not possible until they are returned. As part of the agreement, Israel was supposed to release the prisoners last weekend after Hamas freed hostages from its Oct. 7, 2023, attack.

In a written statement, Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said the militant group had 'fully adhered to all provisions of the agreements' and that Israel’s delay 'puts the agreement at risk of collapse, potentially leading to a resumption of war.' The first phase of the ceasefire is due to end Saturday, and while negotiations on a second phase were to have started weeks ago, they have not yet begun. A U.S. diplomat is returning to the region this week with the hope of extending the first phase to buy time for further negotiations, but Naim suggested Hamas was unwilling to talk until the prisoners were released. At least 6 infants have died from hypothermia in the Gaza Strip Palestinian medics say at least six infants have died from hypothermia in the last two weeks in the Gaza Strip. A fragile ceasefire that took hold last month paused 15 months of war between Israel and the Hamas militant group. But hundreds of thousands of people are still living in squalid tent camps or bombed-out buildings with little shelter from the cold, and temperatures have plunged in recent days. Dr. Ahmed al-Farah, head of the pediatric department at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told The Associated Press that it received the body of a 2-month-old girl on Tuesday. He said another two infants were treated for frostbite, with one of them discharged. Saeed Saleh, of the Patient’s Friends Hospital in Gaza City, said five infants aged one month or younger have died from the cold over the last two weeks. Zaher al-Wahedi, head of the Gaza Health Ministry’s records department, said it has recorded 15 deaths from hypothermia this winter. The territory on the Mediterranean coast experiences cold and wet winters, with temperatures dropping below 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) at night. Freed Israeli hostage says faith kept her going through Gaza captivity Agam Berger, a former hostage released by Hamas, said it was her Jewish faith that sustained her during her 16-month ordeal in the Gaza Strip. Berger was a military spotter who was captured during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. Berger told Israeli public radio Reshet Bet on Tuesday that she was held in tunnels and apartments with other female captives. She was given two meals a day, pita and rice, and had some access to media. In January 2024, Berger said her captors brought her and other hostages two Jewish prayer books, as well as other objects left behind by Israeli soldiers, such as a newspaper and military maps. She said around the first Hanukkah she spent in captivity in December 2023, in a tunnel with four other hostages, they asked their captors for candles to mark the holiday, and they brought them one. Lebanon's prime minister says only armed forces can defend the nation Lebanon’s new prime minister has read his government policy statement stating that only the country’s armed forces should defend the nation in case of war. Nawaf Salam was picked to form a new government last month after a devastating war between Israel and Hezbollah that killed over 4,000 people and caused widespread destruction. Hezbollah has kept its weapons over the past decades saying it is necessary to defend Lebanon against Israel. But many in Lebanon have been calling on the group to disarm, and such calls intensified during the latest war that stopped when a U.S.-brokered ceasefire went into effect on Nov. 27. Salam said Tuesday that the government asserts that Lebanon has the right to defend itself in case of 'aggression' and only the state has the right to have weapons. He also said that the government takes measures to liberate land occupied by Israel 'through its forces only.' Trump administration's suspension of funds to WHO freezes $46 million for Gaza A Trump administration move to suspend funding to the World Health Organization has frozen $46 million for its operations in Gaza, a top WHO official in the region said Tuesday. Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO representative for Occupied Palestinian Territories, said the 'freezing' would leave six areas underfunded, including EMT operations, rehabilitation of health facilities, coordination with partner organizations, and medical evacuation operations. Speaking from Gaza to reporters a U.N. briefing in Geneva, Peeperkorn said money for such operations remained in WHO’s funding pipeline and 'we’re still going full steam ahead' with activities. Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman, said he did not have figures about how the U.S. funding cuts affected the entirety of its operations worldwide.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-hamas-official-says-no-further-talks-with-israel-until-prisoners-are-freed/	2025-02-25T05:21:53-08:00	
Desperation grows in northern Gaza as Palestinians struggle to re...	BEIT LAHIYA, Gaza Strip (AP) — When night falls over northern Gaza, much of the cityscape of collapsed buildings and piled wreckage turns pitch black. Living inside the ruins of their home, Rawia Tambora’s young sons get afraid of the dark, so she turns on a flashlight and her phone’s light to comfort them, for as long as the batteries last. Displaced for most of the 16-month-long war, Tambora is back in her house. But it is still a frustrating shell of a life, she says: There is no running water, electricity, heat or services, and no tools to clear the rubble around them. Nearly 600,000 Palestinians flooded back into northern Gaza under the now month-old ceasefire in Gaza, according to the United Nations. After initial relief and joy at being back at their homes — even if damaged or destroyed — they now face the reality of living in the wreckage for the foreseeable future. 'Some people wish the war had never ended, feeling it would have been better to be killed,' Tambora said. 'I don’t know what we’ll do long-term. My brain stopped planning for the future.' The six-week ceasefire is due to end Saturday, and it’s uncertain what will happen next. There are efforts to extend the calm as the next phase is negotiated. If fighting erupts again, those who returned to the north could find themselves once again in the middle of it. A massive rebuilding job has no way to start A report last week by the World Bank, U.N. and European Union estimated it will cost some $53 billion to rebuild Gaza after entire neighborhoods were decimated by Israel’s bombardment and offensives against Hamas militants. At the moment, there is almost no capacity or funding to start significant rebuilding. A priority is making Gaza immediately livable. Earlier in February, Hamas threatened to hold up hostage releases unless more tents and temporary shelters were allowed into Gaza. It then reversed and accelerated hostage releases after Israel agreed to let in mobile homes and construction equipment. Humanitarian agencies have stepped up services, setting up free kitchens and water delivery stations, and distributing tents and tarps to hundreds of thousands across Gaza, according to the U.N. President Donald Trump turned up the pressure by calling for the entire population of Gaza to be removed permanently so the U.S. can take over the territory and redevelop it for others. Rejecting the proposal, Palestinians say they want help to rebuild for themselves. Gaza City’s municipality started fixing some water lines and clearing rubble from streets, said a spokesperson, Asem Alnabih. But it lacks heavy equipment. Only a few of its 40 bulldozers and five dump trucks still work, he said. Gaza is filled with over 50 million tons of rubble that would take 100 trucks working at full capacity over 15 years to clear away, the U.N. estimates. Families try to get by day by day Tambora’s house in the northern town of Beit Lahiya was destroyed by an airstrike early in the war, so she and her family lived in the nearby Indonesian Hospital, where she worked as a nurse. After the ceasefire, they moved back into the only room in her house that was semi-intact. The ceiling is partially collapsed, the walls are cracked; the surviving fridge and sink are useless with no water or electricity. They stack their sheets and blankets in a corner. Tambora said her 12-year-old son lugs heavy containers of water twice a day from distribution stations. They also have to find firewood for cooking. The influx of aid means there is food in the markets and prices went down, but it remains expensive, she said. With the Indonesian Hospital too damaged to function, Tambora walks an hour each day to work at the Kamal Adwan Hospital. She charges her and her husband’s phones using the hospital generator. Many of Tambora’s relatives returned to find nothing left of their homes, so they live in tents on or next to the rubble that gets blown away by winter winds or flooded during rains, she said. Asmaa Dwaima and her family returned to Gaza City but had to rent an apartment because their home in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood was destroyed. It was only weeks after returning that she went to visit their four-story house, now a pile of flattened and burned wreckage. 'I couldn’t come here because I was afraid. I had an image of my house in my mind — its beauty, and warmth. ... I was afraid to face this truth,' the 25-year-old dentist said. 'They don’t just destroy stone, they are destroying us and our identity.' Her family had to rebuild the house once before, when it was leveled by airstrikes during a round of fighting between Israel and Hamas in 2014, she said. For the time being, they have no means to rebuild now. 'We need to remove the rubble because we want to pull out clothes and some of our belongings,' she said. 'We need heavy equipment … There are no bricks or other construction tools and, if available, it’s extremely expensive.' Desperation is growing Tess Ingram, a spokesperson with UNICEF who visited northern Gaza since the ceasefire, said the families she met are 'grieving the lives that they used to live as they begin to rebuild.' Their desperation, she said, 'is becoming more intense.' Huda Skaik, a 20-year-old student, is sharing a room with her three siblings and parents at her grandparents’ house in Gaza City. It’s an improvement from life in the tent camps of central Gaza where they were displaced for much of the war, she said. There, they had to live among strangers, and their tent was washed away by rain. At least here they have walls and are with family, she said. Before the war interrupted, Skaik had just started studying English literature at Gaza’s Islamic University. She is now enrolled in online classes the university is organizing. But the internet is feeble, and her electricity relies on solar panels that don’t always work. 'The worst part is that we’re just now grasping that we lost it all,' she said. 'The destruction is massive, but I’m trying to remain positive.' ___ Khaled reported from Cairo.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-palestinians-struggle-to-restart-their-lives-in-the-ruins-of-gaza/	2025-02-25T04:59:19-08:00	
US refuses to blame Russia for Ukraine war, splitting with Europe...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — In a dramatic shift in transatlantic relations under President Donald Trump, the United States split with its European allies by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in votes on three U.N. resolutions Monday seeking an end to the three-year war. The growing divide follows Trump’s decision to open direct negotiations with Russia on ending the war, dismaying Ukraine and its European supporters by excluding them from the preliminary talks last week. In the U.N. General Assembly, the U.S. joined Russia in voting against a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution that calls out Moscow’s aggression and demands an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops. The U.S. then abstained from voting on its own competing resolution after Europeans. led by France, succeeded in amending it to make clear Russia was the aggressor. The voting was taking place on the third anniversary of Russia's invasion and as Trump was hosting French President Emmanuel Macron in Washington. It was a major setback for the Trump administration in the 193-member world body, whose resolutions are not legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion. The U.S. then pushed for a vote on its original draft in the more powerful U.N. Security Council, where resolutions are legally binding and it has veto power along with Russia, China, Britain and France. The vote in the 15-member council was 10-0 with five European countries abstaining – Britain, France, Denmark, Greece and Slovenia. The dueling resolutions also reflect the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine. In escalating rhetoric, Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator' for not holding elections during wartime, when much of Ukraine is under Russian occupation, its soldiers are on the frontlines and the country is under martial law. Trump also has falsely accused Kyiv of starting the war and warned that he 'better move fast' to negotiate an end to the conflict or risk not having a nation to lead. Zelenskyy responded by saying Trump was living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space.' In a whirlwind of diplomacy, Trump’s meeting with Macron will be followed by a visit on Thursday from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, key U.S. allies who were in lockstep with Washington on Ukraine just over a month ago. They now find themselves on opposite sides on the best pathway for the UN to call for an end to the war. The General Assembly voted 93-18 with 65 abstentions to approve the Ukrainian resolution. The result showed some diminished support for Ukraine, because previous assembly votes saw more than 140 nations condemn Russia’s aggression and demand an immediate withdrawal. The assembly then turned to the U.S.-drafted resolution, which acknowledges 'the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict' and 'implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia,' but never mentions Moscow’s aggression. In a surprise move, France proposed three amendments, which add that the conflict was the result of a 'full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.' The amendments reaffirm the assembly’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity, and call for peace that respects the U.N. Charter. Russia proposed an amendment calling for 'root causes' of the conflict to be addressed. All the amendments were approved and the resolution passed 93-8 with 73 abstentions, with Ukraine voting 'yes,' the U.S. abstaining, and Russia voting 'no.' Both assembly resolutions were supported by U.S. allies in Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, its neighbors Canada and Mexico and European countries, with the exception of Hungary. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa said her country is exercising its 'inherent right to self-defense' following Russia’s invasion, which violates the U.N. Charter’s requirement that countries respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations. 'As we mark three years of this devastation — Russia’s full invasion against Ukraine — we call on all nations to stand firm and to take … the side of the Charter, the side of humanity and the side of just and lasting peace, peace through strength,' she said. Trump has often stated his commitment to bringing 'peace through strength.' Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward warned the council, 'If Russia is allowed to win, we will live in a world where might is right, where borders can be redrawn by force, where aggressors think they can act with impunity.' Denmark’s Lotte Machon, a deputy foreign minister, stressed that in peace negotiations, 'nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, nothing about European security without Europe.' U.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea, meanwhile, said multiple previous U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops 'have failed to stop the war,' which 'has now dragged on for far too long and at far too terrible a cost to the people in Ukraine and Russia and beyond.' 'What we need is a resolution marking the commitment from all U.N. member states to bring a durable end to the war,' Shea said before the vote. In the Security Council, Russia used its veto to prevent European amendments to the U.S. resolution, which is legally blinding but essentially toothless. It only operative paragraph 'Implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.' Shea called it 'a first step, but a crucial one,' saying it 'puts us on the path to peace.' The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body on Ukraine because the Security Council has been paralyzed by Russia’s veto power. It has approved half a dozen resolutions since Russian forces stormed across the border on Feb. 24, 2022. The Ukrainian resolution adopted Monday recalls the need to implement the previous resolutions, singling out the demand that Russia 'immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine.' The resolution reaffirms the assembly’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and also 'that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.' It calls for 'a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine' and it reiterates 'the urgent need to end the war this year.' ___ AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-the-un-will-vote-to-demand-russia-pull-troops-out-of-ukraine-but-the-us-wants-a-softer-approach/	2025-02-24T17:58:45-08:00	
Trump expresses hope Russia's war in Ukraine is nearing an endgam...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump expressed hope that Russia's war in Ukraine is nearing an endgame as he met Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron on the third anniversary of the invasion. But France's leader cautioned that it's crucial that any potential agreement with Moscow does not amount to surrender for Ukraine. Their talks come at a moment of deep uncertainty about the future of transatlantic relations, with Trump transforming American foreign policy and effectively tuning out European leadership as he looks to quickly end the war in Ukraine. While Macron and Trump made nice at the White House, their countries were at loggerheads at the United Nations over resolutions describing Russia as the aggressor in the war. In broad comments on the state of the conflict, Trump said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine. 'Yeah, he will accept it,' Trump told reporters. 'I have asked him that question. Look, if we do this deal, he’s not looking for more war.' And Trump said he hoped that the war could end within weeks and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would soon come to the U.S. to sign a deal giving America access to Ukraine's critical minerals, which are used in key technology. Trump is pressing the economic deal to help repay some of the $180 billion in American aid for Kyiv since the start of the war — tens of billions of which is being spent in the U.S. to replenish older weapons sent to Ukraine. 'It looks like we’re getting very close,' Trump told reporters of the minerals deal before his meeting with Macron. He said Zelenskyy could potentially visit Washington this week or next to sign it. Ensuring security for Ukraine Ukraine also is looking for future security guarantees as part of any agreement. Trump, however, did not say whether the emerging deal would include such assurances from the United States: 'Europe is going to make sure nothing happens.' A French official with knowledge of Macron’s meeting with Trump said the U.S. president didn’t object to the need for U.S. security guarantees in a possible peace deal but details were still being worked out. The official wasn’t authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. At a joint press conference, Macron acknowledged that European nations must do more to bolster defense on the continent. But he also warned against capitulating to Russia. 'This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine,' Macron said. 'It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees. This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty.' Macron cut off direct communication with Putin after Russian forces carried out brutal operations in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha months into the conflict. But he said the moment has changed and he hopes Trump's engagement with Putin can lead to something fruitful. 'Now, there is a big chance because there is a new U.S. administration, so this is a new context,' Macron said. 'So there is good reason for President Trump to reengage with President Putin.' Putin said Monday that he has not discussed resolving the conflict in Ukraine in detail with Trump and neither did Russian and American negotiating teams when they met in Saudi Arabia last week. Putin also said Russia does not rule out European countries — who were dismayed that they and Ukraine were not invited to the table in Riyadh — participating in a peace settlement. America's foreign policy turnaround The war's anniversary — and the talks at the White House — come at an unnerving moment for much of Europe as it witnesses a dramatic shift in American foreign policy under Trump. Trump has made demands for territory — Greenland, Canada, Gaza and the Panama Canal. Just over a month into his second term, the 'America First' president has cast an enormous shadow over what veteran U.S. diplomats and former government officials had regarded as America’s calming presence of global stability and continuity. Despite some hiccups, the military, economic and moral power of the United States has dominated the post-World War II era, most notably after the Cold War came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union. All of that, some fear, may be lost if Trump gets his way and the U.S. abandons the principles under which the United Nations and numerous other international bodies were founded. 'The only conclusion you can draw is that 80 years of policy in standing up against aggressors has just been blown up without any sort of discussion or reflection,' said Ian Kelly, a U.S. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administrations and now a professor at Northwestern University. European leaders in Washington Trump is set to hold a meeting Thursday with another key European leader, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump shook Europe with repeated criticism of Zelenskyy for failing to negotiate an end to the war and rebuffing a push to sign off on a deal giving the U.S. access to Ukraine's critical minerals, which could be used in the American aerospace, medical and tech industries. Zelenskyy initially bristled, saying it was short on security guarantees. He said Sunday on X that 'we are making great progress' but noted that 'we want a good economic deal that will be part of a true security guarantee system for Ukraine.' Zelenskyy, who said Sunday in response to a question that he would trade his office for peace or to join NATO, had angered Trump by saying the U.S. president was living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space.' In the public spat, Trump called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and falsely charged Kyiv with starting the war. Russia, in fact, invaded its smaller and lesser-equipped neighbor in February 2022. Asked Monday if he thought Putin was also a dictator, Trump demurred: 'I don’t use those words lightly.' Some daylight between allies While Macron and Trump held talks, including participating in a virtual meeting with fellow Group of Seven leaders, the United States split with its European allies at the U.N. by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in a series of resolutions. The U.S. abstained from voting on its own proposal after the Europeans, led by France, succeeded in changing it to make clear that Russia was the aggressor. Before meeting with Trump, Macron said he intended to tell him that it’s in the joint interest of Americans and Europeans not to 'be weak in the face of President Putin.' 'It’s not you, it’s not your trademark, it’s not in your interest,' Macron said. 'How can you then be credible in the face of China if you’re weak in the face of Putin?' Yet, Trump said this month he'd like to see Russia rejoin the G7. It was suspended from the G8 after annexing Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. 'I really believe he wants to make a deal,' Trump said. 'I may be wrong, but I believe he wants to make a deal. ___ AP writers Edith M.

McConnell suggests Trump has ‘gross misunderstanding’ of Ukraine ...	(The Hill) – Former Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday suggested that President Trump’s refusal to blame Russia as the sole aggressor who provoked the war in Ukraine 'reflects a gross misunderstanding of the nature of negotiations and leverage.' McConnell declared in a statement marking the three-year anniversary of the war that the 'human catastrophe rests solely on Vladimir Putin' and that if Ukrainian forces laid down their arms, 'Putin’s aims would not stop with Kyiv.' 'Mistaking this fact is as embarrassing as it is costly,' McConnell said. He also criticized what he called the Biden administration’s 'shameful hesitation and half-measures' in responding to Russian aggression but, without naming Trump specifically, he warned that refusing to recognize the United States’ interest in defeating Russian aggression would be 'even more disgraceful.' 'Refusing to acknowledge Russia as the undeniable and unprovoked aggressor is more than an unseemly moral equivalency — it reflects a gross misunderstanding of the nature of negotiations and leverage,' he said. McConnell, the chairman of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, issued his statement a few days after Trump suggested that Ukraine started the war with Russia and called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 'a dictator without elections.' Russia’s army invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, after Putin said he needed to protect the Russian-speaking population in eastern Ukraine and contain NATO expansion. Trump refused to call Putin a 'dictator' when asked by a reporter whether he would use the same words for the Russian president. 'I don’t use those words lightly,' Trump responded during a joint press appearance with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday at the White House. Trump and Macron discussed their efforts to bring an end to the three-year war. Those comments came on the same day the United States voted against a U.N. resolution condemning Russia as the aggressor in the war, joining Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Israel and Hungary in voting no. McConnell, who has devoted his final two years in the Senate to pushing back against the isolationists in his party, said that hoping that 'appeasement will check the ambitions' of Putin is 'as naïve today as it was in 1939,' referring to western Europe's initial hesitancy in standing up to Nazi Germany. 'America is right to seek an end to this war, but an end that fails to constrain Russian ambition, ensure Ukrainian sovereignty, or strengthen American credibility with both allies and adversaries is no end at all,' he warned. 'Instead, such a hollow peace would invite further aggression,' he said. McConnell said the 'axis of aggressors from Beijing to Moscow,' which includes Iran and North Korea, is seeking an outcome in Ukraine that 'undermines the credibility of American deterrence and leaves U.S. interests more vulnerable.' 'Without a clear and resolute commitment to the leadership and order that underpins our prosperity and security, America’s adversaries will receive exactly what they hope for,' he declared.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/mcconnell-suggests-trump-has-gross-misunderstanding-of-ukraine-talks/	2025-02-24T15:46:16-08:00	
The fragile ceasefire in Gaza faces a key deadline. Will it last?	The first phase of the ceasefire that paused 15 months of brutal warfare between Israel and Hamas militants is set to end on Saturday — and it's unclear what comes next. The two sides were supposed to start negotiating a second phase weeks ago in which Hamas would release all the remaining hostages from its Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which triggered the war, in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. But those negotiations have not begun — there have only been preparatory talks — and the first phase has been jolted by one dispute after another. Hamas has freed all 25 living hostages included in the first six-week phase ending on March 1 in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. It has also released the bodies of four captives and is expected to turn over four more, though it's unclear if that will happen Thursday as planned. That leaves it with more than 60 captives, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Israel has meanwhile delayed the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners who were supposed to be freed last weekend over the treatment of the captives, who were paraded before crowds. Israel is reportedly seeking an extension of the first phase to secure the freedom of more captives. But Hamas says it won't negotiate anything until the prisoners whose release was delayed are freed. Negotiations over Phase 2 will be even more contentious. Phase 2 was always the biggest challenge The second phase was always going to be the most difficult because it would likely force Israel to choose between its two main war goals — the safe return of the hostages and the annihilation of their captors. Hamas, though weakened, remains in power with no internal challengers. In exchange for the remaining living hostages — its main bargaining chip — it is demanding a lasting ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. A third phase would see the exchange of remains and the start of Gaza's daunting reconstruction process, which is expected to take years and cost billions of dollars. Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration's Mideast envoy, is returning to the region this week. In an interview with CNN’s 'State of the Union' on Sunday, he said he will aim for an extension of Phase 1 to buy time for negotiating the second phase. But Egypt, which has served as a key mediator, has refused to discuss an extension of Phase 1 until negotiations over Phase 2 begin, according to two Egyptian officials who were not authorized to brief reporters and spoke on condition of anonymity. One official familiar with the negotiations said the mere launch of Phase 2 talks would keep the truce intact, according to the language of the deal. That would mean a continued halt in fighting and aid flowing into Gaza, though there would be no further hostage releases beyond what has already been negotiated, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss closed diplomatic contacts. Hamas has previously said it is open to a short extension to complete talks on Phase 2, but that was before Israel held up the release of the prisoners. One of the Egyptian officials said Egypt is also demanding Israel complete its withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor, on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, before moving on to the next phase. The agreement calls for that withdrawal to begin this weekend and be completed within eight days. Netanyahu has not publicly stated what he will do this weekend. He is under heavy pressure from hard-line coalition partners to resume the war against Hamas. But after images showed freed hostages returning home in poor condition, he also faces heavy public pressure to bring the remaining hostages home. Witkoff said Netanyahu is committed to bringing back all the hostages but has set a 'red line' that Hamas cannot be involved in governing Gaza after the war. Netanyahu has also ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, dominated by Hamas' main rival, Fatah. Hamas has said it is willing to hand over control of Gaza to other Palestinians. But the militant group, which does not accept Israel's existence, would still be deeply entrenched in Gaza. And it says it won't lay down its arms unless Israel ends its occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, lands captured in the 1967 Mideast war that Palestinians want for a future state. Hamas has also dismissed Israel's suggestion that its Gaza leadership go into exile. Phase 1 is unfinished and has further embittered both sides The first phase of the ceasefire has yet to be completed and has only deepened the bitter mistrust on both sides. Israelis were shocked to see the captives — some of whom were emaciated — paraded before crowds upon their release, with some forced to smile, wave, deliver statements and, in one case, kiss a masked militant on the head. After returning to Israel, hostages said they were held under harsh conditions. Last Thursday, Hamas displayed coffins holding what it said were the remains of Shiri Bibas and her two small children, who it said were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel said a forensic investigation showed the two children were killed by their captors. The third body turned out to be someone else. Hamas then released another body that was confirmed to be the mother. On Saturday, Hamas filmed two hostages who were forced to watch the release of others, turning to a camera and begging to be released, in yet another public spectacle that infuriated Israel. That appears to have prompted Israel to postpone the release of the prisoners. Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire by killing dozens of people who the army said had approached its forces or entered unauthorized areas. It also accused Israel of dragging its feet on the entry of mobile homes and equipment for clearing rubble, which entered late last week, and of beating and abusing Palestinian prisoners prior to their release. Israel has also launched a major military operation in the occupied West Bank that has displaced some 40,000 Palestinians, according to the United Nations. Israel says it is cracking down on militants who threaten its citizens, while Palestinians see it as trying to further cement its decades-long rule. Mixed signals from Trump U.S. President Donald Trump took credit for the ceasefire, which Witkoff helped push across the finish line after a year of negotiations led by the Biden administration, Egypt and Qatar. But Trump has since sent mixed signals about the deal. Earlier this month, he set a firm deadline for Hamas to release all the hostages, warning 'all hell is going to break out' if it didn't. But he said it was ultimately up to Israel, and the deadline came and went. Trump sowed further confusion by proposing that Gaza's population of some 2 million Palestinians be relocated to other countries and for the U.S. to take over the territory and develop it. Netanyahu welcomed the idea, which was universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries, including close U.S. allies. Human rights groups said it could violate international law. Trump stood by the plan in a Fox News interview over the weekend but said he's 'not forcing it.' ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-the-fragile-ceasefire-in-gaza-faces-a-key-deadline-will-it-last/	2025-02-24T12:00:29-08:00	
Western leaders visit Kyiv and pledge military support against Ru...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — More than a dozen Western leaders attended events in Ukraine on Monday marking the third anniversary of the country's war with Russia, many pledging more military aid in a conspicuous show of support for Kyiv as uncertainty deepened over the commitment of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to helping it fend off Russia’s invasion. The fourth year of fighting could be pivotal, as Trump uses his return to office last month to press for a peace deal. But Ukrainian and European officials have been rattled by his cordial approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his tough words for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. World security is at stake in talks over how the war ends, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned. 'The autocrats around the world are watching very carefully whether there’s any impunity if you violate international borders or invade your neighbor, or if there is true deterrence,' she told a conference in Kyiv. Some observers say Russian success in Ukraine could embolden China’s own ambitions. Just as Moscow claims that Ukraine is rightfully Russian territory, China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own. In a cascade of unwelcome developments for Kyiv, Trump has in recent days called Zelenskyy a dictator, suggested Ukraine is to blame for the war and ended Putin’s three-year diplomatic isolation by the United States. U.S. officials have also indicated to Ukraine that its hopes of joining NATO are unlikely to be realized and that it probably won’t get back the land that Russia’s army has occupied, amounting to nearly 20% of the country. Meanwhile, Putin’s troops are making steady progress on the battlefield while Ukraine is grappling with shortages of troops and weapons. Some of Ukraine’s most important backers, including European leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were among the stream of dignitaries arriving by train in Kyiv. Others spoke at a conference via video link. The guests had similar messages: Ukraine and its European partners must be consulted in any peace negotiations, Putin’s ambitions must be thwarted, and Europe must take on more of the burden for its own defense. Alarm bells sound in Europe as Washington changes course The shift in Washington's policy has set off alarm bells in Europe, where governments fear being sidelined by the U.S. in efforts to secure a peace deal and are mulling how they might pick up the slack of any cut in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The changes have also placed strain on transatlantic relations. European Council President Antonio Costa on Sunday announced that he would convene an emergency summit of the 27 EU leaders in Brussels on March 6, with Ukraine at the top of the agenda. 'We are living a defining moment for Ukraine and European security,' he said in a post on social media. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are to both visit Washington this week. EU foreign ministers on Monday approved a new raft of sanctions against Russia. The measures target Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet' of ships that it uses to skirt restrictions on transporting oil and gas, or to carry stolen Ukrainian grain. The EU said 74 vessels were added to its shadow fleet list. Asset freezes and travel bans were imposed on 83 officials and 'entities' — usually government agencies, banks or companies. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country would provide a 1 billion-euro ($1.04 billion) military systems package to Ukraine this year. Starmer said Ukrainians’ voices 'must be at the heart of the drive for peace,' while Trump’s intervention had 'changed the global conversation' and 'created an opportunity.' 'Russia does not hold all the cards in this war,' he said. Coming off a victory in Sunday’s German elections, conservative leader Friedrich Merz — also a staunch backer of Ukraine — posted on X Monday: 'More than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength.' 'For a fair peace, the country that is under attack must be part of peace negotiations,' he wrote. Diplomacy ramps up after record Russian drone attack On Sunday, Russia launched its biggest single drone attack of the war, pounding Ukraine with 267 drones. The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, insisted that the U.S. cannot seal any peace deal to end the war without Ukraine or Europe being involved. She highlighted what she claimed were pro-Russian positions being taken up by the Trump administration. 'You can discuss whatever you want with Putin. But if it comes to Europe or Ukraine, then Ukraine and Europe also have to agree to this deal,' Kallas told reporters in Brussels, where she was chairing a meeting of EU foreign ministers. Kallas travels to Washington on Tuesday for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Washington and Moscow draw closer U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the third anniversary was 'a grim milestone.' 'More than 12,600 civilians killed, with many more injured. Entire communities reduced to rubble. Hospitals and schools destroyed,' he said in Geneva. Russia's foreign ministry said Saturday that preparations for a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin were underway, and U.S. officials have said that they had agreed with Moscow to reestablish diplomatic ties and restart economic cooperation. Kallas rejected Trump’s earlier inflammatory assertion that Zelenskyy was a dictator for not having held elections after his regular term expired last year, saying, 'Russia hasn’t had elections in 25 years.' Ukrainian law prohibits elections being held while martial law is in place, and Zelenksyy said as recently as Sunday that after martial law is lifted, 'there will be elections and people will make their choice.' ___ Associated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-foreign-leaders-visit-ukraines-capital-to-mark-3rd-war-anniversary/	2025-02-24T05:20:15-08:00	
Russia-Ukraine war enters third year	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) - As the war in Ukraine enters its third year, the United States is ramping up efforts to broker a peace deal, but sharp divisions are emerging over how to approach Russia’s role in the conflict. On the three-year mark of the war Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he'll give up his presidency, in exchange for peace. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is making headlines after declining to call Russia’s invasion 'unprovoked.' 'Does all the finger pointing and pearl clutching make peace more likely? That’s the enduring question. The president is asking, he wants peace,' stated Hegseth. Special envoy Steve Witkoff shared similar comments in an interview. 'Irrespective of who started it, it needs to end too. Many people's lives have been expunged as a result of it,' said Witkoff. Not everyone in Washington is on board with the Trump administration's approach. 'I think Trump is much closer, ideologically to Putin and other autocrats around the world, than he is to democratic countries,' said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.). President Trump will hold a call with other G-7 leaders on Monday to discuss the three-year mark of the war and next steps toward a possible resolution.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/russia-ukraine-war-enters-third-year/	2025-02-24T04:13:32-08:00	
Zelenskyy says progress made on reaching an agreement with the US...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A contentious Trump administration proposal to give the U.S. $500 billion worth of profits from Ukraine's rare earth minerals as compensation for its wartime assistance to Kyiv has been taken off the table, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday, indicating a more equitable deal is in the works. Zelenskyy had earlier declined a U.S. draft agreement on exploitation of his country's valuable minerals such as lithium used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries because it did not contain security guarantees and came with the $500 billion price tag. 'The question of $500 billion is no longer there,' Zelenskyy told a news conference at a forum of government officials in Kyiv marking the three-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainian leader said considering aid as a debt to be repaid would be a 'Pandora's box' that would set a precedent requiring Kyiv to reimburse all its backers. 'We do not recognize the debt,' Zelenskyy said. 'It will not be in the final format of the agreement.' No further details were given on the state of negotiations. Ukraine has insisted on security guarantees that it needs to deter any potential Russian aggression in the future. Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said on CNN’s 'State of the Union' that he expects a deal this week allowing the U.S. to play a greater role in exploiting Ukraine's mineral resources. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration's minerals plan was to create a U.S.-Ukraine partnership, calling it a 'win-win.' 'We make money if the Ukrainian people make money,' Bessent told Fox News Channel’s Sunday Morning Futures program. Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, left the Kyiv forum early along with Economic Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko for what Yermak said were talks with U.S. officials on a potential deal. Later Sunday, Yermak posted on social media that he'd spoken with U.S. officials, including Bessent and Trump's national security adviser Mike Walz, saying it had been a 'constructive conversation.' 'We are making progress ,' Yermak wrote. 'The USA is our partner and we are grateful to the American people.' Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency for NATO membership In response to a pointed question from a reporter on whether he would give up his presidency for peace in Ukraine, Zelenskyy said he would if it achieved a durable end to the fighting under the security umbrella of the NATO military alliance. 'If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I’m ready,' he said. 'I can trade it for NATO.' His comment appeared to be aimed at recent suggestions by President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that elections should be held despite Ukrainian legislation prohibiting them during martial law. Ukraine fears Trump's policy shift toward Putin Trump's engagement with Russian officials and his recent agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow have marked a dramatic about-face in U.S. policy that has rattled leaders in Ukraine and across Europe. Zelenskyy has expressed fear that Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in Ukraine losing territory and being left vulnerable to future Russian aggression. U.S. officials have asserted the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start. Trump, however, prompted alarm and anger in Ukraine this week when he suggested Kyiv had started the war and Zelenskyy was acting as a 'dictator' by not holding elections. On Sunday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the state TASS news agency that Moscow and Washington would continue bilateral talks at the end of next week. Ryabkov said the talks would take place between department heads from both countries’ foreign ministries, adding that 'quite a lot' of contact was ongoing between the Russian and American sides. European leaders prepare for talks with Zelenskyy and Trump European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other top EU officials were headed to Kyiv Monday for talks with Ukraine’s government as Europe scrambles to devise a response to the Trump administration's U.S. policy changes, and to maintain support for Kyiv if aid from Washington ends. The U.K. said it would announce new sanctions against Russia on Monday, describing them as the biggest package since the early days of the war. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the measures would be aimed at eroding Russia’s 'military machine and reducing revenues fueling the fires of destruction in Ukraine.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were to both visit Washington this week as Europe attempts to persuade Trump not to abandon Ukraine in pursuit of a peace deal. Russia launches record drone strikes on eve of anniversary Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia had launched 267 drones into Ukraine overnight, more than in any other single attack of the war. Ukraine’s air force said 138 drones were shot down over 13 Ukrainian regions, with 119 more lost enroute to their targets. Three ballistic missiles also were fired, the air force said. One person was killed in the city of Kryvyi Rih, according to the city military administration. Reacting to the latest Russian attacks, Andrii Sybiha‎, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, said on social media: 'No one should trust Putin’s words. Look at his actions instead.' More sanctions imposed on Russia New Zealand will sanction an additional 52 people and entities involved in Russia’s military and energy sectors, North Korea’s support to Russia’s war effort, and the forced relocation and reeducation of Ukrainian children, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Monday. Since March 2022, New Zealand has placed sanctions on more than 1,800 individuals and entities. New Zealand will contribute a further 3 million New Zealand dollars ($1.7 million) to the World Bank-administered fund for Ukraine, Peters said in a statement. ___ Associated Press writers Thomas Strong and Will Weissert in Washington and Charlotte Graham-McLay in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-launches-a-record-number-of-drones-into-ukraine-on-the-eve-of-the-wars-3-year-anniversary/	2025-02-23T20:03:57-08:00	
US pressures Ukraine to nix its UN resolution demanding Russian f...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.S. has pressured Ukraine to withdraw its European-backed U.N. resolution demanding an immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine in favor of an American proposal that does not mention Moscow’s invasion, a U.S. official and a European diplomat said Sunday. But Ukraine refused to pull its draft resolution, and the U.N. General Assembly will vote on it Monday, the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, two European diplomats said. The 193-nation General Assembly then is expected to vote on the U.S. draft resolution, according to the diplomats and the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because private negotiations are still ongoing. The Trump administration is also seeking a vote on its proposal in the more powerful U.N. Security Council. China, which holds the Security Council presidency this month, scheduled a vote on the U.S. resolution for Monday afternoon. The dueling resolutions — the first since the invasion — highlight the tension between the U.S., Ukraine and European countries in the five weeks since President Donald Trump took office and has opened talks with Russia after years of isolation in a bid to end the war. European leaders were dismayed that they and Ukraine were left out of preliminary negotiations between the U.S. and Russia last week. The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body on Ukraine because the Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, has been paralyzed by Russia’s veto power. There are no vetoes in the General Assembly, and its votes are closely watched as a barometer of world opinion. However, its resolutions are not legally binding, unlike those adopted by the Security Council. Since Russian forces crossed Ukraine’s border on Feb. 24, 2022, the assembly has adopted half a dozen resolutions condemning the war and demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops. The assembly votes have shown strong global opposition to Russia's conflict, and the votes on the rival resolutions Monday will be closely watched to see if that support has waned — and to assess support for Trump’s effort to bring a speedy end to the war. One European diplomat said there has been intense lobbying and arm-twisting on the rival resolutions. The U.S. official said the U.S. is trying to get Ukraine and the Europeans to back down on their draft. It comes as Trump plans to host French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday in Washington. The United States believes 'this is the moment to commit to ending the war. This is our opportunity to build real momentum toward peace,' Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement late Friday. He said that 'while challenges may arise, the goal of lasting peace remains achievable' and that the resolution would 'affirm that this conflict is awful, that the U.N. can help end it, and that peace is possible.' The Ukraine resolution, co-sponsored by the 27-nation European Union, refers to 'the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation' and recalls the need to implement all previous assembly resolutions 'adopted in response to the aggression against Ukraine.' It singles out the General Assembly’s demand that Russia 'immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders' and its demand to immediately halt all hostilities. And it calls for 'a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine.' The very brief U.S. draft resolution acknowledges 'the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict' and 'implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.' It never mentions Moscow's invasion. Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told reporters last week that the U.S. resolution was 'a good move.' Russia also suggested an amendment, seeking to add the phrase 'including by addressing its root causes' so the final line of the U.S. resolution reads, 'implores a swift end to the conflict, including by addressing its root causes, and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.' ___ Lee reported from Washington.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-pressures-ukraine-to-nix-its-un-resolution-demanding-russian-forces-withdraw/	2025-02-23T19:31:41-08:00	
Netanyahu says Israel won't allow Syrian forces 'south of Damascu...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will not allow Syria’s new army or the insurgent group that led the ouster of former President Bashar Assad to 'enter the area south of Damascus' as his government made clear Israeli forces would stay in parts of southern Syria for an indefinite period. Netanyahu’s comments Sunday at a military graduation led to new concerns over the Israeli presence, and sway, in a swath of southern Syria as Damascus' new leaders attempt to consolidate control after years of civil war. 'Take note: We will not allow HTS forces or the new Syrian army to enter the area south of Damascus,' Netanyahu said, referring to Syria’s new authorities as well as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main former rebel group. 'We demand the complete demilitarization of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa and Suwayda from the forces of the new regime. Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.' There was no immediate response from Syrian authorities. Defense Minister Israel Katz added that Israeli forces will remain on the peak of Mt. Hermon in southern Syria and in a buffer zone 'for an indefinite period of time to protect our communities and thwart any threat.' He said Israeli forces have built two posts on the mountain and another seven in the buffer zone 'to ensure defense and offense against any challenge.' After the fall of Assad in December, Israel seized the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory. The zone was set up under a 1974 ceasefire agreement. Syria’s new authorities and U.N. officials have called for Israel to withdraw. Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s government has been under pressure to protect Israelis living near border areas in the north. Katz said Israel will 'strengthen ties with friendly populations in the region,' notably the Druze, a religious minority who live in both southern Syria and in Israel’s Golan Heights, where Druze navigate their historically Syrian identity while living under Israeli rule. 'We will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria,' Netanyahu said. More broadly, Israeli forces 'will not allow hostile forces to establish themselves and be present in the security zone in southern Syria from here to Damascus. And we will act against any threat,' Katz said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-netanyahu-says-israel-wont-allow-syrian-forces-south-of-damascus/	2025-02-23T16:31:50-08:00	
Israel sends tanks into West Bank for first time in decades, says...	JENIN, West Bank (AP) — Israeli tanks moved into the occupied West Bank on Sunday for the first time in decades in what Palestinian authorities called a 'dangerous escalation,' after the defense minister said troops will remain in parts of the territory for a year and tens of thousands of Palestinians who have fled cannot return. Associated Press journalists saw several tanks move along unpaved tracks into Jenin, long a bastion of armed struggle against Israel. Israel is deepening its crackdown on the Palestinian territory and has said it is determined to stamp out militancy amid a rise in attacks. It launched the offensive in the northern West Bank on Jan. 21 — two days after the current ceasefire in Gaza took hold — and expanded it to nearby areas. Palestinians view the deadly raids as part of an effort to cement Israeli control over the territory, where 3 million Palestinians live under military rule. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the military to 'increase the intensity of the activity to thwart terrorism' in all refugee camps in the West Bank. 'We will not allow the return of residents, and we will not allow terrorism to return and grow,' he said. Earlier, Katz said he had instructed the military to prepare for 'an extended stay' in some of the West Bank's urban refugee camps from which about 40,000 Palestinians have fled, leaving them 'emptied of residents.' The camps are home to descendants of Palestinians who fled during wars with Israel decades ago. It was not clear how long Palestinians would be prevented from returning. Katz said Israeli troops would stay 'for the coming year.' Netanyahu said they would stay 'as long as needed.' Tanks were last deployed in the West Bank in 2002, when Israel fought a deadly Palestinian uprising. The Palestinian foreign ministry called the Israeli moves 'a dangerous escalation of the situation in the West Bank,' and urged the international community to intervene in what it termed Israel's illegal 'aggression.' 'Even if they stay, we will return to the camp at the end,' said Mohamed al-Sadi, one of those displaced from Jenin. 'This camp is ours. We have no other place to go.' Netanyahu under pressure to crack down With fighting in Gaza and Lebanon on hold, Netanyahu has been under pressure from far-right governing partners to crack down on militancy in the West Bank. The U.N. says the current Israeli military operation is the longest since the Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s. Under interim peace agreements from the early 1990s, Israel maintains control over large parts of the West Bank, while the Palestinian Authority administers other areas. Israel regularly sends troops into Palestinian zones but typically withdraws them after missions. More than 800 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the war in Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, with a Hamas attack on southern Israel. Israel says most were militants, but stone-throwing youths protesting Israeli raids as well as bystanders have also been killed. In the most recent operation, a pregnant Palestinian woman was killed. Jewish settlers also have carried out rampages in Palestinian areas in the territory. And there has been a spike in Palestinian attacks emanating from the West Bank. On Thursday, blasts rocked three empty buses in Israel in what police view as a suspected militant attack. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. Palestinians want all three territories for their future independent state. U.S. envoy to pursue extended ceasefire The truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza remains tenuous. A week is left in the ceasefire’s first phase, and no negotiations have been reported on the second phase. The truce’s collapse could lead to renewed fighting in Gaza, where Netanyahu says 63 hostages remain, about half of them believed dead, including a soldier captured in 2014. 'We are ready to return to intense fighting at any moment,' Netanyahu said Sunday. The military increased its 'operational readiness' around Gaza. The U.S. special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told CNN he expects the second phase to go forward, adding: 'We have to get an extension of phase one and so I’ll be going into the region this week, probably Wednesday, to negotiate that.' He told CBS he will visit Qatar, Egypt, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. But a senior Hamas leader, Mahmoud Mardawi, said Sunday the group will not engage in further discussions with Israel through mediators until Israel releases the 620 Palestinian prisoners meant to be freed on Saturday. Israel said early Sunday it was delaying the release until it gets assurances that Hamas stops what Israel calls 'humiliating' handovers of hostages in staged ceremonies criticized by the U.S. and Red Cross as cruel. Egypt and Qatar were pressing Israel to release the prisoners, and Egypt refused to discuss any Israeli demands before then, said an Egyptian official involved in the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to talk to the media. Palestinian family members were distraught. 'What have the prisoners done? We don’t know what happened. They killed our joy,' said one mother, Najah Zaqqot. The White House is supporting Israel’s decision to delay releasing the Palestinians prisoners, calling it 'appropriate.' National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said Sunday that, 'given Hamas’ barbaric treatment of the hostages, including the hideous parade of the Bibas children’s coffins through the streets of Gaza, Israel’s decision to delay the release of prisoners is an appropriate response.' 'The President is prepared to support Israel in whatever course of action it chooses regarding Hamas,' Hughes said in a statement. Meanwhile, Netanyahu faced new criticism over the war while speaking at a military graduation. As he held up a picture of Shiri Bibas and her young boys, Ariel and Kfir, whose remains were returned from Gaza last week, to demonstrate 'what we are fighting against,' audience members called out 'Shame!' and 'Why didn’t you save them?' The prime minister didn’t react. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Ukraine's Zelenskyy says he'd be ready to give up presidency if i...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday he would be ready to give up the presidency if doing so would achieve a lasting peace for his country under the security umbrella of the NATO military alliance. Speaking at a forum of government officials in Kyiv marking the three-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Zelenskyy said, 'If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I’m ready.' Responding to a journalist's question on whether he’d trade his office for peace, Zelenskyy said, 'I can trade it for NATO.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy answers media questions during his press conference, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Sunday, Feb. 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) His comment appeared to be aimed at recent suggestions by U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that elections should be held in Ukraine despite Ukrainian legislation prohibiting them during martial law. Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 strike drones into Ukraine overnight on Saturday, more than in any other single attack of the war. Ukraine's air force said 138 drones had been shot down over 13 Ukrainian regions, with 119 more lost en route to their targets. Three ballistic missiles had also been fired, the air force said. One person was killed in the city of Kryvyi Rih, according to the city military administration. The attack came as leaders in Kyiv and across Europe are seeking to navigate rapid changes in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump, who in a matter of days has upended years of firm support for Ukraine, leading to fears that he would join with Moscow to force a settlement to the war without involving Ukraine and its European backers. Ukraine fears Trump's policy shift toward Putin Trump's engagement with Russian officials and his agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow marked a dramatic about-face in U.S. policy. Zelenskyy has expressed fears that Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in lost territory for Ukraine and vulnerability to future Russian aggression, though U.S. officials have asserted that the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start. Trump, however, prompted alarm and anger in Ukraine when this week he suggested that Kyiv had started the war, and that Zelenskyy was acting as a 'dictator' by not holding elections, despite Ukrainian legislation prohibiting them during martial law. Russia’s deputy foreign minister on Saturday said preparations were underway for a Trump-Putin meeting, a further sign that the Russian leader's isolation, at least for the Trump administration, was beginning to thaw. Reacting to the latest Russian attacks, however, Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that the overnight attack 'demonstrates that avoiding calling Russia an aggressor does not change the fact that it is one.' 'No one should trust Putin’s words. Look at his actions instead,' Sybiha said in a statement on social media. Ukraine continuing dialogue with U.S. over mineral deal Ukrainian officials on Sunday discussed a deal that would allow the U.S. to access Ukrainian rare earth minerals, a proposal Trump's administration is pushing for but that Zelenskyy earlier declined to accept because it lacked specific security guarantees. At a forum in Kyiv to mark the anniversary of the war, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andrii Yermak said his government was considering investment opportunities both with the U.S and European countries 'which includes minerals, their development and extraction.' Yermak left the forum early along with Economic Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko for what he said were talks with U.S. representatives on a potential deal. He said Ukraine’s mineral resources represent 'a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees — military guarantees and others.' Yermak pushed back on the notion that Ukraine had rejected U.S. proposals but said any agreement 'must meet the national interests of Ukraine, and undoubtedly, must be interesting to our partners.' Before leaving the forum, Svyrydenko said there are $350 billion worth of minerals on Ukrainian territories currently occupied by Russia. This calculation, however, is partly based on geological maps dating back to 1940s and 1960s, she said, adding: 'We have to conduct geological exploration and confirm the deposits we have on paper.' Meanwhile, Putin in a special televised message Sunday praised Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine for defending 'their native land, the national interests and the future of Russia.' Putin used his speech, on Russia’s Defender of the Fatherland Day, to pledge greater social support for military personnel and new weapons and equipment for Russian forces. 'Today, as the world is changing impetuously, our strategic course for strengthening and developing the Armed Forces remains unchanged,' he said, adding that Russia would continue to develop its armed forces 'as the essential part of Russia’s security that guarantees its sovereign present and future.' European leaders prepare for talks with Trump The U.K. on Sunday said it would announce new sanctions on Russia Monday, its biggest package since the early days of the war. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the measures would be aimed at 'eroding (Russia’s) military machine and reducing revenues fueling the fires of destruction in Ukraine.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron will make tag-team visits to Washington this week as Europe attempts to persuade Trump not to abandon Ukraine in pursuit of a peace deal. Starmer told a Labour Party gathering in Scotland on Sunday: 'There can be no discussion about Ukraine without Ukraine, and the people of Ukraine must have a long-term secure future.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ukraines-zelenskyy-says-hed-be-ready-to-give-up-presidency-if-it-brought-peace-nato-membership/	2025-02-23T08:12:51-08:00	
Hamas frees all 6 hostages in the latest exchange with Israel	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Hamas freed all six hostages in the latest exchange Saturday, even as heightened tension between the adversaries clouded the future of the fragile ceasefire deal. The six included three Israeli men seized from the Nova music festival and another abducted while visiting his family in southern Israel when militants stormed across the border in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that triggered Israel’s nearly 16-month campaign in the Gaza Strip. Two of the hostages had been held by Hamas for around a decade since they each entered Gaza on their own. Five of the captives were handed over in staged ceremonies that the Red Cross and Israel have condemned in the past — brought out by masked, armed Hamas fighters in front of hundreds of Palestinians before being transferred to Red Cross vehicles. In the central town of Nuseirat, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, and Eliya Cohen were posed alongside Hamas fighters on the stage. A beaming Shem Tov even kissed two militants next to him on the head and blew kisses to the crowd. Hamas has come under heavy criticism for such public displays, with Israel, the U.N. and the Red Cross saying they are cruel and do not respect the dignity of the hostages. Watching the release, Cohen’s family and friends in Israel chanted 'Eliya! Eliya! Eliya!' and cheered when they saw him for the first time. Shem Tov’s grandmother ululated in joy, shrieking, 'Omer, my joy! My life!' as she saw him. The Israeli military said the final hostage, Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, was released later Saturday. The Bedouin Israeli crossed on his own into Gaza in 2015 and had been held since. His family has told Israeli media Al-Sayed was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia. The latest releases, to be followed by the freeing of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, went ahead after tensions mounted over a grisly and heart-wrenching dispute triggered this week when Hamas initially handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother of two young boys abducted by the militants. The remains that Hamas transferred with her sons’ bodies on Thursday were later determined to be those of an unidentified Palestinian woman. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed revenge for 'a cruel and malicious violation,' while Hamas suggested it had been a mistake. On Friday night, the small militant group believed to have been holding Bibas and her sons — the Palestinian Mujahedeen Brigades — handed over a second body. Bibas’ family said Israeli forensic authorities had confirmed the remains were hers. 'For 16 months we sought certainty, and now that it’s here, it brings no comfort, though we hope it marks the beginning of closure,' the family said. Difficult negotiations likely over the ceasefire’s next phase The ceasefire deal has paused the war but is nearing the end of its first phase. Negotiations over a second phase, in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal, are likely to be even more difficult. The six hostages being freed Saturday are the last living ones to be released under the first phase. Cohen, Shem Tov and Wenkert, all in their 20s, were abducted by Hamas fighters at the Nova music festival. During their release, they were brought out wearing fake army uniforms, though they were not soldiers when they were kidnapped. Earlier Saturday, two other hostages — Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38 — were freed in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Arriving back in Israel, both were taken to medical centers for examination. 'This is an unforgettable moment, where all emotions are rapidly mixing together. Our Tal is with us,' Shoham’s family said in a statement, calling for a deal to free all those still captive. 'There is a window of opportunity; we must not miss it.' Shoham, who also holds Austrian citizenship, was visiting his family in Kibbutz Be’eri when Hamas militants stormed into the community during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. Shoham’s wife, two young children, and three other relatives who were abducted with him were freed in a November 2023 exchange. Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, had been held in Gaza since entering on his own in 2014. Watching the handover on Israeli media, Mengistu’s family and friends broke out into a Hebrew song, 'Here is the Light,' as they saw him for the first time in more than a decade. 'Do you remember me?' one of his brothers asks as they embraced at the hospital. Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners set for release Later Saturday, Israel is to release 620 imprisoned Palestinians. They include 151 who were serving life or other sentences, around 100 of whom will be deported to other countries, according to the Palestinian prisoners media office. They also include 445 men as well as 18 children between the ages of 15 and 17, five aged between 18-19, and a woman, all of whom were seized by Israeli troops in Gaza during the current war, according to the media office. Hamas has said it will also release four more bodies next week, completing the first phase of the ceasefire. If that plan is carried out, Hamas would retain about 60 hostages, about half of whom are believed to be alive. Hamas has said it won’t release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he’s committed to destroying Hamas’ military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Israel’s military offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza’s population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, Jahjouh from Rafah.

US envoy praises Zelenskyy after Trump's censure of the Ukrainian...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President Donald Trump’s envoy to Ukraine and Russia said on Friday that he had held 'extensive and positive discussions' with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the three-year war with Russia and praised the Ukrainian leader as an 'embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war.' Retired U.S. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg — who traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday and whose planned news conference with Zelenskyy on Thursday was changed at the last minute to a simple photo opportunity — struck a positive tone after what he said on the social platform X was 'a long and intense day' of talks with Ukraine’s senior leadership. His comments marked a departure from recent rebukes of Zelenskyy by Trump and other senior U.S. officials that appeared to indicate an abrupt deterioration of relations. Trump called Zelenskyy 'a dictator without elections' and warned him that he'd ' better move fast ' to negotiate an end to the war or risk not having a nation to lead. The possibility that vital U.S. military aid for Ukraine was in doubt darkened the mood in Kyiv as Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russia’s bigger army on the battlefield. European governments, uneasy about being sidelined so far in talks between senior U.S. and Russian officials, have jumped to shore up Zelenskyy and at the same time avoid a breakdown in transatlantic relations. Polish President Andrzej Duda, whose country has been a vocal supporter of neighboring Ukraine, said Zelenskyy phoned him on Friday. Duda said he told Zelenskyy 'to remain committed to the course of calm and constructive cooperation' with Trump. 'We consistently believe there is no other way to stop the bloodshed and achieve lasting peace in Ukraine except with the support of the United States,' Duda said he also told Zelenskyy. 'I trust that goodwill and honesty form the foundation of the U.S. negotiation strategy,' Duda said on X. 'I have no doubt that President Trump is guided by a deep sense of responsibility for global stability and peace.' The European Union’s top defense official said Friday that the bloc plans to send a strong message of support to Ukraine next week with a new aid package to mark Monday’s third anniversary of the war. EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius said senior members of the bloc’s executive branch are weighing how, 'in a very urgent way, to send a very strong message to Ukrainians and to the world that we are standing together with Ukraine.' European policy commissioners, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other top EU officials are traveling to Kyiv on Monday. Russia has pressed on with its invasion even as talks with the U.S. take place, striking civilian targets almost daily. On Friday, Russian forces dropped three powerful glide bombs on Kostiantynivka, in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, killing one man and injuring two others, regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said. Another Russian glide bomb damaged homes and injured five people in the northeastern Kharkiv region, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said. The public quarrel between Trump and Zelenskyy began after Russia and the U.S. agreed Tuesday to start working toward ending the war in Ukraine and improving their diplomatic and economic ties. With that, and a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump abruptly reversed the three-year U.S. policy of isolating Russia. Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said during a White House briefing on Thursday that the U.S. president is 'obviously very frustrated' with Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy was unhappy that a U.S. team opened the talks without inviting him or European governments that have backed Kyiv. When Trump claimed without evidence Zelenskyy was deeply unpopular in Ukraine and falsely suggested that Ukraine was to blame for the war, Zelenskyy said Trump was living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space,' suggesting he had been duped by Putin. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-envoy-praises-zelenskyy-after-trumps-censure-of-the-ukrainian-leader/	2025-02-21T17:07:13-08:00	
Trump: Zelensky 'has no cards,' 'shouldn't be at meetings' with R...	President Trump on Friday lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying he did not think it was important for Zelensky to attend negotiations about the war in Ukraine. Trump in an interview with Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio acknowledged Russia attacked Ukraine but still suggested former President Biden and Zelensky shared blame for failing to talk down Moscow. 'I've been watching for years, and I've been watching him negotiate with no cards,' Trump said of Zelensky. 'He has no cards. And you get sick of it.' 'So, I don't think he's very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you,' Trump added. 'He makes it very hard to make deals.' Trump suggested Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to reach a deal to end the war in Ukraine. He claimed Putin did not necessarily have to negotiate a ceasefire, because if he wanted, he’d get 'the whole country.' 'Every time I say, 'Oh, it's not Russia's fault,' I always get slammed by the fake news,' Trump told Kilmeade. 'But I'm telling you, Biden said the wrong things. Zelensky said the wrong things. They got attacked by somebody that's much bigger and much stronger.' Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after amassing troops on the border and demanding a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO. The invasion took place nearly a decade after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Trump has become increasingly critical of the Ukrainian leader, in recent days calling him a 'dictator without elections,' claiming he was doing a 'terrible job' and falsely suggesting he was the one who started the war with Russia. Trump administration officials met with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia earlier this week to start talks about ending the war. Zelensky had expressed frustration that Ukrainian officials were not involved in the discussions. Trump administration officials have pushed for Ukraine to accept a deal that would give the United States a stake in Ukraine's rare mineral supply, arguing the economic agreement would create an incentive for the U.S. to provide security guarantees for Kyiv. Zelensky has said he was presented with the proposal last week with little notice or time to assess the deal. 'President Zelensky is going to sign that deal, and you will see it in the very short term,' national security adviser Mike Waltz said Friday morning at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). After the Kilmeade interview, Trump again chided Ukraine during remarks to a bipartisan group of governors at the White House.'I’ve had very good talks with Putin,' Trump said, and 'not such good talks with Ukraine.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/trump-zelensky-has-no-cards-shouldnt-be-at-meetings-with-russia/	2025-02-21T09:07:17-08:00	
Netanyahu decries release of wrong body as a ceasefire violation....	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed revenge Friday for what he described as a 'cruel and malicious violation' of the ceasefire agreement after a body that Hamas released as part of the deal was found to not be that of an Israeli mother of two young boys, as the militants had promised. The incident raised questions about the future of the fragile ceasefire deal, which has paused over 15 months of war and is due to see its first phase end in early March. But in the short term, there were indications the deal's next step — the release of six living hostages on Saturday — would proceed as planned. In a statement Friday, Hamas said it would 'conduct a thorough review' of the information regarding the body. It suggested a possible mix-up of remains might have occurred due to Israeli bombing of the area where the Israeli hostages were being held because other Palestinians were also present. Hamas’ military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, also announced Friday it would go ahead with the release of the six Israeli hostages on Saturday. In return, Israel is expected to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas turned over four bodies Thursday as part of the ceasefire. They were supposed to have been those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Kfir and Ariel Bibas, and of Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted during the Hamas attack that started the war on Oct. 7, 2023. Israeli authorities said that while the remains of the two boys and of Lifshitz were positively identified, the fourth body was found to not be that of Shiri Bibas, but that of an unidentified woman from Gaza. 'We will work with determination to bring Shiri home together with all our hostages — both living and dead — and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and malicious violation of the agreement,' Netanyahu said. 'The sacred memory of Oded Lifshitz and Ariel and Kfir Bibas will be forever enshrined in the heart of the nation. May God avenge their blood. And so we will avenge.' Hamas said it had 'no interest in retaining any bodies,' adding that it had 'demonstrated full compliance with the agreement in recent days and remain committed to all its terms.' 'We reject Netanyahu’s threats, which serve only to manipulate Israeli public opinion,' Hamas said, calling on mediators to ensure the continued implementation of the ceasefire. The group also called for the return of the unidentified remains, which Israel has said are those of a Palestinian woman. The revelation of the body’s identity was a shocking twist in the saga surrounding the Bibas family, who have become global symbols of the plight of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. During the ceasefire, which began in January, Hamas has been releasing living hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails. Thursday’s release marked the first time the group has returned the remains of dead hostages. The Israeli army said Thursday that the fourth body released by Hamas was an 'anonymous, unidentified body.' It said the Bibas family had been notified, including Yarden Bibas, Shiri’s husband and father of the two boys, who had been taken captive separately from his wife and children and was released early this month as part of the ceasefire deal. Hamas has claimed Lifshitz, Shiri Bibas and her sons were killed in Israeli airstrikes. But Israel said the testing had found the two boys and Lifshitz were killed by their captors. U.S. envoy Adam Boehler described the release of the wrong body as 'horrific' and a 'clear violation' of the ceasefire. 'If I were them, I’d release everybody or they are going to face total annihilation,' Boehler, who serves as the U.S. envoy for hostages, told CNN. It was unclear how the incident might affect the next scheduled swap of hostages for prisoners, set for Saturday. Hamas has said it will also release four more bodies next week, completing the first phase of the ceasefire. It is also unclear whether the truce will be extended beyond the end of the current phase. In another potential blow to the deal, a series of explosions struck three parked, empty buses in central Israel overnight. There were no injuries and no claim of responsibility. But the Israeli military said in response it was beefing up its forces in the West Bank, raising the likelihood of further escalation in the area. Israel has been carrying out a broad military offensive in the occupied territory since the ceasefire took effect. If the current phase of the ceasefire goes according to plan with the release of six hostages on Saturday and four more bodies next week, Hamas will be left with about 60 hostages, about half — all men — believed to still be alive. Hamas has said it won’t release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he’s committed to destroying Hamas’ military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Trump’s proposal to remove about 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it, which has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries, has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. Hamas could be reluctant to free more hostages if it believes that the war will resume. Israel’s military offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza’s population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-netanyahu-slams-cruel-and-malicious-violation-of-gaza-ceasefire-deal-over-release-of-body/	2025-02-21T04:48:46-08:00	
Trump’s attempts to denigrate Zelenskyy have led to a surge in Uk...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Days before the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainians are as somber and tense as they were right before Moscow launched the war. Only now, they aren’t just worried about their longtime enemy. Ukraine's stunning new threat comes from its once staunchest ally, the United States, whose support appears to be fading as President Donald Trump echoes the narrative of Russian President Vladimir Putin while pledging to stop the fighting between the two countries. Over three years of war, Ukraine’s initial unity had started to wear thin, as old frictions and political spats reemerged. But after Trump’s false claims this week that Ukraine is led by a 'dictator' who started the war with Russia, even some of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s harshest critics have rallied around him and feelings of unity have surged again. 'Yes, he’s not a perfect president, but he’s not a dictator,' said Kateryna Karaush, a 25-year-old tech worker from Kyiv who like many Ukrainians — and even some Republicans in Congress — is struggling to wrap her head around Trump's embrace of Russia, which represents a major about-face in U.S. foreign policy. 'It feels like the whole world is against us,' Karaush said. Against long odds, Ukrainians – with massive military support from the U.S. – have prevented Russia from overtaking their country, even if roughly one fifth of it is now under Russia control. But after three years of war, both civilians and soldiers are exhausted. Hundreds of thousands have been killed or wounded, tens of thousands are missing, and millions have fled the country. The mood only became gloomier in recent days as Trump signaled his desire to rapidly bring the fighting to a close on terms that Zelenskyy and many in the West say are too favorable to Russia. After Trump falsely called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' – for legally postponing an election last year — and as reports emerged of U.S. and Russian officials meeting in Saudi Arabia to discuss a possible ceasefire without input from Ukraine, even some of Zelenskyy’s domestic opponents have begun defending him. 'We may have different opinions about Zelenskyy, but only Ukrainian citizens have the right to judge his support,' said Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a lawmaker from the opposition party Holos. 'And to publicly criticize him too, because, in the end, he is our elected leader.' Trump’s harsh words for Zelenskyy have drawn criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans in the U.S. Congress, where defending Ukraine from Russia — with tens of billions of dollars in military aid — has had bipartisan support. But Vice President JD Vance admonished Zelenskyy for publicly warning Trump about falling for Russian disinformation. On Thursday, the deepening tensions led to the cancelation of a news conference that had been planned to follow talks between Zelenskyy and Trump's Ukraine envoy over how to end the war. A poll released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology put public trust in Zelenskyy at 57%. The survey was conducted Feb. 4 to Feb. 9 among 1,000 people living across Ukraine in regions and territories controlled by the Ukrainian government. 'We have a president whom we support. During war, we are united,' said Larysa, a 52-year-old resident from the northeastern city of Kharkiv, who refused to give her last name due to security concerns. The political rift with the U.S. comes as Ukrainian forces, outnumbered and outgunned, increasingly struggle to hold back Russia’s slow but steady advances. Speaking from the front lines, some Ukrainian soldiers said they were not panicking yet, and not ready to give up the fight. 'Even if we don’t get enough weapons or if funding is cut, that doesn’t change our duty to (fight),' said a Ukrainian officer who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military rules. 'No shells? We’ll take up rifles. No rifles? We’ll grab shovels.' On Wednesday, Trump echoed one of Putin’s frequent talking points, claiming Zelenskyy, whose term expired last year, must hold elections. But the idea has little traction within Ukraine — even among opposition politicians, who recognize Zelenskyy’s right to postpone elections during wartime. 'Elections are not needed right now because they should only take place when we understand the framework of (a peace) agreement with Russia,' said Volodymyr Ariev, a lawmaker from the opposition European Solidarity party. 'Holding elections now would only benefit the Kremlin, further dividing Ukrainians and installing a new president who could sign a deal favorable to Moscow.' An adviser to Zelenskyy, Mykhailo Podolyak, gave an additional reason for holding off any election until there is peace: Russia might seek to interfere in an electoral process that would already face significant challenges. Millions of displaced Ukrainians living abroad would struggle to participate — not to mention the hundreds of thousands Ukrainians living in Russian-occupied territories, whose ability to vote would be virtually impossible. Around 800,000 Ukrainians are currently serving in the armed forces, making it difficult for them to cast ballots without weakening the military. And those fighting would be unable to run for office — a right guaranteed under Ukrainian law. 'Holding elections before a peace agreement with security guarantees is signed would be devastating for Ukraine,' said Valerii Pekar, a professor at Kyiv-Mohyla Business School. 'The U.S. and Russia are now united in promoting the idea of ‘elections first, then peace’ — which is the quickest and cheapest way to bring Ukraine down.' ___ Associated Press journalist Volodymyr Yurchuk contributed from Kyiv, Ukraine.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukrainians-rally-around-their-president-after-trump-seeks-to-denigrate-him/	2025-02-21T03:47:35-08:00	
A news conference between Zelenskyy and Trump’s Ukraine envoy is ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A news conference that was planned to follow talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump’s Ukraine envoy was canceled Thursday as political tensions deepened between the two countries over how to end the almost three-year war with Russia. The event was originally supposed to include comments to the media by Zelenskyy and retired U.S. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, but it was changed at the last minute to a simple photo opportunity where the two posed for journalists. They did not deliver statements or field questions as expected. The change was requested by the U.S. side, Ukrainian presidential spokesman Serhii Nikiforov said. Kellogg’s trip to Kyiv coincided with recent feuding between Trump and Zelenskyy that has bruised their personal relations and cast further doubt on the future of U.S. support for Ukraine’s war effort. Dozens of journalists gathered at Ukraine's presidential office in Kyiv after being invited to take photos and observe a news conference with Zelenskyy and Kellogg. As the meeting began, photographers and video journalists were allowed into a room where the two men shook hands before sitting across from each other at a table. Journalists were then informed that there would be no news conference with remarks by the leaders or questions from reporters. Nikiforov gave no reason for the sudden change except to say that it was in accordance with U.S. wishes. The U.S. delegation made no comment. The White House did not respond to questions about why the news conference was called off. Two leaders were to speak about ending the war The two men were due to speak about Trump's efforts to end the war. Zelenskyy had previously said he looked forward to explaining what was happening in Ukraine and showing it to Kellogg. Kellogg, one of the architects of a staunchly conservative policy book laying out an 'America First' national security agenda, has long been Trump’s top adviser on defense issues. Writing on his Telegram channel, Zelenskyy said the meeting with Kellogg was a 'good conversation, lots of details.' He said they discussed security guarantees for Ukraine and the return of Ukrainian prisoners from Russian custody. 'We can and must make peace reliable and lasting so that Russia can never return with war again,' he wrote. 'Ukraine is ready for a strong, truly beneficial agreement with the President of the United States on investments and security.' Zelenskyy and Trump have traded rebukes in recent days. The spat erupted after Russia and the U.S. agreed Tuesday to start working toward ending the war in Ukraine and improving their diplomatic and economic ties. With that, Trump abruptly reversed the three-year U.S. policy of isolating Russia. Zelenskyy was unhappy that a U.S. team opened the talks without inviting him or European governments that have backed Kyiv. When Trump claimed Zelenskyy was deeply unpopular in Ukraine, the Ukrainian president said Trump was living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space,' suggesting he had been duped by Putin. Trump also accused Zelenskyy of being 'a dictator without elections' and suggested that Ukraine was to blame for the war. Due to the fighting, Ukraine has delayed elections that were scheduled for April 2024. Zelenskyy 'retains a fairly high level of public trust' in Ukraine — about 57 percent — according to a report released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. White House sees obstacles to peace White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said Trump’s increasingly tough criticism of Zelenskyy reflected frustration with what the administration sees as roadblocks erected by the Ukrainian leader to finding an endgame to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 'There needs to be a deep appreciation for what the American people and the American taxpayer, what President Trump did in his first term and what we’ve done since,' Waltz said. 'There’s some of the rhetoric coming out of Kyiv, frankly, and insults to President Trump (that) were unacceptable.' Waltz also noted that Trump is frustrated that Zelenskyy rejected an offer presented last week by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that would have given the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals as repayment for U.S. support during the war and future aid for Ukraine. Russia’s army crossed the border on Feb. 24, 2022, in an all-out invasion that Putin sought to justify by falsely saying it was needed to protect Russian-speaking civilians in eastern Ukraine and prevent the country from joining NATO. On Wednesday, Trump warned Zelenskyy that he 'better move fast' to negotiate an end to Russia’s invasion or risk not having a nation to lead. European leaders quickly threw support behind Zelenskyy German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose country has been Kyiv’s second-biggest weapons supplier after the U.S., said it was 'wrong and dangerous' to deny Zelenskyy’s democratic legitimacy. Ukraine has been defending itself for nearly three years against a merciless war of aggression — day after day,' Scholz told news outlet Der Spiegel. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to Zelenskyy on Wednesday and expressed support for him 'as Ukraine’s democratically elected leader,' Starmer’s office said, adding that it was 'perfectly reasonable' to postpone elections during wartime. Russian officials, meanwhile, are basking in Washington’s attention and offering words of support for Trump’s stance. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said 'the rhetoric of Zelenskyy and many representatives of the Kyiv regime in general leaves much to be desired' — a veiled reference to Ukrainian criticism of Putin. 'Representatives of the Ukrainian regime, especially in recent months, often allow themselves to make statements about the heads of other states that are completely unacceptable,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Russian keeps up strikes on civilians Amid the diplomatic clamor, Ukrainian civilians continue to endure Russian strikes. Russia fired 161 Shahed and decoy drones and up to 14 missiles of various types at Ukraine overnight from Wednesday to Thursday, according to military authorities. A Russian glide bomb struck an apartment block in the southern city of Kherson on Wednesday night, killing one person and wounding six, including 14-year-old twins, authorities said. The southern port city of Odesa also came under a Russian drone attack for the second consecutive night, leaving almost 50,000 homes without electricity in freezing winter temperatures, officials said. ___ Associated Press Writer Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-a-news-conference-between-zelenskyy-and-donald-trumps-ukraine-envoy-is-canceled-at-u-s-request/	2025-02-20T12:13:12-08:00	
Haley admonishes Trump for Ukraine stance: 'Exactly what Putin wa...	(The Hill) -- Former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley admonished her 2024 election rival, President Donald Trump, over his stance on Ukraine and recent comments directed at the country’s president Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump appeared to blame Zelensky and the country’s leadership on Tuesday for the war in Eastern Europe as it nears its three-year anniversary. He doubled down on his criticism of Ukraine’s leader on Wednesday, claiming he has done a 'terrible job' of leading the war-torn country and accusing him of taking advantage of Washington with all of the aid the U.S. has forked over in the last three years. Haley, who eventually endorsed Trump in 2024, characterized the president’s remarks as 'classic Russian talking points' and 'exactly what Putin wants.' Trump escalated his jabs against Zelensky as a group of U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, met with their Russian counterparts on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia. They began peace talks, seeking to restart a relationship with Moscow, one that diminished following Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Haberman says Trump’s Russia-Ukraine rhetoric ‘seems to be about flexing muscle’ Kyiv did not have a representative at the meeting. The commander-in-chief on Wednesday called Zelensky a 'dictator,' slamming him for not holding nationwide elections and claiming his approval rating dropped to single digits. With Ukraine under martial law, elections cannot take place. A Wednesday poll from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57 percent of Ukrainians trust their president. Zelensky fired back at Trump’s Tuesday comments, saying he is living in a Russian 'disinformation space.' Haley, a foreign policy hawk who after the election joined the Hudson Institute think tank, has previously said support for Ukraine is in the U.S. national interest and has backed Kyiv to eventually join the NATO military alliance. Trump has gotten pushback regarding his recent rhetoric on Ukraine from his former vice president and 2024 primary election rival Mike Pence. 'Mr. President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war. Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth,' Pence wrote on Wednesday. Some Republican senators have also been unnerved by Trump’s recent public comments, praising Zelensky’s leadership and reiterating that Russia started the invasion in 2022, eight years after annexing Crimea. 'Zelensky is frustrated, but he’s also been the right head of state for the time. He’s kept a nation together focused on Russian occupiers, and I think we should give them a fair amount of credit for that work,' Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said, days after visiting Kyiv alongside some Senate Democrats.	https://wgntv.com/news/haley-admonishes-trump-for-ukraine-stance-exactly-what-putin-wants/	2025-02-20T08:18:56-08:00	
Hamas returns bodies of 4 Israeli hostages said to include a moth...	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas on Thursday released the bodies of four Israeli hostages, said to include a mother and her two children who have long been feared dead and had come to embody the nation's agony following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. The remains were presumed to be of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, as well as Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted. Kfir, who was 9 months old when he was taken, was the youngest captive. Hamas has said all four were killed along with their guards in Israeli airstrikes. 'Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters,' Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement. 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely.' The militants displayed four black coffins on a stage in the Gaza Strip surrounded by banners, including a large one depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a vampire. Thousands of people, including large numbers of masked and armed militants, looked on as the coffins were loaded onto Red Cross vehicles before being driven to Israeli forces. The military held a small funeral ceremony, at the request of the families, before transferring the bodies to a laboratory in Israel for formal identification using DNA, a process that could take up to two days. Only then will the families be given the final notification. Israeli channels did not broadcast the handover. In Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, where Israelis have gathered to watch the release of living hostages, a large screen showed a compilation of photos and videos of Lifshitz and the Bibas family, including a chuckling baby Kfir and the family dressed up in Batman costumes. Israelis have celebrated the return of 24 living hostages in recent weeks under a tenuous ceasefire that paused over 15 months of war. But the handover on Thursday was a grim reminder of those who died in captivity as the talks leading up to the truce dragged on for over a year. It could also provide impetus for negotiations on the second stage of the ceasefire that have hardly begun. The first phase is set to end at the beginning of March. Infant was the youngest taken hostage Kfir Bibas was just 9 months old, a red-headed infant with a toothless smile, when militants stormed into the family’s home on Oct. 7, 2023. His brother Ariel was 4. Video shot that day showed a terrified Shiri swaddling the two boys as militants led them into Gaza. Her husband, Yarden Bibas, was taken separately and released this month after 16 months in captivity. Relatives in Israel have clung to hope, marking Kfir’s first and second birthdays and his brother's fifth. The Bibas family said in a statement Wednesday that it would wait for 'identification procedures' before acknowledging that their loved ones were dead. Supporters throughout Israel have worn orange in solidarity with the family — a reference to two boys' red hair — and a popular children’s song was written in their honor. Like the Bibas family, Oded Lifshitz was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, along with his wife Yocheved, who was freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Oded was a journalist who campaigned for the recognition of Palestinian rights and peace between Arabs and Jews. Hamas-led militants abducted 251 hostages, including some 30 children, in the Oct. 7 attack, in which they also killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. More than half the hostages, and most of the women and children, have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight and have recovered dozens of bodies of people killed in the initial attack or who died in captivity. It's not clear if the ceasefire will last Hamas is set to free six living hostages on Saturday in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and says it will release four more bodies next week, completing the ceasefire's first phase. That will leave the militants with some 60 hostages, all men, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he is committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Trump's proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it, which has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries, has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. Hamas could be reluctant to free more hostages if it believes the war will resume with the goal of annihilating the group or forcibly transferring Gaza's population. Israel's military offensive killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its records. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to fields of rubble and bombed-out buildings. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza's population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Lidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hamas-to-return-4-israeli-bodies-including-a-mother-and-her-2-young-children/	2025-02-20T04:59:53-08:00	
Trump warns Zelenskyy to quickly negotiate war's end with Russia ...	MIAMI (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he 'better move fast' to negotiate an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine or risk not having a nation to lead. The rhetoric from Trump toward Ukraine comes amid an escalating back-and-forth between the two presidents and rising tensions between Washington and much of Europe over Trump's approach to settling the biggest conflict on the continent since World War II. Trump's harsh words for Zelenskyy drew criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans in the United States, where Ukraine’s defense against Russian aggression has had bipartisan support. Zelenskyy said Trump was falling into a Russian disinformation trap — and was quickly admonished by Vice President JD Vance about the perils of publicly criticizing the new president. Trump, who is trying to bring the fighting to a close on terms that Kyiv says are too favorable to Moscow, used an extended social media post on his Truth Social platform to lash out at Zelenskyy and call the Ukrainian a 'dictator without elections.' 'Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and ‘TRUMP,’ will never be able to settle,' Trump said of Zelenskyy, who was a popular television star in Ukraine before running for office. The U.S. has obligated about $183 billion since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, according to the U.S. special inspector general, conducting oversight of American assistance to Ukraine. Trump accused Zelenskyy of being 'A Dictator without Elections!!' Due to the war, Ukraine did delay elections that were scheduled for April 2024. He later repeated many of the criticisms of Zelenskyy, who he said has done a 'terrible job,' during an address before a meeting in Miami of business executives hosted by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. Trump also contended that Zelenskyy was misusing American aid intended for the war effort and had taken advantage of Democrat Joe Biden's administration. The Republican president was riled by Zelenskyy's charge that Trump 'lives in this disinformation space' fostered by Moscow. 'We have seen this disinformation. We understand that it is coming from Russia,' Zelenskyy said. Vance told the Daily Mail that Zelenskyy's criticism of Trump was not helping his cause. 'The idea that Zelenskyy is going to change the president’s mind by bad mouthing him in public media, everyone who knows the president will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration,' Vance said. Ukrainian officials, however, continue to raise their concerns about Trump's approach. 'Why should dominance be handed over to a country that is an aggressor, a violator of international law, and the author of aggression against Ukraine?' said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy. 'We still do not understand this strategy.' U.S. and Russian officials meeting in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday agreed to negotiate a settlement to an end to the war. Ukrainian and European officials were not included. Trump said Zelenskyy should have worked out a deal earlier. 'Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left,' Trump said. 'In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only ‘TRUMP,’ and the Trump Administration, can do. Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring Peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the ‘gravy train’ going,' Trump wrote. The rhetoric from Trump went even further than the false charges he made Tuesday against the Ukrainians when he suggested Kyiv was responsible for starting the war. Russia invaded its smaller neighbor. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York was appalled that Trump was blaming Ukraine for Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion. 'It’s disgusting to see an American president turn against one of our friends and openly side with a thug like Vladimir Putin,' Schumer said. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said he disagreed with Trump's suggestion that Ukraine was responsible. 'I think Vladimir Putin started the war,' Kennedy said. 'I also believe, from bitter experience, that Vladimir Putin is a gangster. He’s a gangster with a black heart' who has Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's 'taste for blood.' Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Trump's words were insulting to the thousands of Ukrainians who have died in the war and he accused the president of parroting Putin. 'I would call on President Trump to apologize to the people of Ukraine, but it would be a waste of breath,' Durbin said. 'Donald Trump is a pushover for Putin.' Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota is among the Republican lawmakers who have supported Ukraine over the course of the war. He said the Trump administration needed space as it seeks a resolution. 'The president speaks for himself,' Thune said about Trump's sharpening rhetoric toward Zelenskyy. 'What I want to see is a peaceful result, a peaceful outcome.' The administration has also shown frustration with Zelenskyy for directing his ministers last week not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. The Ukrainians said the document was too focused on U.S. interests. The proposal, a key part of Zelenskyy’s talks with Vance on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, did not offer any specific security guarantees in return. Trump during his speech in Miami fumed about the Ukrainians walking away from an agreement. 'They broke that deal,' Trump charged. Trump, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One after his speech Wednesday evening, said the U.S. believed it had a deal on accessing Ukraine's critical minerals when Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent travelled to Kyiv last week. Trump added the Ukrainians 'agreed to it more or less and then Scott Bessent went there and was treated rather rudely because essentially they told him no.' Ukrainian officials met Wednesday in Kyiv with retired U.S. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia. 'It’s an egregious war in the sense of the length of time and casualties there and he understands the human suffering,' Kellogg said of Trump's thinking. 'He understands the damage that we can see and we want to see an end to it.' ___ Madhani and Pesoli reported from Washington.

Trump: Zelensky 'has done a terrible job'	President Trump on Wednesday ratcheted up his criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, accusing him of taking advantage of the United States and saying he has done a 'terrible job' leading his war-torn country. Trump went after Zelensky and questioned U.S. support for Ukraine in its war against Russia a day after he appeared to blame the Ukrainian leader for starting the conflict. Zelensky responded to those earlier comments by saying Trump 'lives in this disinformation space.' 'Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle,' Trump posted Wednesday on Truth Social. He questioned why the United States has spent billions of dollars in support of Ukraine and why the Biden administration did not demand Europe put in an equal amount, given its proximity to the conflict. 'He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden 'like a fiddle,'' Trump wrote of Zelensky. 'A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. 'In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do. Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring Peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the 'gravy train' going,' Trump continued. 'I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died – And so it continues…..' Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after amassing troops on the border and demanding a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO. The invasion took place nearly a decade after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine postponed its 2024 presidential elections because of martial law being in place amid the Russian invasion. Top Trump administration officials met Tuesday in Saudi Arabia with Russian officials in the first step toward negotiating a ceasefire agreement in Ukraine. The meeting did not include Ukrainian officials, which irked Zelensky. Trump vowed to end the war during his presidential campaign. He has shrugged off questions about which party is at fault or whether Ukraine is an equal member of peace talks, saying he wants the killing to stop. His rhetoric about ending the war, and the fact that he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week before talking to Zelensky, has marked a shift in posture from the Biden administration, which championed the concept of 'nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.' Trump on Tuesday was sharply critical of Zelensky when asked by reporters about the meeting in Saudi Arabia. 'Today I heard, ‘Oh, well we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,' he said of Ukraine. 'You should’ve ended it in three years. You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.' Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week called it 'unrealistic' for Ukraine to return to its pre-2014 borders as part of a ceasefire agreement with Russia, or to gain NATO membership. Those comments sparked criticism, as some saw it as giving away negotiating leverage for Ukraine before peace talks began in earnest. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, Congress had approved nearly $183 billion in Ukraine aid, according to a federal government oversight office. A Jan. 20 release from the State Department said the U.S. had provided roughly $66 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since February 2022, as well as billions of dollars in other forms of support.

Pakistan steps up arrests of Afghans without papers. Kabul says i...	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Authorities have stepped up arrests of Afghan citizens in Pakistan's capital and a nearby city in an effort that the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad described on Wednesday as a push to force the expulsion of all Afghan refugees from the country. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry promptly dismissed the allegation, saying that the authorities were only trying to facilitate conditions for the swift return of Afghans to their home country. Pakistan has long threatened to deport Afghans living in the country illegally. Separately, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last month approved a March 31 deadline to deport those awaiting relocation to third countries unless their cases are swiftly processed by the governments that have agreed to take them, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press. More than 800,000 Afghans have returned home or have been expelled by force from Pakistan since 2023, according to the International Organization for Migration, a U.N. agency that tracks migrations. In a strongly worded statement on Wednesday, the Afghan Embassy — which represents the Taliban-run government of Afghanistan — criticized 'the short timeframe' given by the authorities in Islamabad and 'the unilateral nature of Pakistan’s decision.' Afghans in Islamabad and the nearby garrison city of Rawalpindi have been subjected to arrests, searches, and orders from police to leave the the two cities and relocate to other parts of Pakistan, the embassy said. It further claimed that for all Afghans, 'expulsion is imminent' — something the embassy said Pakistani authorities had not communicated to Kabul ' through any formal correspondence.' More than half a million Afghans who fled the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 have been living without papers in Pakistan, thousands of them waiting for resettlement in the United States and elsewhere. There are also some 1.45 million Afghan refugees, registered with the U.N. refugee agency, most of whom fled during the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation of their country. Last July, Pakistan extended the stay of refugees registered with the UNHCR until June 2025, saying they will not be arrested or deported at least until the extension expires. Sharif's January decision appears to be a reversal of that extension and followed a widely criticized anti-migrant crackdown by his government targeting anyone without valid documentation regardless of nationality, according to Pakistani authorities. Ultimately, the embassy said, 'Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that there is a definitive and final plan to deport all Afghan refugees not only from Islamabad and Rawalpindi but also from the entire country in the near future.' Pakistan foreign ministry defended its stance on Wednesday. 'While Pakistan has done what it could, we expect ... Afghan authorities to create conducive conditions so returnees are fully integrated in the Afghan society,' it said. After President Donald Trump paused U.S. refugee programs last month, around 20,000 Afghans who were awaiting resettlement in Pakistan are now in limbo. Ahmad Shah, a member of an Afghan advocacy group, urged Pakistan on Wednesday to allow Afghans waiting for relocation to continue living in Islamabad — at least until the Trump administration makes a final decision about their fate. He said it would be hard for them to visit Western embassies in the Pakistani capital if they are forced to move to other areas.	https://wgntv.com/news/international/ap-international/ap-pakistan-wants-to-expel-all-afghan-refugees-from-the-country-says-afghan-embassy/	2025-02-19T05:20:59-08:00	
Trump is living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space,' says Uk...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump is living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space' as a result of his administration’s discussions with Kremlin officials. Zelenskyy said he 'would like Trump’s team to be more truthful.' He made the comments shortly before he was expected to meet with Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, who arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday. Kellogg will meet Zelenskyy and military commanders as the U.S. shifts its policy away from years of efforts to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump suggested Tuesday that Kyiv was to blame for the war, which enters its fourth year next week, as talks between top American and Russian diplomats in Saudi Arabia sidelined Ukraine and its European supporters. French President Emmanuel Macron was to hold a videoconference on Ukraine later Wednesday with leaders of over 15 countries, mostly European nations, 'with the aim of gathering all partners interested in peace and security' on the continent, his office said. Key European leaders held an emergency meeting in Paris on Monday after they felt they had been sidelined by the Trump administration. Trump’s comments are likely to vex Ukrainian officials, who have urged the world to help them fight Russia’s full-scale invasion that began Feb. 24, 2022. Trump also said at Mar-a-Lago that Zelenskyy’s rating stood at 4%. Zelenskyy replied in a news conference in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv that 'we have seen this disinformation. We understand that it is coming from Russia.' He said that Trump 'lives in this disinformation space.' Trump also suggested Ukraine ought to hold elections, which have been postponed due to the war and the consequent imposition of martial law, in accordance with the Ukrainian Constitution. Zelenskyy questioned claims, which he didn't specify, that 90% of all aid received by Ukraine comes from the United States. He said that, for instance, about 34% of all weapons in Ukraine are domestically produced, over 30% of support comes from Europe, and up to 40% from the U.S. The battlefield has also brought grim news for Ukraine in recent months. A relentless onslaught in eastern areas by Russia's bigger army is grinding down Ukrainian forces, which are slowly but steadily being pushed backward at some points on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. Trump told reporters at his Florida residence Tuesday that Ukraine 'should have never started' the war and 'could have made a deal' to prevent it. Kellogg said his visit to Kyiv was 'a chance to have some good, substantial talks.' Zelenskyy was due to travel to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday but canceled his trip in what some analysts saw as an attempt to deny legitimacy to the U.S.-Russia talks about the future of his country. American officials have signaled that Ukraine’s hopes of joining NATO in order to ward off Russian aggression after reaching a possible peace agreement won’t happen. Zelenskyy says any settlement will require U.S. security commitments to keep Russia at bay. 'We understand the need for security guarantees,' Kellogg said in comments carried by Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne Novyny on his arrival at Kyiv train station. 'It’s very clear to us the importance of the sovereignty of this nation and the independence of this nation as well. ... Part of my mission is to sit and listen,' the retired three-star general said. Kellogg said he would convey what he learns on his visit to Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to 'and ensure that we get this one right.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-trumps-envoy-arrives-in-kyiv-as-us-policy-shifts-toward-russia/	2025-02-19T03:52:01-08:00	
A deeper look at the talks between US and Russian officials as Tr...	RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Top U.S. and Russian officials had their most extensive high-level engagement since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine almost three years ago, meeting for four hours Tuesday before President Donald Trump suggested that Kyiv was to blame for the conflict. Trump showed little patience for Ukraine’s objections to being excluded from the talks in Saudi Arabia. He said repeatedly that Ukraine’s leaders never should have allowed the conflict to begin, indicating Kyiv should have been willing to make concessions to Russia before it sent troops into Ukraine in 2022. 'Today I heard, ‘Oh, well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you been there for three years. You should have ended it three years' ago, Trump told reporters at his Florida residence. 'You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.' Such comments and Trump's goal of mending ties with Moscow may come at a cost to the transatlantic alliance of the U.S. and Europe and significantly damage Washington’s standing with Ukraine as well as with other nations counting on U.S. leadership in NATO and elsewhere for their security and protection. During former President Joe Biden's administration, the U.S. and Europe focused on isolating Russia and defending the post-World War II international order. In Riyadh, the delegations led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to set up teams to look into restoring staffing at the U.S. and Russian embassies in Moscow and Washington that have been decimated by a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions. The effort is aimed at using those channels to support Ukraine peace negotiations and to explore ways to restart economic and global cooperation. A Russian official pointed to possible joint energy ventures. Here’s a look at the meeting and what comes next: Reestablishing tattered diplomatic relations First on both countries' list of accomplishments was an agreement to end what has been years of dwindling diplomatic relations that hit a post-Cold War low point after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. The meeting, which came just a week after Trump spoke to Putin by phone, was the first substantive face-to-face discussion between the nations’ top diplomats since former Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Lavrov in Geneva in January 2022 in an unsuccessful bid to prevent the Ukraine conflict. Lavrov said after Tuesday's talks that the sides agreed to fast-track the appointment of new ambassadors, adding that senior diplomats from the two countries will meet shortly to discuss specifics related to 'lifting artificial barriers to the work of the U.S. and Russian embassies and other missions.' In reality, the decimation of the U.S. and Russian embassies' personnel began well before Russian troops rolled into Ukraine in 2022, starting after 2014 Russia’s annexation of Crimea. That was seen as illegal by most of the world during the Obama administration, which ordered several Russian offices in the U.S. to close. It picked up steam after the 2018 poisoning in Britain of an exiled Russian spy and his daughter, which British authorities blamed on Russia, and which resulted in mass expulsions of diplomats and the closure of numerous consulates in both countries and Europe. Asked by The Associated Press if the U.S. now considered those cases closed, Rubio declined to say but said it would be impossible to get a Ukraine peace agreement without diplomatic engagement. 'I’m not going to negotiate or talk through every element of the disruptions that exist or have existed in our diplomatic relations, on the mechanics of it,' he said. Bringing an end to the conflict cannot happen 'unless we have at least some normalcy in the way our diplomatic missions operate in Moscow and in Washington, D.C.' Negotiating an end to the conflict in Ukraine The two sides agreed to set up high-level working groups to begin exploring a negotiated end to the conflict. It was not immediately clear when these teams would first meet, but both said it would be soon. As to concessions that may need to be made by all sides, Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who participated in the talks Tuesday, said the issue of territory and security guarantees would be among the subjects discussed. Rubio said a high-level team, including experts who know technical details, will begin to engage with the Russian side on 'parameters of what an end to this conflict would look like.' On the key issue of a prospective peacekeeping mission to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, the top Russian diplomat said Moscow would not accept any troops from NATO members, repeating its assertion that Ukraine's bid to join the Western military alliance poses a major security issue. 'We explained that the deployment of troops from the countries that are NATO members, even if they are deployed under the EU or national flags, will not change anything and will certainly be unacceptable for us,' Lavrov said. Exclusion of Ukraine and Europe from the talks Neither Ukraine nor European nations were invited to Tuesday's talks in Riyadh, but U.S. officials said there is no intention to exclude them from peace negotiations should they begin in earnest. 'No one is being sidelined here,' Rubio said. 'Obviously, there’s going to be engagement and consultation with Ukraine, with our partners in Europe and others. But ultimately, the Russian side will be indispensable to this effort.' Waltz agreed: 'If you’re going to bring both sides together, you have to talk to both sides. ... We are absolutely talking to both sides.' He noted that Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy immediately after speaking with Putin last week and that U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Rubio met Friday with Zelenskyy in Germany. Still, Zelenskyy was clearly peeved at being omitted from the meeting, postponing plans to visit Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to avoid any linkage of his trip with Tuesday's U.S.-Russia talks. And that was before Trump's comments suggesting Kyiv was at fault in starting the fighting. 'This whole negotiation from the start seems very tilted in Russia’s favor. And it’s even a question whether it should be termed a negotiation or in some sense, a series of American capitulations,' said Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Eurasia and Russia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a former British ambassador to Belarus. Possible lifting of US sanctions against Russia Asked whether the U.S. could lift sanctions against Moscow imposed during the Biden presidency, Rubio noted that 'to bring an end to any conflict, there has to be concessions made by all sides' and 'we’re not going to predetermine what those are.' Asked if the U.S. could officially remove Lavrov from its sanctions list, Rubio said that 'we’re just not at that level of conversation yet.' Potential US-Russian cooperation Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund who joined the Russian delegation in Riyadh, told reporters that Russia and the U.S. should develop joint energy ventures. 'We need joint projects, including in the Arctic and other regions,' he said. Should the parties succeed in negotiating an end to the Ukraine conflict, Rubio said, it could open 'incredible opportunities' to partner with the Russians 'on issues that hopefully will be good for the world and also improve our relations in the long term.' He did not say what those would entail. ___ Isachenkov reported from Moscow. Associated Press Writer Emma Burrows in London and Jonathan J.

Trump administration prepares to meet with Russian officials to e...	WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) - The Trump administration is taking new steps to try to negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is traveling to Saudi Arabia Monday to meet with Russian officials. Negotiations are in the very early stages, but the trump administration seems to be going into the discussions with some optimism. 'We're trying to get a peace with Russia and Ukraine, and we're working very hard on it,' said Trump. President Donald Trump says he's in close contact with Secretary of State Marco Rubio who's abroad to begin talks with Russian officials to try to end the war in Ukraine. The next few weeks and days will determine whether it's serious or not,' said Rubio. Secretary Rubio said the three-year war has stretched on for too long and he credited President Trump for his phone call last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin that kickstarted this process. 'One phone call. Call does not solve a war as complex as this one, but I can tell you that Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that could potentially begin that process,' said Rubio. The president framed the call as productive saying U.S. negotiators and Putin have a shared goal. 'I think he wants to stop fighting,' said Trump. Though Ukraine and its supporters have expressed concerns about what they may have to concede to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country won't accept any deal negotiated without Ukraine’s involvement, but he also said that Ukraine relies on continued U.S. military support. 'We will have low chance, a low chance to survive without the support of the United States,' said Zelenskyy. President Trump told reporters he does expect Zelenskyy to be part of negotiations and says he plans to meet directly with Putin. 'No, time set, but it could be very soon,' said Trump. President Zelenskyy also warned if the U.S. pulls out of NATO, he believes Russia would invade other European countries.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/trump-administration-prepares-to-meet-with-russian-officials-to-end-ukraine-war/	2025-02-17T06:42:38-08:00	
Israeli official says forces will remain in 5 locations in Lebano...	JERUSALEM (AP) — An Israeli official says forces will remain in five strategic locations in southern Lebanon near the border after Tuesday’s deadline for their full withdrawal. The official spoke Monday on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. Lebanon’s government has opposed any further delay in the Israeli pullout under the ceasefire agreement that ended fighting with the Hezbollah militant group. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel has issued a tender for the construction of nearly 1,000 additional settler homes in the occupied West Bank, an anti-settlement watchdog said Monday. Israelis and Palestinians meanwhile marked the 500th day since Hamas' attack into Israel ignited the war in the Gaza Strip. Peace Now says the development of 974 new housing units would allow the population of the Efrat settlement to expand by 40% and further block the development of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem. Hagit Ofran, who leads the group's settlement monitoring, said construction can begin after the contracting process and issuing of permits, which could take another year at least. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli government. Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state and view the settlements as a major obstacle to peace, a position with wide international support. The war in Gaza was paused last month when a fragile ceasefire took hold. The first phase of the truce is set to end in early March, and it’s unclear whether it will be extended to allow the release of dozens more hostages, or if Israel will renew its military offensive against Hamas with U.S. support. An Israeli strike in Lebanon killed a senior Hamas leader there a day before Israel is to complete its withdrawal from the country under a separate ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group. Settlement expansion is set to accelerate with Trump in office President Donald Trump lent unprecedented support to the settlements during his previous term. Israel has also steadily expanded settlements during Democratic administrations, which were more critical but rarely took any action to curb them. Israel has built well over 100 settlements across the West Bank, ranging from hilltop outposts to fully developed suburban communities, with apartment blocks, malls and parks. Over 500,000 settlers live in the occupied West Bank, which is home to some 3 million Palestinians. The settlers have Israeli citizenship, while Palestinians live under military rule with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers. The Israeli government views the West Bank as the historical and biblical heartland of the Jewish people and is opposed to Palestinian statehood, while human rights groups have accused Israel of discrimination against and oppression of Palestinians in the West Bank. Peace Now, which favors a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government of pressing ahead with settlement construction while dozens of hostages captured in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack languish in captivity in the Gaza Strip. 'The Netanyahu government is operating ‘on steroids’ to establish facts on the ground that will destroy the chance for peace and compromise,' it said in a statement. Israelis mark 500 days of war and captivity Israelis held protests across the country on Monday calling for the ceasefire to be extended so that more hostages can be released. Demonstrators blocked a main intersection in Tel Aviv, and some protesters planned to fast for 500 minutes in a show of solidarity with the captives. 'All I care about, all I want, is for my friends to return. There were six of us living in unbearable conditions, in a six-square-meter (65-square-foot) space. I got out, but they are still there,' Ohad Ben Ami, a hostage who was released a week and a half ago, told Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday. He added that hostages don't count days while in captivity, they count minutes and seconds. Hamas is set to continue the gradual release of 33 hostages during the current phase of the truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most parts of Gaza and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid. But the two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, in which Hamas would release more than 70 remaining hostages — around half of whom are believed to be dead — in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal and a lasting ceasefire. Netanyahu and the Trump administration have given conflicting signals over whether they want to continue the ceasefire or renew the war. Both they say are committed to the eradication of Hamas and the return of all the hostages, but those goals are widely seen as incompatible. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack and abducted around 250. More than half of the hostages have been returned in agreements with Hamas or other deals, while just eight have been rescued in military operations. The militant group, though weakened, remains in full control of the territory. Hamas has said it is willing to relinquish power to other Palestinians but will not accept any occupying force. Israel's air and ground war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The war destroyed vast areas of Gaza and at its height had displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million. Trump has called for Gaza's population to be permanently relocated to other countries and for the United States to take ownership of the territory and rebuild it for others. Israel has welcomed the plan, while Palestinians and Arab nations have universally rejected the idea. Rights groups and experts say the proposal, if implemented, would likely violate international law. The proposal has meanwhile cast further doubt over the future of the ceasefire. Hamas may be unwilling to release the remaining captives — its only bargaining chips — it if believes Israel is going to resume the war with the goal of expelling the Palestinian population. Israel kills senior Hamas official i n Lebanon An Israeli drone strike targeted a car in Lebanon's southern port city of Sidon, the deepest strike since the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel took effect in November. Israel said it targeted Muhammad Shaheen, the head of Hamas' operations in Lebanon. Footage circulating online showed a car engulfed in flames. The strike occurred near a Lebanese army checkpoint and Sidon’s municipal sports stadium. The original withdrawal deadline was in late January, but under pressure from Israel, Lebanon agreed to extend it to Feb. 18. It remains unclear whether Israeli troops will complete their withdrawal by Tuesday. Since the ceasefire, Israel has continued airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it is targeting military sites containing missiles and combat equipment. Each side has accused the other of violating the truce. ___ Wafaa Shurafa in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, contributed to this report.

Ukraine's President Zelenskyy travels to United Arab Emirates as ...	ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with the leader of the United Arab Emirates on Monday as momentum grows for potential peace talks ending Moscow's war on the country. U.S. President Donald Trump last week suggested he would be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia. The UAE, home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, has long been floated as a possible site for peace talks as well, given the large population of Russian and Ukrainian expatriates who have flooded the country since the war began, and due to the Emirates' work on prisoner exchanges in the past. Zelenskyy arrived in Abu Dhabi on Sunday night after attending the Munich Security Conference in Germany. Footage released by his office showed him and his wife, Olena Zelenska, being greeted by an Emirati official and honor guard at the airport late Sunday night. Zelenska has traveled to the UAE since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, but this trip is Zelenskyy’s first to the UAE since the war began. 'Our top priority is bringing even more of our people home from captivity,' Zelenskyy's office said in messages online. 'We will also focus on investments and economic partnership, as well as a large-scale humanitarian program.' The United Arab Emirates' state-run WAM news agency did not immediately report on Zelenskyy's arrival, which was unusual. Later on Monday, Zelenskyy’s office posted video of him meeting Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the leader of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi. Zelenskyy said the meeting included officials signing a deal that 'maximally liberalizes access to the UAE market for almost all Ukrainian goods.' Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko in a Facebook post called the deal 'truly a historic event' as it was the country's first with a Gulf Arab state. Officials also agreed to create a Ukraine-UAE Investment Council. 'I am confident that this agreement will provide a strong boost to our economies, strengthen cooperation in key sectors, and lay the foundation for long-term, stable engagement between our countries,' the minister wrote. Zelenskyy's visit to Abu Dhabi came as it hosts its biennial International Defense Exhibition and Conference arms show this week, where both Ukraine and Russia have displayed arms — even as Moscow faces Western sanctions over the war. While Ukraine wasn't selling any of the weapons, its presence at the fair was crucial, said Ivan Sybyriakov, senior manager of the Unmanned Systems Center at the SPETS Techno Export. 'It is very important to show that Ukraine is not a victim of the war,' he said. 'Ukraine is the defender of Europe.' Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Ukraine's stands Monday afternoon, even as Russian tried to sell helicopters and other weaponry at the fair. 'Our capacity now we could produce 4 million drones per year despite the war,' Sybiha told journalists. 'We could test the drones or our products immediately on the battlefield. That's why they are really of the high quality. So I'm really proud, as a minister of a country in war, to visit the exposition.' Russian money continues to flood into Dubai’s red-hot real estate market. Daily flights between the Emirates and Moscow provide a lifeline for both those fleeing conscription and the Russian elite. The U.S. Treasury under former President Joe Biden also expressed concerns about the amount of Russian cash flowing into the Arabian Peninsula country. Zelenskyy's visit comes as Denis Manturov, Russia's first deputy prime minister, visited earlier Sunday with UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the country's president and ruler of Abu Dhabi. A readout from WAM described the talks as focusing on 'growing UAE-Russia ties and ways to advance shared interests, benefiting both nations and their peoples.' Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading a delegation to Saudi Arabia this week for direct talks with Russia over the war. He will meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and other officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Ukraine will not be present at the talks. The outreach and Trump's direct call with Putin have upended years of U.S. policy under Biden that isolated Moscow over its Feb. 24, 2022, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Sybiha declined to answer a question from a journalist about what he would say to his American counterpart ahead of the meeting. ___ Associated Press writer Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraines-president-zelenskyy-travels-to-united-arab-emirates-as-momentum-grows-for-war-peace-talks/	2025-02-17T05:06:42-08:00	
500 days of the Israel-Hamas war, by the numbers	Monday is the 500th day of the war triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. A tenuous ceasefire in the Gaza Strip has held for nearly a month. But the current phase of the truce is set to expire in early March and it is unclear if the sides will extend it, begin negotiations for a more lasting ceasefire or resume fighting. Here are some numbers that show the scale of death and devastation. Sources include the Israeli government, the Gaza Health Ministry and U.N. agencies. People killed in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023: Around 1,200 Hostages taken into Gaza: 251 Hostages remaining in Gaza: 73, including 3 taken before Oct. 7, 2023 Hostages in Gaza believed to be dead: 36, including one from before Oct. 7, 2023 Palestinians killed in Gaza: Over 48,200 (This figure from the Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but the ministry says more than half of the dead were women and children) Palestinians wounded in Gaza: Over 111,600 Israeli soldiers killed since Oct. 7, 2023: 846 Rockets fired at Israel from Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023: Over 10,000 Percentage of Gaza’s population displaced: Around 90% Palestinians who have crossed into northern Gaza since the ceasefire began: 586,000 Israelis displaced by attacks from Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon at their peak: Over 75,500 Housing units damaged or destroyed in Gaza: Over 245,000 Primary roads damaged or destroyed in Gaza: Over 92% Health facilities damaged or destroyed in Gaza: Over 84% ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-500-days-of-the-israel-hamas-war-by-the-numbers/	2025-02-16T23:35:06-08:00	
Israel and Hamas complete their latest exchange as ceasefire's fi...	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel and Hamas completed the sixth exchange of hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners on Saturday with just over two weeks remaining in the initial phase of their fragile Gaza ceasefire. Israelis expressed some relief as the three hostages — Argentinian-Israeli Iair Horn, 46; American-Israeli Sagui Dekel Chen, 36; and Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, 29 — appeared to be in better condition than the emaciated hostages freed a week ago. Before being reunited with family, Troufanov was informed of his father's death in the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the 16-month war. Chen prepared to meet his youngest daughter for the first time. Horn's brother, Eitan, remains in captivity. Armed, masked militants made the three pale, worn men walk onto a stage and speak to a crowd before handing them over to the Red Cross in the southern city of Khan Younis. The 369 Palestinian prisoners were later released. A tense dispute earlier in the week threatened to derail the ceasefire and renew the fighting in Gaza. U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to remove the territory's over 2 million Palestinians and settle them elsewhere in the region also shook the truce. But Hamas said Thursday it would move ahead with the planned exchange after it said mediators Egypt and Qatar had pledged to 'remove all hurdles' to ensure Israel would allow more tents, medical supplies and other essentials into devastated Gaza. Trump on Saturday posted on social media that the hostages 'seem to be in good shape,' adding: 'Israel will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O’CLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES. The United States will back the decision they make!' Israel has not imposed such a deadline, and it is not part of the ceasefire deal. In the occupied West Bank town of Beitunia, released prisoners were greeted by a cheering crowd of relatives and supporters. Some appeared gaunt, and the Palestinian Red Crescent emergency service said four were taken for treatment. Buses transported 333 others to Gaza. The ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19. Before Saturday, 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners had been freed during the first truce's phase. The ceasefire faces a much bigger challenge with its first phase concluding in early March. There have not been substantive negotiations over the second phase, in which Hamas would release all remaining hostages in return for ending the war. The hostages and prisoners released The three hostages had been abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, a community that was hard-hit in the Oct. 7 attack. Horn was abducted with his brother, who is not on the list of hostages expected to be released in the ceasefire's first phase. 'Now, we can breathe a little. Our Iair is home after surviving hell in Gaza,' his family said. 'Now, we need to bring Eitan back so our family can truly breathe.' Chen was working outside when militants stormed in. His wife, Avital Dekel Chen, hid in a safe room with their two daughters. She gave birth to their third daughter two months later. She told Israeli media she was overwhelmed with happiness to see her husband back in Israel, where he will meet his youngest daughter, Shachar. Troufanov, whose father was killed, was taken hostage with his grandmother, mother and girlfriend. The women were released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. His family said they were 'overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude' Saturday. Russia's government also expressed gratitude. Of the 251 people abducted during the Oct. 7 attack, 73 remain in Gaza, around half believed to be dead. Nearly all are men, including Israeli soldiers. Concern has grown about their condition. One hostage, 65-year-old Keith Siegel, said Friday in a video message addressed to Trump that his captors treated him worse as the war intensified, kicking him, spitting on him and holding him without water or light. The newly released Palestinian prisoners included 36 serving life sentences for involvement in deadly attacks against Israelis. They include Ahmed Barghouti, 48, a close aide of militant leader and iconic Palestinian political figure Marwan Barghouti. Israel sentenced Ahmed Barghouti on charges that he dispatched suicide bombers during the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s in attacks that killed Israeli civilians. Twenty-four of those serving life sentences will be exiled abroad, while 12 returned to the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem. 'When I saw my son, my soul came back to me again and I came back to life,' said Om Bashar, mother of Hassan Aweis, sentenced to life in 2002 on charges of voluntary manslaughter, planting an explosive device and attempted murder. As part of the ceasefire, Israel has also committed to releasing over 1,000 detained from Gaza provided they did not participate in the Oct. 7 attack. The truce remains fragile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right allies are calling for the war to resume in early March with the goal of destroying Hamas. The militant group remains in control of the territory after surviving one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. Hamas may be unwilling to release more hostages if it believes the war will resume. A new challenge to talks is Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza, which has been welcomed by Israel’s government. But it has been rejected by Arab countries and Palestinians, who fear they won't be able to return. Human rights groups say the relocation could amount to a war crime under international law. Trump also proposed that once the war ends, Israel would transfer control of Gaza to the United States, which would redevelop it as the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million. Hundreds of thousands have returned to their homes during the ceasefire, though many found only rubble, human remains and unexploded ordnance. The war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Bwaitel reported from Beitunia, West Bank, and Lidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Vance will meet Zelenskyy amid concerns about US-Russia talks to ...	MUNICH (AP) — Vice President JD Vance hammered home the U.S. demand that the NATO alliance step up defense spending on Friday, ahead of a security meeting in Europe at a time of intense concern and uncertainty over the Trump administration’s foreign policy. The future of Ukraine is the top item on the agenda at the Munich Security Conference following a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, when they pledged to work together to end the 3-year-old Russia-Ukraine conflict. Vance is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later Friday for talks that many observers, particularly in Europe, hope will shed at least some light on Trump’s ideas for a negotiated settlement to the war. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told the conference that everyone 'wants this war to end.' But 'how this war ends,' he said, 'will have a lasting influence on our security order and on the position of power of Europe and America in the world.' NATO defense spending Vance started his day in Munich meeting separately with Steinmeier, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy. He used the engagements to reiterate the Republican Trump administration's call for NATO members to spend more on defense. Currently, 23 of NATO’s 32 member nations are hitting the Western military alliance’s target of spending 2% of the nation's GDP on defense. 'NATO is a very important military alliance, of course, that we’re the most significant part of,' Vance told Rutte. 'But we want to make sure that NATO is actually built for the future, and we think a big part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden sharing in Europe, so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia.' Rutte said he agreed that Europe needs to step up. 'We have to grow up in that sense and spend much more,' he said. Chernobyl drone strike Hours before Vance and Zelenskyy were set to meet, a Russian drone with a high-explosive warhead hit the protective confinement shell of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Kyiv region, the Ukrainian president said. Radiation levels have not increased, Zelenskyy and the U.N. atomic agency said. Zelenskyy in Munich told reporters that he thinks the Chernobyl drone strike is a 'very clear greeting from Putin and Russian Federation to the security conference.' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday denied Ukraine's claims. And Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the Munich organizers haven’t invited Russia for several years, a decision she called 'strange and politicized.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was supposed to join Vance and Zelenskyy but was delayed when his Air Force plane had to return to Washington after developing a mechanical problem en route to Munich. He took a different aircraft, but it was unclear whether he would arrive in time for the meeting. Trump, who upended years of steadfast U.S. support for Ukraine during his call with Putin on Wednesday, has been vague about his specific intentions — other than suggesting that a deal will likely result in Ukraine being forced to cede territory that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014. 'The Ukraine war has to end,' Trump told reporters Thursday. 'Young people are being killed at levels that nobody’s seen since World War II. And it’s a ridiculous war.' Ukraine's bid to join NATO Trump’s musings have left Europeans in a quandary, wondering how — or even if — they can maintain the post-WWII security that NATO afforded them or fill the gap in the billions of dollars of security assistance that the Democratic Biden administration provided to Ukraine since Russia’s February 2022 invasion. Trump has been highly skeptical of that aid and is expected to cut or otherwise limit it as negotiations get underway in the coming days. Both Trump and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week undercut Ukraine’s hopes of becoming part of NATO, which the alliance said less than a year ago was 'irreversible,' or of getting back its territory captured by Russia, which currently occupies close to 20% including Crimea. 'I don’t see any way that a country in Russia’s position could allow ... them to join NATO,' Trump said Thursday. 'I don’t see that happening.' But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Zelenskyy on Friday that Ukraine must be allowed to join NATO. Trump in recent days said he wants to reach an agreement with Ukraine to gain access to the country’s rare earth materials as a condition for continuing U.S. support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia. He confirmed earlier this week that aides were working toward striking such a deal. Asked Friday if a deal might be completed in Munich, Vance responded, 'We'll see.' Possible sanctions against Russia Vance, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, said that the U.S. would hit Moscow with sanctions and potentially military action if Putin won’t agree to a peace deal with Ukraine that guarantees Kyiv’s long-term independence. The warning that military options 'remain on the table' was striking language from a Trump administration that’s repeatedly underscored a desire to quickly end the war. Vance’s team later pushed back on the newspaper’s report. 'The Vice President didn’t make any threats. He simply stated the fact that no one is going to take options away from President Trump as these negotiations begin,' communications director William Martin wrote on social platform X. Zelenskyy won't accept agreements made without Ukraine The U.S. reassurances may have somewhat allayed Zelenskyy’s fears, although they will not replace any lost military or economic support that President Joe Biden's administration had provided. The Ukrainian leader conceded Thursday that it was 'not very pleasant' that Trump spoke first to Putin. But he said the main issue was to 'not allow everything to go according to Putin’s plan.' 'We cannot accept it, as an independent country, any agreements (made) without us,' Zelenskyy said as he visited a nuclear power plant in western Ukraine. European turning point The track Trump is taking also has rocked Europe, much as his dismissive comments about France and Germany did during his first term. French Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Haddad described Europe as being at a turning point, with the ground shifting rapidly under its feet, and said Europe must wean itself off its reliance on the United States for its security. He warned that handing a victory to Russia in Ukraine could have repercussions in Asia, too. 'I think we’re not sufficiently grasping the extent to which our world is changing. Both our competitors and our allies are busy accelerating,' Haddad told broadcaster France Info on Thursday. ___ Lee reported from Washington and Dazio from Berlin. AP reporters Lolita C.

Middle East latest: 3 Israeli men named as latest to be freed in ...	The families of Israeli hostages still held by the Hamas militant group have released the names of three hostages expected to be freed on Saturday. The Hostages Families Forum said Friday in a statement that it welcomed the 'joyous news' that Iair Horn, 46, Sagui Dekel Chen, 36, and Sasha Troufanov, 29, are set to be freed after 498 days in Hamas captivity. All three men were taken from the same hard-hit kibbutz on Oct. 7, 2023. The news came after Hamas said Thursday it would release the next three Israeli hostages as planned this weekend in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, raising the prospect of resolving a major dispute over the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Israel, with the support of U.S. President Donald Trump, has said it will resume fighting if the hostages are not freed, but did not immediately comment on the statement by Hamas. Hamas had said it was going to delay the hostage release because Israel wasn't keeping up its side of the ceasefire agreement. Hamas said Israel wasn't allowing enough shelters, medical supplies, fuel and heavy equipment for clearing rubble into Gaza, among other alleged violations of the truce. The sides have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, freeing 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners so far during the first phase of the truce. The war could resume if no agreement is reached on the more complicated second phase, which calls for the return of all remaining hostages captured in Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and an indefinite extension of the truce. Here's the latest: ___ More than 360 Palestinian prisoners to be released RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Hamas-linked prisoners’ information office says that a total of 369 Palestinians jailed by Israel will be released Saturday in exchange for three Israeli hostages held in Gaza. It said Friday that 36 of the Palestinians scheduled for release were serving life sentences. The statement did not specify how many of them would be released into exile in Egypt ahead of deportation to other countries as part of the agreement between Israel and Hamas. The rest of the 333 Palestinians were from Gaza, all arrested after Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 that ignited the 15-month war in Gaza. Under the ceasefire deal, Israel committed to release more than 1,000 Palestinians from Gaza detained during the Israeli invasion of the enclave on the condition that they had not participated in the Oct. 7 attack. The Palestinian Authority did not immediately announce the names of those set to be freed Saturday. 3 Israelis with dual nationalities to be released JERUSALEM — The three men set to be freed by Hamas on Saturday in the sixth wave of hostage releases under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire are all Israeli civilians with dual nationalities. All were from the same communal farm, Kibbutz Nir Oz, where some 80 of roughly 400 residents were taken hostage in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack. The men are Israeli-Argentinian Iair Horn, 46, Israel-Russian Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov, 29, and Israeli-American Sagui Dekel Chen, 36. Horn is an Israel-Argentinian who was kidnapped along with his brother, Eitan Horn, who was staying with him at the time. Eitan Horn remains in Hamas captivity. Chen was outside working on a bus renovation when militants stormed the kibbutz. His wife, Avital, hid in the safe room with their two daughters. Avital was seven months pregnant and gave birth to a third daughter, Shachar Mazal, in December, while Dekel Chen was in captivity. Israeli-Russian Sasha Trufanov was taken hostage along with three members of his family: grandmother Irena Tati, mother Yelena (Lena) and his girlfriend Sapir Cohen. Sasha’s father Vitaly Trufanov was killed on October 7, 2023. The rest of his family was released in a brief ceasefire period November 2023. Hamas released the names in a statement earlier Friday. Saturday’s release will be the sixth since the Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect. Turkish president blasts Trump's Gaza proposal ANKARA, Turkey - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan continued his strong criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza, arguing that the U.S. president was making a mistake by trusting Israeli 'lies' and disregarding the 'history and values' of the region. Speaking to a group of journalists on his return from a trip to three Asian nations, Erdogan urged Trump to fulfil his promises to promote peace rather than conflict. 'Believing what (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu — whose legal process is still ongoing in his country — says will do nothing but shed blood in the region,' Erdogan said, according to a transcript of comments that were made available to The Associated Press on Friday. 'This will not bring the longed-for peace, on the contrary, it will deepen conflicts and increase blood and tears.' Erdogan, a vocal advocate of Palestinian rights, also appeared to suggest that the U.S. president should refrain from taking decisions regarding the region without consultations. 'There is no room for a ‘it’s done whether you like it or not’ approach in this region,' Erdogan said. 'The expulsion of the Palestinian people from Gaza is unacceptable.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-3-israeli-men-named-as-latest-to-be-freed-in-hostage-release/	2025-02-14T05:41:02-08:00	
A drone damaged the outer shell of Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear pl...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A drone armed with a warhead hit the outer protective shell of Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant early Friday, damaging the structure and briefly starting a fire, in an attack Kyiv blamed on Russia. The Kremlin denied it was responsible. Radiation levels at the shuttered plant in the Kyiv region — site of the world's worst nuclear accident — have not increased, according to the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency, which said the strike did not breach the plant's inner containment shell. The IAEA did not attribute blame, saying only that its team stationed at the site heard an explosion and was informed that a drone had struck the shell. Fighting around nuclear power plants has repeatedly raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe during three years of war, particularly in a country where many vividly remember living through the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which killed at least 30 people and spewed radioactive fallout over much of the Northern Hemisphere. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is Europe’s biggest, has occasionally been hit by drones during the war without causing significant damage. The strike came two days after President Donald Trump upended U.S. policy on Ukraine, saying he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war. The move seemed to identify Putin as the only player that matters and looked set to sideline Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as European governments, in any peace talks. That comes at a time when Ukraine is being slowly pushed backward by Russia’s bigger army along parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line and desperately needs more Western help. The Chernobyl strike occurred in the early hours of Friday, according to the IAEA. Zelenskyy said a Russian drone with a high-explosive warhead hit the plant's outer shell and started a fire, which has been put out. The shell was built in 2016 over another heavy concrete containment structure, which was placed on the plant’s fourth reactor soon after the 1986 disaster. Both shells seek to prevent radiation leaks. The Ukrainian Emergency Service provided a photograph that showed a hole punched in the roof of the outer shell, which is a massive steel-and-concrete structure weighing some 40,000 tons (36,000 metric tons) and tall enough to fit Paris’ Notre Dame Cathedral inside. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Russia was responsible. 'There is no talk about strikes on nuclear infrastructure, nuclear energy facilities. Any such claim isn’t true, our military doesn’t do that,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. It was not possible to independently confirm who was behind the strike. Both sides frequently trade blame when nuclear sites come under attack. Peskov alleged the Ukrainian claim was aimed at thwarting efforts to end the war through negotiations between Trump and Putin. 'It’s obvious that there are those (in the Ukrainian government) who will continue to oppose any attempts to launch a negotiation process, and it’s obvious that those people will do everything to try to derail this process,' Peskov said. Ukraine plans to provide detailed information to U.S. officials about the Chernobyl strike during the Munich Security Conference starting Friday, the head of Ukraine’s Presidential Office, Andrii Yermak, wrote on his Telegram channel. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said on social platform X that the Chernobyl strike and the recent increase in military activity near Zaporizhzhia 'underline persistent nuclear safety risks,' adding that the IAEA remains 'on high alert.' The IAEA said its personnel at the site responded within minutes of the strike, adding there were no casualties. 'Radiation levels inside and outside remain normal and stable,' the IAEA said on X. Zelenskyy claimed on Telegram that the Chernobyl strike showed that 'Putin is certainly not preparing for negotiations' — a claim Ukrainian officials have repeatedly made. 'The only state in the world that can attack such facilities, occupy the territory of nuclear power plants, and conduct hostilities without any regard for the consequences is today’s Russia. And this is a terrorist threat to the entire world,' he wrote. 'Russia must be held accountable for what it is doing,' he added. ___ This story has been updated to correct a typo in the name of the head of the IAEA.

Trump’s call with Putin ends U.S. efforts to isolate Russia	MOSCOW (AP) — By saying Ukraine’s NATO membership is 'impractical' and the return of Russian-occupied territories to Kyiv is 'illusionary,' the Trump administration is giving its blessing to key items on President Vladimir Putin’s wish list — even before a potential settlement of the conflict. Rarely was a policy change between Moscow and Washington so swift and drastic than President Donald Trump’s phone call with Putin, abruptly ending a three-year, U.S.-led effort to isolate the Russian leader over Ukraine. And the fighting in Ukraine wasn’t the only issue the two leaders discussed in Wednesday's call. They talked about the Middle East settlement, the role of the dollar, global energy markets and even artificial intelligence. The broad agenda was exactly what Putin has long wanted – Russia and the U.S. sitting down to talk about global issues while the rest of the world stood by. It’s unclear how the prospective Ukraine peace talks could evolve, but the call already has marked a watershed, immediately breaking the ice between Moscow and Washington. Putin’s goals in Ukraine Putin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, amid Kyiv’s bid to join NATO that he described as a 'red line' for Moscow. He had cast the alliance’s eastward expansion as a major threat to Russia and sought NATO’s guarantees that it would never offer membership to Ukraine. Putin expected a quick victory, but the steadfast Ukrainian resistance and a flow of Western weapons to Kyiv quickly thwarted Kremlin hopes. The fighting has produced heavy casualties on both sides, becoming Europe’s largest military conflict since World War II. After suffering early setbacks, Russia gradually regained the initiative in combat, unleashing a series of offensives across the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line in slow but steady gains throughout 2024. It controls about a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean Peninsula, taken in 2014 Putin has demanded that Ukraine withdraw its troops from the four regions that Russia has seized but never fully controlled, renounce its bid to join NATO, and protect the rights of Russian speakers. He and his lieutenants repeated all of that in recent statements, reaffirming Moscow’s maximalist approach. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected Moscow's demands, but the grim battlefield situation and the latest statements from Trump set the stage for talks in which Kyiv could potentially be forced into painful compromises. Trump signals openness to Russian demands Trump described his call with Putin as 'lengthy and highly productive' and thanked Putin 'for his time and effort,' emphasizing their shared desire to halt the fighting without saying a word that it was Russia which sent troops into Ukraine. He said he later spoke to Zelenskyy, but he remained noncommittal about whether Ukraine would be an equal participant in the peace talks — an apparent signal that Kyiv could be presented with a deal negotiated behind its back in a dramatic shift from the Biden administration's policy of 'nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.' Also on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told a meeting of Ukraine’s Western allies that Kyiv shouldn’t hope to get all its territory back from Russia and will not be allowed to join NATO. And while Europe has demanded to be part of any talks about the Ukrainian settlement, Trump and his team have shown little interest in bringing the allies on board. Hegseth insisted that NATO should play no role in any future military mission to police the peace in Ukraine and that any peacekeeping troops should not be covered by the part of NATO’s founding treaty that obliges all allies to come to the aid of any member under attack. 'For Russia, the fact that for now it looks like it’s going to be Russia and the United States outlining the scheme for cessation of hostilities and potential resolution of the conflict or turning it into frozen conflict will be happening between Moscow and Washington, and Kyiv and European capitals will be a sideshow here,' said Alexander Gabuev, director of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. Many in Europe seemed flabbergasted by Washington’s drastic policy change. 'It’s certainly an innovative approach to a negotiation to make very major concessions even before they have started,' former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who co-chairs the European Council on Foreign Relations. said on social platform X. In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov mocked what he described as the EU and NATO 'stupor' after the Trump-Putin call, saying that 'many in the West, starting with the EU leaders, were stunned when a normal, basic conversation between two well-mannered, polite people took place.' 'I’m very sorry, but the Western reaction shows that there are practically no such people left there,' Lavrov said. Expanding a US-Russian agenda Trump posted on social media that he and Putin both 'reflected on the Great History of our Nations, and the fact that we fought so successfully together in World War II, remembering that Russia lost tens of millions of people, and we, likewise, lost so many!' Those words were music to Putin's ears. He has made the enormous Soviet suffering and sacrifice during World War II a key ideological pillar and a rallying point for the country, as well as a justification of its claim of a superpower status. 'Trump borrowed a lot of Putin’s talking points about the role of Russia in World War II and all of the multiple casualties,' Gabuev said. Putin, in turn, has been praising Trump even before the call, echoing his repeated claim that he would have prevented the hostilities in Ukraine had he been in office. Putin also has endorsed Trump’s refusal to accept his defeat in the 2020 election. Trump said his campaign motto of 'COMMON SENSE' was cited by Putin in the conversation, adding that 'we both believe very strongly in it.' He said they 'agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s nations' and added that they would 'probably' meet in Saudi Arabia in the near future. The various global issues that Trump said he discussed with Putin — including the Middle East, energy markets, the dollar and AI — reflected the broad agenda that the Kremlin leader has long sought to address, seeking to regain Moscow’s Cold War-era status of a superpower on par with the U.S. 'The way that Trump frames this new approach, the way that he talks about his first official on-the-record conversation with President Putin, is definitely seen as a symbolic win by Moscow,' Gabuev said. 'It’s really a discussion on peer competitor or what Moscow sees as kind of peer great power. It is much broader than just Ukraine.' —- Associated Press writer Harriet Morris contributed.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-trumps-call-with-putin-ends-u-s-efforts-to-isolate-russia/	2025-02-13T11:11:55-08:00	
NATO allies insist Ukraine and Europe must be in peace talks as T...	BRUSSELS (AP) — Several NATO allies stressed on Thursday that Ukraine and Europe must not be cut out of any peace negotiations as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth denied that the United States is betraying the war-ravaged country. European governments are reeling after the Trump administration signaled that it is planning face-to-face talks with Russia on ending the Ukraine war without involving them, insisted that Kyiv should not join NATO, and said that it’s up to Europe to protect itself and Ukraine from whatever Russia might do next. 'There can be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine. And Ukraine’s voice must be at the heart of any talks,' U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey told reporters at NATO headquarters, as the organization’s 32 defense ministers met for talks on Ukraine. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said: 'For me, it’s clear … that Europe must be involved in the negotiations — and I think that’s very easy to understand,' particularly if Europe is 'supposed to play a central or the main role in the peace order.' Europe 'will have to live directly' with the consequences, he added. Hegseth denied that the U.S. has betrayed Ukraine by launching negotiations about its future without Kyiv’s full involvement. After talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and then Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump said on Wednesday he would 'probably' meet in person with the Russian leader in the near term, possibly in Saudi Arabia. 'There is no betrayal there. There is a recognition that the whole world and the United States is invested and interested in peace. A negotiated peace,' Hegesth told reporters. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, expressed surprise that Hegseth and Trump had listed what appeared to be concessions to Russia even before talks have begun in earnest. 'We shouldn’t take anything off the table before the negotiations have even started, because it plays to Russia’s court,' she said. 'Why are we giving them everything that they want even before the negotiations have been started? It’s appeasement. It has never worked.' Hegseth fired back later, saying in his first major news conference as defense secretary that 'it’s just a cheap political point to say, oh, we’ve left all the negotiating cards off the table by recognizing some realities that exist on the ground.' He said that neither Russia nor Ukraine will 'get everything that they want' in negotiations to end the war. Hegseth also warned that the war in Ukraine must 'be a wakeup call' for NATO’s European allies to spend more on their own defense budgets. Twenty-three of the 32 member countries were forecast to have met the organization’s guideline of spending 2% of gross domestic product on their national defense budgets last year, but a third still do not. European countries, he said, must spend more on their own defense, otherwise the U.S. is forced to 'be everywhere for everybody, all the time.' Asked when the U.S. might raise its defense spending from 3.4% to the 5% Washington is demanding of other allies, Hegseth demurred, saying that '3.4% is a very robust investment, larger than most.' But Hegseth's French counterpart, Sébastien Lecornu, described the wrangling over greater defense spending as 'a false debate,' saying that governments and parliaments across Europe are already approving more weapons purchases and bigger military budgets while helping Ukraine stave off an invasion. Lecornu warned that the future of NATO itself is now in question. 'To say that it’s the biggest and most robust alliance in history is true, historically speaking. But the real question is will that still be the case in 10 or 15 years,' he said, after the U.S. — by far NATO's biggest and most powerful member — signaled that its security priorities lie elsewhere, including in Asia. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who was chairing Thursday's meeting, said that whatever agreement is struck between Russia and Ukraine, it is crucial that the 'peace deal is enduring, that Putin knows that this is the end, that he can never again try to capture a piece of Ukraine.' ___ Lolita C.

Russia rejoices at Trump-Putin call as Zelenskyy rejects talks wi...	Russian officials and state media took a triumphant tone Thursday after President Donald Trump jettisoned three years of U.S. policy and announced he would likely meet soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a peace deal in the almost three-year war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said he would not accept any negotiations about Ukraine that do not include his country in the talks. European governments also demanded a seat at the table. Trump’s change of tack seemed to identify Putin as the only player that matters in ending the fighting and looked set to sideline Zelenskyy, as well as European governments, in any peace talks. The Ukrainian leader recently described that prospect as 'very dangerous.' Putin has been ostracized by the West since Russia’s Feburary 2022 invasion of its neighbor, and in 2023 the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian leader alleging war crimes. Trump’s announcement created a major diplomatic upheaval that could herald a watershed moment for Ukraine and Europe. Russia rejoices at Putin's spotlight role Russian officials and state-backed media sounded triumphant after Wednesday’s call between Trump and Putin that lasted more than an hour. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that the 'position of the current (U.S.) administration is much more appealing.' The deputy chair of Russia’s National Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said in an online statement: 'The presidents of Russia and the U.S. have talked at last. This is very important in and of itself.' Senior lawmaker Alexei Pushkov said the call 'will go down in the history of world politics and diplomacy.' 'I am sure that in Kyiv, Brussels, Paris and London they are now reading Trump’s lengthy statement on his conversation with Putin with horror and cannot believe their eyes,' Pushkov wrote on his messaging app. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said in an opinion column: 'The U.S. finally hurt Zelenskyy for real,' adding that Trump had found 'common ground' with Putin. 'This means that the formula ‘nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine’ — a sacred cow for Zelenskyy, the European Union and the previous U.S. administration — no longer exists. Moreover, the opinion of Kyiv and Brussels (the European Union) is of no interest to Trump at all,' it added. The pro-Kremlin Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda went even further and published a column stating in the headline that 'Trump signed Zelenskyy’s death sentence.' 'The myth of Russia as a ‘pariah’ in global politics, carefully inflated by Western propaganda, has burst with a bang,' the column said. Zelenskyy won't accept talks without Ukraine In his first comments to journalists since Trump held individual calls first with Putin and then Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian leader conceded that it was 'not very pleasant' that the American president spoke first to Putin. But he said the main issue was to 'not allow everything to go according to Putin’s plan.' 'We cannot accept it, as an independent country, any agreements (made) without us,' Zelenskyy said as he visited a nuclear power plant in western Ukraine. During the conversation with Trump on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said, the U.S. president told him he wanted to speak to both the Russian and Ukrainian leaders at the same time. 'He never mentioned in a conversation that Putin and Russia was a priority. We, today, trust these words. For us it is very important to preserve the support of the United States of America,' Zelenskyy said. Alarm bells ring in Europ e and NATO Trump appears ready to make a deal over the heads of Ukraine and European governments. He also effectively dashed Ukraine’s hopes of becoming part of NATO, which the alliance said less than a year ago was an 'irreversible' step, or getting back the parts of its territory captured so far by the Russian army. Russia currently occupies close to 20% of the country. The U.S. administration’s approach to a potential settlement is notably close to Moscow’s vision of how the war should end. That has caused alarm and tension within the 32-nation NATO alliance and 27-nation European Union. Some European governments that fear their countries could also be in the Kremlin’s crosshairs were alarmed by Washington’s new course, saying they must be part of negotiations. 'Ukraine, Europe and the United States should work on this together. TOGETHER,' Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote Wednesday on social media. EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas said: 'It is clear that any deal behind our backs will not work. You need the Europeans. You need the Ukrainians.' Others balked at Trump’s overtures and poured cold water on his upbeat outlook. 'Just as Putin has no intention of stopping hostilities even during potential talks, we must maintain Western unity and increase support … to Ukraine, and political and economic pressure on Russia,' Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said. 'Our actions must show that we are not changing course.' A Ukrainian soldier is resigned to Trump and Putin talking A soldier from Ukraine’s 53rd Brigade fighting in the eastern Donetsk region said it was normal for Trump and Putin to speak to each other. 'If dialogue is one way to influence the situation, then let them talk — but let it be meaningful enough for us to feel the results of those talks,' the soldier said, insisting on anonymity due to security risks for her family in occupied Ukrainian territory. But she was skeptical about the negotiations, given the incompatible demands tabled in the past by Russia and Ukraine. 'The conditions are unacceptable for everyone. What we propose doesn’t work for them, and what they propose is unacceptable for us,' she said. 'That’s why I, like probably every soldier here, believe this can only be resolved by force.' A Ukrainian army officer, who said he's in touch with more than 40 brigades, said the troops he regularly speaks with don’t want a peace deal at any price even as they are desperate for more Western military aid. 'The stock we currently have, in terms of ammunition, is enough to last two or three weeks, maybe a month,' he told The Associated Press, asking that his name not be used because he wasn’t authorized to speak to the media. 'We definitely cannot deal with it on our own,' he added. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-rejoices-at-trump-putin-call-as-alarm-bells-ring-in-europe/	2025-02-13T08:34:51-08:00	
Hamas says it will free 3 more hostages as planned, paving the wa...	CAIRO (AP) — Hamas said Thursday it would release three more Israeli hostages as planned, paving the way toward resolving a major dispute over the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Hamas had threatened to delay the next release of captives, accusing Israel of failing to meet its obligations to allow in tents and shelters, among other alleged violations of the truce. Israel, with the support of U.S. President Donald Trump, had threatened to renew its offensive if hostages were not freed. There was no immediate comment from Israel on Hamas’ announcement, but it should allow the ceasefire to continue for now, though the future of the truce remains in doubt. Hamas said its delegation held talks in Cairo with Egyptian officials and was in contact with Qatar’s prime minister about bringing into Gaza more shelters, medical supplies, fuel and heavy equipment for clearing rubble — its key demand in recent days. It said in a statement that the mediators had pledged to 'remove all hurdles.' Shortly after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou confirmed to The Associated Press by phone that three hostages will be released on Saturday. Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV, which is close to the country’s security services, reported that Egypt and Qatar had succeeded in resolving the dispute. The two Arab countries have served as key mediators with Hamas and helped broker the ceasefire, which took effect in January, more than 15 months into the war. Egyptian media also aired footage showing trucks carrying temporary housing and bulldozers on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing with Gaza. They reported that the trucks were heading to an Israeli inspection area before crossing into Gaza. Trump has introduced more uncertainty The truce faces a much bigger challenge in the coming weeks. The first phase is set to conclude at the beginning of March, and there have not yet been substantive negotiations over the second phase, in which Hamas would release dozens of remaining hostages in return for an end to the war. Trump's proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and settle them in other countries has thrown the truce’s future into further doubt. The plan has been welcomed by Israel but vehemently rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries, which have refused to accept any influx of refugees. Human rights groups say it could amount to a war crime under international law. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right allies are already calling for a resumption of the war after the first phase with the goal of implementing Trump’s plan and annihilating Hamas, which remains in control of the territory after surviving one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. More than half have been released in deals with Hamas or other agreements, eight have been rescued and dozens of bodies have been recovered. The captives are among the only bargaining chips Hamas has left, and it may be difficult to get the group to commit to further releases if it believes the war will resume. Trump has given mixed signals about what he wants to see in Gaza. He took credit for brokering the ceasefire, which was reached days before he took office after more than a year of negotiations under the Biden administration. But he has also expressed misgivings about how the agreement is unfolding and says it’s up to Israel whether to resume the war or not, while pledging continued U.S. military support. Seventy-three hostages have not yet been released, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Nearly all the remaining hostages are men, including Israeli soldiers. The war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israel’s offensive has obliterated large parts of Gaza. At its height, the fighting had displaced 90% of the territory’s population of 2.3 million. Hundreds of thousands have returned to their homes since the ceasefire took hold, though many have found only mounds of rubble and buried human remains and unexploded ordnance. A ‘new war’ would likely be far worse Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, echoing Trump, said Wednesday that 'all hell will break loose' if Hamas stops releasing hostages. He said a 'new Gaza war' wouldn’t end until Hamas was defeated, which would allow for Trump’s vision of mass displacement to be carried out. With far fewer hostages remaining in Gaza, Israel's military would have more freedom to act. It would also face far fewer constraints from the United States, its main military patron. The Biden administration, while providing crucial military and diplomatic support, had occasionally pressed Israel to allow in more aid and at one point suspended some weapons shipments. It had also said there should be no permanent displacement of Gaza's Palestinian population. Trump has lifted restrictions on arms transfers, and his administration is pressing ahead with the sale of $7 billion worth of weapons approved under President Joe Biden. Trump has said Gaza’s population should be resettled elsewhere in the region, with wealthy Arab countries paying for it. He has suggested that once the fighting ends, Israel would transfer control of Gaza to the United States, which would then redevelop it as the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a key partner in Netanyahu’s fragile governing coalition, has called for a resumption of the war, the 'voluntary migration' of large numbers of Palestinians from Gaza and the reestablishment of Jewish settlements there. ___ Lidman reported from Jerusalem. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-hamas-says-it-will-release-hostages-as-planned-apparently-resolving-ceasefire-dispute/	2025-02-13T08:05:18-08:00
