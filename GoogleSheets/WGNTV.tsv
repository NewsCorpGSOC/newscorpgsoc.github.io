Middle East latest: Hamas frees 3 hostages, Israel releases Pales...	Hamas freed three hostages in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday and Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners in the fourth round of exchanges during the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The six-week phase one truce calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 prisoners, as well as the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory. Israel and Hamas are set next week to begin negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached. Palestinian health authorities in Gaza also announced that the long-shuttered Rafah border crossing with Egypt would reopen on Saturday for thousands of Palestinians who desperately need medical care — a breakthrough that signals the ceasefire agreement continues to gain traction. —— Here's the latest: Family of Bibas rejoice at his freedom TEL AVIV, Israel — The family of Yarden Bibas says 'there are no words to describe the relief of holding Yarden in our hands, embracing him, and hearing his voice,' after his release from Hamas' captivity on Saturday. Bibas, 35, was taken hostage from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oc. 7, 2023. His wife, Shiri, and their two young boys, Ariel and Kfir, were also taken that day and are still captive in Gaza. It is unknown if they are still alive. 'Yarden has returned home, but the home remains incomplete,' the family wrote. 'Yarden is a father who left his safe room to protect his family, bravely survived captivity, and returned to an unbearable reality.' The family said it 'continues with hope' and made a plea to the public to keep pressing for the release of all remaining hostages. Argentinian officials celebrate the release of an Israeli-Argentine hostage JERUSALEM — Argentinian officials are celebrating the release of Israeli-Argentine Yarden Bibas from Hamas captivity after almost 16 months of the war in Gaza. President Javier Milei of Argentina, a staunch supporter of Israel, posted a stream of emotional videos all morning Saturday on X showing Bibas greeting his relatives after his release with long and tearful hugs. The Israeli Embassy in Argentina says that Bibas obtained Argentine citizenship through his wife, Shiri, and their two small children, Ariel and Kfir, are also Argentinian. The condition of Shiri and their two sons, the youngest hostages to be abducted during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, remains unclear. Hamas claimed last year that they had been killed by an Israeli airstrike, but Israeli officials never confirmed that. Axel Wahnish, a Sephardic rabbi and the Argentine ambassador to Israel, said that Argentine authorities were following Bibas’ release in the exchange closely. He expressed hope that 'all the kidnapped people can return safely to their homes.' Wahnish also praised Milei for his strong condemnations of Hamas, which he said stood in contrast to the 'silence of some leaders of the free world.' Released Palestinians describe harsh prison conditions in Israel RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinians who were sentenced to years in prison over deadly attacks against Israelis and released into the occupied West Bank described harsh conditions, beatings and other abuse in prison. Many appeared frail as they reveled in their homecoming on Saturday. Mohammad Kaskus, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison over his militancy during the second Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s, told The Associated Press that he faced beatings and intimidation during interrogations. He said that the food provisions in prison were insufficient, with meager snacks instead of full meals often leaving him hungry. The Israeli Prison Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Another released prisoner, Murad Hmeidan, who was serving a life sentence plus 25 years in a case also related to his involvement in attacks against Israelis, said 'the treatment was extremely bad.' He said that seeing the deaths of fellow prisoners in detention from wounds or illnesses over the years made him feel that 'there is a serious risk to the lives of everyone in Israeli prisons.' The Palestinian Prisoners' Society, an advocacy group, has recorded the deaths 54 Palestinians inside Israeli prison since Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Israel has previously said that military prosecutors are investigating Palestinian deaths in custody and did not offer further comment on Saturday. Arab nations reject Trump’s suggestion to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan CAIRO — Powerful Arab nations have rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan. Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League released a joint statement on Saturday following a meeting of foreign ministers. They said they reject any plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Yarden Bibas seen arriving in Israeli hospital after release from Gaza TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli army released footage of Yarden Bibas arriving at a hospital in central Israel and meeting his mother for the first time after his release earlier Saturday from 15 months of captivity in Gaza. The two are seen locked in a silent embrace. Bibas, 35, returned to Israel without his wife, Shiri Bibas, or his two young sons, Kfir and Ariel, who remain in captivity. Hamas claims the three were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel has not confirmed their deaths but says it is gravely concerned for their welfare. Ariel was 4 years old and Kfir was 9 months old when they were taken with their mother during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza. In a post on X, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed Bibas along with Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegal, who were also freed on Saturday. He added, 'Our thoughts are now with Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas and all our hostages. We will continue to work to bring them home.' Freed hostage Keith Siegel arrives in hospital in Israel JERUSALEM — Newly released hostage Keith Siegel looked frail and appeared to be walking slowly in footage released by the Israeli military shortly after his release from captivity in Gaza. Still, in Associated Press footage the 65-year-old Israeli-American refused a wheelchair upon landing at the hospital where doctors will check his medical condition. Wrapped in an Israeli flag, we waved to people in nearby balconies waving back at him. Siegel was injured in the Hamas attack October 7, 2023, his ribs broken and hand bleeding when he was dragged into Gaza, according to his wife Aviva Siegel, who was taken hostage with him but released in November 2023. Watching the first moments of her husband’s release on television in a southern border community near Gaza as she waited to reunite with him, Aviva Siegel said, 'There he is, Keith, there he is, wow!' 'They’ve put a hat on him!' she exclaimed. Released hostage thanks the Israeli people for their support JERUSALEM - Israel’s military published a photo of recently freed hostage Yarden Bibas in a military helicopter shortly after his release Saturday, holding a sign thanking Israelis for their support. 'I thank all the people of Israel for the support and help. I’ve heard from my family that you fought for me,' read the message Bibas held up to the camera. Bibas, 35, returns to Israel without his wife, Shiri Bibas, or his two boys, Kfir and Ariel, who remain in captivity. The family’s plight — and the two boys with their shocks of ginger hair — have captivated Israelis, and Yarden’s release dims hopes that the three others are alive. Family of Keith Siegal says they can ‘breathe again’ as he returns to Israel JERUSALEM — The family of Keith Siegel said they could breathe again as he returned to Israel after being released by Hamas. Siegel, an American Israeli from North Carolina, was captured from the communal farming village by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023. 'Finally, after 484 long, terrifying days and nights, full of immense worry for our father, we can breathe again,' his family wrote in a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters. Siegel’s family also thanked U.S. President Donald Trump, the American and Israeli governments, and the Israeli military for securing his return. Israel says all 183 Palestinian prisoners set for release are now free RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Israeli Prison Authority says that all 183 Palestinian prisoners slated for release on Saturday have been freed. Most of them, including 111 arrested after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, were released to Gaza. Just over two dozen returned to cheering crowds in the occupied West Bank. Another seven serving life sentences were transferred to Egypt ahead of their deportation. That concludes the fourth prisoner-for-hostage swap in the six-week initial phase of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Sick and wounded children leave Gaza for treatment as border crossing reopens RAFAH CROSSING, Egypt — A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing to Egypt for treatment through Gaza’s Rafah crossing on Saturday, in the first opening of the border since Israel captured it nearly nine months ago. The reopening of the Rafah crossing represents a significant breakthrough that bolsters the ceasefire deal Israel and Hamas agreed to earlier this month. Israel agreed to reopen the crossing after Hamas released the last living female hostages in Gaza. Egyptian television showed an Palestinian Red Cross ambulance pulling up to the crossing gate, and several children were brought out on stretchers and transferred to ambulances on the Egyptian side. Prisoners released by Israel include aid worker jailed in controversial case RAMALLAH, West Bank — One of the most prominent Palestinians being released on Saturday is aid worker Mohammed el-Halabi, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison in a high-profile case that drew criticism from rights groups. El-Halabi had worked as the Palestinian manager of the Gaza branch of World Vision, a major Christian aid organization. He was was arrested in 2016 and accused of diverting tens of millions of dollars to Hamas. Both el-Halabi, 47, and World Vision vigorously denied the allegations and independent investigations found no proof of wrongdoing. Rights groups say el-Halabi was denied a fair and transparent trial, as he and World Vision had no chance to review the evidence against them. His prolonged detention sent a chill through nongovernmental groups providing aid to Palestinians in Gaza. Israel begins freeing Palestinian prisoners OFER MILITARY PRISON, West Bank — Israel has begun freeing 183 Palestinian prisoners due for release after Hamas freed three hostages as part of the ceasefire deal that has halted 15 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip. A bus departed Ofer Military Prison with some 32 prisoners headed for the West Bank. About 150 other prisoners were being sent to Gaza or deported. According to Palestinian authorities, a total of 183 Palestinian prisoners are to be released, including dozens serving lengthy or life sentences and 111 people from the Gaza Strip who were arrested after Oct. 7, 2023, and held without trial. Palestinian Authority says Israel will begin releasing Palestinians held without trial after Oct. 7 attack RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Palestinian Authority’s commission of prisoners’ affairs says that a total of 183 Palestinian prisoners are slated for release Saturday in exchange for the three Israeli hostages held in Gaza. In a sign that the ceasefire agreement is progressing, this release departs from the previous formula of 30 Palestinian prisoners for each Israeli hostage to include more Palestinian detainees who were rounded up in Gaza after the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that began the war. As part of the ceasefire deal, Israel has agreed to release about 1,000 Palestinians from Gaza who were detained on suspicion of militancy and have been held without trial since the day after the Oct. 7 attack. The Palestinian Authority said that on Saturday, Israel will release 111 of these Palestinians from Gaza on the condition that they did not participate in the Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7, 2023, the first of what will be several such releases staggered over the six weeks of the Phase 1 ceasefire deal. The other 72 Palestinians set to be released Saturday were serving long or life sentences on national security charges connected to their involvement in deadly attacks against Israelis. Of that group, 32 hail from the occupied West Bank, where families and friends on Saturday were anxiously awaiting their return, and another 39 come from Gaza. Seven of the prisoners serving life sentences will be transferred to Egypt before further deportation under the terms of the ceasefire agreement. Freed hostage reunites with father and sister TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military published footage of released hostage Yarden Bibas reuniting with his father and sister at a military base outside of Gaza, where he is undergoing initial medical checks immediately after entering Israel. He closed his eyes as his father, Eli, and sister Ofri hugged him fiercely. 'Sweetheart,' his father said, as the family embraced and cried. Bibas, 35, is the father of the two youngest hostages in Gaza, whose plight has become a rallying cry for Israelis. The Bibas sons — 4 years old and 9 months old at the time of their abduction — and their mother, Shiri, are still in captivity, and feared dead. Shiri Bibas and the two children are the last woman and children held in captivity in Gaza who have not been confirmed dead by Israel. In November 2023, Yarden Bibas was filmed by Hamas as he was told that Shiri Bibas and the children were kidnapped and killed in an Israeli airstrike. In the video, filmed under duress, Yarden is sobbing and pleading with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring their bodies to Israel for burial. Israel dismissed the video as 'psychological terror' and said there was no concrete information about the status of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas, but there have been no signs of life from the three in the past year. Siegel returns to Israel Israel confirmed that American Israeli hostage Keith Siegel had crossed the border from Gaza after being handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross at a ceremony in Gaza City. The Israeli military said in a statement that he was headed to a reception point at a military base, where he would be met by family members before heading to a hospital. Family of French Israeli hostage celebrates his return PARIS — The family of Ofer Kalderon said they were 'overwhelmed with joy, relief and emotion' after his release by Hamas. Kalderon, a 54-year-old French-Israeli citizen, was one of three male hostages released Saturday as part of a ceasefire deal that halted fighting in Gaza after more than 15 months of war. Kalderon was kidnapped by Hamas from the Nir Oz kibbutz on Oct. 7, along with his daughter Sahar and son Erez. The children were released in November 2023 during a temporary ceasefire. 'Today, we finally embrace Ofer, seeing and truly comprehending that he is here with us,' his family said in a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters. 'We have witnessed how, through extraordinary mental strength, he survived this hell. Ofer endured months in a nightmare, and we are proud of his ability to survive and hold onto the hope of embracing his children again.' The family added a note of support for the remaining hostages still being held by Hamas. 'In the midst of this emotional moment, we must remember all the hostages who remain behind. We have no right to stop until all 79 hostages return home — whether for rehabilitation or for burial,' the family said. Kibbutz members cheer as their neighbor is released There were sighs of relief and cheers in the living room where members of Kibbutz Kfar Aza watched Hamas militants hand over hostage Keith Siegel to the Red Cross. Siegel, an American Israeli from North Carolina, was captured from the communal farming village by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023. His neighbors gathered anxiously in front of the television as they watched footage of Siegel, looking thin, emerging from a vehicle and walking through a crowd in Gaza city, flanked by Hamas militants. Many of those in the room were family friends. They applauded upon seeing Siegel’s face. Some teared up. Siegel is one of the highest-profile hostages, now a household name in Israel after his wife Aviva Siegel, also captured in the Hamas attack, mounted a public campaign to bring him home after her own release from captivity in November 2023. Hamas hands over U.S.-Israeli hostage Hamas has handed American Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, 65, over to the Red Cross, the third hostage to be released Saturday as part of a ceasefire deal with Israel. Siegel walked onto a stage set up by the sea in Gaza City before militants handed him over to waiting Red Cross officials. Earlier, the militants released Yarden Bibas, 35, and French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54, to the Red Cross in similar scenes in the town of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. All three had been abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war. Macron hails release of French citizen French President Emmanuel Macron has hailed the release of French-Israeli citizen Ofer Kalderon, while noting that another French citizen remains a hostage. 'Ofer Kalderon is free! We share the immense relief and joy of his family after 483 days of unimaginable hell,' Macron posted on X. Our thoughts are with Ohad Yahalomi, still in the hands of Hamas, and his family. France is doing everything in its power to secure his immediate release.' Red Cross vehicles arrive in Gaza City for planned hostage release Red Cross vehicles have arrived in Gaza City where Hamas is set to release American Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, 65, as part of the fourth round of hostage releases in its ceasefire deal with Israel. Two other hostages — Yarden Bibas, 35, and French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54 — were released earlier Saturday in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. In return for the three, Israel is to release dozens of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-2-freed-hostages-are-back-in-israel/	2025-02-01T07:16:10-08:00	
Middle East latest: Militants in Gaza release 8 Thai and Israeli ...	Militants in the Gaza Strip released eight hostages on Thursday, handing them over to the Red Cross amid chaotic crowds as part of a swap that is set to see 110 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons later in the day. Agam Berger, a 20-year-old soldier, was handed over first at a site in the heavily destroyed urban refugee camp of Jabaliya in northern Gaza, followed hours later by two more Israelis and five Thai farm workers who were handed over amid a chaotic crowd in the city of Khan Younis. It's the third such exchange since a ceasefire took hold in the Gaza Strip earlier this month. The tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is aimed at ending the war in Gaza and securing the release of dozens of hostages held by the militant group, as well as hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned or detained by Israel. Under the ceasefire, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have jubilantly returned to northern Gaza over the past three days. However, their homecoming has been bittersweet as nearly everyone has friends or relatives who died, and many northern neighborhoods have been transformed into an apocalyptic landscape of devastation by more than 15 months of war. ___ Here's the latest: Israeli president thanks Thai government for support JERUSALEM — Israel’s president thanked the Thai government for its support as he met with the Thai ambassador Thursday, ahead of the release of five Thai hostages from captivity in Gaza. The Thai government confirmed Thursday that five Thai hostages were released from Gaza. The hostages, who were pulled from the farming communities in southern Israel where they worked as agricultural laborers on Oct. 7, 2023, were among 31 Thais taken by Hamas. President Isaac Herzog said in a statement posted to X that he told Pannabha Chandraramya, the ambassador of Thailand to Israel, that 'the people of Israel are very moved by the release of our Thai brothers from the hell of captivity.' He thanked the Thai government for its support and vowed to continue trying to secure the release of Thai hostages who remain in Gaza. Twenty-three others were already released. Another two have been confirmed dead, and the status of one remaining person is not clear. Netanyahu puts Palestinian prisoners’ release on hold Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has put the release of Palestinian prisoners on hold until the 'safe release' of hostages is assured after a chaotic handover in Gaza. Netanyahu demanded that mediators intervene after some hostages released Thursday were led through a rowdy crowd of thousands by masked militants. Israel was supposed to release 110 Palestinian prisoners later Thursday, including around 30 serving life sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis. Agam Berger reunites with family at military base TEL AVIV, Israel — 'We’re here and we’re never leaving you,' Agam Berger’s mother, Merav, told her daughter in the moments of their initial reunion on Israeli soil after Agam’s release on Thursday from Hamas captivity. Berger, 20, was among five young female soldiers abducted when militants overran the Nahal Oz military base in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killing over 60 soldiers there. The other four were released Saturday. The family was reunited at a specially prepared reception area in a military base near the Gaza border. A pale looking Berger wiped away tears as she sat on her mother’s lap and held her father’s hand, as seen in footage released by the Israeli army. From the military base, Berger was flown to a hospital in central Israel, where she will meet her fellow released soldiers. Netanyahu condemns chaos during the release of hostages TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the chaotic scenes at the site of a second hostage release in Gaza on Thursday. Seven hostages were handed over to the Red Cross in Khan Younis and were then transferred to Israeli forces, the Israeli military said. Their release was delayed after armed militants struggled to contain the large Palestinian crowds that gathered around the Red Cross cars. The hostages were eventually led through the crowd surrounded by a ring of gunmen. 'I view with utmost severity the shocking scenes during the release of our hostages,' Netanyahu said in a statement released by his office shortly after the handover was completed. He said he 'demands that the mediators make certain that such terrible scenes do not recur and guarantee the safety of our hostages.' Israeli Red Cross says it has received 7 more hostages JERUSALEM — The Israeli army said the Red Cross has reported receiving seven more hostages, including two Israelis and five Thais, hours after an Israeli soldier was handed over at another location. Israel protests chaotic scenes surrounded hostage release JERUSALEM — Israeli officials have filed an angry complaint to international mediators over chaotic scenes surrounding the release of hostages. An Israeli official confirmed the protest, speaking on condition of anonymity because the release was still taking place. Militants lead second hostage through crowd ahead of release Militants led Israeli hostage Arbel Yehoud through a chaotic crowd in Gaza ahead of her release, hours after Hamas handed a captive Israeli soldier over to the Red Cross in the Gaza Strip. Yehoud was at the center of the dispute about the sequence of releases that briefly rocked the ceasefire over the weekend. Israel says she was supposed to have been freed Saturday and delayed the opening of crossings to northern Gaza when she was not. Israelis watch anxiously as friend nears departure from Gaza CARMEI GAT, Israel — A group of friends of Arbel Yehoud, a hostage set to be released Thursday, watched in tears and worried silence as the Israeli hostage appeared to be freed, surrounded by a large crowd of Palestinians. The friends sat in anxious silence at a private home in southern Israel as they watched a TV showing the large crowd of Palestinians gathered at the release point in Gaza. Some cried, others had their hands over their eyes or mouths. When a news anchor said the situation appeared dangerous, one yelled at her to 'shut up.' People began crying when Yehoud was seen walking through the crowd, escorted by gunmen, followed by reports that she had been turned over to the Red Cross. Most of the 20 or so people were survivors of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, including three former hostages released in a November 2023 ceasefire. The Associated Press was granted access to the event. Thai ambassador says she's ‘holding her breath’ BEER YAAKOV, Israel — Thailand’s ambassador to Israel said she was 'holding her breath' along with the entire country of Israel for the release of five Thai agricultural workers who were kidnapped on Oct. 7. 'We have nothing to do with this conflict, they just happened to be there, and they are working tirelessly on the farms and kibbutzes,' said Ambassador Pannabha Chandraramya as she watched footage from Gaza at the Israeli hospital where the Thai workers will be brought upon their return to Israel. She added that despite the war, Thai agricultural workers are continuing to come to Israel. Prior to the attack, less than 30,000 Thai workers were in Israel, mostly in the agricultural sector, and that number has grown to 38,000 today. Chandraramya said the Thai government had notified the families of all six surviving Thai hostages, because they are not sure which five will be released. The bodies of another two Thai hostages who were killed on Oct. 7, 2023 are also being held in Gaza. The Shamir Medical Center, outside of Tel Aviv, has a number of Thai-speaking social workers and psychologists to assist the hostages being released. Emir of Qatar meets with Syria's new interim leader DAMASCUS — The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, visited Syria on Thursday and met with newly installed interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa. He was the first head of state to visit Syria since the fall of former President Bashar Assad in a lighting rebel offensive last month. Qatari Minister of State Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al Khulaifi told journalists that the wealthy Gulf country 'will continue to provide the required support at all economic and service levels, as well as in terms of infrastructure and electricity' to Syria. Qatar had cut off relations with Damascus and backed rebel groups seeking to overthrow Assad in Syria’s nearly 14-year civil war. On Wednesday, the Syrian factions that toppled Assad named al-Sharaa, an Islamist former rebel leader who headed the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham militant group, as the country‘s interim president. Qatar was among the first countries to welcome al-Sharaa’s appointment. Israel says it intercepted Hezbollah surveillance drone JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it has intercepted a surveillance drone launched toward Israeli airspace by the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah reached a ceasefire in late November that ended some 14 months of fighting. Under the deal, both sides were to withdraw forces from southern Lebanon within 60 days. The deadline passed this week with Israeli troops still in Lebanon. But the U.S. said the sides had agreed to extend the ceasefire through Feb. 18 while Israel continues its withdrawal. Israel and Hezbollah have repeatedly accused each other of violating the deal. Red Cross arrives at site of second hostage handover KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Red Cross vehicles arrived at a location in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis where hostages are set to be released. The second handover site is in front of the destroyed home of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Hundreds of militants from Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group arrived earlier with a convoy in a show of force, and thousands of people gathered to watch, some from the tilted rooftops of bombed-out buildings. Israeli soldier Agam Berger released in Gaza Strip DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Hamas handed captive Israeli soldier Agam Berger over to the Red Cross at a ceremony in the heavily destroyed urban refugee camp of Jabaliya in northern Gaza. Berger, 20, was abducted alongside four other female soldiers, who were freed on Saturday. At a gathering in Tel Aviv, people cheered, clapped and whistled as they saw images of Berger being released on a TV screen, next to a large clock that’s counted the days the hostages have been in captivity. Some held signs saying 'Agam we’re waiting for you at home.' A short time later, Israel confirmed that Berger was with its military. Red Cross arrives at site of hostage release DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Red Cross vehicles arrived at the northern refugee camp of Jabaliya, where hundreds of masked militants and onlookers had gathered ahead of a planned release of hostages held in Gaza. Hamas set up two locations for the release, one in Jabaliya and the other in the southern city of Khan Younis in front of the destroyed home of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Video shows hostages set to be released JERUSALEM — The Islamic Jihad militant group has released a brief video of two hostages set to be released Thursday as part of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The video, without sound, shows Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Gadi Moses, 80, smiling and embracing one another. They were among scores of people abducted in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war. Islamic Jihad is a smaller and more extreme militant group allied with Hamas. It took part in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack. Mother of Thai hostage hears he's about to be freed BANGKOK — Khammee Lamnao, the mother of Thai hostage Surasak Lamnau, said the Thai embassy in Israel had called her Wednesday to let her know her son was one of the five who were to be released. 'I cannot wait to see my son,' the 53-year-old said. 'I’ve been waiting for him.' Surasak had been working in the agricultural sector in Israel for 15 months when he was taken hostage during the October 2023 attack. Thirty-one Thai nationals are believed to have been taken hostage when Hamas attacked Israel in October, 2023. Of those, 23 have been released, and two of the remaining hostages have been confirmed dead. Five surviving hostages are due to be released, and it is not clear at the moment what the status of the sixth person is. There were about 30,000 Thai workers — mostly laborers in the agricultural sector — in Israel prior to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, when militants stormed through a border fence and killed hundreds of Israelis and foreign nationals, including 41 Thai workers. At least 7,000 Thai workers are known to have returned home on government evacuation flights, but many others decided to stay for the opportunity to earn wages far higher than at home. Who's set to be released today? DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — The Israelis set to be released are Agam Berger, 20, a female soldier; Arbel Yehoud, a 29-year-old civilian woman; and Gadi Moses, an 80-year-old man. The names of the Thai hostages who were set to be freed were not released. Yehoud was at the center of the dispute about the sequence of releases that briefly rocked the ceasefire over the weekend. Israel says she was supposed to have been freed Saturday and delayed the opening of crossings to northern Gaza when she was not. Berger was abducted alongside four other female soldiers, who were freed on Saturday. Of the 110 people set to be released from prisons in Israel, 30 are serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis. Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent former militant leader and theater director who took part in a dramatic jailbreak in 2021 before being rearrested days later, is also among those set to be released. Ceasefire holds for now but next phase will be harder DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Today's exchange is part of a deal that paused fighting in Gaza on Jan. 19. Israeli forces have pulled back from most of Gaza, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remains of their homes and humanitarian groups to surge assistance. It calls for Hamas to release a total of 33 hostages, including women, children, older adults and sick or wounded men, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the hostages to be released in this phase are dead. The initial Phase One ceasefire paused fighting for six weeks, calling for the sides to use that time to negotiate a second phase in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages and the ceasefire would continue indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached. Negotiating a phase two deal could be difficult. Hamas says it won’t release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, after reasserting its rule over Gaza within hours of the truce. Meanwhile, Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, and a key far-right partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition is already calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase. ___ Corrects that 41, not 38, Thai workers were killed during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack and its aftermath.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-hostages-and-prisoners-set-to-be-released-as-ceasefire-holds/	2025-01-30T05:43:00-08:00	
Hamas frees 8 more hostages but Israel puts prisoner release on h...	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas-led militants freed eight hostages on Thursday as part of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, but the chaotic handover of some of the captives, who were shuttled through a rowdy crowd of thousands by masked militants, drew an angry protest from Israel. Israel was supposed to release 110 Palestinian prisoners later in the day, including around 30 serving life sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that was put on hold until the 'safe release' of hostages can be assured and called on mediators to intervene. Hamas released seven of the hostages in front of the destroyed home of its slain leader, Yahya Sinwar, as thousands pressed in. Hamas called it a 'message of determination,' but it triggered the latest in a series of disputes that have sent U.S. and Arab mediators scrambling to patch up the truce. The ceasefire is aimed at eventually ending the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas, and securing the release of dozens of hostages abducted in the militant group's Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. A show of force as hostages are released The first hostage — female soldier Agam Berger, 20 — was released after Hamas paraded her in front of a smaller crowd in the heavily destroyed urban Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza. Hours later, a chaotic scene unfolded at a handover of the other seven in the southern city of Khan Younis. Hundreds of militants from Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group arrived with a convoy, and thousands of people gathered to watch, some from the tilted rooftops of bombed-out buildings. Footage showed hostage Arbel Yehoud, 29, looking stunned as masked militants hustled her through the shouting crowd, pushing people back. Also released were Gadi Moses, an 80-year-old Israeli man, and five Thai laborers, identified by Israel as Watchara Sriaoun, 33; Pongsak Tanna, 36; Sathian Suwankam, 35; Bannawat Seathao, 27; and Surasak Lamnau, 32. A number of foreign workers were taken along with dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers during Hamas’ attack. Twenty-three Thais were among more than 100 hostages released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israel says three Thais remain in captivity, two of whom are believed to be dead. Yehoud had been at the center of a dispute earlier this week over the sequence in which the hostages would be released. The United States, Egypt and Qatar, which brokered the ceasefire after a year of tough negotiations, resolved it with an agreement that Yehoud would be released with the others on Thursday. About 20 friends of Yehoud gathered in southern Israel watched as the tense scene unfolded on live television. Some cried. Others had their hands over their eyes or mouths. The crowd then burst into tears after she was turned over to the Red Cross. Netanyahu condemned the 'shocking scenes' and called on international mediators to ensure the safety of hostages in future releases. Ceasefire holds for now but next phase will be harder In the first phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is set to release a total of 33 Israeli hostages, including women, children, older adults and sick or wounded men, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the hostages to be released in this phase are dead. Among those set to be released from prisons is Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent former militant leader and theater director who took part in a dramatic jailbreak in 2021 before being rearrested days later. Palestinians have cheered the release of the prisoners, who they widely see as heroes who have sacrificed for the cause of ending Israel’s decades-long occupation of lands they want for a future state. Israeli forces have meanwhile pulled back from most of Gaza, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remains of their homes and humanitarian groups to surge assistance. The deal calls for Israel and Hamas to negotiate a second phase in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages and the ceasefire would continue indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached. Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the truce. A key far-right partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition is already calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase. Hamas says it won't release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Tens of thousands killed Hamas started the war when it sent thousands of fighters storming into Israel. The militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Israel’s ensuing air and ground war was among the deadliest and most destructive in decades. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants. The Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence, and that it went to great lengths to try to spare civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in dense residential neighborhoods and put military infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques. The Israeli offensive has transformed entire neighborhoods into mounds of gray rubble, and it’s unclear how or when anything will be rebuilt. Around 90% of Gaza’s population has been displaced, often multiple times, with hundreds of thousands of people living in squalid tent camps or shuttered schools. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

A Russian drone strikes an apartment building in Ukraine, killing...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian drone blasted a hole in an apartment building in northeastern Ukraine during a nighttime attack, killing at least four people and injuring nine others, officials said Thursday. The Shahed drone blew out a wall and surrounding windows in the apartment block in Sumy, a major city, just after 1 a.m., the Sumy regional administration said. Four people were rescued from the rubble, and a child was among the injured, it said, adding that 120 people were evacuated. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it 'a terrible tragedy, a terrible Russian crime.' The war between Russia and Ukraine, which enters its fourth year next month and shows no signs of ending, has killed more than 10,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the United Nations. Civilians have also endured hardship caused by Russian attacks on the power grid that have denied them heating and running water. Many have been evacuated from areas along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line where Ukrainian defenses are straining to hold the bigger Russian army at bay. The fighting has been especially fierce in recent times in the eastern Donetsk region, which Russian forces partly occupy and appear bent on capturing completely in coming months. A Russian artillery strike on the Donetsk city of Kramatorsk injured eight people, including two young children, Donetsk regional head Vadym Filashkin wrote on his Telegram channel Thursday. 'Anyone who still remains in the Donetsk region is putting themselves in mortal danger,' Filashkin said. 'Take care of yourself! Evacuate.' Russia launched more than 80 drones at Ukraine overnight, the air force reported, in what are common nighttime barrages. Most of the drones were shot down or stopped by electronic jamming, it said. In Ukraine’s southern Odesa region, Russian drones damaged a hospital and two apartment buildings, regional head Oleh Kiper wrote on Telegram. No one was injured, he said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-a-russian-drone-strikes-an-apartment-building-in-ukraine-killing-at-least-4/	2025-01-30T04:12:52-08:00	
How did so many Thai farmers end up held hostage by Hamas?	BANGKOK (AP) — Five Thai nationals held hostage by Hamas since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel were released on Thursday. They were among 31 Thais taken by the militant group, of whom 23 have already been released. Another two have been confirmed dead, and the status of one remaining person is not clear. According to Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 46 Thais have been killed during the conflict, including the two who died in Hamas captivity. They were among tens of thousands of Thai workers in Israel. Here’s a look at what they were doing there. Why are there so many Thais in Israel? Israel once relied heavily on Palestinian workers, but it started bringing in large numbers of migrant workers after the 1987-93 Palestinian revolt known as the first Intifada. Most came from Thailand, and Thais remain the largest group of foreign agricultural laborers in Israel today, earning considerably more than they can at home. Thailand and Israel implemented a bilateral agreement a decade ago to ease the way for workers in the agriculture sector. Israel has come under criticism for the conditions under which the Thai farm laborers work. In a 2015 report, Human Rights Watch said they often were housed in makeshift and inadequate accommodations and 'were paid salaries significantly below the legal minimum wage, forced to work long hours in excess of the legal maximum, subjected to unsafe working conditions and denied their right to change employers.' A watchdog group found more recently that most were still paid below the legal minimum wage. How many Thais work in Israel? There were about 30,000 Thai workers, primarily working on farms, in Israel prior to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas. In the wake of the attack, some 7,000 returned home, primarily on government evacuation flights, but higher wages have continued to attract new arrivals. Thai ambassador to Israel Pannabha Chandraramya said Thursday that there are now more than 38,000 Thai workers in the country. What happened after they left? Faced with a labor shortage in the wake of the exodus after the Hamas attack, Israel’s Agriculture Ministry announced incentives to try and attract foreign workers back to evacuated areas. Among other things, it offered to extend work visas and to pay bonuses of about $500 a month. Thailand's Labor Ministry granted 3,966 Thai workers permission to work in Israel in 2024, keeping Israel in the top four destinations for Thais working abroad last year. Thai migrant workers generally come from poorer regions of the country, especially the northeast, and even before the bonuses the jobs in Israel paid many times what they could make at home. ___ Chalida Ekvitthayavechnukul contributed to this story.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-how-did-so-many-thai-farmers-end-up-held-hostage-by-hamas/	2025-01-30T03:32:43-08:00	
Hamas will free 3 Israelis and 5 Thais in next hostage release Th...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Hamas will release three Israelis, including two women and an 80-year-old man, as well as five Thai nationals during the next hostage release set for Thursday, Israel and Hamas said Wednesday as their tenuous ceasefire moves ahead. The Israeli women are Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Agam Berger, 20, and the man is Gadi Moses. The identities of the Thai nationals were not immediately known. A number of foreign workers were taken captive along with dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack that set off the war in Gaza. Twenty-three Thai hostages were released in the first ceasefire in November 2023. Israel says eight remain. Thursday's release would keep up the momentum of the ceasefire that began earlier this month and paused the 15-month war in Gaza. Hamas is releasing hostages in phases in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The prisoners range from individuals detained over minor offenses in recent months to senior militants serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks on Israeli civilians. Some have been held without charge or trial. Hostages and prisoners will be released twice this week The deal had been negotiated for months under the Biden administration but was finally sealed after incoming President Donald Trump threatened there would be 'hell to pay' if the hostages weren't returned. Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Israel on Wednesday and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who heads to Washington next week as the first foreign leader to meet Trump in his second term. The White House meeting on Feb. 4 comes a day after talks on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, aimed at ending the war, are meant to resume. Thursday's hostage release wasn't originally scheduled but came as a result of a standoff between Israel and Hamas over the identities of the hostages released last weekend. Israel had demanded that Yehoud, a civilian, be part of that group. When she wasn't freed, it held up the return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to war-battered northern Gaza. International mediation efforts brought about the plan for an additional release on Thursday and cleared the way for Palestinians to stream north. Another release occurs Saturday, which Netanyahu's office said would free male hostages. Dozens of Palestinian prisoners are set to be freed both Thursday and Saturday. Among the prisoners slated for release Thursday is Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent former militant leader and theater director whose dramatic jailbreak in 2021 thrilled Palestinians and stunned the Israeli security establishment. Egypt rejects Trump's suggestion that it take in Palestinians The pause in fighting has exposed the vastness of the destruction to Gaza's urban landscape, prompting Trump's suggestion over the weekend that neighboring Jordan and Egypt take in displaced Palestinians so that 'we just clean out that whole thing,' calling the territory 'a demolition site.' Egypt and Jordan, important U.S. allies, have rejected the suggestion, defying a U.S. president who has shown little patience for dissent from international partners. The Palestinians also rejected it amid fears it would undermine the notion of Palestinian statehood. In his first public comments on the issue, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi on Wednesday called the idea 'an injustice' and said the transfer of Palestinians 'can’t ever be tolerated or allowed.' He said the solution is the establishment of a Palestinian state. Trump has said he would urge the leaders of both countries, which are major recipients of U.S. aid, to accept the idea, saying the resettlement could be temporary or long term. It is not clear if Trump could force Egypt or Jordan to agree, but he has threatened hefty tariffs against other American allies to get his way. Egypt and Jordan receive billions of dollars in American aid each year. Military assistance to Egypt and Israel was exempted from a U.S. funding freeze to global aid programs. Palestinians fear they may never return if they leave The war has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their count. The fighting has obliterated vast areas of Gaza, displacing some 90% of its 2.3 million population, often multiple times. During its attack, Hamas took 250 people hostage and killed roughly 1,200. The theme of displacement has been recurrent in Palestinian history, and the idea of staying on one's land is integral to the Palestinian identity. Palestinians fear that if they leave, they may never be allowed to return. Those fears have been compounded by far-right members of Israel's government who support rebuilding Jewish settlements in Gaza, from which Israel withdrew troops and settlers from in 2005. Netanyahu says that idea is unrealistic. Egypt and Jordan have each made peace with Israel but support the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem. They fear that the permanent displacement of Gaza’s population could make that impossible. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Middle East latest: 2 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in occu...	The Palestinian Health Ministry says two Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in the occupied West Bank overnight and into Wednesday. A 23-year-old man was shot dead in Tulkarem and a 25-year-old man was killed in a strike on Jenin, where Israel launched a large operation earlier this month. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its reports. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip ignited the war there. The ministry says over 800 Palestinians have been killed. Most appear to have been militants killed in battle during Israeli arrest raids, but the dead also include people killed during violent protests, as well as civilian bystanders. There has also been an uptick in settler violence against Palestinians and Palestinian attacks on Israelis since the start of the war. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. ___ Here's the latest: Kremlin says Russian visit to Syria was important for building dialogue MOSCOW — Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that a Russian delegation’s visit to Damascus the day before, the first since the fall of former President Bashar Assad, an ally of Russia, was 'an important trip' for building dialogue with Syrian authorities. Peskoy refused to comment on reports that the Syrian authorities demanded that Moscow pay some kind of compensation to Syria or on unnamed sources claiming another demand was to extradite Assad, who fled to Russia and was granted asylum there. 'I am leaving this without any comment. We will continue the dialogue with the Syrian authorities,' Peskov said in a response to a reporter's question. Syrian state-run news agency SANA reported Wednesday that the discussions had included 'Russia’s role in rebuilding trust with the Syrian people through concrete measures such as reparations, reconstruction and recovery.' It said the talks were also on 'transitional justice mechanisms aimed at ensuring accountability and justice for the victims of the brutal war waged by the Assad regime.' Israeli authorities say they arrested 12 Palestinians in east Jerusalem JERUSALEM — Israeli authorities say they have arrested 12 Palestinians in east Jerusalem who celebrated the release of prisoners under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal. Israel’s internal Shin Bet security service and the police said they arrested the men late Tuesday after videos taken earlier in the week showed the men celebrating the release of the prisoners by waving Hamas flags and firing guns into the air. They say the Palestinians who celebrated the release had violated the ban on 'expressions of joy' and 'identification with Hamas' that Israel has imposed since the ceasefire took hold. They said a search revealed Hamas flags, posters, fireworks, a BB gun and cash. Under the first phase of the deal, Hamas is releasing 33 hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war in exchange for the release for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including some serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. Palestinians generally view the prisoners as heroes imprisoned for fighting against Israel’s decades-long occupation of lands they want for a future state.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-2-palestinians-killed-by-israeli-fire-in-occupied-west-bank-officials-say/	2025-01-29T03:40:35-08:00	
Western officials warn Ukraine over weapons procurement dispute	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Western officials have warned Ukraine that an escalating rift between the defense minister and procurement chief may jeopardize trust in the country and urged the government to resolve the situation quickly so as not to disrupt weapons supplies. The conflict began last week when the Defense Procurement Agency’s board unanimously voted to extend director Maryna Bezrukova’s contract for another year. However, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov overruled the decision, refusing to renew her contract. He accused her of poor performance and failing to deliver weapons and ammunition to front-line troops. The decision provoked an outcry from lawmakers and anti-corruption watchdogs who said the minister's move was illegal because Bezrukova had her contract extended by the agency’s supervisory board in January. They also came to Bezrukova’s defense, saying she has been instrumental in creating greater transparency and reforms within the DPA, which has long faced corruption allegations. Under Ukrainian law, Umerov’s decision to go ahead with her dismissal is illegal. The incident comes at a politically sensitive time for Ukraine as the country’s leadership is eagerly watching the Trump administration’s next moves, and as Ukrainian troops continue to face challenges in holding the line in the east amid fierce Russian attacks. In a statement posted Monday on social media platform X, the ambassadors representing Group of Seven nations urged the government to resolve the situation 'expeditiously and focus on keeping defense procurement going.' 'Consistency with good governance principles and NATO recommendations is important to maintain the trust of the public and international partners,' they said. Following Umerov's decision, the Anti-Corruption Action Center filed a complaint urging the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) to investigate him for alleged abuse of power. Local media reported that NABU opened proceedings against Umerov at the Anti-Corruption Action Center's request. Anastasiia Radina, a lawmaker and head of the Committee on Anti-Corruption Policy, called for Umerov’s dismissal, a decision that ultimately will fall to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 'What I see as a parliamentarian and as an observer is that his actions do not strengthen the agency and its independence. And that is just unacceptable for a country at war,' she told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine exchanged drone barrages overnight in an attempt to strike deeper into their enemy’s territory. The Russian military said Wednesday it intercepted and destroyed 104 Ukrainian drones over nine Russian regions in one of the biggest drone attacks on Russia this year. No casualties or significant damage was reported. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 57 Shahed and other drones overnight. Moscow also attacked with missiles overnight. In southern Mykolaiv, a Russian ballistic missile struck a food enterprise Tuesday night, killing two female workers, regional head Vitalii Kim said. Odesa authorities said Russian drones attacked port infrastructure in the Ismail district of the region that borders NATO member Romania Romania’s Ministry of National Defense said two F-16 fighter jets were dispatched at 3:20 a.m. to monitor airspace for about two hours, and emergency authorities issued text alerts to some residents living in Tulcea county, which is across the Danube river near Ukrainian ports. The ministry condemned the Russian attacks, calling them 'unjustified and in serious contradiction with the norms of international law,' and said NATO allies have been informed. Since the war next door started in February 2022, Romania has reported multiple airspace violations and confirmed drone fragments in its territory on several occasions. ___ Associated Press reporter Stephen McGrath in Sighisoara, Romania contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-western-officials-warn-ukraine-over-weapons-procurement-dispute/	2025-01-29T02:40:16-08:00	
Israeli father says even in Hamas captivity, his daughter heard h...	RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) — For more than 470 days, Eitan Gonen publicly pleaded with his daughter to stay alive while in Hamas captivity. He didn't know if she would hear him, but he ended every interview he gave with the same hopeful message: Romi is coming home alive. When he finally got to speak to his daughter for the first time in 15 months after she and two other women were freed Jan. 19, he got his answer. 'She said, ’Dad, I came home alive,'' Eitan Gonen told The Associated Press on Tuesday in his first interview with an international news outlet since her release. 'I know that my interview back then gave Romi a lot of strength, a lot of hope, something to cling on,' he said. Romi Gonen, 24, was among the first hostages to be freed from Gaza and one of seven women so far released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners as part of the ceasefire, a long and uncertain process aimed at eventually ending the war. Some 250 people were kidnapped during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. About 90 hostages remain in Gaza, although at least a third of them are believed to be dead. During the ceasefire's first phase, Hamas agreed to gradually release 33 hostages in exchange for Israel freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Six more hostages are expected to be released this week in exchange for hundreds of prisoners. Israel has been preparing for the hostages to return, with the expectation that after more than a year in captivity, many would likely be dealing with life-threatening health issues or other physical and psychological problems. This week, Dr. Ami Benov, who is working with the hostages, told reporters that the women were in poor physical condition and would face a lengthy recovery process, as they suffered from 'mild starvation' and vitamin deficiencies. Sitting in a complex in central Israel where his daughter and some of the other freed hostages are staying, Eitan Gonen wouldn't comment on Romi's health but said there's a long road ahead. 'The rehabilitation status just started,' he said. Because she spent so long in captivity, the family isn't pressuring her to speak. Instead, they are trying to give her autonomy and control, and to let her take things at her own pace, he said. Like many others, Romi was taken captive at the Nova music festival. That morning, her sister and mother, Merav Leshem Gonen, spent nearly five hours speaking to Romi as militants marauded through the festival grounds. Romi told her family that she would try to hide in the bushes, as the roads being clogged with abandoned cars made escape impossible. For nearly two months, her family had no idea if she was dead. They only learned she was alive from other hostages who were freed during a weeklong ceasefire a month after the attack, Eitan Gonen said. Praising his daughter's strength, he said she survived in part by learning Arabic, as it was the only way to communicate with her captors. 'Human beings will do anything to survive. Anything. And since the terrorists don’t speak any other language other than Arabic, she didn’t have any chance in order to communicate with them — to start learning their language,' he said, noting that she has even spoken it at times since being freed, likely out of habit. Something else that helped her stay alive was the support from other hostages, Eitan Gonen said. For a period, Romi was held with Emily Damari, a British-Israeli hostage who was released along with her. 'I believe God set it up somehow that Emily and Romi ... had each other to survive. ... It’s a dynamic duo,' he said. Other released hostages expressed similar sentiments about their own time in captivity. Israeli soldier Naama Levy, who was released Saturday, wrote in an Instagram post that after spending 50 days mostly alone, she was given strength when she was reunited with other kidnapped soldiers. Being held hostage with someone can provide strength through a shared fight for survival in the face of unimaginable adversity, said Dr. Einat Yehene, a psychologist who specializes in trauma and loss and who is head of rehabilitation at the Hostages Families Forum. Even though he finally got his daughter back, Eitan Gonen is still urging the Israeli government to keep working to bring home all of the remaining hostages. And he urges the families of hostages to keep giving interviews in all languages and mediums, to maintain the pressure and let their relatives know they haven't been forgotten. But he's mostly focusing on spending time with his daughter. 'I just enjoy being with her even in silence, touching, hugging, watching her,' he said. 'I missed it so much.' ___ Associated Press reporter Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israeli-father-says-even-in-hamas-captivity-his-daughter-heard-his-pleas-to-come-home-alive/	2025-01-29T00:25:24-08:00	
Trump invites Israel's Netanyahu to meet with him at the White Ho...	WADI GAZA, Gaza Strip (AP) — President Donald Trump has invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House next week as the first foreign leader to visit in Trump's second term, Netanhayu and the White House said Tuesday. The announcement came as the United States pressures Israel and Hamas to continue a ceasefire that has paused a devastating 15-month war in Gaza. Talks about the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, which aims to end the war, begin next Monday. The White House letter shared by Netanyahu's office, dated Tuesday, said 'I look forward to discussing how we can bring peace to Israel and its neighbors, and efforts to counter our shared adversaries.' The meeting on Feb. 4 is a chance for Netanyahu, under pressure at home, to remind the world of the support he has received from Trump over the years, and to defend Israel's conduct of the war. Last year, the two men met face-to-face for the first time in nearly four years at Trump’s Florida Mar-a-Lago estate. Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. military aid, and Netanyahu is likely to encourage Trump not to hold up some weapons deliveries the way the Biden administration did, though it continued other deliveries and overall military support. Netanyahu also wants Trump to put more pressure on Iran, and renew efforts to deliver a historic normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a rival of Iran and the Arab world’s most powerful country. Even before taking office this month, Trump was sending his special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region to apply pressure along with the Biden administration to get the current Gaza ceasefire achieved. But Netanyahu has vowed to renew the war if Hamas doesn’t meet his demands in negotiations over the ceasefire's second phase, meant to discuss a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' Over 375,000 return to northern Gaza Under the deal, more than 375,000 Palestinians have crossed into northern Gaza since Israel allowed their return on Monday morning, the United Nations said Tuesday. That represents over a third of the million people who fled in the war’s opening days. Many of the Palestinians trudging along a seaside road or crossing in vehicles after security inspections were getting their first view of shattered northern Gaza under the fragile ceasefire, now in its second week. Trump this week suggested that Egypt and Jordan take in Palestinians from Gaza, at least temporarily, so that 'we just clean out that whole thing' — which Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians swiftly rejected, fearing Israel would never allow a return. Instead, Palestinians were determined to pitch makeshift shelters or sleep outdoors amid the vast piles of broken concrete or perilously leaning buildings. After months of crowding in squalid tent camps or former schools in Gaza’s south, they would finally be home. 'It’s still better for us to be on our land than to live on a land that’s not yours,' said Fayza al-Nahal as she prepared to leave the southern city of Khan Younis for the north. At least two Palestinians set off for the north by sea, crowding into a rowboat with a bicycle and other belongings. Hani Al-Shanti, displaced from Gaza City, looked forward to feeling at peace in whatever he found, 'even if it is a roof and walls without furniture, even if it is without a roof.' One newly returned woman hung laundry in the ruins of her home, its walls blown out. Next steps Under the ceasefire, the next release of hostages held in Gaza, and Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody, is set to occur on Thursday, followed by another exchange on Saturday. In the ceasefire’s six-week first phase, a total of 33 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that ignited the war should be released, along with almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel this week said a list provided by Hamas confirmed the fears that eight of the 33 hostages to be freed are dead, bringing fresh grief to Israeli families who have long pressed the government to reach a deal to bring everyone home before time runs out. On Tuesday, one of the first hostages to be released under the current ceasefire – just the second in the war – shared a glimpse of life in captivity. Naama Levy, 20, wrote on social media that she spent most of the first 50 days alone before being reunited with other soldiers kidnapped from her military base on Oct. 7, well as other civilian captives. 'We strengthened each other until the day of our release, and also afterwards,' she wrote. Aid flows in A surge in humanitarian aid into Gaza continued under the ceasefire. 'In this past week alone, approximately 4,200 trucks carrying aid have entered the Gaza Strip following inspections,' said Israel’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel. Under the deal, 600 trucks of aid are meant to enter per day. The government of Qatar, a mediator in the ceasefire talks, said Tuesday that while complaints have been raised by both sides, no confirmed ceasefire violations have occurred that could cause the agreement to collapse. The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas. Militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 assault and abducted another 250. Israel responded with an air and ground offensive that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Lidman reported from Nahariya, Israel.

Tens of thousands return to shattered northern Gaza for the first...	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Tens of thousands of Palestinians streamed into Gaza’s most heavily destroyed area on Monday under a fragile ceasefire after Israel opened the north for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas. Israel, meanwhile, announced that eight of the hostages to be freed in the weeks ahead are dead. Massive crowds of Palestinians, some holding babies or pushing wheelchairs, walked with their belongings along a seaside road in a dramatic reversal of the mass exodus from the north that many had feared Israel would make permanent. Associated Press footage showed people still moving northward eight hours after the crossing opened. They were watched over by Israeli tanks on a nearby hill. Palestinians who have been sheltering in squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters are eager to return to their homes — even though they are likely damaged or destroyed. Yasmin Abu Amshah, a mother of three, said she walked 6 kilometers (nearly 4 miles) to reach her home in Gaza City, where she found it damaged but habitable. She also saw her younger sister for the first time in over a year. 'It was a long trip, but a happy one,' she said. Many saw their return as an act of steadfastness after Israel’s military campaign, which was launched in response to the Hamas militant group's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The return was also seen as a repudiation of U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion that large numbers of Palestinians be resettled in Egypt and Jordan, which those countries have rejected. Families of dead hostages are informed Whether hostages are still alive inside Gaza has been a heartbreaking question for waiting families who have pushed Israel’s government to reach a deal to free them, fearing that time was running out. Before Monday’s announcement, Israel believed that at least 35 of the about 90 hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack and still held in Gaza were dead. Government spokesman David Mencer told journalists that a list received overnight from Hamas on the status of the 33 hostages being freed under the ceasefire's first phase showed eight were dead, and 25 were alive. The families have been informed, he said. The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas and securing the release of dozens of hostages captured in the Oct. 7 attack. Militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in that assault and abducted another 250. Israel responded with an air and ground war that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ‘The joy of return’ Ismail Abu Matter, a father of four who waited for three days near the crossing point before moving into northern Gaza, described scenes of jubilation on the other side, with people singing, praying and crying as they were reunited with relatives. 'It’s the joy of return,' said Abu Matter, whose relatives were among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. 'We had thought we wouldn’t return, like our ancestors.' The opening was delayed for two days over a dispute between Hamas and Israel, which said the militant group changed the order of the hostages it released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Local medical officials said Israeli forces opened fire at the waiting crowd and killed several Palestinians over the weekend. Israel's military said it fired warning shots at approaching groups it deemed a threat. Mediators resolved the dispute overnight. Hamas said the return was 'a victory for our people, and a declaration of failure and defeat for the (Israeli) occupation and transfer plans.' In the opening days of the war, Israel ordered the evacuation of the north and sealed it off shortly after ground troops moved in. Around a million people fled to the south in October 2023, while hundreds of thousands remained in the north, which had some of the heaviest fighting and the worst destruction of the war. In all, around 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced. 'This is our house, four stories. You can’t see them,' one man, gesturing to a pile of rubble, said in an AP video. Hostage dispute rattled week-old ceasefire Palestinians were crossing on foot without inspection through part of the Netzarim corridor, a military zone bisecting the territory just south of Gaza City that Israel carved out early in the war. A checkpoint for vehicles opened later on Gaza’s main north-south highway, where traffic was backed up for around 3 kilometers (2 miles). Under the ceasefire agreement, vehicles are to be inspected for weapons before entering the north, but the mechanism for that was not immediately clear. Israel had delayed the opening of the crossing, which was supposed to happen over the weekend, saying it would not allow Palestinians north until a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was released. Israel said she should have been released before four young female soldiers who were freed on Saturday. Israel also accused Hamas of failing to provide information on hostages to be freed. Hamas in turn accused Israel of violating the agreement by not opening the crossing. Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, announced early Monday that an agreement had been reached to release Yehoud along with two other hostages by Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the hostage release — which will include female soldier Agam Berger — will take place on Thursday. Another three hostages should be released on Saturday as previously planned. Hamas also handed over information about the hostages to be released in the first phase. Defense Minister Israel Katz said anyone violating the ceasefire or threatening Israeli forces 'will bear the full cost.' Israel's military has warned Palestinians not to approach its forces, which have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza. ___ Shurafa reported from Wadi Gaza, Gaza Strip, and Magdy from Cairo.

Middle East latest: Hamas says 8 hostages to be freed in first ph...	Israel says a Hamas list shows that eight of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire are dead. An Israeli government spokesperson told reporters Monday that Hamas says the other 25 are alive. Israel has said the next release of hostages will take place on Thursday, followed by another on Saturday. The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas and securing the release of dozens of hostages captured in the militants’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which triggered the fighting. Israel on Monday began allowing Palestinians to return to the heavily destroyed north of the Gaza Strip for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas, in accordance with a fragile ceasefire. Thousands of Palestinians headed north after waiting for days to cross. Here's the latest: Israel says Hamas list shows 8 of 33 hostages who were to be freed in first phase of Gaza ceasefire are dead JERUSALEM — Israel says a Hamas list shows that eight of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire are dead. Government spokesman David Mencer told journalists Monday that Hamas said the other 25 are alive. Israel overnight said it had received a list of information on the status of the hostages from Hamas. Israel has said the next release of hostages will take place on Thursday, followed by another on Saturday. Whether hostages are alive or dead inside Gaza has been a heartbreaking question for waiting families who have pushed Israel’s government to reach a deal to free them, fearing that time was running out. Approximately 90 hostages are still in captivity. Prior to this announcement, Israel believed at least 35 of them were dead. An Israeli strike in the West Bank kills 2 RAMALLAH, West Bank — Israel has carried out a strike on a vehicle in the occupied West Bank, killing two people and wounding another three. The Palestinian Health Ministry reported the casualties from Monday’s strike in the built-up Nur Shams refugee camp. It has been the scene of several Israeli military raids in recent months targeting Palestinian militants. Hamas said the two killed were fighters in its armed wing. Another Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire in the urban Qalandiya refugee camp near Jerusalem overnight, according to the Health Ministry. The ministry does not say whether those killed by Israeli fire are militants or civilians. The Israeli military confirmed the strike in Nur Shams but did not immediately provide further details. It referred questions about the shooting in Qalandiya to the Israeli police, who did not immediately respond. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip ignited the war there. Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza along with east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. An Israeli ex-general says the war did not end well for his country JERUSALEM — A former Israeli general who had proposed a surrender-or-starve strategy for northern Gaza says 'the war has ended very badly' for Israel. Giora Eiland spoke to Israeli Army Radio on Monday as tens of thousands of Palestinians returned to the heavily destroyed north in accordance with a ceasefire reached with Hamas. Eiland said that by opening the Netzarim corridor, an Israeli military zone bisecting the territory, Israel had lost leverage over Hamas and would not be able to restore it, even if it resumes the war. 'We are at the mercy of Hamas,' he said. Eiland was the main author of the so-called Generals’ Plan, which called for giving civilians in the northern third of Gaza a week to evacuate. The whole area would then be declared a closed military zone, sealed off from humanitarian aid, and anyone remaining would be considered a combatant. Last fall, the plan was presented to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, which has not said whether it adopted parts of it. The Israeli military has denied carrying out the plan. Around the time it was publicized, in October, Israel launched a major operation in northern Gaza and sealed it off, allowing in hardly any aid. Tens of thousands of people were forced out, and the operation caused heavy destruction. Eiland said Israel had failed to achieve its stated goals, including destroying Hamas, removing it from power, restoring a sense of safety to Israeli border communities or safely returning dozens of hostages abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. He said that Hamas, by contrast, 'has largely achieved everything it wanted.' Israeli fire kills 1 in southern Lebanon as residents try to return to their homes BEIRUT — Israeli troops killed one person in southern Lebanon on Monday as residents tried to enter villages where Israeli troops remain, Lebanon's Health Ministry said. On Sunday, Israeli troops opened fire on protesters who insisted on accessing their villages, killing 24 people and wounding more than 130, the Health Ministry said. A U.S.-brokered ceasefire that went into effect on Nov. 27, ending a 14-month war between Hezbollah and Israel, stipulates that Israeli forces withdraw from southern Lebanon by Jan. 26. Israel blamed delays on the Lebanese army’s failure to deploy to the area, while the Lebanese army accused Israel of stalling its withdrawal, complicating its deployment. Lebanon later agreed to extend the deadline to Feb. 18. Despite that, residents on Monday tried to return to their villages and Israeli troops opened fire, killing one person in Odaisseh and wounding seven others across four southern villages, according to the Health Ministry. An Israeli doctor says released hostages are in poor physical condition JERUSALEM — An Israeli military doctor who has treated the returning hostages released by Hamas in recent days says they are in poor physical condition and face a lengthy recovery process. Dr. Ami Benov told reporters on Monday that the seven young women were suffering from 'mild starvation' and vitamin deficiencies. He says all of them suffered injuries in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack and that the medical care they received was poor. 'They’re not in a good shape. They’re not good physically,' he said. Benov says their mental states are 'very complicated.' He says the women were held in tunnels and deprived of sunlight for at least eight months. He says one of the challenges will be the 'grounding' process in which they gradually understand they have regained control over such decisions as what to eat, what to wear and where and when to meet their families. 'We feel obligated to give them the option to do whatever they feel right,' he said. But he said everything is being done in 'very small steps.' Death toll rises to 24 in the southern Lebanon confrontation with Israeli troops BEIRUT — The death toll in the confrontation between protesters and Israeli troops who remained in southern Lebanon has risen to 24 with 134 wounded, the Lebanese Health Ministry said Monday. Under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah was to move north of the Litani River by Jan. 26, with the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers deploying in the south. However, implementation delays left Israeli forces in over a dozen villages, sparking violent protests Sunday by residents expecting to return home by the deadline. Lebanon has subsequently agreed to extend the ceasefire deadline until Feb. 18. A Hezbollah lawmaker said Monday that his group, alongside the Lebanese army, is prepared to liberate villages where Israeli troops remain. 'The residents of these villages where the occupation remains are getting ready with our national army to liberate it,' Hassan Fadlallah said, speaking at an event in the southern city of Bint Jbeil, where Hezbollah’s reconstruction arm launched a rebuilding project. Israel arrests 2 citizens on suspicion of working for Iran TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli authorities say they have arrested two Israeli citizens for allegedly conducting missions on behalf of Iran, the latest in a string of similar cases announced in recent months. A statement from the Israeli police and the Shin Ben internal security agency on Monday said that Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreev, residents of northern Israel, were in contact with an Iranian agent and carried out various missions under his instruction. The missions included passing on classified military material obtained during Eliasfov’s military service in an air defense unit. It said the suspects also spray-painted graffiti and hung banners with pro-Iranian messages in various locations across the country, all allegedly in return for financial compensation. The prosecution is expected to file an indictment against them in the coming days. In September, an Israeli citizen was indicted for involvement in an Iranian assassination plot against top Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One month later, authorities arrested another Israeli who was allegedly involved in an Iranian plot to assassinate an Israeli scientist. The Shin Bet says Iranian agents are known to use social media and promises of cash to try to enlist Israelis to carry out such missions. Israel and Iran’s long-running shadow war has burst into the open over the past year, with the two countries directly exchanging fire in April and again in October. Tens of thousands return to devastated northern Gaza as Israel lifts its closure under truce DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Tens of thousands of Palestinians streamed into the most heavily destroyed part of the Gaza Strip on Monday as Israel lifted its closure of the north for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas in accordance with a fragile ceasefire. Massive crowds of people walking with their belongings stretched along a main road running next to the coast in a stunning reversal of the mass exodus from the north at the start of the war that many Palestinians had feared Israel would make permanent. Palestinians who have been sheltering in squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters for over a year are eager to return to their homes — even though they have likely been damaged or destroyed. Yasmin Abu Amshah, a mother of three, said she walked 6 kilometers (nearly 4 miles) to reach her home in Gaza City, where she found it damaged but still habitable. She also saw her younger sister for the first time in over a year. 'It was a long trip, but a happy one,' she said. 'The most important thing is that we returned.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israel-allows-palestinians-to-return-to-heavily-destroyed-north-of-gaza-strip/	2025-01-27T06:26:20-08:00	
Middle East latest: Deal reached to release Israeli hostage and a...	Mediator Qatar announced early Monday that an agreement has been reached to release an Israeli civilian hostage and allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, easing the first major crisis of the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Qatar’s statement said Hamas will hand over the civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, along with two other hostages before Friday. And on Monday, Israeli authorities will allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement said the hostage release — which will include soldier Agam Berger — will take place on Thursday, and confirmed that Palestinians can move north on Monday. Israel’s military said people can start crossing on foot at 7 a.m. Under the ceasefire deal, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza. But Israel put that on hold because of Yehoud, who Israel said should have been released on Saturday. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement. Here is the latest: Qatar says agreement reached to release Israeli hostage, allow Palestinians to return to north Gaza JERUSALEM — Mediator Qatar announced early Monday that an agreement has been reached to release an Israeli civilian hostage and allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, easing the first major crisis of the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Qatar’s statement said Hamas will hand over the civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, along with two other hostages before Friday. And on Monday, Israeli authorities will allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement said the hostage release — which will include soldier Agam Berger — will take place on Thursday, and confirmed that Palestinians can move north on Monday. Israel’s military said people can start crossing on foot at 7 a.m. Egypt rejects any transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza CAIRO — Egypt has rejected any transfer of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip or the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in its response to President Donald Trump’s suggestion that Egypt and Jordan take in Palestinians from war-ravaged Gaza. A statement by Egypt's foreign ministry on Sunday said the 'temporary or long-term' transfer of Palestinians 'threatens stability, risks expanding the conflict in the region and undermines prospects of peace and coexistence among its people.' Egypt stressed its rejection of any violation of Palestinian's rights 'whether through settlement or annexation of territories' or 'encouraging the transfer or uprooting of Palestinians from their land.' The statement, which didn’t address Trump’s comments directly, urged the international community to work toward 'the practical implementation of the two-state solution' to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Relatives of 4 female Israeli soldiers freed from captivity in Gaza express joy at their release TEL AVIV, Israel— In their first public comments since reuniting with their loved ones, relatives of the four female Israeli soldiers freed from captivity in Gaza expressed joy and gratitude at their release but said their struggle will not end until all the hostages are back home. 'Our Liri is home, but there are 90 more hostages, and they should have already been freed,' said Eli Albag, father of released hostage Liri Alabg, in a statement to the press at the hospital where the women are still undergoing medical evaluations. He said he has contempt for the ministers who voted against the ceasefire deal. Karina Ariev, 20, Daniella Gilboa, 20, Naama Levy, 20, and Liri Albag, 19, were released by Hamas on Saturday after more than 15 months in captivity. In exchange, Israel released 200 Palestinian prisoners. Hospital officials have described the four women’s condition as stable. Orly Gilboa, Daniella’s mother, said her daughter 'came back thin and pale,' but that she was 'still the same wonderful kid.' The families expressed their gratitude to everyone who made the release possible, singling out U.S. President Donald Trump and his Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff for special thanks. 'Because of your powerful actions, we have our lives back,' said Sasha Ariev, sister of Karina Ariev, addressing Trump directly, in English. 'You made this deal possible after so many months, when it felt like all hope was gone.' Earlier on Sunday, the first three women freed from Gaza in the current ceasefire were released from the hospital, a spokesman for the Sheba Medical Center said. Palestinian president condemns Trump's suggestion to ‘clean out’ the Gaza Strip RAMALLAH, West Bank — The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has sharply condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion to 'clean out' the Gaza Strip and request that Egypt and Jordan take in more Palestinians. In a statement, the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited control over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, says the prospect of mass displacement from the Gaza Strip 'constitutes a violation of the red lines that we have repeatedly warned against.' 'Our people will not leave,' the statement said. 'We warn of the repercussions of such a dangerous Israeli policy that contributes to severing the ties of the Gaza Strip, and displacing its people, which will lead to destabilization and security.' Trump’s remarks suggesting that Palestinians be encouraged to leave Gaza gets at the core of Palestinian fears that they will be driven from their remaining homeland. The Palestinian presidency said it was 'ready to assume its full duties in the Gaza Strip' in hopes of eventually establishing an independent Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank city of Ramallah, briefly controlled Gaza after Israeli troops withdrew in 2005, only to be driven out by its rival Hamas two years later. France will consider allowing Israeli companies to take part in Paris Air Show PARIS — France will consider allowing Israeli companies to participate in the Paris Air Show in June, thanks to ceasefire agreements in Gaza and Lebanon, the French president’s office said Sunday. That was among the results of a conversation Sunday between French President Emmanuel Macron and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Macron said France hopes to help speed up the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, two of whom are French citizens. Macron also urged Israel to allow for a ″massive″ facilitation of aid to Gaza’s population, and to fulfill its promises to withdraw troops from Lebanon under a truce brokered by the U.S. and France. Netanyahu asked about Israeli participation in the upcoming Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, a major industry event. The French president said Israeli participation ″could be favorably considered, as a consequence of the cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon,″ according to Macron's office. Tensions surrounded Israel’s participation in two arms shows in France last year, Eurosatory and Euronaval. The French government did not want Israel displaying any weapons used in its wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Islamic Jihad group says the dispute over a hostage has been settled RAMALLAH, West Bank — A spokesman for the Islamic Jihad, Gaza’s second-largest militant group, says the dispute over an Israeli hostage that has kept Palestinians from returning home to northern Gaza has been settled. Mohamed al-Hajj Mousa added in a statement that the group told mediators that the hostage, Arbel Yehoud, will be released before Saturday, when the next exchange of hostages from Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody is set to take place. There is no immediate comment from Israel, which has accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire by changing the order of hostages it has released. It expected Yehoud to be freed this weekend, and it has put the movement of Palestinians into northern Gaza on hold. UNRWA warns of far-reaching consequences if Israel goes ahead with its closure RAMALLAH, West Bank — The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says that if Israel carries out its threat to close its east Jerusalem headquarters on Thursday, the outsize effects will be felt acutely and immediately by tens of thousands of Palestinians. The agency, known as UNRWA, runs 12 facilities that provide critical public services across east Jerusalem, including schools enrolling at least 1,200 children and free clinics serving over 70,000 people. 'That’s the thing, it has an impact on people’s lives,' Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, said of the potential closure. In the Shuafat refugee camp, an impoverished neighborhood, 'people today can walk just a few meters and they’re in an excellent clinic,' Touma said. But if it's shuttered, she said, tens of thousands of Palestinians would have to cross a difficult checkpoint, pay for transport and, even if they’re eligible for Israeli primary health care, also pay for medicine in order to see a doctor or get a blood test. 'We’re talking about the poorest of the poor,' Touma said. 'Right now, they have no alternative.' The closure of UNRWA schools would raise all sorts of problems given that there are already too few classrooms in the overcrowded Palestinian areas of east Jerusalem, she said. Touma said much remains unclear about the Israeli order, including whether the closure would apply to operations in east Jerusalem only or to the entirety of the Palestinian territories. Israel says the agency has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. Israeli far-right leaders back Trump's suggestion to resettle Palestinians TEL AVIV, Israel — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both want Israel to establish Jewish settlements in Gaza, supported Trump's remarks, calling it 'voluntary emigration.' Palestinians and many of their supporters view it as code for ethnic cleansing. In a post on X Sunday, Smotrich called the idea of 'helping (Palestinians) find other places to start new, good lives' great and said he would work with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to that end. Ben-Gvir, who quit Netanyahu’s government over the current ceasefire in Gaza, said Trump’s remarks gave Israel the green light to move ahead on 'voluntary emigration.' 'When the president of the world’s largest superpower brings it up himself, the government of Israel should implement it,' he said in a statement. Netanyahu has said building Jewish settlements in Gaza is not realistic. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains a blockade with Egypt on the territory. UNRWA says Israel ordered it to vacate Jerusalem headquarters JERUSALEM — The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees says its staff was directed to vacate the premises by Thursday. Israel passed legislation last year cutting all ties with the agency and barring it from operating in its territory. It says the agency, which is the main provider of aid in the Gaza Strip, has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. In a statement Sunday, the agency, known as UNRWA, said the order to vacate 'is in contradiction to international law obligations of U.N. member states,' including Israel. 'United Nations premises are inviolable and enjoy privileges and immunities under the United Nations Charter.' UNRWA closed its east Jerusalem headquarters last May after Israeli protesters set fire to its perimeter. Senior Hamas official rejects Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Bassem Naim said that 'even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction,' the Palestinian people will never agree to such a proposal. He also said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza 'even better than before' if Israel lifts its blockade. Israeli forces kill 2 Palestinians in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday. Those killed included a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza as part of the ceasefire, which came into force last Sunday, but the military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which are still operating in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-ceasefires-in-gaza-and-lebanon-appear-at-risk-with-disputes-over-deadlines/	2025-01-26T15:20:06-08:00	
Russia says its troops have captured a strategic town in eastern ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia on Sunday claimed its troops had captured a strategically important town in eastern Ukraine as part of a grinding campaign to weaken Kyiv’s grip on the country’s industrial heartland, while uncertainty over the continued flow of U.S. funding has reportedly halted the work of some Ukrainian NGOs, including those helping war veterans. Russia’s Defense Ministry announced the fall of Velyka Novosilka, which had around 5,000 residents before the war, following a monthslong battle. Its statement could not be independently verified, and Ukraine claimed its troops had only strategically withdrawn from certain areas. But if confirmed, it would make Velyka Novosilka the first significant town to capitulate in 2025 under Moscow’s onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region against Ukraine’s weary and short-handed army. The war is set to reach its three-year milestone in February. Ukrainian forces withdrew from certain parts of Velyka Novosilka to avoid encirclement, the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade said in a statement on its official Telegram channel Sunday. The brigade is active in that patch of the frontline. Analysts have long predicted that it’s only a matter of time until Russian forces capture the settlement, which lies only 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region. The brigade said though they have approximate parity with Russian forces in terms of artillery and drones, the Russians have a huge advantage in manpower. 'Our units, using the weather conditions, skillfully withdrew from areas where there was a threat of encirclement. This does not mean that we have completely left the city, the fighting in Velyka Novosilka continues . All actions are aimed at minimizing our own losses and maximum damage to the enemy,' the statement said. The brigade said the withdrawal will make it topographically difficult for Russians to advance by making the river an obstacle for further advance. 'The enemy (…) will have no peace, any movement is cut off by shells and drones,' the statement said. Russia captured the Donetsk cities of Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year after long and grueling battles. Those cities were largely leveled by Russian artillery, glide bombs and drones before they fell. Russian forces have also been trying for months to capture the key Donetsk strongholds of Pokrovsk and Chasiv Yar. Elsewhere, Ukrainian NGOs catering to the needs of war veterans and their families have claimed a suspension of U.S. funding is forcing them to halt their work, days after newly sworn in U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would pause foreign aid grants for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later claimed that military aid to Ukraine would continue, but did not clarify whether humanitarian aid had been paused. Kyiv relies on the U.S. for 40% of its military needs. According to news reports, Ukrainian NGOs receiving funding from Washington this weekend began receiving 'stop work' orders, requiring them to pause all projects and related travel. Veteran Hub, an NGO that provides legal and psychological support to war veterans and their families, was forced to halt operations of two of its three largest service units as a result, the organization said in its official Facebook page. It said the suspension has lead it to ask for public donations for the first time. 'Since 2018, we have refrained from public fundraising because we believe that donations are primarily needed for the military. Today, we are forced to publicly ask for support for the first time,' the organization said. With the Trump administration questioning the future of U.S. aid to Ukraine, stressing the need to quickly broker a peace deal, both Moscow and Kyiv are seeking battlefield successes to strengthen their negotiating positions ahead of any prospective talks. For the past year, Russian forces have been waging an intense campaign to punch holes in Ukraine’s defenses in the eastern Donetsk region. The sustained and costly offensive has compelled Kyiv to give up a series of towns, villages and hamlets.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-russia-says-its-troops-have-captured-a-strategic-town-in-eastern-ukraine/	2025-01-26T12:50:47-08:00	
Trump wants Egypt and Jordan to take in Palestinians from Gaza. H...	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — President Donald Trump's suggestion that Egypt and Jordan take in Palestinians from the war-ravaged Gaza Strip is likely to be met with a hard 'no' from the two U.S. allies and the Palestinians themselves, who fear Israel would never allow them to return. Trump floated the idea on Saturday, saying he would urge the leaders of the two Arab countries to take in Gaza's now largely homeless population, so that 'we just clean out that whole thing.' He added that resettling Gaza's population 'could be temporary or long-term.' 'It’s literally a demolition site right now,' Trump said, referring to the vast destruction caused by Israel's 15-month military campaign against Hamas, now paused by a fragile ceasefire. Middle East latest: Israel says it won’t complete its withdrawal from Lebanon by Sunday 'I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location, where they can maybe live in peace for a change,' Trump said. There was no immediate comment from Egypt, Jordan, Israel or Palestinian officials. The idea is likely to be welcomed by Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right governing partners have long advocated what they describe as the voluntary migration of large numbers of Palestinians and the reestablishment of Jewish settlements in Gaza. Hundreds rally on Michigan Ave. against Trump administration’s Middle East, immigration policies Human rights groups have already accused Israel of ethnic cleansing, which United Nations experts have defined as a policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove the civilian population of another group from certain areas 'by violent and terror-inspiring means.' History of displacement Before and during the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, some 700,000 Palestinians — a majority of the prewar population — fled or were driven from their homes in what is now Israel, an event they commemorate as the Nakba — Arabic for catastrophe. Israel refused to allow them to return because it would have resulted in a Palestinian majority within its borders. The refugees and their descendants now number around 6 million, with large communities in Gaza, where they make up the majority of the population, as well as the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. In the 1967 Mideast war, when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 300,000 more Palestinians fled, mostly into Jordan. The decades-old refugee crisis has been a major driver of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was one of the thorniest issues in peace talks that last broke down in 2009. The Palestinians claim a right of return, while Israel says they should be absorbed by surrounding Arab countries. Hamas frees 4 female Israeli soldiers in exchange for 200 Palestinian prisoners as ceasefire holds Many Palestinians view the latest war in Gaza, in which entire neighborhoods have been shelled to oblivion and 90% of the population of 2.3 million have been forced from their homes, as a new Nakba. They fear that if large numbers of Palestinians leave Gaza, then they, too, may never return. Steadfastly remaining on one's land is central to Palestinian culture and was on vivid display in Gaza on Sunday, when thousands of people tried to return to the most heavily destroyed part of the territory. Red line for Egypt, Jordan Egypt and Jordan fiercely rejected the idea of accepting Gaza refugees early in the war, when it was floated by some Israeli officials. Both countries have made peace with Israel but support the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. They fear that the permanent displacement of Gaza's population could make that impossible. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi has also warned of the security implications of transferring large numbers of Palestinians to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, bordering Gaza. Hamas and other militant groups are deeply rooted in Palestinian society and are likely to move with the refugees, which would mean that future wars would be fought on Egyptian soil, something that could unravel the historic Camp David peace treaty, a cornerstone of regional stability. 'The peace which we have achieved would vanish from our hands,' el-Sissi said in October 2023, after Hamas' attack on southern Israel triggered the war. 'All for the sake of the idea of eliminating the Palestinian cause.' Devastating toll for Gaza’s children: Over 13,000 killed and an estimated 25,000 injured, UN says That's what happened in Lebanon in the 1970s, when Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, the leading militant group of its time, transformed the country's south into a launchpad for attacks on Israel. The refugee crisis and the PLO's actions helped push Lebanon into a 15-year civil war in 1975. Israel invaded twice and occupied southern Lebanon from 1982 until 2000. Jordan, which clashed with the PLO and expelled it under similar circumstances in 1970, already hosts more than 2 million Palestinian refugees, the majority of whom have been granted citizenship. Israeli ultranationalists have long suggested that Jordan be considered a Palestinian state so that Israel can keep the West Bank, which they view as the biblical heartland of the Jewish people. Jordan's monarchy has vehemently rejected that scenario. Can Trump force Egypt, Jordan to accept refugees? That depends on how serious Trump is about the idea and how far he is prepared to go. U.S. tariffs — one of Trump's favorite economic tools — or outright sanctions could be devastating for Jordan and Egypt. The two countries receive billions of dollars in American aid each year, and Egypt is already mired in an economic crisis. But allowing an influx of refugees could also be destabilizing. Egypt says it is currently hosting some 9 million migrants, including refugees from Sudan's civil war. Jordan, with a population of less than 12 million, is hosting over 700,000 refugees, mainly from Syria.

That would potentially complicate efforts to broker a historic agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel to normalize relations, something Trump tried to do during his previous term and expects to complete in his current one.

Devastating toll for Gaza's children: Over 13,000 killed and an e...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The war in Gaza has been devastating for children: More than 13,000 have been killed, an estimated 25,000 injured, and at least 25,000 hospitalized for malnutrition, according to U.N. agencies. As Britain’s deputy U.N. ambassador, James Kariuki, recently told the Security Council, 'Gaza has become the deadliest place in the world to be a child.' 'The children of Gaza did not choose this war,' he said, 'yet they have paid the ultimate price.' The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported Thursday that of the 40,717 Palestinian bodies identified so far in Gaza, one-third – 13,319 – were children. The office said Friday the figures came from Gaza’s Ministry of Health. The U.N. children’s agency, UNICEF, said the estimate of 25,000 children injured came from its analysis based on information collected together with Gaza’s Health Ministry. U.N. deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said nearly 19,000 children had been hospitalized for acute malnutrition in the four months before December. That figure also came from UNICEF, which said it was from data collected by U.N. staff in Gaza focusing on nutrition, in coordination with all pertinent U.N. agencies. The U.N. says thousands of children have also been orphaned or separated from their parents during the 15-month war. Yasmine Sherif, executive director of the U.N. global fund Education Cannot Wait, told a press conference that 650,000 school-age children haven’t been attending classes and the entire education system has to be rebuilt because of the widespread destruction in Gaza. Diplomats from Britain, France and other countries also cited the toll on Israeli children who were killed, injured and abducted during Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 – with some still being held hostage. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon asked the Security Council whether it ever paused to consider the plight of Israeli children 'mutilated, tortured and murdered' on Oct. 7, the 30 who were kidnapped and the tens of thousands who have been displaced, their homes destroyed. 'The trauma they have endured is beyond imagination,' he said. Danon called Thursday's council meeting on children in Gaza 'an affront to common sense,' accusing Hamas of turning Gaza into 'the world’s largest terror base' and using children as human shields. 'The children of Gaza could have had a future filled with opportunity,' he said. 'Instead, they are trapped in a cycle of violence and despair, all because of Hamas, not because of Israel.'	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-devastating-toll-for-gazas-children-over-13000-killed-and-an-estimated-25000-injured-un-says/	2025-01-25T15:47:49-08:00	
US has not stopped military aid to Ukraine, Zelenskyy says	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday the U.S. has not stopped military aid to Ukraine after newly sworn in U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would pause foreign aid grants for 90 days. Zelenskyy did not clarify whether humanitarian aid had been paused. Ukraine relies on the U.S. for 40% of its military needs. 'I am focused on military aid; it has not been stopped, thank God,' he said at a press conference with Moldovan President Maia Sandu. The two leaders met in Kyiv on Saturday to discuss the energy needs of Moldova’s Russian-occupied Transnistria region, which saw its natural gas supplies halted on Jan. 1 due to Ukraine’s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Ukraine has said it can offer coal to the Transnistrian authorities to make up for the shortfall. The future of U.S. aid to Ukraine remains uncertain as President Donald Trump begins his second term in office. The American leader has repeatedly said he wouldn’t have allowed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to start if he had been in office, although he was president as fighting grew in the east of the country between Kyiv’s forces and separatists aligned with Moscow, ahead of Putin sending in tens of thousands of troops in 2022. On Thursday, Trump told Fox News that Zelenskyy should have made a deal with Putin to avoid the conflict. A day earlier, Trump also threatened to impose stiff tariffs and sanctions on Russia if an agreement isn’t reached to end the fighting in Ukraine. Speaking in Kyiv on Saturday, Zelenskyy said he had enjoyed 'good meetings and conversations with President Trump' and that he believed the U.S. leader would succeed in his desire to end the war. 'This can only be done with Ukraine, and otherwise it simply will not work because Russia does not want to end the war, and Ukraine does,' Zelenskyy said. Grinding eastern offensive With Trump stressing the need to quickly broker a peace deal, both Moscow and Kyiv are seeking battlefield successes to strengthen their negotiating positions ahead of any prospective talks. For the past year, Russian forces have been waging an intense campaign to punch holes in Ukraine’s defenses in the Donetsk region and weaken Kyiv’s grip on the eastern parts of the country. The sustained and costly offensive has compelled Kyiv to give up a series of towns, villages and hamlets. Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed Friday that Russian troops had fought their way into the center of the strategically important eastern of Velyka Novosilka, although it was not possible to independently confirm the claim. Elsewhere, three civilians were killed Saturday in shelling in the Russian-occupied area of Ukraine’s Kherson region, Moscow-installed Gov. Vladimir Saldo said. He urged the residents of Oleshky, which sits close to the frontline in southern Ukraine, to stay in their homes or in bomb shelters. Russia also attacked Ukraine with two missiles and 61 Shahed drones overnight Saturday. Ukrainian air defenses shot down both missiles and 46 drones, a statement from the air force said. Another 15 drones failed to reach targets due to Ukrainian countermeasures. The downed drones caused damage in the Kyiv, Cherkasy and Khmelnytskyi regions, with Ukrainian emergency services saying that five people had to be from a 9-story apartment block in the Ukrainian capital. Russia also struck Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region with drones causing casualties and damage, local authorities said Saturday. Drones targeted the city’s Shevchenkivskyi, Kyivskyi and Kholodnohirskyi districts, said Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Russia used a Molniya drone – an inexpensive weapon that has been developed and recently deployed by Russia – in the Shevchenkivskyi district, sparking a fire. The attacks disrupted the city’s water and electricity supplies, the mayor said. Terekhov said the number of victims was still being determined, while Kharkiv’s governor, Oleh Syniehubov, said three people, two women and a man, were injured in the strikes. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-has-not-stopped-military-aid-to-ukraine-zelenskyy-says/	2025-01-25T09:53:46-08:00	
Middle East latest: Hamas releases 4 Israeli soldiers in exchange...	Hamas militants on Saturday released four female Israeli soldiers they held captive for 15 months in a planned exchange for 200 Palestinian prisoners or detainees in Israel. It's the second exchange since a fragile ceasefire took effect last weekend, halting the fighting in Gaza for at least six weeks during which dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be freed while more aid flows in. In return for the four soldiers, Israel should free 200 Palestinian prisoners or detainees, including 120 militants serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks. The first exchange took place Sunday with the release of three Israeli hostages and 90 Palestinian prisoners. Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities. The ministry doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. The war was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which killed around 1,200 people. ___ Here's the latest: Israel warns Palestinians not to return to northern Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military is warning Palestinians in Gaza not to return to northern Gaza. The army’s Arabic spokesman, Avichay Adraee, published a post on social media telling Palestinians not to approach the east-west Netzarim route, which bisects Gaza. Israel had been expected to open the route by Sunday as part of the latest stage of the ceasefire. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the pullback was on hold because of delays in the release of an Israeli civilian woman from captivity in Gaza. Mediators say they are trying to resolve the dispute. Some Palestinian prisoners being released will be sent to other Arab countries RAMALLAH, West Bank — The head of a Palestinian prisoner advocacy group says that some of the 70 convicted militants being transferred to Egypt after their release from Israeli prison will ultimately be sent to other Arab countries. Abdullah al-Zaghari, the head of the Palestinian Prisoner’s Club, told The Associated Press that Algeria, Tunisia and Turkey have all expressed willingness to receive some of those required to live in exile according to the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. A total of 200 prisoners, 120 of them sentenced to life prison on charges related to deadly attacks against Israelis, were being freed Saturday after Hamas released four female soldiers from captivity in Gaza. Al-Zaghari said that the details of how many of the 70 deported Palestinian prisoners will stay living in Egypt and how many will travel on to other countries are still being worked out. Video shows freed hostages in an Israeli army base JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has released a video showing the freed hostages being welcomed at an army base in southern Israel. Some of the hostages hugged the female soldiers who greeted them. One of them, Liri Albag, 19, smiled, gave two thumbs-up and made a heart shape with her hands before boarding a van. Israel's president welcomes hostages home JERUSALEM — Israel’s president has welcomed home the four female soldiers released from captivity. 'You are heroes,' President Isaac Herzog said in a post on X. Herzog wished them healthy recoveries, but says the nation 'will not rest' until all hostages return. Israel releases 70 Palestinian prisoners into Egypt in Gaza ceasefire deal CAIRO — Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV says Israel has released 70 Palestinian prisoners into Egypt under the Gaza ceasefire deal. The network says they arrived at the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing with the Gaza Strip. Hamas had earlier released four female Israeli soldiers. Israel is expected to release a total of 200 Palestinian prisoners or detainees, many of whom will be sent into exile. Israel says it won't allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza until hostage Arbel Yehoud is released JERUSALEM — Israel says it will not allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza until Arbel Yehoud, one of the dozens of hostages held by Hamas, is released. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Yehoud was supposed to have been released Saturday as part of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Hamas had earlier released four female Israeli soldiers. Israeli army spokesman criticizes Hamas' display of hostages TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s army spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari says the released hostages are 'in our hands' and on their way home. In a televised statement Saturday, Hagari criticized what he called the 'cynical' public display of the young women by Hamas before their release. He also said that Israel is concerned about the fate of the two youngest hostages — Kfir and Ariel Bibas — and their mother Shiri. Kfir Bibas marked his second birthday in captivity earlier this month. Hagari says the army is committed to bringing all hostages home. Palestinians release a list of 200 prisoners to be released from Israel RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian authorities have released a list of 200 Palestinian prisoners and detainees expected to be released from Israel in exchange for four female Israeli soldiers held by Hamas in Gaza. The list includes 120 militants serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis. The rest are serving lengthy sentences. The list shows that 70 of the prisoners will not be allowed to return to their homes in the occupied West Bank or Jerusalem and will be required to live in exile. It’s unclear exactly where they will go. The more notorious militants being released include Mohammad Odeh, 52, and Wael Qassim, 54, both from east Jerusalem. They were accused of carrying out a series of deadly Hamas attacks against Israelis, including a bombing at a cafeteria at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2002 that killed nine people, including five U.S. citizens. Another prisoner set to be released is Mohammed Aradeh, 42, an Islamic Jihad militant, who become something of a Palestinian folk hero in 2021 along with five other prisoners after they used spoons to tunnel their way out of Israel’s most secure prison in an extraordinary escape that stunned Israelis and Palestinians alike. 4 female soldiers freed by Hamas as part of Gaza ceasefire are with Israeli forces DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Four female soldiers freed from captivity in the Gaza Strip are with Israeli forces, the second such release as part of a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. Israel confirmed it had received the freed hostages on Saturday. The truce, which began Sunday, is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the Hamas militant group. The four Israeli soldiers, Karina Ariev, 20, Daniella Gilboa, 20, Naama Levy, 20, and Liri Albag, 19, were captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. Lebanese army blames Israel for delay in deploying troops in southern Lebanon BEIRUT — The Lebanese army on Saturday said it has been unable to deploy its forces throughout southern Lebanon as laid out in a ceasefire agreement that halted the Israel-Hezbollah war because of Israel’s 'procrastination in withdrawal' from the area. Under the deal reached in November, Israel is supposed to complete its withdrawal from Lebanon by Sunday, after which the Lebanese armed forces would patrol the buffer zone in southern Lebanon alongside U.N. peacekeepers to prevent Hezbollah from reestablishing a military presence there. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested Friday that Israel might not withdraw by the deadline, and Washington appears prepared to push for an extension. Netanyahu said the Lebanese government hasn’t yet 'fully enforced' the agreement, an apparent reference to the deployment of Lebanese troops. The Lebanese army statement said 'procrastination in the withdrawal by the Israeli enemy complicates the army’s deployment mission.' It said it 'maintains readiness to complete its deployment immediately after the Israeli enemy withdraws.' It called on displaced Lebanese not to return to their areas until they receive instructions, citing the danger of landmines and explosives. Some 112,000 Lebanese remain displaced. There have been calls for protests on Sunday if Israel does not fully withdraw. Crowds gather in Tel Aviv and Gaza City ahead of the release of hostages and prisoners DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Crowds began to gather in Tel Aviv and Gaza City on Saturday ahead of the expected swap between Israel and Hamas of more hostages for Palestinian prisoners. In Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square, a big screen showed the faces of the four female soldiers expected to be released. Some in the growing crowd wore Israeli flags, others held posters with the hostages’ faces. 'I’m extremely excited, exhilarated,' said onlooker Gili Roman. 'In a heartbeat, in a split of a second, their lives are going to turn upside again, but right now for a positive and a good side.' He said his sister was released in the only other ceasefire in November, but another relative was killed in captivity. In Gaza City’s central Palestine Square, a crowd began to gather early as militants worked to cordon off an area where the hostages were expected to be handed over to the Red Cross. Dozens of armed and masked militants also paraded in vehicles through the streets of the city, said resident Radwan Abu Rawiya who was part of the Palestine Square crowd. Children ran alongside the militants’ vehicles as celebratory gunfire rang out, he said in a telephone interview. 'People are celebrating and waiting to see the hostages,' he said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-4-israeli-female-soldiers-will-be-exchanged-for-200-palestinian-prisoners/	2025-01-25T04:20:42-08:00	
Trump leans in on targeting Russian oil revenue as he tries to fu...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is emphasizing that targeting Russia's oil revenue is the best way to get Moscow to end its nearly three-year war against Ukraine. Trump, who pledged in the campaign that he'd broker a quick end to the grinding conflict, in his first days in office has leaned in on the idea that OPEC+, the alliance of oil producing nations, holds the key to ending the war by reducing oil prices. The president on Friday renewed his call on the group of oil producing exporters, led by Saudi Arabia, to reduce the price of oil. It's a move he says would bleed Russia of much needed revenue to pay for the conflict and force Vladimir Putin to reconsider the war. 'One way to stop it quickly is for OPEC to stop making so much money,' Trump told reporters. 'So, OPEC ought to get on the ball and drop the price of oil. And that war will stop right away.' But the push on OPEC+ is an uphill battle, according to industry experts. The alliance last month put off increasing oil production as it faces weaker than expected demand and competing production from non-allied countries. Trump made similar calls on OPEC+ this week during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the annual gathering of world leaders and corporate elites. Meanwhile, the president's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said Friday that OPEC+ cutting oil prices to $45 per barrel could push Russia to end the war. 'Russia is gaining billions of dollars of money from oil sales,' Kellogg said in a Fox News interview. 'What if you drop that to $45 a barrel, which is basically a baseline break-even point?' The Saudi and Russian relationship is complicated, though the countries have cooperated on oil. In 2016, Russia and other oil producers that weren’t part of the alliance joined with Saudi Arabia and other members of the oil cartel to form OPEC+. Russia and Saudi Arabia are by far the biggest producers in the expanded alliance. That move was largely made in response to dramatically falling oil prices due to U.S. shale oil output. The United States is not a member of OPEC or OPEC+. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said Trump has a better relationship with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, than did his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden. Still, he said, the Saudis 'still have bills to pay,' and Trump is making a 'huge ask.' 'Oil companies respond to economics and not to personal favors,' he added. The Kremlin on Friday dismissed the idea that Russia could be pressed into talks on ending the war by the U.S. and its allies targeting the oil sector. 'The conflict doesn’t depend on oil prices,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a call with reporters. 'The conflict is ongoing because of the threat to Russia’s national security, the threat to Russians living on those territories and the refusal by the Americans and the Europeans to listen to Russia’s security concerns. It’s not linked to oil prices.' The U.S. and its allies have imposed a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil. But Moscow has been able to sustain a steady stream of revenue from sales by relying on buyers, including China and India, who have taken advantage of discounted prices from the Russians. Trump earlier this week spoke by phone with the Saudi crown prince, his first foreign leader call after his return to the White House. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to comment on whether the two leaders discussed Trump's push for slashing oil prices. After the call, the crown prince said the kingdom would look to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, and Trump publicly said he'd like to see the Saudis spend $1 trillion. Trump is also hopeful for landing a long sought Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization deal, to formalize relations between the Middle East's two biggest powers. Trump may be making a risky gambit by publicly pressing the Saudis and other OPEC+ nations. Biden, who was critical of the Saudis' human rights record early in his term, faced an embarrassing setback months into the Ukraine war when the Saudis rejected the Democrat's public push to increase the global flow of oil. Asked why Trump could succeed where Biden failed, Leavitt, Trump's press secretary, offered confidence but no specifics. 'The Biden administration said a lot of things that never actually came to fruition, and President Trump is a man of his word,' she said. 'You’re seeing that already.' It’s possible that Saudi Arabia and other allies would want to answer Washington’s call eventually, but not immediately, said Kevin Book, the managing director who leads the research team at ClearView Energy Partners LLC, a Washington research firm. Global oil supply is currently ahead of demand by about 700,000 barrels per day, according to the International Energy Agency, a surplus that already weighs on the price. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, was trading at about $78 on Friday morning. Book said whether Trump will have better luck than Biden depends on his terms -- what he asks for and what pressure he brings. 'What Biden was essentially asking for was going to divide the two biggest players in OPEC+ and that’s essentially what’s on the table right now, too,' he said. 'It was challenging then. It would be challenging now.' Kellogg said Trump feels strongly that drumming up economic pressure will be more useful to getting Russia to the negotiating table than helping Ukraine score battlefield wins. Both sides have suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. Kellogg expressed doubt that the incredible human cost would have much impact on the Kremlin's calculations. 'This is a nation that was willing to lose 700,000 killed in six months at Stalingrad in World War II. They just throw troops at it,' Kellogg said. He added, 'So when you look at Putin, you can’t just say, 'Well, stop the killing,' because candidly, that’s not their mentality, that’s not how they do things.' Criticism of Biden's handling of the Ukraine conflict was a cornerstone of Trump's 2024 campaign. He regularly pilloried Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the enormous amount of military aid poured into Ukraine in the aftermath of Russia's February 2022 invasion. He boasted on the campaign trail that the war would have never happened if he were president and that he would end the war within 24 hours of being sworn in. Since his election victory, he's acknowledged that the war remains complicated and has said it could take months to find a resolution to the war. In a posting on his Truth Social site, Trump earlier this week said the U.S 'must never forget that Russia helped us win the Second World War.' And he's repeatedly said that he will hold talks with Putin. 'I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon and get that war ... ended,' Trump said at Davos. 'And that’s not from the standpoint of economy or anything else. It’s from the standpoint of millions of lives are being wasted. Beautiful, young people are being shot in the battlefield.' ___ McDermott reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

North Korea prepares to send more troops to Russia after sufferin...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s military said Friday it suspects North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after its soldiers fighting in the Russian-Ukraine war suffered heavy casualties. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff also assessed in a report distributed to journalists that North Korea is continuing its preparations to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile intended to reach the United States. President Donald Trump’s return to the White House may brighten Pyongyang's prospects for high-level diplomacy with Washington, as he met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times during his first term. Many experts say Kim likely thinks his evolving nuclear program and expanding military cooperation with Russian President Vladimir Putin could give him a greater leverage than during his 2018-19 summits with Trump. North Korea has been supplying a vast amount of artillery and other conventional weapons to Russia, and last October it sent about 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia as well, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukraine intelligences. Seoul, Washington and others worry Russia could in return transfer to North Korea sophisticated weapons technologies that can enhance its nuclear program. North Korean soldiers are considered to be highly disciplined and well-trained, but their lack of combat experiences and unfamiliarity with the largely flat plains that make up most battlefields in the Russian-Ukraine war have made them easy targets for drone and artillery strikes. South Korea’s spy agency said last week that it assessed about 300 North Korean soldiers had died and another 2,700 had been injured. Earlier in January, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 4,000, though U.S. estimates were lower at around 1,200. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said that North Korea is believed to be accelerating preparations to send more troops to Russia, without saying how it reached the assessment. Deepening military ties between North Korea and Russia could embolden Kim over his dealings with the U.S. and South Korea. In a major political conference last month, Kim vowed to implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy. But many experts say Kim may eventually want to sit down for talks with Trump if he thinks the U.S. president could make concessions. Their previous talks collapsed after Trump rejected Kim’s offer to dismantle his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearization step, in return for extensive sanctions relief. Kim has since sharply increased the pace of weapons tests to expand an arsenal of nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and South Korea. In South Korea, there are concerns that Trump might give up the goal of a complete denuclearization of North Korea and focus on eliminating its long-range missile program that poses a direct threat to the U.S., while leaving its nuclear attack capabilities against South Korea intact. During a Fox News interview broadcast Thursday, Trump called Kim 'a smart guy' and 'not a religious zealot.' Asked over whether he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied that 'I will, yeah.' On Monday, Trump called North Korea 'a nuclear power' as he boasted of his personal ties with Kim. That created a stir in South Korea, as Washington, Seoul and their partners have long avoided describing North Korea as a nuclear state out of worries that it could be seen as accepting its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. 'I was very friendly with him. He liked me. I liked him,' Trump said during a press availability at the Oval Office after his inauguration. 'Now he is a nuclear power. But we got along. I think he’ll be happy to see I’m coming back.' Jeon Ha Gyu, a spokesperson for the South Korean Defense Ministry, told reporters Tuesday that efforts to achieve North Korea’s denuclearization must be continued as a prerequisite to realize lasting peace not only on the Korean Peninsula but also in the world. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry also said it will closely coordinate with the Trump administration to achieve North Korea's denuclearization. North Korea hasn’t responded to Trump’s comments. A state media report Friday on the closely watched two-day parliament meeting in Pyongyang this week didn’t say whether Kim attended it, and the report made no mention of the U.S., South Korea, Russia or other foreign policy issues.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-north-korea-prepares-to-send-more-troops-to-russia-after-suffering-casualties-south-korea-says/	2025-01-24T04:34:14-08:00	
Israelis await names of next 4 hostages to be released by Hamas a...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Relatives of hostages still being held by militants in Gaza called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Friday to ensure all remaining captives are freed, while also appealing to U.S. President Donald Trump to continue pressing for their release. As a fragile six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas entered its sixth day, Israelis waited anxiously for the names of the next four hostages who will be released from among the more than 90 still held in Gaza. In the Palestinian enclave, civilians in the central and southern part of the Gaza Strip hoping to return to the remnants of their home in the battered north faced an agonizing wait. Israel believes about a third, or possibly as many as half, of the more than 90 hostages still in Gaza have died. Hamas has not released definitive information on how many captives are still alive or the names of those who have died. 'Dear President Trump, first of all we want to say thank you for the happy moments we felt this week. But we want to tell you we still have 94 hostages, we need them all at home,' said Ayelet Samerano, whose son Yonatan Samerano is among those still being held. 'Please do not stop. Please continue to press and do everything so that all the 94 hostages will come home immediately.' In the first phase of the ceasefire deal, 33 hostages are expected to be released gradually in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The first three Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners on Sunday, the first day of the ceasefire that has halted the 15-month war that has devastated Gaza. Wide swathes of the territory have been destroyed, while more than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not differentiate between combatants and civilians but say more than half are women and children. According to the deal, on Friday Hamas is to announce the names of the next four hostages to be released on Saturday, after which Israel will also release a list of which Palestinian prisoners will be freed. The hostages were among about 250 men, women and children captured by militants who burst across the border into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people in an attack that sparked the war in Gaza. About 100 were released during a brief ceasefire in November that year, while the bodies of around three dozen hostages have been recovered in Gaza and eight hostages have been rescued by the army. 'I call from here to the Prime Minister and negotiating team -- you’re doing excellent work -- do whatever is necessary to bring everyone back, to the last hostage,' Samerano said. 'We ask you to ensure phase two of the deal is agreed upon before finishing the current phrase. We cannot continue living in uncertainty. All hostages must return, and none of them has time left.' The 33 to be released in the first phase will include women, children, sick people and those over 50 — almost all civilians, though the deal also commits Hamas to freeing all living female soldiers in Phase 1. Hamas will release living hostages first, but could release some bodies if they don’t have enough living hostages in this category. Male soldiers are not expected to be released in the first phase. 'This week we were moved to watch images of mothers embracing their daughters, but our hearts break thinking that my son Nimrod and other men remain behind, and each day they’re there poses a real danger to their lives,' said Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod Cohen is among the hostages. 'The worry that the deal won’t be fully implemented gnaws at us all. All senior officials openly say that stopping the deal means a death sentence for those left behind.' Under the terms of the deal, Palestinians in Gaza will have more freedom of movement from the north to the south of the enclave. Civilians in the south will be allowed to take a coastal road to northern Gaza from Saturday, when Israeli troops are expected to withdraw from the key route and Hamas is set to release the next four Israeli hostages. Those in other parts of the strip seized on the ceasefire this week to reunite with scattered family members, picking their way through vast swaths of rubble and trying to salvage what remained of their homes and their belongings. But those displaced from the north have had to wait. 'The first thing I’ll do, I’ll kiss the dirt of the land on which I was born and raised,' said Nadia Al-Debs, one of the many people gathered in makeshift tents in Gaza’s central city of Deir al-Balah preparing to set out for home in Gaza City the next day. 'We’ll return so my children can see their father.' Nafouz al-Rabai, another displaced woman in Deir al-Balah from al-Shati, along the coast in Gaza City, said the day she walks home will be a 'day of joy for us.' The return stirs bittersweet emotions. Al-Rabai acknowledged it would be painful to absorb the scale of damage to the home and the urban refugee camp she knew and loved. 'God knows if I’ll find (my house) standing or not,' she said. 'It’s a very bad life.' ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-israelis-await-names-of-next-4-hostages-to-be-released-by-hamas-as-part-of-the-ceasefire/	2025-01-24T03:26:11-08:00	
Kremlin scoffs at Trump's claim that a drop in oil prices will he...	MOSCOW (AP) — The Kremlin insisted Friday that a settlement in Ukraine couldn’t be facilitated by a drop in global oil prices as U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested. Speaking by video from the White House to the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said on Thursday that the OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries shares responsibility for the nearly three-year conflict in Ukraine because it has kept oil prices too high. 'If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately,' Trump said. Energy sales form a large part of Russia's earnings. Asked about Trump's comments, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov affirmed Moscow's view that the Ukrainian conflict was triggered by the West's refusal to take into account Russian security interests. 'The conflict doesn't depend on oil prices,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. 'The conflict is ongoing because of the threat to Russia’s national security, the threat to Russians living on those territories and the refusal by the Americans and the Europeans to listen to Russia’s security concerns. It’s not linked to oil prices.' He said Russian President Vladimir Putin remains ready for contacts with Trump. Peskov's comments echoed Putin’s statements that he had to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022 to fend off a threat to Russia’s security resulting from plans for Ukraine to join NATO and to protect Russian speakers living there. Ukraine and the West have denounced Moscow’s action as an unprovoked act of aggression. Asked to comment on Trump’s claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is ready for a peace deal, Peskov pointed out the Ukrainian leader’s earlier decision to rule out any talks with Moscow. 'Zelenskyy can’t be ready for a deal,' Peskov told reporters, adding that 'in order to reach a settlement it’s necessary to conduct talks, and Zelenskyy forbade himself to hold talks by his own decree.' On Wednesday, Trump threatened to impose stiff taxes, tariffs and sanctions on Russia if an agreement isn’t reached to end the war in Ukraine. Peskov said that the Kremlin was closely following Trump's statements and noted that he imposed a slew of sanctions during his first term. He said Moscow 'remains ready for an equal dialogue, for a mutually respectful dialogue.' 'This dialogue took place between the two presidents during Trump’s first presidency. And we are waiting for signals that we have not received yet,' Peskov said.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-kremlin-scoffs-at-trumps-claim-that-a-drop-in-oil-prices-will-help-end-ukraine-conflict/	2025-01-24T03:19:15-08:00	
Ukraine is reforming its recruitment efforts to attract younger s...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine is in the final stages of drafting recruitment reforms to attract 18- to 25-year-olds who are currently exempt from mobilization as it looks for ways to bolster its fighting force, the battlefield commander recently appointed to the President’s Office said. In his first interview with foreign media since taking up his new position last fall, Deputy Head of the Office of the President Colonel Pavlo Palisa said Ukraine is exploring new recruitment options because the current drafting system inherited from Soviet times is hindering progress. While Ukraine passed a mobilization law last spring and lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 years old, the measures have not had the impact needed to replenish its ranks or replace battlefield losses in its war with Russia. One initiative is what Palisa described as an 'honest contract,' a plan that includes financial incentives, clear guarantees for training, and measures to ensure dialogue between soldiers and their commanders. The plan is aimed at attracting mainly 18- to 25-year-olds who are currently exempt from mobilization, and will also target Ukrainians who have the right to deferment or were discharged after the mobilization law was passed. 'To secure the unit commander and the contract soldier, establish open and professional relations between them, and set clear boundaries that are understandable to both,' he said Wednesday. 'In my opinion, this is essential for effective dialogue.' The effort, which Palisa said is in its final stages, could help respond to calls aired by both the Biden and Trump administrations that Ukraine could expand its manpower by lowering the conscription age. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been adamantly opposed to implementing obligatory mobilization starting from 18 years old, saying doing so would radically affect the future prospects of the war-weary country. 'As of now, my view is that we need to start an open dialogue with society,' Palisa said. 'Because the defense of the state is not only the responsibility of the Armed Forces. It is the duty of every Ukrainian citizen, and it is their obligation.' Palisa said his office, in collaboration with the Cabinet and the Ministry of Defense, is reviewing why mobilization efforts have fallen short. 'We actually have a huge mobilization resource. In my opinion, at the moment, it is greater than what we currently need to address certain tasks on the frontline,' he said. 'The mechanism we currently have does not allow us to be as effective as we could be.' Palisa was taken straight from the battlefield to the president’s office, and he sees his appointment as an attempt to tackle systemic issues within the military. Part of a new generation of Ukrainian military leadership, he was studying at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. He graduated remotely in the summer of 2022 while fighting on the frontline. He then commanded the 93rd Brigade 'Kholodnyi Yar,' during the grueling nine-month battle for Bakhmut. 'This is a unique opportunity to bring pressing military issues to the attention of the country’s top leadership,' he said, adding that he intends to return to his battlefield role once his mission is complete. With Russia continuing to make incremental advances in the Donetsk region, some analysts have pointed to structural weaknesses in Ukraine’s command system and faltering communication between the units on the frontline as a key factor in its struggle to hold territory along the 1000 km (620 mile) frontline. Since the beginning of Moscow's full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s army has expanded significantly but years of resisting Russian advances has left little time for strategic management — a gap that now threatens to jeopardize Ukraine’s chances of success. Palisa says there's an urgent need for reforms to improve coordination and effectiveness. '(We need) to adapt the structure to the logic of modern warfare, which will allow us to be more effective and prevent us from making the same mistakes repeatedly,' he said. 'This is what needs to be done. There is no other way.'	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraine-is-reforming-its-recruitment-efforts-to-attract-younger-soldiers-and-boost-forces/	2025-01-23T20:07:49-08:00	
How the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal will unfold —and why it is so...	CAIRO (AP) — Israeli troops have pulled back to the edges of Gaza, the first hostages have been released and many Palestinians have returned to what remains of their homes in the first few days of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal. If it goes according to plan, there will be no fighting in Gaza for at least six weeks, and dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be freed, while more aid flows in. The question is if the ceasefire will survive beyond the first phase — and an appendix to the deal provided to The Associated Press reveals some of the tensions in it. Extending the ceasefire depends on even more negotiations meant to begin soon and eventually tackling the tough issue of how Gaza will be governed, with Israel still demanding the elimination of Hamas. Hanging over those talks is the possibility Israel could resume its campaign to destroy the militant group — even as dozens of hostages remain in its hands. Here is a look at the plan and the major challenges ahead. Israeli troops pull back and Palestinians return home As part of Phase 1, Israeli troops have pulled back into a buffer zone along Gaza’s borders with Israel. According to the appendix, which AP has verified, the buffer is 700 meters (about 0.4 mi) wide in most areas. That has allowed displaced Palestinians to begin to return to their homes, many of which were destroyed or heavily damaged by Israel’s campaign. But their return has been a complicated point in the negotiations. Israel long demanded it keep control over Palestinians’ movement to ensure Hamas does not move weapons back to northern Gaza close to Israeli communities. Throughout the war, the Israeli military had barred Palestinians from returning to the north by severing Gaza along the Netzarim corridor, a belt that runs east to west across the strip where troops cleared out the Palestinian population and set up bases. According to the appendix, Israel will start on Saturday allowing displaced Palestinians to return to the north without searches, but only on foot via the main north-south coastal road. In the coming weeks, it is supposed to open another route to foot traffic, without inspection. A private company — the details of which are yet to be formally announced — will search Palestinians returning in vehicles to prevent military hardware from reaching the north, according to the appendix. The document says this will also start from Saturday, but it is still unclear how it will work. The appendix was confirmed by multiple officials involved in the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. Swapping hostages for imprisoned Palestinians During the first phase, Hamas is set to free 33 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The first exchange took place Sunday with the release of three Israeli hostages and 90 Palestinian prisoners. By the end of the 42 days, all living women, children and older people held by the militants should be freed. Currently, some 94 hostages remain captive inside Gaza, a mix of civilians and soldiers and foreigners. The military believes at least a third them are dead. The next exchange is set for Saturday. After that, if the deal does not collapse, there will be weekly releases. The 33 will include women, children, sick people and those over 50 — almost all civilians, but the deal also commits Hamas to freeing all living female soldiers in Phase 1. Hamas will release living hostages first, but could release some bodies if they don't have enough living hostages in this category. In exchange, Israel will free 30 Palestinian women, children or older people for each living civilian hostage freed. The deal says those released will include more than 110 Palestinians serving life sentences. For each female soldier freed, Israel will release 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 serving life sentences. Many of the prisoners who will be released were convicted in deadly attacks. A number of Palestinian prisoners will be sent abroad or to Gaza, according to the deal, but it unclear who this will apply to and which country will accept them. According to the appendix, Israel will also release 1,000 people detained from Gaza since the war began, as long as they are not accused of involvement in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Dozens of male hostages, including soldiers, will remain captive in Gaza, pending the second phase. The Philadelphi corridor At the end of the first phase, Israel has also pledged to begin reducing its forces in the Philadelphi corridor, a strategic strip of territory along Gaza’s border with Egypt — and, according to the appendix, they will completely withdraw by Day 50. Israel's demand to maintain a long-term presence in the corridor while Hamas demanded a full withdrawal was one of the knottiest issues in the ceasefire negotiations. At the same time, the document states that the Rafah Crossing into Egypt will be reopened to allow wounded and sick Palestinians — including a few dozen wounded fighters, whose exit would have to be approved by Israel and Egypt — to be evacuated for treatment, but only when all the female hostages have been released, including female soldiers. An Israeli official told the AP that Israeli troops will not be drawn down in Gaza during the initial 42 days, only redistributed. The official, who spoke on condition anonymity to discuss close-door talks, also said that if it does reach a deal with Hamas on Phase 2 that meets Israel’s war aims, which include the full dismantling of the militant group, Israel will stay in the corridor. Humanitarian aid In the first phase, aid to Gaza is ramping up to hundreds of trucks a day of food, medicine, building supplies and fuel to alleviate the humanitarian crisis. This already has begun. The need is great. Malnutrition and diseases are rampant among Palestinians, while hospitals have been damaged and are short of supplies. Implementation, however, could bring problems. Even before the war, Israel restricted the entry of some equipment, arguing it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. Further complicating matters, Israel’s government is still committed to its plan to ban UNRWA — the U.N. agency that is the main distributor of aid in Gaza — from operating and to cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. Beyond Phase 1 Phase 2's broad outlines are laid out in the deal: All remaining hostages are to be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But that seemingly basic exchange opens up much bigger issues. Israel has said it won't agree to a complete withdrawal until Hamas’ military and political capabilities are eliminated. Hamas says it will not hand over the last hostages until Israel removes all troops from Gaza. So both sides will have to agree to a plan for governing Gaza. Hamas has said it would be willing to step aside, but it may still seek a hand in any future government, which Israel has vehemently rejected. And it is unlikely to give up its weapons. Israel has also rejected the alternative of having the Palestinian Authority govern Gaza. If all sides reach the third phase, it is likely to be less contentious: The bodies of remaining hostages would be returned in exchange for a three- to five-year reconstruction plan in Gaza, but who will pay for it also remains unclear. ___ Sewell reported from Beirut.

Middle East latest: Israeli forces kill 2 Palestinian militants w...	Israeli forces have killed two Palestinian militants who carried out a deadly attack on a bus in the West Bank earlier this month. The Israeli military said Thursday that the two men barricaded themselves in a structure in the West Bank village of Burqin and exchanged fire with Israeli troops before they were killed overnight. The army said a soldier was moderately wounded. The military said Mohammed Nazzal and Katiba al-Shalabi were operatives with the Islamic Jihad militant group. The Hamas militant group released a statement claiming the two men were members of its armed wing and praising the bus attack. Hamas and the smaller and more radical Islamic Jihad are allies that sometimes carry out attacks together. The Jan. 6 attack on the bus carrying Israelis killed three people and wounded six others. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. ___ Here's the latest: 24-year-old Hamas attack survivor will represent Israel at Eurovision TEL AVIV — A survivor of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack will represent Israel at the Eurovision Song Contest to be held in Switzerland in May. Yuval Raphael, 24, won first place in a singing contest on Israeli television that determines Israel’s entry to Eurovision, a pan-continental pop extravaganza. She won with a performance of the Swedish group ABBA’s pop hit 'Dancing Queen,' which she dedicated to the victims of the attack. Raphael survived the Nova music festival in southern Israel as Palestinian militants stormed the event, killing hundreds and taking many hostage during Hamas’ cross-border raid. She has testified in the Israeli parliament about her experience on Oct. 7. She described hiding from gunmen under piles of dead bodies for eight hours, and said 'I’m going to deal with this thing for the rest of my life.' Last year’s Eurovision was overshadowed by the war in Gaza, with large demonstrations protesting Israel’s participation. Israel’s representative, Eden Golan, who ended up taking fifth place in the competition, was kept under tight security. Israel will not compromise on dismantling Hamas, foreign minister says BUDAPEST, Hungary - Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Thursday that Israel would not compromise on its objectives of dismantling Hamas’ military and governing capabilities, and that there were no guarantees for the success of the three-phase cease fire in the war in the Gaza Strip. Speaking alongside his Hungarian counterpart in Budapest, Hungary, Saar said Hamas leaders had declared their intent to carry out more attacks on Israel similar to the deadly raids on Oct. 7, 2023, and could therefore not be allowed to retain any military capabilities. 'They are committed to the idea of eliminating the Jewish state,' Saar said. 'Israel will not accept Hamas’ rule in Gaza. As long as Hamas remains in power, there will be no peace, security or stability in the Middle East.' 'We hope that the framework for the hostage release will continue until its end, but of course I cannot guarantee that,' he continued. 'We will not abandon our objectives.' Heavy rain and floods worsen misery for Palestinians displaced in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Although the ceasefire in Gaza has brought an influx of humanitarian aid and a rare respite from Israeli bombardment, it has done little to change the miserable conditions endured by most of the 2 million people displaced by fighting. The winter weather has compounded the hardships of those eking out an existence in tattered tents and makeshift shelters. Heavy rains were flooding tents across the territory, leaving Palestinians shivering in the cold. At one makeshift camp in the central city of Deir al-Balah, the downpour Thursday quickly soaked through flimsy tents that seemed to float on pools of muck. Some used sandbags to keep their tents from washing away, while others tried to clear the huge puddles of mud outside their shelters. Barefoot children trod through paths that had become filthy rivers. A cacophony of coughs emanated from every corner, raising concerns about the spread of illness. Tareq Deifallah, a displaced resident in Deir al-Balah originally from Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza, said water was seeping through his tent from all sides. He said 'the truce is useless' when it came to changing his living conditions. 'Before the truce we were suffering, after the truce we are suffering, from the rain and the winter,' Deifallah said. Monira Faraj, a mother of two young girls, said rain flooded her tent and soaked through her mattress as her family was sleeping. 'We’re afraid we’re going to drown if it becomes too much,' she said. Residents of the tent camp said they had no choice but to stay put. Even though the ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war that took effect Sunday allows Palestinians displaced by the fighting to return to their homes, those who set out to check on their houses in recent days said they found only ruins. Commercial plane from Turkey lands in Damascus for first time in 13 years DAMASCUS, Syria — A commercial plane from Turkey landed in Damascus for the first time in 13 years on Thursday, Syrian state media said. The Turkish Airlines plane flew from Istanbul to the Syrian capital, SANA reported, two weeks after the first international commercial flight landed, from Qatar, since former Syrian President Bashar Assad’s fall. Ankara backed opposition groups in northwestern Syria that fought against Assad and his allies during the uprising-turned-conflict and never restored ties, even when most Mideast countries did in 2023. Now Turkey, a key ally of the new authorities under the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, has expressed its intention to invest in Syria’s economy and help its ailing electricity and energy sectors. Israel's ambassador to US says the 2 countries are discussing Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon JERUSALEM — Israel’s ambassador to the United States says the two countries are in talks about the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon as a deadline in the ceasefire with Hezbollah militants approaches. Israeli media have reported that Israel is seeking to postpone the completion of its pullout. Michael Herzog said in an interview with Israeli Army Radio on Thursday that he believed Israel would 'reach an understanding' with the Trump administration, without elaborating. Under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that ended more than a year of fighting linked to the war in the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces are supposed to complete their withdrawal from southern Lebanon by Sunday. Israeli media have reported that Israel reached an understanding with the Biden administration on staying longer but that President Donald Trump is urging it to withdraw on time. There was no immediate comment from the United States. Israeli officials have said Lebanese troops are not deploying fast enough in the areas Israeli troops are supposed to vacate. Under the ceasefire, the Lebanese army is to patrol a buffer zone in southern Lebanon alongside United Nations peacekeepers. Hezbollah has threatened to resume its rocket and drone fire if Israel does not withdraw on time. Al Jazeera says the Palestinian Authority arrested one of its reporters The Al Jazeera news network says the Palestinian Authority arrested one of its reporters after preventing him from covering an Israeli operation in the occupied West Bank. The Qatar-based news network reported Thursday that its reporter, Mohammed al-Atrash, was arrested from his home. It said Palestinian security forces had earlier prevented him from reporting on a large Israeli military operation in Jenin, an epicenter of Israeli-Palestinian violence in recent years. The Palestinian Authority launched its own crackdown on militants in the city late last year. There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian Authority. Both Israel and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority banned Al Jazeera last year. Israel accuses it of being a mouthpiece of Hamas over its coverage of the war in the Gaza Strip and says some of its reporters are also militants. The pan-Arab broadcaster has rejected the allegations and accused both Israel and the Palestinian Authority of trying to silence critical coverage. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and cooperates with Israel on security matters. It is unpopular among Palestinians, with critics portraying it as a corrupt and authoritarian ally of Israel. Israel’s Netanyahu will probably visit Trump in the next few weeks, official says UNITED NATIONS – Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations believes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Washington to meet President Donald Trump 'in a few weeks.' Danny Danon told reporters Wednesday: 'I’m sure he would be one of the first foreign leaders invited to the White House.' Danon said he expects their discussions to include the current ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and the release of hostages taken during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack in southern Israel.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-al-jazeera-says-the-palestinian-authority-arrested-one-of-its-reporters/	2025-01-23T03:09:39-08:00	
NATO chief says Russian victory over Ukraine would have a costly ...	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned on Thursday that a Russian victory over Ukraine would undermine the dissuasive force of the world’s biggest military alliance and that its credibility could cost trillions to restore. NATO has been ramping up its forces along its eastern flank with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, deploying thousands of troops and equipment to deter Moscow from expanding its war into the territory of any of the organization’s 32 member countries. 'If Ukraine loses then to restore the deterrence of the rest of NATO again, it will be a much, much higher price than what we are contemplating at this moment in terms of ramping up our spending and ramping up our industrial production,' Rutte said. 'It will not be billions extra; it will be trillions extra,' he said, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Rutte insisted that Ukraine’s Western backers must 'step up and not scale back the support' they are providing to the country, almost three years after Russia’s full-fledged invasion began. 'We have to change the trajectory of the war,' Rutte said, adding that the West 'cannot allow in the 21st century that one country invades another country and tries to colonize it.' 'We are beyond those days,' he said. Anxiety in Europe is mounting that U.S. President Donald Trump might seek to quickly end the war in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on terms that are unfavorable to Ukraine, but Rutte appeared wary about trying to do things in a hurry. 'If we got a bad deal, it would only mean that we will see the president of Russia high-fiving with the leaders from North Korea, Iran and China and we cannot accept that,' the former Dutch prime minister said. 'That would be geopolitically a big, big mistake.' Trump’s new envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, criticized allies who talk of continuing the war but still won’t increase their defense spending to NATO guidelines. He said Americans think it is 'outrageous' that the Biden administration refused to talk to Putin. NATO leaders have agreed that each member country should spend at least 2% of gross domestic product on their military budgets. The alliance estimates that 23 members will reach that level this year, although almost a third will still fall short. Poland and Estonia spend most in GDP terms. 'You cannot ask the American people to expand the umbrella of NATO when the current members aren’t paying their fair share,' Grenell said. The United States spends most within NATO on its own budget, in dollar terms, and allies rely on its military might for their defense. 'When we have leaders who are going to talk about more war, we need to make sure that those leaders are spending the right amount of money,' Grenell said. 'We need to be able to avoid war, and that means a credible threat from NATO.' He also insisted that former President Joe Biden was wrong not to talk to Putin, who was indicted for war crimes in 2023 by the International Criminal Court for the 'unlawful deportation' of children from Ukraine to Russia. 'You should be able to talk to people,' Grenell said. 'Talking is a tactic, and you’re not going to be able to solve problems peacefully unless you actually have conversations,' he said. Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski welcomed Trump's acknowledgement that it must be Russia which should make the first peace moves, but he cautioned that 'this is not the Putin that President Trump knew in his first term.' On Wednesday, Trump threatened to impose stiff taxes, tariffs and sanctions on Moscow if an agreement isn’t reached to end the war, but that warning will probably fall on deaf ears in the Kremlin. Russia's economy is already weighed down by a multitude of U.S. and European sanctions. Sikorksi warned that Putin should not be put at the center of the world stage over Ukraine. 'The president of the United States is the leader of the free world. Vladimir Putin is an outcast and an indicted war criminal for stealing Ukrainian children,' Sikorski said. 'I would suggest that Putin has to earn the summit, that if he gets it early, it elevates him beyond his, significance and gives him the wrong idea about the trajectory of this,' he said.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-nato-chief-says-russian-victory-over-ukraine-would-have-a-costly-impact-on-alliances-credibility/	2025-01-23T01:35:00-08:00	
Why is Israel launching a crackdown in the West Bank after the Ga...	In the days since a fragile ceasefire took hold in the Gaza Strip, Israel has launched a major military operation in the occupied West Bank and suspected Jewish settlers have rampaged through two Palestinian towns. The violence comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces domestic pressure from his far-right allies after agreeing to the truce and hostage-prisoner exchange with the Hamas militant group. U.S. President Donald Trump has, meanwhile, rescinded the Biden administration's sanctions against Israelis accused of violence in the territory. It's a volatile mix that could undermine the ceasefire, which is set to last for at least six weeks and bring about the release of dozens of hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, most of whom will be released into the West Bank. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, and Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Escalations in one area frequently spill over, raising further concerns that the second and far more difficult phase of the Gaza ceasefire — which has yet to be negotiated — may never come. A rampage and a military raid Dozens of masked men rampaged through two Palestinian villages in the northern West Bank late Monday, hurling stones and setting cars and property ablaze, according to local Palestinian officials. The Red Crescent emergency service said 12 people were beaten and wounded. Israeli forces, meanwhile, carried out a raid elsewhere in the West Bank that the military said was in response to the hurling of firebombs at Israeli vehicles. It said several suspects were detained for questioning, and a video circulating online appeared to show dozens being marched through the streets. On Tuesday, the Israeli military launched another major operation, this time in the northern West Bank city of Jenin, where its forces have regularly clashed with Palestinian militants in recent years, even before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip triggered the war there. At least nine Palestinians were killed on Tuesday, including a 16-year-old, and 40 were wounded, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The military said its forces carried out airstrikes and dismantled roadside bombs and 'hit' 10 militants — though it was not clear what that meant. Palestinian residents have reported a major increase in Israeli checkpoints and delays across the territory. Israel, meanwhile, says threats from the West Bank against its citizens are on the rise. Earlier this month, Palestinian gunmen opened fire on motorists there, killing three Israelis, including two women in their 70s. That attack fueled calls from settler leaders for a crackdown in the territory. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz cast the Jenin operation as part of Israel's larger struggle against Iran and its militant allies across the region, saying 'we will strike the octopus' arms until they snap.' The Palestinians view such operations and the expansion of settlements as ways of cementing Israeli control over the territory, where 3 million Palestinians live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering cities and towns. Prominent human rights groups call it a form of apartheid since the over 500,000 Jewish settlers in the territory have all the rights conferred by Israeli citizenship. Israel rejects those allegations. Netanyahu's far-right partners are up in arms Netanyahu has been struggling to quell a rebellion by his ultranationalist coalition partners since agreeing to the ceasefire. The agreement requires Israeli forces to withdraw from most of Gaza and release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners — including militants convicted of murder — in exchange for hostages abducted in the Oct. 7 attack. One coalition partner, Itamar Ben-Gvir, resigned in protest the day the ceasefire went into effect. Another, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to bolt if Israel does not resume the war after the first phase of the ceasefire is slated to end in early March. They want Israel to annex the West Bank and to rebuild settlements in Gaza while encouraging what they refer to as the voluntary migration of large numbers of Palestinians. Netanyahu still has a parliamentary majority after Ben-Gvir's departure, but the loss of Smotrich — who is also the de facto governor of the West Bank — would severely weaken his coalition and likely lead to early elections. That could spell the end of Netanyahu's nearly unbroken 16 years in power, leaving him even more exposed to longstanding corruption charges and an expected public inquiry into Israel's failure to prevent the Oct. 7 attack. Trump's return could give settlers a freer hand Trump's return to the White House offers Netanyahu a potential lifeline. The newly sworn-in president, who lent unprecedented support to Israel during his previous term, has surrounded himself with aides who support Israeli settlement. Some support the settlers' claim to a biblical right to the West Bank because of the Jewish kingdoms that existed there in antiquity. The international community overwhelmingly considers settlements illegal. Among the flurry of executive orders Trump signed on his first day back in office was one rescinding the Biden administration's sanctions on settlers and Jewish extremists accused of violence against Palestinians. The sanctions — which had little effect — were one of the few concrete steps the Biden administration took in opposition to the close U.S. ally, even as it provided billions of dollars in military support for Israel's campaign in Gaza, among the deadliest and most destructive in decades. Trump claimed credit for helping to get the Gaza ceasefire agreement across the finish line in the final days of the Biden presidency. But this week, Trump said he was 'not confident' it would hold and signaled he would give Israel a free hand in Gaza, saying: 'It's not our war, it's their war.' ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-why-is-israel-launching-a-crackdown-in-the-west-bank-after-the-gaza-ceasefire/	2025-01-22T05:39:05-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israel says it will maintain control of Gaza-...	Israel said it will maintain control of the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip during the first phase of the ceasefire with Hamas. A statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Wednesday denied reports that the Palestinian Authority would control the crossing. The truce, now in its fourth day, is supposed to bring calm to the war-battered Gaza for at least six weeks and see 33 Hamas-held hostages released in return for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The statement said European Union monitors would supervise the crossing, which will be surrounded by Israeli troops. Israel also will approve the movement of all people and goods. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages still remain in Gaza, after the rest were released, rescued, or their bodies were recovered. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities but do not say how many of the dead were fighters. Israel says it killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the latest: Yemen’s Houthi rebels release crew of commercial vessel seized in 2023 DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels said they released the crew of the Galaxy Leader, a ship they seized in November 2023 at the start of their campaign in the Red Sea corridor. The rebels said Wednesday they released the sailors after mediation by Oman. The crew of 25 included mariners from the Philippines, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Mexico. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels said they hijacked the ship over its connection to Israel. They then had a campaign targeting ships in international waters, which only stopped with the recent ceasefire in Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel says it will keep control of the Rafah crossing with Egypt JERUSALEM — Israel says it will maintain control of the Rafah crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip during the first phase of the ceasefire with Hamas. A statement issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Wednesday denied reports that the Palestinian Authority would control the crossing. It said local Palestinians not affiliated with Hamas who had been vetted by Israeli security would merely stamp passports at the crossing. It noted that, under international agreements, this stamp 'is the only way Gazans may leave the Strip in order to enter, or be received in, other countries.' The statement said Israeli forces would surround the crossing and that Israel must approve the movement of all people and goods through it. It said European Union monitors would supervise the crossing. Israel captured the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing last May, forcing it to shut down. Egypt, a key mediator in more than a year of negotiations that led to the ceasefire, has demanded that Palestinians control the Gaza side. UN says aid is flowing smoothly into Gaza UNITED NATIONS – The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Gaza says trucks from the U.N., aid groups, governments and the private sector are arriving and no major looting has been reported -– just a few minor incidents. Nearly 900 trucks of aid entered Gaza on the third day of the ceasefire Tuesday, the United Nations said. That's significantly higher than the 600 trucks called for in the deal. Muhannad Hadi, who returned to Jerusalem from Gaza on Tuesday afternoon, told U.N. reporters by video that it was one of the happiest days of his 35-year humanitarian career to see Palestinians in the streets looking ahead with hope, some heading home and some starting to clean up the roads. In his talks with families at a communal kitchen run by the U.N. World Food Program and elsewhere, he said, they all told him they need humanitarian assistance but want to go home, to work and earn money. 'They don’t like the fact that they have been depending on humanitarian aid,' Hadi said. Palestinians talked about resuming education for their children and about the need for shelter, blankets and new clothes for women who have been wearing the same clothes for more than a year. He said a shipment of tents is expected in the coming days.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-israel-says-it-will-maintain-control-of-gaza-egypt-crossing/	2025-01-22T05:26:14-08:00	
Russia warns Trump against seizing Panama Canal	(The Hill) - Russia warned President Trump on Tuesday against seizing the Panama Canal, after he reiterated his intent to take control of the strategic waterway in his second inaugural address Monday. 'We expect that during the expected discussions between the leadership of Panama and US President Donald Trump on issues of control over the Panama Canal, which certainly falls within the sphere of their bilateral relations, the parties will respect the current international legal regime of this key waterway,' said Alexander Shchetinin, director of the Latin American Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, according to Russian state media outlet, TASS. Shchetinin reaffirmed Russia’s commitment to the neutrality of the critical trade route and said it expects both America and Panama to continue respecting that agreement. Miraflores Locks on the Panama canal (Getty Images file) 'Russia has been a party to the protocol since 1988 and confirms its obligations to observe the permanent neutrality of the Panama Canal, advocating for keeping this international transit waterway safe and open.' Trump’s pledge to take control of the canal has been a central theme of his recent rhetoric, paired with expansionist designs on Greenland, a Danish overseas territory, and apparent tongue-in-cheek references to making Canada the '51st state.' 'American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal,' Trump said Monday. Panama has full control of the canal itself, but Hutchison Ports PPC, a Hong Kong-based company, controls two ports at either end of the canal. While Hutchison and CK Hutchison Holdings, its parent company, are not owned by the Chinese government, they are subject to the national security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in 2020. Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino responded Monday to Trump’s remarks by rejecting Trump’s vow to retake the canal, saying, it 'is and will remain Panama’s and its administration will remain under Panamanian control with respect to its permanent neutrality.' Mulino also pushed back against the suggestion that China had outsized influence over the canal and said, 'There is no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration.' The United States built the canal in the early 1900s and relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by former President Carter. Shchetinin noted that under the agreement, 'each of the two countries must protect the canal from any threat to the neutrality regime.' 'At the same time, a reservation was made that the said right of the United States to defend the Panama Canal does not mean and should not be interpreted as the right to interfere in the internal affairs of Panama, and any actions by the American side will never be directed against the territorial integrity or political independence of Panama,' Shchetinin added.

Israel's top general resigns over Oct. 7 failures as it launches ...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's top general resigned on Tuesday, citing the security and intelligence failures related to Hamas' surprise attack that triggered the war in the Gaza Strip. Israel meanwhile launched a large operation in the occupied West Bank, killing at least eight people, according to Palestinian officials. Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi is the most senior Israeli figure to resign over the security breakdown on Oct. 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led militants carried out a land, sea and air assault into southern Israel, rampaging through army bases and nearby communities. The attack killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and the militants abducted another 250. More than 90 captives are still held in Gaza, around a third are believed to be dead. Halevi's resignation came just days into a fragile ceasefire with Hamas that could lead to an end to the 15-month war and the return of remaining captives. Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, head of Israel's Southern Command, which oversees operations in Gaza, also tendered his resignation. The resignations will likely add to calls for a public inquiry into the Oct. 7 failures, something Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — whose leadership could be implicated — has said must wait until the war is over. Halevi had appeared to be at odds with Israel's new defense minister, Israel Katz, over the direction of the war, saying Israel had accomplished most of its goals while Katz echoed Netanyahu's vow to keep fighting until 'total victory' over Hamas. Halevi's resignation letter said the military, under his command, had 'failed in its mission to defend the State of Israel' when Hamas attacked but made 'significant achievements' in the war that has rippled across the Middle East. He said his resignation would go into effect March 6. Another major operation in the West Bank The ceasefire that started Sunday does not apply to the West Bank, where Israel announced a 'significant and broad military operation' against Palestinian militants in Jenin, without details. The city has seen repeated Israeli incursions and gunbattles with militants in recent years, even before the outbreak of the Gaza war. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least eight people were killed and 35 wounded. It does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its tally. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek an independent state encompassing all three territories. The West Bank has seen a surge of violence since the start of the war in Gaza. Israeli troops have carried out near-daily raids that often ignite gunbattles. There has also been a rise in attacks on Palestinians by Jewish extremists — including a rampage in two Palestinian villages overnight Monday — as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis. Hamas condemned the Israeli operation in Jenin, calling on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to step up their attacks. The smaller and more radical Islamic Jihad militant group also condemned the operation, saying it reflected Israel's 'failure to achieve its goals in Gaza.' It said it was also a 'desperate attempt' by Netanyahu to save his governing coalition. Netanyahu faces domestic criticism over ceasefire Netanyahu has faced criticism from far-right allies over the ceasefire, which requires Israeli troops to pull back from populated areas in Gaza and envisions the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including militants convicted of involvement in deadly attacks on Israelis. The ceasefire is supposed to last for six weeks and see 33 hostages gradually released in return for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Three hostages and 90 prisoners were released on Sunday, when it took effect. The next release is Saturday. The truce has already seen Hamas return to the streets, showing that it remains in control of the territory despite the war killing tens of thousands of Palestinians — including some Hamas leaders — and causing widespread devastation. One of Netanyahu's erstwhile partners, Itamar Ben-Gvir, quit the government the day the ceasefire went into effect, weakening the coalition but still leaving Netanyahu with a parliamentary majority. Another, far-right leader, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to leave if Israel does not resume the war after the ceasefire's first phase. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities but do not say how many of the dead were fighters. Israel says it killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Gaza's Health Ministry said 72 bodies had been taken to hospitals in the past 24 hours, almost all of them recovered from attacks before the ceasefire. An unknown number of bodies remain unreachable because they are in northern Gaza, where access remains restricted, or in buffer zones where Israeli forces are. Over 900 trucks of aid entered Gaza on the second day of the ceasefire Monday, the United Nations said — significantly higher than the 600 trucks called for in the deal — in a rush to supply food, medicines and other needs it has described as 'staggering' for the population of over 2 million people. 'Most importantly, we want things that will warm us in winter,' one of the many displaced Palestinians, Mounir Abu Seiam, said Tuesday as people gathered in the southern city of Khan Younis to receive food. ___ Tufaha reported from Jenin, West Bank.

Suspected settlers attacked Palestinian villages hours before Tru...	JINSAFUT, West Bank (AP) — Shortly after suspected Jewish settlers stormed Palestinian villages in the occupied West Bank late Monday, setting cars and property ablaze, U.S. President Donald Trump canceled sanctions against Israelis accused of violence in the territory. The reversal of the Biden administration's sanctions, which were meant to punish radical settlers, could set the tone for a presidency that is expected to be more tolerant of Israel's expansion of settlements and of violence toward Palestinians. In Trump's previous term he lavished support on Israel, and he has once again surrounded himself with aides who back the settlers. Settler leaders rushed to praise Trump’s decision on the sanctions, which were first imposed nearly a year ago as violence surged during the war in Gaza. The sanctions were later expanded to include other Israelis seen as violent or radical. Finance Minister and settler firebrand Bezalel Smotrich called it a just decision, saying the sanctions were a 'severe and blatant foreign intervention.' In a post on social media platform X, he went on to praise Trump's 'unwavering and uncompromising support for the state of Israel.' The West Bank's 3 million Palestinians already live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority administering cities and towns. Smotrich and other hard-line settler leaders want Israel to annex the West Bank and rebuild settlements in Gaza, territories that Israel seized during the 1967 Mideast war. Palestinians want both territories for a future state and have long viewed the settlements as a major obstacle to peace, while the international community overwhelmingly considers them illegal. There are more than 500,000 settlers in the West Bank who have Israeli citizenship. Late Monday, dozens of masked men who are widely believed to be settlers marauded through at least two Palestinian villages and attacked homes and businesses, according to officials in Jinsafut and Al-Funduq, which are roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Jerusalem. The Palestinian Red Crescent said it treated 12 people who were beaten by the men. It gave no details on their condition. Israel’s military said the men hurled rocks at soldiers who had arrived to disperse them, and that it had launched an investigation. Violence has surged in the West Bank during the Gaza war, so it was not clear if the attack had any link to the inauguration. On Tuesday, meanwhile, Israel launched a deadly raid on the Jenin refugee camp. Jalal Bashir, the head of Jinsafut’s village council, said that the men attacked three houses, a nursery and a carpentry shop located on the village’s main road. Louay Tayem, head of the local council in Al-Funduq, said dozens of men had fired shots, thrown stones, burned cars, and attacked homes and shops. 'The settlers were masked and had incendiary materials,' said Bashir. 'Their numbers were large and unprecedented.' On Tuesday, the charred shells of cars lay on the side of the road in Jinsafut and residents surveyed the damage to a burned storage space. Growing impunity, even after Biden's sanctions Biden’s executive order against the settlers marked a rare break with America’s closest Middle East ally, and signaled his frustration with what critics say is Israel’s leniency in dealing with violent settlers. Rights groups say that impunity has deepened since Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz exempted settlers from what is known as administrative detention — Israel's practice of detaining individuals on security grounds without charge or trial — which is routinely used against Palestinians. Katz, who freed all Israelis held in administrative detention just last week, said those behind Monday's attack should be held accountable in Israel's more transparent criminal justice system. Palestinian residents, meanwhile, are tried in Israeli military courts. Biden’s sanctions were aimed at settlers who were involved in acts of violence, as well as threats against and attempts to destroy or seize Palestinian property. They later were broadened to include other groups, including Tzav 9, an activist organization that was accused of disrupting the flow of aid into Gaza by trying to block trucks heading into the territory. Reut Ben-Chaim, a mother of eight who founded the group and was then slapped with sanctions that crippled her wellness company and prohibited her access to credit cards or banking apps, welcomed Trump’s step. 'We have heard in the last few days that the Trump administration is going to be the most pro-Israel there has been,' she told The Associated Press. 'These actions, such as the removal of the sanctions … these are actions that already mark the way forward.' Support for Israel could clash with wider ambitions Trump has long boasted of his support for Israel, but he has also pledged to end wars in the Middle East that could require exerting some pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Even before taking office, Trump appears to have pressed Netanyahu to accept a Gaza ceasefire agreement with Hamas that strongly resembled one the Biden administration had been pushing for months. Trump has also said he hopes to bring Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords, under which the United Arab Emirates and other Arab countries forged ties with Israel during his first term. The Saudis have said they will only sign such a historic agreement if it includes a pathway to a Palestinian state — a nonstarter for Netanyahu's government. During his first term, Trump moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, recognized Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights — which it captured from Syria in the 1967 war — and presented a Mideast peace plan that was seen as overwhelmingly favorable to Israel. He also let settlement construction in the West Bank surge unchecked. But he seemed at the time to have tapped the brakes on Netanyahu's plans to annex large parts of the West Bank, something Israel's far-right settlers have demanded for years. Netanyahu said he temporarily shelved the idea as part of the agreement with the UAE. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-suspected-settlers-attacked-palestinian-villages-hours-before-trump-rescinded-biden-sanctions/	2025-01-21T05:59:38-08:00

A major Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday left at least six dead and dozens wounded, Palestinian health officials said, as a fragile ceasefire in Gaza entered its third day. The operation was centered in the city of Jenin, which has seen repeated Israeli incursions and gunbattles with militants in recent years, even before Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the war in Gaza. The Israeli military announced a 'significant and broad military operation' in the West Bank, just days into a ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza that is supposed to last for six weeks and see 33 militant-held hostages released in return for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 800 people have been killed in Israeli raids in the West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war. ___ Here's the latest: Israel's top general resigns over failure to stop Hamas attack JERUSALEM — Israel’s top general has resigned, citing the security failures that allowed Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi is the most prominent Israeli official to resign over the attack. He announced his resignation Tuesday, just days into a fragile ceasefire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Trump rescinds sanctions on far-right Israeli settlers WASHINGTON — Among other Biden-era executive orders that President Trump rescinded Monday is one that authorizes sanctions on people who undermine peace in the occupied West Bank. The Biden administration used the executive order to impose a handful of sanctions on extremist settlers accused of using violence against Palestinians who live in the West Bank after violence erupted after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attacks on Israel. Settlers in the territory have celebrated the incoming Trump administration, believing it will take a more favorable approach to illegal settlements. During his first term, Trump took unprecedented steps to support Israel’s territorial claims, including recognizing Jerusalem as its capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there, and recognizing Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights. Trump not confident ceasefire in Gaza will hold WASHINGTON — Trump said Hamas is weakened, but he’s hardly certain that the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas will hold. 'I’m not confident,' Trump told reporters. 'That’s not our war. It’s their war.' He said that his administration 'might' help rebuild Gaza, which he compared to a 'massive demolition site.' 'Some beautiful things could be done with it,' said Trump, the real estate developer turned commander in chief, noting the territory’s coastline and 'phenomenal' weather and location. 'Some fantastic things could be done with Gaza. Some beautiful things could be done with Gaza.' Major influx of aid into Gaza on second day of ceasefire, UN says UNITED NATIONS — Gaza has received a major influx of aid and goods, with 915 trucks crossing into the territory on the second day of the ceasefire, the United Nations said. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said colleagues in Gaza informed the U.N. that 915 trucks – significantly higher than the 600 trucks called for in the ceasefire – entered Gaza on Monday, based on information from Israeli authorities and the guarantors of the ceasefire agreement. U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said Sunday the needs in Gaza are staggering and his office said Monday that aid workers are ramping up the delivery of food, clean water, shelter materials and other essential supplies. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports that the more than 2 million people in Gaza, about half of them children, depend on this aid, Haq said. The World Health Organization, meanwhile, has a 60-day plan to increase beds and deploy overseas health workers to Gaza hospitals, but some 30,000 Palestinians have life-changing injuries and need specialized care, Haq said.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-middle-east-latest-2-killed-in-an-israeli-strike-in-the-west-bank-palestinians-say/	2025-01-21T05:22:15-08:00	
Palestinians confront a landscape of destruction in Gaza's 'ghost...	RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinians in Gaza are confronting an apocalyptic landscape of devastation after a ceasefire paused more than 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas. Across the tiny coastal enclave, where built-up refugee camps are interspersed between cities, drone footage captured by The Associated Press shows mounds of rubble stretching as far as the eye can see — remnants of the longest and deadliest war between Israel and Hamas in their blood-ridden history. 'As you can see, it became a ghost town,' said Hussein Barakat, 38, whose home in the southern city of Rafah was flattened. 'There is nothing,' he said, as he sat drinking coffee on a brown armchair perched on the rubble of his three-story home, in a surreal scene. Critics say Israel has waged a campaign of scorched earth to destroy the fabric of life in Gaza, accusations that are being considered in two global courts, including the crime of genocide. Israel denies those charges and says its military has been fighting a complex battle in dense urban areas and that it tries to avoid causing undue harm to civilians and their infrastructure. Military experts say the reality is complicated. 'For a campaign of this duration, which is a year’s worth of fighting in a heavily urban environment where you have an adversary that is hiding in amongst that environment, then you would expect an extremely high level of damage,' said Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a British think-tank. Savill said that it was difficult to draw a broad conclusion about the nature of Israel's campaign. To do so, he said, would require each strike and operation to be assessed to determine whether they adhered to the laws of armed conflict and whether all were proportional, but he did not think the scorched earth description was accurate. International rights groups. including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, view the vast destruction as part of a broader pattern of extermination and genocide directed at Palestinians in Gaza, a charge Israel denies. The groups dispute Israel's stance that the destruction was a result of military activity. Human Rights Watch, in a November report accusing Israel of crimes against humanity, said 'the destruction is so substantial that it indicates the intention to permanently displace many people.' From a fierce air campaign during the first weeks of the war, to a ground invasion that sent thousands of troops in on tanks, the Israeli response to a Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, has ground down much of the civilian infrastructure of the Gaza Strip, displacing 90% of its population. The brilliant color of pre-war life has faded into a monotone cement gray that dominates the territory. It could take decades, if not more, to rebuild. Airstrikes throughout the war toppled buildings and other structures said to be housing militants. But the destruction intensified with the ground forces, who fought Hamas fighters in close combat in dense areas. If militants were seen firing from an apartment building near a troop maneuver, forces might take the entire building down to thwart the threat. Tank tracks chewed up paved roads, leaving dusty stretches of earth in their wake. The military’s engineering corps was tasked with using bulldozers to clear routes, downing buildings seen as threats, and blowing up Hamas’ underground tunnel network. Experts say the operations to neutralize tunnels were extremely destructive to surface infrastructure. For example, if a 1.5-kilometer (1-mile) long tunnel was blown up by Israeli forces, it would not spare homes or buildings above, said Michael Milshtein, a former Israeli army intelligence officer. 'If (the tunnel) passes under an urban area, it all gets destroyed,' he said. 'There’s no other way to destroy a tunnel.' Cemeteries, schools, hospitals and more were targeted and destroyed, he said, because Hamas was using these for military purposes. Secondary blasts from Hamas explosives inside these buildings could worsen the damage. The way Israel has repeatedly returned to areas it said were under its control, only to have militants overrun it again, has exacerbated the destruction, Savill said. That’s evident especially in northern Gaza, where Israel launched a new campaign in early October that almost obliterated Jabaliya, a built up, urban refugee camp. Jabaliya is home to the descendants of Palestinians who fled, or were forced to flee, during the war that led to Israel‘s creation in 1948. Milshtein said Israel's dismantling of the tunnel network is also to blame for the destruction there. But the destruction was not only caused from strikes on targets. Israel also carved out a buffer zone about a kilometer inside Gaza from its border with Israel, as well as within the Netzarim corridor that bisects north Gaza from the south, and along the Philadelphi Corridor, a stretch of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Vast swaths in these areas were leveled. Amir Avivi, a retired Israeli general, said the buffer zones were an operational necessity meant to carve out secure plots of land for Israeli forces. He denied Israel had cleared civilian areas indiscriminately. The destruction, like the civilian death toll in Gaza, has raised accusations that Israel committed war crimes, which it denies. The decisions the military made in choosing what to topple, and why, are an important factor in that debate. 'The second militants move into a building and start using it to fire on you, you start making a calculation about whether or not you can strike,' Savill said. Downing the building, he said, 'still needs to be necessary.' ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-palestinians-confront-a-landscape-of-destruction-in-gazas-ghost-towns/	2025-01-21T05:02:29-08:00	
Middle East latest: Released Israeli hostage says she has 'return...	One of the Israeli hostages freed on the first day of the Gaza ceasefire said Monday in her first comments since being released that she has 'returned to life.' Emily Damari, 28, was one of three hostages freed Sunday after spending 471 days in captivity. Officials at a hospital that received them said their condition was stable. Officials tout Gaza ceasefire, hostage deal as Israel says details still in flux In an Instagram story, which was shared by Israeli media, Damari thanked her family and the large protest movement that coalesced to advocate for the release of the hostages. 'Thank you thank you thank you I’m the happiest in the world,' she said. Damari, a dual Israeli-British citizen, returned from captivity with a bandage on one hand, and authorities said she had lost two fingers during Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, 2023. As she arrived to a hospital on Sunday, she waved at a crowd that had gathered and footage later showed her joyfully reuniting with her family. WATCH: Video of 3 Israeli hostages held by Hamas released on first day of ceasefire. Who are they? Her mother, Mandy Damari, said in a statement later Monday that Damari was 'doing much better than any of us could ever have anticipated.' The three Israeli hostages left Hamas captivity on Sunday and returned to Israel, and dozens of Palestinian prisoners walked free from Israeli jail, leaving both Israelis and Palestinians torn between celebration and trepidation as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took hold. Palestinians trek across rubble to return to their homes as Gaza ceasefire takes hold Here's the latest: Israeli soldier killed in West Bank JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says a soldier was killed and another was seriously wounded in the West Bank. The military declined to provide further details. Israeli media reported Monday that the soldiers’ vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb in the northern West Bank overnight. Israel has been battling Palestinian militants in the northern part of the occupied West Bank for years. The violence escalated after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip ignited the war there. The deadly blast came hours after a long-awaited ceasefire took hold in Gaza. Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want an independent state encompassing all three territories. Turkey reopens consulate in Aleppo ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey reopened its consulate in Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, raising its flag at the building for the first time in 12 years, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The opening on Monday comes weeks after the Turkish Embassy resumed its operations in the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Dec. 14. Turkey had closed down its diplomatic missions in Syria in 2012 due to security concerns amid the civil war, during which Turkey supported forces opposed to the government of former President Bashar Assad. Prior to the Syria conflict, Aleppo, located some 31 miles from the Turkish border, was an important center for trade between Turkey and Syria. Yemen’s Houthis say they’ll limit attacks DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels have signaled they will limit their attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships as a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip took hold. The Houthis made the announcement in an email sent to shippers and others on Sunday. The Houthis separately planned a military statement on Monday, likely about the decision. The Houthis, through their Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center, made the announcement by saying it was 'stopping sanctions' on the other vessels it has previously targeted since it started attacks in November 2023. The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023, after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Freed Palestinian med student: 'Joy is limited’ BEITUNIA, West Bank — Bara’a Al-Fuqha, 22, hugged her family as she stepped off the white Red Cross bus and into the sea of cheering Palestinians welcoming the 90 Palestinians freed by Israel early Monday. A medical student at Al-Quds University in East Jerusalem before her arrest, she had spent around six months in Damon Prison. She said she was held under administrative detention — a policy of indefinite imprisonment without formal charge or trial that Israel almost exclusively uses against Palestinians. Israel says that the cases of Palestinians released as part of the exchange with Hamas for Israeli hostages all relate to state security charges. Al-Fuqha said her conditions in Israeli prison were 'terrible,' her access to food and water limited. 'It was like, when we tried to hold our heads high, the guards would do their best to hold us down,' she said. But now, reunited with her family, al-Fuqha displayed a sense of relief and defiance. 'Thank God, I am here with my family, I’m satisfied,' she said. 'But my joy is limited, because so many among us Palestinians are being tortured and abused. Our people in Gaza are suffering. God willing, we will work to free them, too.' That reflected a wider feeling in the crowd, with many saying this release offered a small, if fleeting, moment of joy, tempered by the 15 months of death and destruction in Gaza. UN: Trucks with aid have entered Gaza Strip JERUSALEM — United Nations humanitarian officials say that more than 630 trucks of humanitarian aid have entered the besieged Gaza Strip, in implementation of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. In a post on social media platform X, Tom Fletcher, the United Nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs said that over 630 trucks entered Gaza on Sunday, with at least 300 of them bringing humanitarian assistance into the north. 'There is no time to lose,' Fletcher wrote. 'After 15 months of relentless war, the humanitarian needs are staggering.' The Gaza ceasefire deal, which began Sunday with an initial phase lasting six weeks, calls for the entry into Gaza of 600 trucks carrying humanitarian relief daily. Over the course of the deal’s first stage, 33 Israeli hostages in Hamas captivity in Gaza will also be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Aid workers have been scrambling to address Gaza’s dire humanitarian needs after 15 months of devastating war and tough Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries and the movement of convoys within Gaza. Lawlessness and looting by armed gangs has also been a major obstacle to aid distribution. Before this latest Israel-Hamas war began, Gaza was under a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade that allowed the entry of some 500 trucks a day carrying commercial supplies and humanitarian aid. Hamas: Delay in release of Palestinian prisoners result of conflict over list of names JERUSALEM — Hamas’ office of prisoner affairs has issued a statement saying the delay in Israel’s release of Palestinian prisoners was the result of a last-minute conflict over the names on the list. Seven hours after three Israeli hostages were released from Hamas captivity in Gaza on Sunday, Palestinian crowds gathered outside Israel’s Ofer prison near the West Bank city of Ramallah were still waiting for the release of 90 Palestinians. The Hamas statement said: 'During the process of checking the names of the prisoners being released from Ofer prison, there was found to be one female prisoner missing.' Hamas said that its officials were in communication with mediators and the Red Cross in hopes of pressuring Israel 'to adhere to the agreed-upon list of prisoners.' It said that the issue was being resolved and it expected the buses of the released prisoners to soon depart. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the delay.

WATCH: Video of 3 Israeli hostages held by Hamas released on firs...	JERUSALEM (AP) — Three hostages held by Hamas were released Sunday after 471 days in captivity as part of a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group. A gradual release of dozens of captives over the next several weeks has been agreed on. The truce and release of hostages sparked hope and trepidation among Israelis. Many fear that the three-phase deal could collapse before all the hostages return, or that they will arrive in poor health. Others worry that the number of captives who have died is more than predicted. THE LATEST: Gaza ceasefire takes hold and the first handover of hostages is underway Some 250 people were kidnapped during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered 15 months of war. Around 100 hostages still remain in Gaza, after the rest were released, rescued, or their bodies were recovered. Hours before Sunday's ceasefire, which many hope is the first step to end the war, Israel announced that it had retrieved the body of Oron Shaul, a soldier who was killed in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war and whose remains have been held by the militants since then. Here's a look at the three hostages released Sunday (see video player attached to story): Romi Gonen, 24 Romi Gonen was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That morning, Gonen's mother, Merav, and her eldest daughter spent nearly five hours speaking to Gonen as militants marauded through the festival grounds. Gonen told her family that roads clogged with abandoned cars made escape impossible and that she would seek shelter in some bushes. Then she said words that continue to echo in her mother’s head every day. 'Mommy I was shot, the car was shot, everybody was shot. ... I am wounded and bleeding. Mommy, I think I’m going to die,' she recounted Romi as saying, in a press conference a few weeks after the abduction. At a loss for what to do, Merav Gonen tried to convince her daughter that she wasn’t going to die, to start breathing and treat her wounded friends. According to Merav, Romi's last word during the call was a shriek of 'Mommy!' as approaching gunfire and the men’s shouts drowned out everything. Then the phone shut off. Israeli authorities identified her phone's location in Gaza. Over the past 15 months, Merav Gonen has been one of the most outspoken voices advocating for the return of the hostages, appearing nearly daily on Israeli news programs and traveling abroad on missions. 'We are doing everything we can so the world will not forget,' she told The Associated Press on the six-month anniversary of Hamas' attack. 'Every day we wake up and take a big breath, deep breath, and continue walking, continue doing the things that will bring her back.' Emily Damari, 28 Emily Damari is a British-Israeli citizen kidnapped from her apartment on Kibbutz Kfar Aza, a communal farming village hit hard by Hamas' assault. She lived in a small apartment in a neighborhood for young adults, the closest part of the kibbutz to Gaza. Militants broke through the border fence of the kibbutz and ransacked the neighborhood. Damari's mother, Mandy, said she loves music, traveling, soccer, good food, karaoke and hats. Kibbutz Kfar Aza said that Damari was often the 'glue that held her close-knit friend group together' and she was always organizing gatherings of friends around the best barbecue corner in the entire kibbutz. On Sunday, Mandy released a statement of thanks for supporters 'who never stopped saying her name.' 'After 471 days Emily is finally home,' she said. Doron Steinbrecher, 31 Doron Steinbrecher is a veterinary nurse who loves animals, and a neighbor to Damari in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Steinbrecher holds both Israeli and Romanian citizenship. At 10:20 a.m. on Oct. 7, 2023, Steinbrecher called her mother. 'Mom, I’m scared. I’m hiding under the bed and I hear them trying to enter my apartment,' her brother, Dor, recalled. She was able to send a voice message to her friends. 'They’ve got me! They’ve got me! They’ve got me!' in the moments of her abduction. That message was key in helping her family understand that Doron had been kidnapped. Steinbrecher was featured in a video released by Hamas on Jan. 26, 2024, along with two female Israeli soldiers. Her brother said the video gave them hope that she was alive but sparked concern because she looked tired, weak, and gaunt. In total, militants killed 64 people and 22 soldiers, and kidnapped 19 people from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on Oct. 7. With the return of Steinbrecher and Damari, there are still three members of the kibbutz held in Gaza: American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65, and twins Gali and Ziv Berman, 27. Remains of Oron Shaul, 20 Oron Shaul was a soldier killed on July 20, 2014, during fighting between Israel and Hamas. His body and that of another soldier, Hadar Goldin, had been held by militants since then despite a public campaign to return them by their families. The Hostages Families Forum, which represents relatives of the captives, called the Shaul family an 'inseparable part' of the group. Militants still hold the bodies of Goldin as well as two Israelis who crossed into Gaza in 2014 and 2015 on their own.	https://wgntv.com/israel-hamas-conflict/ap-who-are-the-israelis-released-or-recovered-on-the-first-day-of-the-ceasefire/	2025-01-19T09:12:07-08:00
