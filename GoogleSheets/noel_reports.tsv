General Apti Alaudinov, commander of the 'Akhmat' special forces, made a statement, urging Chechen fighters who surrender to Ukraine to die rather than face the shame of captivity. He claimed that those who surrender have 'strayed from the sacred path' and are no longer considered Chechens. According to Alaudinov, surrendering is a disgrace that can only be cleansed by blood, implying that these individuals should take extreme actions, even to the point of death, to restore their honor.	https://t.me/noel_reports/17613	2024-09-15T09:07:56-07:00	https://cdn4.cdn-telegram.org/file/0a6e30c0cf.mp4?token=kbw85wIX9OvFF_4ARuyirmS8Amw6gGvCgVuvD9cl5GexeK6y56VLmEIBZOvOO5yysr4hathQnW5MZGtSMomdJnJmDPuW2nFpQMogDg2wYOueThlqt2sZlaTffs8IiAsChcxTl5WeYHuJ8VJjtqzPrsobS6kht-C_u7b_vjrTb-t9P2DAz5JhZBZQMvAdjqDCirYTHg3eNI5HLi2ej5dmEZF3GkTYWaj4pkF1HqQx_hyJEhtnLx5Wwfyjq0Iwzw1Q7eFhVh6zUOk_78Vg3BEvfdiLp46eSHaQnqdOHrj8MiqFMDvAdn_uX-YxgUwMl-HIyK2c2LIGp9P1nA--Zr57fCIM5v5o0Q2ts8kTWeZYefmHHjmX-eQWEWm8pXxU2MFoEAEhS5DjQRDEhUpKU2dN9yI7MKEIgSAOQY30-VMzyey23GAp9QeONzxChzOVPyfSqXqg9GzYkOfbG913Yixrveek695Q72s_YjwxruTeqIgabCb4JA4CfNgJokXBZi59JnJHgV4kRFtiEghyvsVdZ1GLkQEjCwv7I2nl_WeyeslJcQD-HvCWBNIpnc_klLNC46OcXjBoCT7GBkXsPy8vGgYrSzk4xPbtvzVXeWDkQYh7u7iBwDmV3pHTN_mDcFRM59I-6CbcYP8kHCQWqN2vuPq3m0AQ5yQxwLcQ6_eMfY0

In recent days, more and more stories have surfaced that Russian soldiers (mainly UAV operators) who disagree with their commanders are being forced to the front and end up in so-called assault squads where the chance of death is extremely high. Romanov also dedicates a message to it.'In the group of 'undesirable' UAV operators to whom a Ukrainian-born man who was simply driven mad by unlimited money, blood, power and impunity wrote a one-way ticket were: Ernest, Goodwin, Reef, Shock and Socrates. All of them, by the way, are from Russia. There were 12 people in the group. Socrates survived. He's safe now. He's supposed to be one of the key witnesses. If he lives. Now there's a manhunt for him. The story of how the survivor was pulled out is definitely off the record. There was also information that at the level of the South Military District there was a command to 'brush him off''.'	https://t.me/noel_reports/17601	2024-09-15T00:39:47-07:00	https://cdn4.cdn-telegram.org/file/rV0J5hveBoWReZtnbtMTlH8W4BZwEdA91fdi1qxQdMsIFZbGSDfrJu8CqCjh3MNtH_ouM2BqYbYnFGgn7ASQQYq7eWLw6Oz7mhtKaufKuctCTRZYU48zF5zslQ7YaeS6eH3frxGIk3J5bK00SqsXA21ZfQ7rPHMioz0ybLL3OAJnmw0wDeEZD_rvHe1E7ZfX9wuKsTWTKiRzPyUrP0GaGr9f6T54WYS0fXdpllCxazLeOhsvjbb6Nhw4ky8USK3mPASfIhJsve5MILKDw1oRUHebE66AqpGEkohNVA1ZBpPDhPP77WI6hbz5TSI52rH-V8aCD1d0HU35FshzFLG_1g.jpg
