All of them have received assistance. Twenty-two people have been rescued. More people are still being searched for under the rubble. At the moment, the list of fatalities, tragically, includes 8 names. My condolences to their families and loved ones.In total, last night alone, the Russians launched 165 missiles and drones – of various types. In addition to the Poltava region, the Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, and Donetsk regions were also hit.Odesa is recovering from yesterday's strikes on the city center. Museums, the philharmonic, many historic buildings, and a famous Odesa hotel were damaged. Not only Ukrainians, but even Norwegian diplomats working in Ukraine were caught under attack in Odesa.We are working to attract more resources and partners to strengthen the Ukrainian air shield. Protection against shelling is an absolute priority. Much more needs to be done.	https://t.me/noel_reports/23702	2025-02-01T11:36:04-08:00	https://cdn4.cdn-telegram.org/file/b565d83ddd.mp4?token=Z3O5YMrl9w3xeREBhoa5XtopFS8xFcIssOA5DiKAkUJ3PFB53v7OjAmgJryi6-okGgWoBYXk4X_PZ3aRgvNEtjPQkFRdr0RUdQcHuVn1siCZ18Zp-w1T3DGxVZQhaqJiI9zvdKsAvG4Hgu8_qd-RAddm1B0SuvaqRTQ_M1VBmeJxvTmYPWe8XquOPLeJS1rdqQKHJ2YMFswul_7T3q0X_99qOM1uuY6Lx5E137z1Gk6DkDSYmuWzZfudr4Q3YxbgLLfbDdeGN2RzPUnwI3pNjv2ID4xiDQz-wOc_XScbd3VQMNjVlETwAqx0Gz9ur-adr37idNELE8wecJxZWk0yRisr9juy0_4gmYwMechInrjqfMLR5Ai0i3-WnAAPDjBJG2VcaC3uWOiMB1wVpRD8bJQK-ZLyVn169YUqBkl-3JxVievkwuAI8u2IXe0U8ZsUQ1-n8d8i19JeNekzMM2285L2TiOE5IsALZY_RhbtjAQedORmWzXwZLkUOKrwNqt7YumqpTfqdosmJsm6fRiDWuQTRi87Y03ll0a-yY-qMBzMHrKe_jsqnHbZ9jcy-gVyc0VwzfUgVBwE7jLkzl2VjtVgO7ztN31_VzCrQQ_n21udz4n7-XJzmrzdpw2eZj9hLMGjhFQaMZnZsbhwOv32zpdIEraLuDVoEV3WsOIk8qw
