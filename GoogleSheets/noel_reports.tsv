During talks with the US, Russia may have demanded Ukrainian forces to withdraw their forces from the Kursk region, claims international relations expert Stanislav Zhelihovskyi. Ukrainian forces seem to have left the majority of the area in the last 24-48 hours. Recently Kremlin Spokesperson Peskov also said that negotations would not start if Ukrainian forces remained present in the Kursk region.	https://t.me/noel_reports/25408	2025-03-12T06:13:17-07:00	https://cdn4.cdn-telegram.org/file/1504042314.mp4?token=WcQ91W9V1ZpDnQhNFY0PczJyvs6MG2CtuYOF7TVThZUxT2FNuXpT3nVLRtZ5RRQWMvD6n0IjYW7gRFAuIlj1f5meFY6iUK89JIJl3riUdqQXUXUG8ipL902-Gr2p-WxElCx05pgcAo8biPpdweGDBYVfLOlD_nNxkp43lMN9rmAKqnjnrUyEEQO1pAw8yTpJAUlfBpxsc2dq48F3tRSvOjeqoS0j-2MomMqo_oLPamTBDh1jUiQ8DUzxmL6Rd-ATxJcyVci0WdlYnlMpbv6WfG0Pn227OwaGy01H9tR49z-byZkwAAOMLyIGjFBdFpVMVPov3yL6VRaPfc3NGunnTkRKMiH-nrGYOzrwHB3AkXNH3nE7sAsrdPyoH73LkE1WdK6Jwae7alGCZ6oPqK5bgRXdIodWD90UUzUREAM7jhlzhyHBVWXQgL9f6HzvVzrAa68O3PUMAr8k9BMmct3xBxKbo5jYEyH4_JCsTXpsvCWL5aRYZRUryqWwbnerud3MsSKoyAXaNGHZ2L-wB_DkIm_VuoDFuWJQJH1NTScLg9QkAS_CcIF_ohbSl6Np57fttIeqWpIEBxV9KVsaxl4xYjo7shaDD6ABChinF5DnjBNi-qCotbCu8o3BziGFS6uQVEwMg78ILIeEqeawvjmKYVqpPU2lOvANNnEXGLW2lKQ

Russia took hold of the border area west of Sudzha and started penetrating AFU lines north of Sudzha. Russia has now taken control over Yuzhnyi, Ivanivskii, Martynovka,, Mikhaylovka, Myrnyi, Kazachya Lohnya, Bogdanovka and has entered Zaoleshenka (northern suburb of Sudzha).

Yet, here we are—at the exact moment Ukraine needs the world’s support more than ever—the U.S. has decided to cut off critical military aid, including air defense interceptors. This move is not just irresponsible; it leaves Ukraine more and more exposed to Russian attacks, pushing them into a corner and forcing them to negotiate under duress. Meanwhile, Russia continues its relentless assault without facing any real consequences.It’s infuriating how this administration seems more interested in playing some naïve 'peace game' that only serves to embolden Russia. The U.S. is choosing to ignore the very real human cost of Ukraine’s suffering—showing a blatant disregard for lives lost, all while turning a blind eye to Russia’s barbaric actions. It’s becoming clearer by the day that most of those in power are more aligned with Russia than they are with defending innocent lives in Ukraine.	https://t.me/noel_reports/25143	2025-03-04T09:29:38-08:00	https://cdn4.cdn-telegram.org/file/a_dktrf2Dqqud1RyvkJv8SaSwPQEMejau7hkwAGOda79GgPJppVrBy9Qn52MOORCk7jy_lLmDBnqjzizX9yk8gwCRmZayryIQJdd8fWJq5LTVcUYgcTUfY_V5LdAdhFaCe-FTO5f-me3WDTcBdTPSOqk0yAKeUIDoLwk-4XF50twLQLqk5NJqe3KYWAE16CYIFjTUG0ZqgIcrf2G4iE5QFtmL8UGypKxpVcXa6NQn78tnyXMyo2T_KZ3gTDTNsxf5YXQ3gv2sfofaMc0tw3t3x-gJF4ZC7X7sfUSm5ajskahd5Okw3voevpX_Srt5siU8Mbar7VyZhWR5Ba9WLnXMg.jpg

He says Zelenskyys Oval Office dispute was seen as an attempt to block Trump’s peace efforts. Rubio hasn’t spoken to Zelensky or his team since and makes it clear: the U.S. will only resume cooperation when Ukraine is ready for peace. For now, there will be no security guarantees. Washington insists peace must come first, while some EU countries push for another year of war. Meanwhile, most of Europe still lacks a real plan to end it.	https://t.me/noel_reports/25054	2025-03-02T11:41:23-08:00	https://cdn4.cdn-telegram.org/file/SZKHMwhGU1d0RUh6xRWl6BJ9y8bUhVJnRNOZngaABAqAHdw43oOvKWaiSygsDkBziwXEBpIIXOJ77Unf6PRuVe693XUbC4kmzgu9gNJaLYGZZGHxwVokoKj7D5Hra6WnHZ2o3dsq42k6s-xnq_lS0vq7QlDxWF9ACatdZt37gELgdKv1qoosoW688B9-aA-IA3V5y3ZJdRiLA3y1-vO8hJdzY44acDjLunsev6Qey4M7onCj4gXW5jLIf8qNwj_Gd4mjClI9KtnNm6XQH8QUoWTm2U3wBEM6p2kWHJ753Rbpw0hM5wCnfrux9NlpGk_BT8ytGE28UbCEWQoC1q5r-g.jpg
