The United States has warned that North Korea is gaining valuable war experience by deploying troops to fight alongside Russia in its war against Ukraine. According to Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Dorothy Camille Shea, more than 12,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia, with many actively engaged in combat against Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. Shea stated that this involvement allows Pyongyang to acquire Russian military equipment, technology, and battlefield experience, making North Korea more capable of waging war against its neighbors.https://www.reuters.com/world/us-warns-north-korea-becoming-better-prepared-war-fighting-against-ukraine-2025-01-08/ReutersUS warns North Korea becoming better prepared for war, fighting against UkraineThe United States warned on Wednesday that North Korea is benefiting from its troops fighting alongside Russia against Ukraine, gaining experience that makes Pyongyang 'more capable of waging war against its neighbors.'	https://t.me/noel_reports/22658	2025-01-09T02:00:04-08:00	https://cdn4.cdn-telegram.org/file/stoORHwkFVrVRMxAIPtVdUHbxVRX0t5nehKXJfQU9_NLrYjKr4G60S_jN1pEuk73m-Uec2hxjXMqEBvpegM_K55Avzvr-MYTocvnnK0--QGmBJRNG2cmoZiavnxcQ2xMXrbLfbQqVX82taFRwi3033cGBgl-Psmb3tmDAnv16RoGwq-WE4bCGGcHxfIC5FO0xmPKE3t2XlKiDYphOpevrO11GhefpETBpxzIORzcMANjI-rd44V-jymipX9K5P6aXJnX1PWB9FaIhRoJLMr81JSWX3OT_9h6GIqmnxEO9VhwhYfCyeafmoOl4wKicqq4MgJI8TvBti1lcCZbcWKNGw.jpg

There were the Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, government officials, and the Office team. This year should be as productive for us in the negotiations regarding Ukraine's accession to the EU as it is necessary for Ukraine, and therefore for the security of our entire Europe. This year, Poland will initially hold the presidency of the EU, and Denmark will hold the presidency for the second half of the year. Our very responsible partners. On the Ukrainian side, we will provide everything necessary to take the right steps.	https://t.me/noel_reports/22588	2025-01-07T10:48:55-08:00	https://cdn4.cdn-telegram.org/file/17fabb1297.mp4?token=ByGFvCXdOj_M6rLyQC6WFl1PXbVHB0Z10Lp7OSa_xZx2K2Ng89V0jVv35EIQnX2K9dUumXsYc31G6I2B_dPOkdvWk8yRbDlhlZyw-HayzTPvylYecNclVKersUXuerEtuxSiN5l0ieK0MneGc5hCpqC9vsBjZbyLteGjl2Y6qWA1P1AXL0FiukS2-9qaSDaFgBAaPKrdkFNW32fTV1TypfJi_fdIrmU2Th6me0gYuoVHrY1vcxnI72F4u7jMggzjOAFyEqp1EE2qwJG0dcZmg-mOopPq9D53nkgZVFC3F8EOX2oVwIUE_yr8ktUvSsuEQ86L16MlLLf3RZAHPFzQ5w

Military expert Ivan Stupak suggests that a potential new Ukrainian offensive in the Kursk region could have dual objectives: 30% military and 70% political. On the military side, the goal would be to force Russia to relocate troops from areas like Pokrovsk and Kurakhove to Kursk, thereby creating a new pressure point. Politically, the offensive could aim to expose the weakness of Russian authorities and increase tension within Russian society.
