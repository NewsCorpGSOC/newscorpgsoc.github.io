Just this Tuesday the NYPD lashed out as their leadership including former Police Commissioner Eric Caban has resigned in disgrace and their zionist cop mayor Adams has been under investigation, violently arresting WOL organizer Abdullah Akl without charge while singling out and targeting several other Muslim youth leaders.

No to Biden, Adams, Netanyahu and all politicians supporting genocide!&nbsp;Eric Adams must resign, as his crime is not just corruption. He has overseen the police murder of 38 Black and Brown New Yorkers, embraced austerity, given material support to the zionist genocide in Palestine, and set the NYPD to crackdown on Palestinian protestors in the streets.&nbsp;(1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/619	2024-09-25T22:19:07-07:00

Make no mistake, this arrest was a targeted attack on the Palestine movement and the Muslim community of New York.Although our brother has been released, our campaign for justice against the NYPD's months of targeted brutality against our communities as we fight for Palestine has only just begun. We call on all Muslim and Arab community organizations to uplift and share these demands among their networks:1. The resignation of Eric Adams2.

Following months of barbaric brutality from the NYPD, we demand: 1. The resignation of Eric Adams 2. The disbandment of the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group… 🚨UPDATE: As of 3:30pm, Abdullah is still in state custody and is waiting to be arraigned. He was treated at a hospital and transferred to central bookings around 5am. He was with an attorney and family member in the hospital and they have reported he is conscious and alert. An attorney attempted to deliver prescribed medication but was turned away by police and court staff. We expect him to be arraigned later today and will provide updates as we receive them. Abdullah has shown up for his community and his people endlessly, it’s time we show up for him. For now, we ask that friends and comrades post the statement and graphics on the WOL Twitter/X account to expose the NYPDs violence against not only Abdullah, but dozens of other New Yorkers. Folks should also feel encouraged to make their own statements to show wider community support for Abdullah and all New Yorkers of conscience protesting against this genocide. NYPD violence cannot continue to be normalized. #WeStandWithAbdullah	https://t.me/wolpalestine/615	2024-09-25T12:39:43-07:00

As the United Nations hosts war criminals from around the world in NYC, the zionist entity is bombing Gaza and Lebanon with the full backing, diplomatic and military support from the U.S. war machine. Since Monday, the occupation’s indiscriminate bombing of Lebanon has resulted in 550 martyrs and counting, and nearly 2,000 more wounded. On Thursday we take to the streets not only in protest of Butcher Benjamin Netanyahu, but to confront U.S. imperialism, zionism and all those enabling the ongoing genocide in Gaza and the current bloodbath in Lebanon, which includes the UN itself. Meanwhile the NYPD, whose foot soldiers routinely brutalize and murder Black and Brown New Yorkers with impunity and who just days ago shot multiple people on the subway, are responsible for the -security- of the UN General Assembly. The NYPD, embroiled in federal investigations, resignation and scandal, has said that all pedestrian traffic during the UNGA will be shut down east of 2nd Avenue, showing just how afraid they are of losing control with so many eyes on NYC. Join us and action on Thursday Sept. 26th and show the world that street closures won't stop us. Move like water, split into streams and take action throughout the day using the map above. Then join us for a central rally at 6PM at Pershing Square (42nd St. &amp; Park Ave) where we will flood the streets for Gaza, Palestine, Lebanon, Yemen and all our people resisting around the world.

Some of the top cops overseeing the force and specifically tasked with repressing the movement for Palestine have a record of brutalizing, abusing, and killing New Yorkers in cold blood, including Chief of Patrol John Chell who murdered Ortanzso Bovell in 2008.This latest police mass shooting comes on the heels of a wide-ranging federal investigation against Adams and the NYPD that has already led to the resignations of several Adams affiliates, including NYPD Commissioner Caban and Adam's top lawyer Lisa Zornberg, and today two former City officials were indicted by federal prosecutors. However, we know Adams and the NYPD's true crimes are not merely corruption and campaign finance violations: they stand guilty for the ongoing murders of Black New Yorkers and their unqualified material support to the zionist genocide of Palestinians.Data on NYPD murders for 2022 + 2023 accessible here: https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/neighborhoods#nationwide.

Our liberation struggles are intertwined and as Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims it is our duty to rise up alongside our Black brothers and sisters against NYPD violence which mirrors the zionist occupation in NYC's Black and brown communities. The NYPD has grown increasingly militarized under the Adams administration both in retaliation against popular movements for Black and Palestinian liberation, and in an escalation of Broken Windows-style policing that never left NYC as well as a surge in stop and frisk incidents which have reached their highest frequency in a decade. From drones, bag checks, cops and military personnel occupying every subway station, we are witnessing an witnessing an increasingly violent police state that has been the daily reality of Black people in this country for hundreds of years. We’ve seen more and more police collaboration with the IDF who has been committing a genocide against our people in Palestine for 76 years, killing at least 200,000 Palestinians since October alone.(2/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/590	2024-09-20T06:43:02-07:00

Today the struggle to #ShutDownAttica and free all political prisoners from the US to 🇵🇸continues.Sparked by the murder of George Jackson in San Quentin prison in California weeks prior, the Attica rebellion lasted for four days. On Sept 13th under the orders of the Governor of NY, state police stormed the prison and carried out a premeditated bloodbath, massacring 39 people. In 2021, just three days before the 50th anniversary of the Attica Uprising, six Palestinian prisoners carried out the heroic freedom tunnel escape from -Gilboa- prison.

For 76 years, from 1948 to September 6th to October 7th, in the face of ethnic cleansing and genocide, torture and rape, siege and blockade, death and destruction, slaughter and annihilation, the Palestinian people have resisted, and resisted and resisted by any means necessary. Assata Shakur once wrote that -A wall is just a wall and nothing more at all. It can be broken down.- With every freedom tunnel dug, every wall broken down, every concentration camp and open-air prison liberated, we are brought closer to Palestinian liberation. During the occupation’s latest invasion of the West Bank, the largest since 2002, nearly 40 Palestinians have been martyred, many of them while taking up arms in defense of the camps.Just days ago Zakaria Al-Zubeidi’s son Mohammed was martyred when he and four other freedom fighters were targeted in a drone strike by IOF in Tubas. Following in his father’s path, Mohammed rose in defense of the land, like Abu Shujaa, Ibrahim Al-Nabulsi and thousands like them. From Gaza to Jenin, Tulkarem to Nablus, Tubas to Al-Khalil, Al-Quds to the occupied interior, Palestine resists as one nation, one people, one struggle.

In the early hours of August 28th the zionist entity launched its largest invasion in the West Bank since 2002, targeting Jenin, Tulkarem, Tubas, Nablus and more in a desperate attempt to claim a -victory- after 11 months of failure and humiliation in its ongoing war on Gaza.

God willing, we will not let you down.-And Abu Shujaa has certainly not let us down, even in his martyrdom there is victory as he never backed down, keeping the resistance in the West Bank alive, with thousands carrying the same will as Abu Shujaa: to rise and resist until Palestine is free within our lifetime.🇵🇸	https://t.me/wolpalestine/549	2024-08-29T18:32:32-07:00
