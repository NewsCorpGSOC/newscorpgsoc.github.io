As the genocide in Gaza goes on over 300 days, the NYPD continues to roll out new tactics targeting jail support efforts, from splitting protestors up between police precincts to arbitrarily transferring them multiple times over the course of one night.

They employ tactics such as shadow banning, outright censorship, and the distribution of debunked israeli propaganda.Here in the United States, healthcare workers continue to witness police inflicting severe injuries on protesters fighting for Palestinian Liberation. The israeli-trained NYPD has used bear spray and brutally assaulted demonstrators in NYC and DC. Movement leaders like Nerdeen Kiswani have been targeted and violently arrested multiple times. As healthcare workers, we are bound by our oath to do no harm. We must stand against both police brutality and media repression and support the fight for Palestinian justice.This cyber and physical repression of Palestine demands a unified stance to honor and defend the lives and dedication of the Palestinian people and their supporters. We call on everyone nationwide to come to NYC on Labor Day, September 2nd, by any means necessary, to show all oppressive forces that when the people are united, we will never be defeated. We must protest against the repression of Palestine!(2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/510	2024-08-01T10:09:26-07:00

MONDAY September 2nd? 12 PM?FOR UPDATES/INFO:Twitter/X: @wolpalestineTelegram: t.me/wolprotestFor over nine months, Gaza has endured a relentless and brutal genocide perpetrated by israel and America, estimated to result in the slaughter of at least 186,000 Palestinians. While israel spreads its false narratives worldwide, Gazans have heroically risked their lives to expose their suffering through social media, unveiling israel?s genocidal intentions. In response, israel has targeted and killed at least 165 Gazan journalists in an effort to intimidate survivors into silence, with Al Jazeera journalist Ismail al-Ghoul and his cameraman Rami al-Rifi among the latest victims. Anti-Palestinian social media platforms and Western media outlets have too been complicit in ruthlessly silencing Gazans, pro-Palestinian activists, and organizations that speak out against anti-Palestinians and the israeli genocidal regime.(1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/509	2024-08-01T10:09:02-07:00

Cameraman Rami Al Refee was martyred in the zionist attack alongside his comrade and colleague.The zionist entity is lashing out against all forces resisting genocide. Yesterday, the IOF bombed Beirut &amp; Iraq as well as Tehran, assassinating Lebanese resistance leader Fuad Shukr. Just last week, they bombed Yemen in retaliation for their steadfast solidarity with Palestine.(2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/506	2024-07-31T12:35:11-07:00

As Israel continues its genocide campaign of killing, famine, and disease in Gaza that has claimed at least 186,000 lives, it bombed the capital of Iran last night and assassinated Ismail Haniyeh. A leader of Palestinian resistance, was martyred by zionist-U.S. aggression in Tehran, along with 60 members of his family during the course of this genocide. We honor each and every Palestinian martyred for our people. The zionist project assumes that assassinations and massacres will halt the march of freedom from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River, from the North to the South, but the 76 year-long history of the struggle for Palestine proves otherwise.

In response to the ongoing massacres in Palestine and the outrageous murder of Sonya Massey in her own home on July 6th in Illinois, we are calling on New York City to flood Brooklyn for Black &amp; Palestinian liberation and resistance by any means necessary. This also coincides with Black August, established to honor the life and legacy of George Jackson, who was assassinated inside San Quentin prison August 21st 1971, and his brother Jonathan, who also died at the hands of the state while attempting to liberate the Soledad Brothers. In solidarity with the Black freedom struggle, the ongoing fight to free all of our political prisoners from the U.S. to Palestine, and in recognition of the interconnectedness of our liberation, we take to the streets on August 3rd. Join us.(2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/502	2024-07-28T10:25:42-07:00
