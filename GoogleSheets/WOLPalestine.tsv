Yahya Sinwar was a key figure who united the fields against zionism, to the people of Yemen, he said: -I also extend my salute to the great Yemeni people, who have always stood by our Palestinian people and their just cause throughout history- and in regards to Lebanon and Iraq he said, -The unification of our efforts with you and our brothers in the valiant resistance in Lebanon and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq will break this enemy and bring about its defeat, paving the way for its expulsion from our land.-His legacy will live on in the hearts of every revolutionary. Thousands will rise after him to continue the path towards liberation. The martyrdom of our resistance leaders will not weaken the resolve of the masses, as history has shown that while martyrs leave this world, their ideas remain immortal guiding those after them. These enduring ideas, deeply rooted in the people of Palestine, will drive the struggle forward until the zionist entity is dismantled, in a free Palestine, within our lifetime.(3/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/693	2024-10-17T21:41:54-07:00

Now as the Al-Aqsa Flood battle sparked on October 7, Yahya Sinwar fought to keep his promise to liberate the thousands of Palestinian prisoners who remain in the occupation's dungeons.&nbsp;We remember and honor Yahya Sinwar as a fierce leader who did not waver, but advanced the struggle until his very last breath. In the 2021 war on Gaza, the occupation forces bombed his home in an attempted assassination attempt, but with pride, he returned home, sat on his furniture, and took a picture of himself humiliating the zionist entity.&nbsp;(2/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/692	2024-10-17T21:41:45-07:00

Yahya Sinwar, also known as -Abu Ibrahim-, the leader of the Palestinian resistance movement, and the commander fighting alongside his people in Gaza has ascended to martyrdom. Yahya Sinwar was martyred in the heart of Gaza, amongst his people leading them to the front lines. He did not cower away, but instead, he fought, led, and inspired thousands of revolutionaries to stand against genocide, in defense of the honorable Palestinian people.&nbsp;Yahya Ibrahim Hassan Sinwar ascended to martyrdom on the 17th of October, and he was born on the 19th of October in the Khan Younis Refugee Camp as his family was displaced from the city of Majdal Asqalan in 1948 during the ongoing Nakba. It was on the 18th of October, 2011 that Yahya Sinwar was released in the -Wafa al-Ahrar- prisoner exchange deal that liberated 1,027 prisoners held in the occupation's dungeons.

AOC's office has chosen to erase the memory of Palestinians.

Last night, activists took action to protest AOC at her Astoria office by holding a vigil for the martyrs of Palestine after over a year of lies about supporting a ceasefire as she continues to co-opt progressive politics to run cover for Biden, Harris, and the Democratic Party's genocide in Gaza. The memorial featured Shaban Al-Dalou, the young Palestinian who was filmed burning to death after the occupation bombed refugee tents next to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. AOC has shamelessly already torn down the memorial this morning, hoping to hide the blood on her hands as she desecrates any attempt to honor the over 300k Palestinians murdered with our taxes. We call on all New Yorkers in solidarity with Palestine to continue taking creative action to confront all those complicit and responsible for the annihilation of our people.

As the zionist entity grows increasingly desperate to delay its inevitable collapse, it has escalated the genocidal aggression against the people of Gaza beyond comprehension. Hours ago the occupation forces bombed Palestinians seeking refuge around Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza, burning them alive in the tents where they were sleeping. This attack followed a successful operation by the resistance in neutralizing military forces. Attacking critical health infrastructure has been a consistent part of the occupation’s strategy to destroy life in Gaza and carry out this genocide.(1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/677	2024-10-13T19:51:02-07:00

This continued siege comes as part of the enemy's plan to displace Palestinians in Jabalia camp. As green-lighted by the United States, the occupation’s primary partner I n facilitating this ongoing genocide, it is clear that this is a coordinated plan to starve, displace, and massacre as many Palestinians in Jabalia as possible.For the past year, the zionist entity has aimed to destabilize the resistance in Jabalia, after failing to defeat the resistance in northern Gaza, particularly in the camp. The IOF have again resorted to cowardly tactics through horrific airstrikes targeting schools, hospitals, and residential areas. Over the past nine days alone, at least 300 Palestinians have been martyred during the ongoing siege of Jabalia. Yet even in the face of this unthinkable violence, our people declare: -Long live the camp, and long live the invincible spirit of Jabalia.-	https://t.me/wolpalestine/675	2024-10-13T17:50:50-07:00

The zionist entity makes the miscalculation of believing that the martyrdom of Lebanese resistance leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah this past weekend will leave the country vulnerable for invasion. But as Palestinian intellectual and martyr Basil Al-Araj wrote, -Those who have died and those who will die will never affect the resistance's system and cohesion because the structure and formations of the resistance are not centralized but horizontal and widespread.- The resistance is in the hearts of 100,000 fighters ready to defend their land and they will do just that.The resistance defeated the zionist occupation in Lebanon twice before, and it will do it again.⁩(3/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/643	2024-10-01T11:25:02-07:00

As the Lebanese resistance prepares for an invasion, the zionist forces are escalating their attempts to trigger a regional war by bombing Damascus, Syria as well as the Ain al Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in South Lebanon last night. Multiple people were wounded and killed in both strikes including Hassan Al-Maqdah, a Palestinian resistance fighter in Ain al Hilweh, and Safaa Al-Ahmed, a Syrian journalist in Damascus. She was martyred shortly after covering the israeli aggressions in both Lebanon and Syria.At the same time as the zionist entity was carrying out these aggressions across the region, Yemen was demonstrating its fearlessness once again, striking Tel Aviv with its second hypersonic missile as the IOF was mounting a sea of tanks at the Lebanese border. Today, Palestinians have conducted multiple shooting operations in Yafa and Tel Aviv while resistance fighters have fended off zionist occupation forces’ attempts to besiege Nablus once again. Just now, Iran launched a barrage of missiles at israel. The past days’ developments make clearer than ever that we are all linked — from Palestine to Lebanon to Syria to Yemen to Iran and beyond.

The Al-Aqsa Intifada then, and our people’s unwavering resistance to this day, from Gaza, Jenin, Tulkarem, Nablus, Al-Quds, Al-Khalil, to the occupied interior in 1948 and beyond, embodies our people’s refusal to surrender and steadfastness in fighting for liberation by any means necessary, passed on from generation to generation.From Zakaria Zubeidi’s generation, the generation who led the armed struggle during the Al-Aqsa Intifada from the camps in the West Bank, the struggle was later passed on to the cubs who grew up during the Intifada like the freedom fighters and martyrs Abu Shujaa, born in 1998 in Nur Shams camp in Tulkarem, and Ibrahim Al-Nabulsi, born five years later in 2003 in Nablus.While zionists seek to vilify the word Intifada and demonize Palestinian resistance, the world has come to see the Palestinian cause as a heroic struggle in the face of settler colonialism, ethnic cleansing, genocide and annihilation.Until liberation and return within our lifetime, the Intifada will continue.🇵🇸 (2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/639	2024-09-29T21:22:20-07:00

Twenty four years ago on September 28th 2000, the Al-Aqsa Intifada launched a new chapter of Palestinian resistance, from mass popular uprisings in the streets, to the iconic images of Palestinian youth throwing stones at tanks, to armed struggle waged by Palestinian resistance groups.The Al-Aqsa Intifada was ignited when the zionist war criminal Ariel Sharon stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound under the protection of over 1,000 occupation forces in an act of provocation that was condemned around the world.&nbsp;Sharon’s actions caused outrage amongst Palestinians, who reacted to the attack on Al-Aqsa by confronting and resisting zionist forces throughout Palestine.Over the course of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, nearly 5,000 Palestinians were martyred resisting the zionist enemy.When the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993, the late Palestinian intellectual Edward Said reacted by saying, -Let us call the agreement by its real name: an instrument of Palestinian surrender.- (1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/638	2024-09-29T21:21:59-07:00

The weight of his martyrdom will crash down on the heads of the settler colony.-We will not abandon Gaza and its people, Palestine, and the sanctities of the nation in Palestine, no matter the circumstances, challenges, and sacrifices. Any hopes of silencing the support fronts are futile. What we started 11 months ago, we will continue, no matter the intimidations and sacrifices.- These are the eternal words of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, even after his martyrdom, his ideas and legacy will remain a beacon of hope for thousands to honor after him.(2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/637	2024-09-28T10:11:01-07:00

Within Our Lifetime mourns the martyrdom of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Lebanese resistance and a symbol of the steadfast struggle to liberate Palestine. Nasrallah was killed by the zionist entity along with several other members of the resistance's senior leadership amid a hailstorm of bombs which rained down on the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh yesterday, killing hundreds and destroying entire city blocks in the process.Nasrallah built up a guerrilla force and led the Lebanese resistance to defeat the far more advanced israeli occupation of South Lebanon in 2006. As the era of national liberation struggle seemed to come to a close on the global stage, their actions represented the dawn of a new path towards victory and dignity. It is no surprise that the genocidal zionist project would eagerly slaughter countless people in Lebanon — as they have done for decades without justification — in order to extinguish this fire.(1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/636	2024-09-28T10:10:48-07:00
