For over ten months, Gaza has endured relentless bombardment by israel and the U.S., resulting in the deaths of at least 186,000 Palestinians and widespread devastation. At least 500 healthcare workers and 165 journalists have been killed in this U.S.- and israeli-led genocide, aimed both at preventing healthcare to Gazans and intimidating survivors into silence.🎥: Samir.foundation on Instagram(2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/540	2024-08-19T16:46:06-07:00

We see growing parallels in the U.S., where anti-Palestinian sentiment is reflected in social media platforms and Western media outlets that silence Gazans, pro-Palestinian activists, and organizations critical of the israeli regime. Tactics such as shadow banning, outright censorship, and the spread of debunked israeli propaganda are employed to suppress Palestinians. Additionally, law enforcement have used physical force to intimidate and obstruct our First Amendment right to protest against U.S. involvement in the genocide in Gaza.📸: @oshimages on Instagram(3/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/536	2024-08-18T08:30:21-07:00

For over ten months, Gaza has endured relentless bombardment by israel and the U.S., resulting in the deaths of at least 186,000 Palestinians and widespread devastation. Reports from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization, and the Palestinian government reveal that Israel has severely damaged more than half of Gaza’s homes, 85% of its schools, all hospitals, 65% of its road networks, and 65% of its cropland. At least 500 healthcare workers and 165 journalists have been killed in this U.S.- and israeli-led genocide, aimed both at preventing healthcare to Gazans and intimidating survivors into silence.(2/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/534	2024-08-18T08:29:50-07:00

Palestinians living in the refugee camp were forced to become displaced once again due to the aggression by the zionist-allied Phalangist forces. However, the Palestinians refused to accept humiliation, they refused to accept massacres and displacement, and they resisted until their very last breath as they were always determined to one day return to their homeland. This steadfastness continues on today in Gaza, the West Bank, and all of Palestine as the Palestinian masses and its resistance are defending their homeland against the zionist entity knowing that they will one day liberate Palestine within our lifetime.Find all of these posters and more at the Palestine Poster Project: palestineposterproject.org(2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/528	2024-08-12T20:03:42-07:00

Today, August 12, we join Palestinians across the world, to commemorate the anniversary of the tragic Tal Al-Zaatar Massacre. 48 years ago in January 1976, the Lebanese Phalangist militia, in coordination with the zionist entity, began a series of attacks on Palestinians living in refugee camps across Lebanon. It has been estimated that over 3,000 Palestinians were martyred during the siege of the Tal Al-Zaatar Refugee Camp. (1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/525	2024-08-12T20:03:29-07:00

We are reminded that it is his VP, Killer Kamala, who is running to be the next top cop responsible for the annihilation of our people. As israeli society debates the merits of raping Palestinian prisoners, an endemic horror to this fascist settler colony, US -progressives- debate the merits of voting for someone who has not made any commitment to ending US funding for these atrocities.The movement to Free Palestine will not support any candidate of the party of genocide, and we will continue flooding the campaign events of Killer Kamala and the streets of New York City until liberation 🇵🇸🔻(2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/523	2024-08-11T17:23:34-07:00
