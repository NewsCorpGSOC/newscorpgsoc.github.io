The New York Times, which falsely claimed the Gaza death toll was exaggerated, has now admitted that the toll was undercounted. As the imperial core, we have a duty to expose these accomplices and demand accountability. Even before October 7, 2023, this year had already become one of the deadliest for Palestinian children in the West Bank. The violence persists because the occupying entity remains entrenched on stolen Palestinian land. Recently, Jenin Camp was bombed twice in weeks, leaving 12 martyrs as the occupation tightened its grip to crush resistance.Liberation is non-negotiable, and justice cannot wait. Join us to demand justice for Palestine!(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/820	2025-01-16T18:40:22-08:00

The struggle continues, and the flood rises stronger! 🇵🇸Join us 🗓️ Saturday, January 18, at ⏰ 2 PM 📍 in front of The New York Times headquarters at 242 W. 41st St. New York, NY 10036 as we demand full liberation from the river to the sea. This is not just a fight for a ceasefire—it’s a fight to end all U.S. financial, media, political, and diplomatic complicity in the crimes of settler colonialism, genocide, and Zionism.The ceasefire while only temporary, was won through the resilience of Palestinian resistance. But true justice demands more: lifting the siege on Gaza, freeing every Palestinian prisoner, and dismantling the occupation entirely.For decades, Palestinians have endured relentless violence, oppression, and dispossession—fueled by U.S. military aid, diplomatic backing, and media propaganda that enable the apartheid regime. Under the Biden administration and the Democratic Party, this complicity has ensured that the bloodshed continues to their very last days in power.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/819	2025-01-16T18:40:18-08:00

Fathers raised their fists in pride. Children ran through the alleys, their cheers and laughter, a louder defiance than any weapon. This is Gaza: resilient, unyielding, unshaken. Every bomb, every lie, and every attempt to sow division has only strengthened its resolve. The resistance is not separate from the people — it is the people. It is their sacrifice, their unity, and their unshakable will. The ceasefire is not merely a -pause-; it is a testament to their perseverance and faith. To the zionists and their allies who hoped for division, the celebrations in Gaza are a powerful reminder: Gaza’s strength lies in its unity, and this unity is built on resilience, faith, and the unrelenting pursuit of justice. Gaza celebrates dignity and honor — a sentiment known only to those who have risen against oppression, to those who have chosen to resist proudly, and stand far from humiliation. Yesterday, Gaza celebrated not just survival, but defiance. Not just life, but the promise of liberation. This is the beating heart of Palestine. Gaza is victorious. Gaza will always be victorious. From Gaza, the intifada was born, and from Gaza, the flood will continue. 🌊(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/818	2025-01-16T10:00:30-08:00

Through the unwavering determination of its people and their deep connection to their homeland, the Palestinian masses have claimed victory on their own terms, defeating the -israeli- occupation forces. The zionist entity sought to eradicate the idea of resistance in Palestine, failing to understand that this idea is eternal—rooted deeply within the hearts of the Palestinian people. Just as the idea will forever be eternal, so will the spirit of our martyrs who continue to guide us to the ultimate goal: complete liberation from the river to the sea. The colonizers believed Gaza would crumble. They thought fear, destruction, and despair would fracture the bond between the resistance and its people, and that the defenders of Gaza would be abandoned. But yesterday, as the dust settled, Gaza stood with pride, dignity, and honor as it continued to defend the last shred of humanity in the world.

We applaud a ceasefire as an effort to preserve the lives of Palestinian people, and we will continue the struggle for complete liberation of Palestine from the river to the sea. Since the beginning, we have made clear that a ceasefire is only a first step in the struggle for true justice against the imperialist zionist and U.S. war machine. Palestinians have finally won their well-deserved space to grieve, celebrate, mourn our martyrs, rebuild, and breathe. Our hearts are with Gaza today and always, and we are committed to continuing this fight until every inch of Palestine is free.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/816	2025-01-15T18:16:01-08:00

We honor the steadfastness, determination, strength, resilience, and courage of the Palestinan people. This is a victory for resistance and those who refused to abandon the path of liberation.Within Our Lifetime Chair Nerdeen Kiswani stated, -They thought they could turn our people against our resistance, as if they were not one in the same-. Over a year of enduring genocide proved Gaza’s commitment to liberation. Not once did the mighty people of Palestine abandon the forces of resistance despite the world's condemnation.

The destruction of Gaza's hospitals and healthcare system as a whole should horrify everyone, and especially our community members who work in this field and understand intimately how bewildering and outrageous it is for ANYONE to target a hospital.A short 5 years ago, Teaneck became the first in the country to declare a lockdown and quarantine in response to the covid-19 pandemic. Holy Name Hospital in the heart of our town underwent drastic changes to respond to the sudden spike in covi!d cases. What would our town, our state, or country look like if during our most vulnerable times, we were being bombarded by a genocidal military that disregards international law?BOMBING HOSPITALS IS A WAR CRIME!Dress warmly, bring your flags, kaffiyehs, signs, and noise makers. Make your voices heard. makers. Make your voices heard.We demand Dr. Husam Abu Safiya's release.We demand the release of all healthcare workers abducted by the occupation.We demand a STOP to airstrikes on hospitals.We demand our community show up for the people of Palestine. They are watching and they can hear us.SHOW UP!

At the time, following global outrage, the occupation sought to blame the attack on the resistance, and when that didn't work, they claimed it was a -misfire-. After seeing the muted global response to its attack on a hospital, the zionist occupation has since then embarked on an intentional annihilation and mass-murdering campaign, specifically targeting Gaza's healthcare infrastructure.We are urging communities in the NJ/NY area to answer the calls of the steadfast healthcare workers in Gaza, like Dr. Husam Abu Safiya, chief of Kamal Adwan Hospital, who was abducted by occupational forces on Saturday, December 28th of 2024.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/811	2025-01-11T22:19:13-08:00

As we are about to enter the third calendar year of the ongoing genocide, many are still citing statistics that 45,000 Palestinians have been killed in the past 450+ days. But in an interview on December 30th 2024, Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah confirmed what some medical experts have been saying for months: that the actual -number [of martyrs] is closer to 300,000,- or -around 10 to 12% of Gaza’s population.-On Monday January 6th people will be calling out sick in New York City and across the U.S. alongside health care workers to take part in mobilizations for Gaza under the slogan -Sick From Genocide.- Within Our Lifetime has answered that call, alongside Doctors Against Genocide and Healthcare Workers for Palestine.
