Some of the top cops overseeing the force and specifically tasked with repressing the movement for Palestine have a record of brutalizing, abusing, and killing New Yorkers in cold blood, including Chief of Patrol John Chell who murdered Ortanzso Bovell in 2008.This latest police mass shooting comes on the heels of a wide-ranging federal investigation against Adams and the NYPD that has already led to the resignations of several Adams affiliates, including NYPD Commissioner Caban and Adam's top lawyer Lisa Zornberg, and today two former City officials were indicted by federal prosecutors. However, we know Adams and the NYPD's true crimes are not merely corruption and campaign finance violations: they stand guilty for the ongoing murders of Black New Yorkers and their unqualified material support to the zionist genocide of Palestinians.Data on NYPD murders for 2022 + 2023 accessible here: https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/neighborhoods#nationwide. Gothamist reports 12 NYPD killings in 2024 here: https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-shoots-person-in-brooklyn-police-say(3/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/582	2024-09-16T15:45:02-07:00

Our liberation struggles are intertwined and as Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims it is our duty to rise up alongside our Black brothers and sisters against NYPD violence which mirrors the zionist occupation in NYC's Black and brown communities. The NYPD has grown increasingly militarized under the Adams administration both in retaliation against popular movements for Black and Palestinian liberation, and in an escalation of Broken Windows-style policing that never left NYC as well as a surge in stop and frisk incidents which have reached their highest frequency in a decade. From drones, bag checks, cops and military personnel occupying every subway station, we are witnessing an witnessing an increasingly violent police state that has been the daily reality of Black people in this country for hundreds of years. We’ve seen more and more police collaboration with the IDF who has been committing a genocide against our people in Palestine for 76 years, killing at least 200,000 Palestinians since October alone.(2/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/581	2024-09-16T15:44:43-07:00

Today, September 13th, marks 31 years since the signing of the so-called -Oslo Accords- in 1993 and 31 years of the Palestinian people rejecting Oslo and continuing to resist the illegitimate, genocidal zionist entity by any means necessary. The negotiations, which were brokered by the US, resulted in the PLO recognizing -israel- and denouncing armed struggle. At the time of the signing the late Palestinian intellectual Edward Said declared, -Let us call the agreement by its real name: an instrument of Palestinian surrender.- But surrender the Palestinian masses did not.From the ongoing holocaust in Gaza to the largest invasion and assault on the West Bank since 2002, the Palestinian people continue to resist and resist and resist. From our prisoners to our martyrs, from our freedom fighters to our intellectuals, from Zakaria Zubeidi to Ibrahim Al-Nabulsi, from Khader Adnan to Basil Al-Araj, from Nizar Banat to Abu Shujaa, one generation after the next have declared time and time again: -No surrender!	https://t.me/wolpalestine/576	2024-09-13T20:34:51-07:00

Today the struggle to #ShutDownAttica and free all political prisoners from the US to 🇵🇸continues.Sparked by the murder of George Jackson in San Quentin prison in California weeks prior, the Attica rebellion lasted for four days. On Sept 13th under the orders of the Governor of NY, state police stormed the prison and carried out a premeditated bloodbath, massacring 39 people. In 2021, just three days before the 50th anniversary of the Attica Uprising, six Palestinian prisoners carried out the heroic freedom tunnel escape from -Gilboa- prison. From Attica to Gilboa, from 1971 to 2021 to the present, prisoners revolt by any means necessary!	https://t.me/wolpalestine/573	2024-09-09T20:34:30-07:00

For 76 years, from 1948 to September 6th to October 7th, in the face of ethnic cleansing and genocide, torture and rape, siege and blockade, death and destruction, slaughter and annihilation, the Palestinian people have resisted, and resisted and resisted by any means necessary. Assata Shakur once wrote that -A wall is just a wall and nothing more at all. It can be broken down.- With every freedom tunnel dug, every wall broken down, every concentration camp and open-air prison liberated, we are brought closer to Palestinian liberation. During the occupation’s latest invasion of the West Bank, the largest since 2002, nearly 40 Palestinians have been martyred, many of them while taking up arms in defense of the camps.Just days ago Zakaria Al-Zubeidi’s son Mohammed was martyred when he and four other freedom fighters were targeted in a drone strike by IOF in Tubas. Following in his father’s path, Mohammed rose in defense of the land, like Abu Shujaa, Ibrahim Al-Nabulsi and thousands like them. From Gaza to Jenin, Tulkarem to Nablus, Tubas to Al-Khalil, Al-Quds to the occupied interior, Palestine resists as one nation, one people, one struggle. Until liberation Within Our Lifetime.🇵🇸(2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/572	2024-09-06T19:20:43-07:00
