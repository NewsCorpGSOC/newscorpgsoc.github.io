As we are about to enter the third calendar year of the ongoing genocide, many are still citing statistics that 45,000 Palestinians have been killed in the past 450+ days. But in an interview on December 30th 2024, Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah confirmed what some medical experts have been saying for months: that the actual -number [of martyrs] is closer to 300,000,- or -around 10 to 12% of Gaza‚Äôs population.-On Monday January 6th people will be calling out sick in New York City and across the U.S. alongside health care workers to take part in mobilizations for Gaza under the slogan -Sick From Genocide.- Within Our Lifetime has answered that call, alongside Doctors Against Genocide and Healthcare Workers for Palestine.

Use your sick days, your mental health days, or unpaid leave to join this mass protest. We call on doctors to give notes to those who need them to call out. This is not just about your health‚Äîit is about drawing a line and disrupting the machinery of apathy that allows these crimes to continue unchecked.This is about action grounded in reality: ‚Ä¢ The reality that hospitals are sacred spaces meant for healing, not targets of war. ‚Ä¢ The reality that healthcare workers like Dr. Hussam embody our shared commitment to life itself, and their abduction is a crime against all of us. ‚Ä¢ The reality that global silence enables genocide. ‚Ä¢ The reality that Gaza‚Äôs destruction is a political choice‚Äîand resisting it is our moral obligation.We cannot -go on as normal- while the systematic destruction of Gaza unfolds. Our bodies bear the weight of this violence, even from afar. Let us use our collective exhaustion, our heartbreak, and our anger as tools of resistance. Mobilizing, attending rallies, organizing teach-ins, or doing outreach on this day is not a luxury or a privilege‚Äîit is a necessity for our shared survival and humanity.Together, we can turn our sickness into strength, our grief into defiance, and our solidarity into a force too powerful to ignore. For the people of Gaza. For the preservation of healthcare as a human right. For Dr. Hussam and all those who fight to save lives in the face of unimaginable violence. Take the day. Resist.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/793	2024-12-31T09:56:29-08:00

Sick from genocide: On January 6th take a sick day to stand against the Destruction of Life and Healthcare in GazaThe genocide in Gaza is not just a distant crisis‚Äîit is a direct assault on life itself. that strikes at the core of our collective humanity. The bombings of hospitals, the targeting of healthcare workers, and the abduction of Dr. Hussam Abu Sufiya from Kamal Adwan Hospital are not just assaults on Gaza‚Äîthey are assaults on the very essence of care, healing, and life itself. These are crimes that reverberate globally, leaving us all wounded.We are sick.Sick with grief.Sick with rage.Sick with helplessness as we watch the deliberate dismantling of Gaza‚Äôs healthcare and the global silence that enables it.But this sickness has a name: it is moral injury. And we refuse to stand by and let it fester in silence.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/792	2024-12-31T09:56:22-08:00

The Palestinian Authority initiated the siege of Jenin Camp under the pretext that it is filled with -outlaws.- In truth, it is a camp of heroism, steadfastly focused on liberating Palestine from the zionist occupation, rather than being drawn into the internal strife that the PA and zionist forces seek to provoke across the West Bank. As the zionist forces are being humiliated in Gaza, under US and -israeli- supervision, the Palestinian Authority was sent to suppress the resistance in Jenin. The PA‚Äôs ongoing siege led to the martyrdom of six Palestinians, as it continues to target Palestinians in the camp, whether they are resistance fighters or -civilians.- In reality, there is no distinction between resistance fighters and -civilians.- Every Palestinian is a resistance fighter, whether resisting with an Expo marker like Refaat Al-Areer or with a camera like the journalist, Shatha Al-Sabbagh, the sixth martyr to ascend due to the ongoing treacherous siege of Jenin Camp. Shatha is the sister of the martyr Motasem Al-Sabbagh, who ascended on March 7, 2023, at the hands of the occupation forces. Today, Shatha was martyred by the same evil‚Äîthe -Palestinian- Authority. Shatha used her voice to defend her camp, heroically ascending to martyrdom while advocating for the truth, an act that made her a target of the PA forces.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/791	2024-12-29T15:02:58-08:00

Since its inception, the Palestinian Authority has always been used as a tool to expand the zionist project, and submit to US Imperialism. From Oslo to the current siege of Jenin Camp, the Palestinian Authority has always been and will always remain the enemy of the Palestinian cause as it is participating in the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian Authority, which serves zionism rather than representing Palestine, remains a barrier to complete liberation and attempts to obstruct the resistance from achieving its goals. However, history has always proven that the resistance will prevail and come out victorious as it is the resistance that truly represents the masses of the homeland.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/790	2024-12-29T15:02:15-08:00

As the last functioning hospital in Northern Gaza, its violent raid and burning by Israeli Occupation Forces left patients and staff displaced, with hundreds of individuals unaccounted for, including hospital director Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya.New testimonies have shed light on the brutal treatment endured by Dr. Hussam. According to the Ministry of Health‚Äôs Director General, Dr. Muneer Alboursh, survivors have reported that Dr. Hussam, after believing he had reached safety, was forced to strip by an Israeli officer and was subsequently beaten by multiple soldiers.Survivors interviewed today by @EuroMedHR also revealed that Israeli forces carried out summary executions during the assault, including of individuals carrying white flags‚Äîan egregious violation of international law.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/788	2024-12-28T14:24:03-08:00

On December 27, Israeli Occupation Forces forcibly raided and set fire to Kamal Adwan Hospital, the last remaining functioning hospital in Northern Gaza. Patients and medical staff were evacuated under threat of weapons, with reports of men being stripped, beaten, and searched, while women were searched and forced to remove their hijabs.The evacuated patients, some critically ill, were made to walk over a mile under the escort of a tank to the Indonesian Hospital, which itself is severely damaged, lacking basic medical supplies, water, and electricity. The fate of over 300 individuals remains unknown, including Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the hospital‚Äôs head, and journalist Mohammad Al-Sharif, who were detained during the assault.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/786	2024-12-27T19:32:46-08:00

Yemen has been one of the only brave nations to demonstrate what it means to defend Palestine. ‚ÄéThe people of Yemen are willing to sacrifice it all for Palestine.

Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church Atallah Hanna has previously called on -the churches of the world, in the east and west, to urgently defend Palestine, the children of Palestine and the Palestinian cause.

We follow the example from Gaza to Bethlehem, to Jerusalem and beyond in calling for solidarity with Gaza‚Äôs Christian community and all Palestinians facing annihilation. There can be no Christmas without Gaza, and we can only celebrate by standing against injustice, with the Palestinian people in support of total liberation from the occupation.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/782	2024-12-25T17:29:59-08:00

Christian leaders in Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, have cancelled Christmas celebrations for the 2nd year in a row in recognition of the ongoing genocide in Gaza that has claimed the lives of over 200,000 Palestinians and in solidarity with the threat of total extinction facing Gaza‚Äôs Christian community. The zionist entity has repeatedly targeted Gaza‚Äôs Christian community, the world‚Äôs oldest. In October 2023 the zionist entity bombed the Church of Saint Porphyrius in a brutal attack that claimed the lives of 18 Christian Palestinians, who harbored in the Church in hopes of safety. Church-affiliated hospitals, heritage sites, and more have been devastated. In response to this existential threat, Father Antonios Hananya of the Holy Orthodox Church of Jerusalem urged in an address this year: -If a Priest must fight, just as a Muslim Sheikh defends women and children, I will go and fight myself.-(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/781	2024-12-25T17:29:39-08:00

Today would have marked the 55th birthday of Khaled Nabhan and the 5th birthday of his beloved granddaughter, Reem Ali Badwan.Reem, known as -the soul of his soul,- was tragically martyred at just two and a half years old in Gaza during the relentless Israeli airstrikes in November 2023.Thirteen months later, only eight days before his birthday, Khaled Nabhan was also martyred by the same zionist forces that took Reem‚Äôs life.Reem, born on her grandfather‚Äôs birthday, brought joy to Khaled‚Äôs life. From the moment she was born, she embodied everything beautiful to him. He embraced her tightly and told her mother at the time, -Reem is mine, and I am hers‚Ä¶ I would carefully choose her clothes and toys and provide for all her needs.-	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/780	2024-12-23T09:16:51-08:00

Rather than confronting the foreign occupation forces, they focus on suppressing resistance from Jenin Camp to the Gaza Strip, while the so-called -outlaws- of Jenin Camp remain steadfast in their commitment to the liberation of Palestine.The ongoing siege of Jenin Camp is being carried out under the -Fenzel Plan-, a security strategy developed by Michael Fenzel, the U.S. Security Coordinator between -israel- and the -Palestinian- Authority. Fenzel‚Äôs plan seeks to suppress resistance in the region to pave the way for peace deals, normalization, and coordination with the occupation. However, this plan is bound to fail, much like the Oslo Accords, as the people of Palestine have consistently rejected plans of normalization while supporting resistance. This is the reality not only in Jenin Camp but across the entire West Bank, where the idea of capitulation has been rejected, and the principled idea of resistance continues to be embraced by the masses. Local sources have reported that Fenzel met with the PA security forces before the operation in Jenin. It is also no surprise that this campaign is being carried out after the IOF has repeatedly failed to defeat the resistance in Jenin Camp. As a result of the PA's ongoing siege, Rebhi Shalabi, Yazid Ja'ayseh, and the child Mohammed Al-Amer ascended to martyrdom. As the siege continues, families are deprived of water and electricity. Children are being denied access to education, and journalists are being silenced to prevent them from reporting on the situation.The people of Jenin Camp remain steadfast, confident in the resistance that will pave the path to victory. Despite being pursued by PA forces and the IOF, they are supported by the mothers of martyrs and the children of Jenin Camp, who envision a future where their homeland is fully liberated from all forms of occupation, including the traitorous -Palestinian- Authority.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/779	2024-12-22T16:43:45-08:00

Jenin is not just the cradle of resistance but it is also the cradle of loyalty to the people of Palestine. Since October 7, Jenin has been targeted for its actions in solidarity with Gaza. However, the suppression of resistance in Jenin Camp predates October 7, as the camp has long been a target of the occupation forces and now it is a target of the PA forces, who justify their treacherous actions by labeling the resistance as -outlaws-, the same term used by the occupation forces when pursuing fighters in the West Bank. In reality, it is the PA forces who are the outlaws as they have repeatedly betrayed the Palestinian cause and abandoned Gaza. (1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/778	2024-12-22T16:41:33-08:00

Righteous soul and grandfather of Reem, our three year old martyr who was murdered by the occupation just a year prior, who Abu Diaa called the -Spirit of my Spirit-. Nabhan was martyred alongside 4 others, he was a devout Muslim with a heart of gold and beloved to everyone he met. Before the egregious zionist entity murdered him, he was helping rescuers and medics take care of injured Palestinian children, playing with them, feeding cats, wandering through campsites and hospitals, feeding communities, spreading joy, hope, and love with a smile on his face that remains in tact as he goes back to be reunited with Reem.We testify to the man you were.
