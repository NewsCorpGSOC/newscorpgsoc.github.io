Nerdeen Kiswani speaks on our community’s need for bravery and courage in a time where our tuition and tax dollars are funding genocide and the further colonization of Palestine, amidst constant state and university-sanctioned repression. -You can’t claim to be an ally while you’re killing us- -Nerdeen Kiswani on the Let’s Talk Palestine PodcastStudents must be UNRELENTING in the fight for divestment.

For 400 days, Gaza has been on fire, and this fire has not yet been extinguished as the occupation forces continue to bomb every area of the Gaza Strip, resulting in the displacement, hunger, and martyrdom of thousands and thousands of Palestinians. Those who are wounded are left to suffer as oxygen tanks and other medical equipment are no longer functioning in the hospitals of Gaza, making it more difficult to treat patients.Yet despite all of this beign documented day in and day out for the whole world to see, the zionist entity continues its campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide with impunity. Today in the northern Gaza Strip, occupation forces have yet again committed another massacre after bombing a family home in Jabalia Camp, resulting in over 36 martyrs as seen in this photograph taken today.This massacre was carried out by the zionist entity with US funding and weapons. Let this serve as a reminder that the United States has blood on its hands and that blood will not wash away with a new president in office.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/723	2024-11-10T17:32:38-08:00

Yesterday November 9th 2024 marked 400 days of the ongoing genocide in Gaza and 400 days and 76 years of Palestinian resistance to zionist settler colonialism. In recent days, as fires have raged from New Jersey to Prospect Park, NYC has experienced the worst air quality the city has seen in months, with the city issuing warnings of serious health effects. For New Yorkers who have turned a blind eye to the horrors of the genocide in Gaza, this is not even a taste of what Palestinians in Gaza have been experiencing for over 400 days.One can only imagine what Gaza is going through with constant fires erupting due to the repeated bombings and massacres committed by the zionist entity. This past year we have seen the zionist entity burn down tents, homes, and hospitals, leading to our martyrs being burned alive while the world watches.

Let it be known that both Harris and Trump intend to continue the genocide in Gaza while continuing to crack down on the movement for Palestine and all peoples' struggles within the belly of the beast. The difference between the two is that Trump remains open and honest about these intentions while the Democratic Party and Harris obscure the truth behind liberal language. Democrats like Harris lie in an attempt to co-opt our movements, using slogans that imply respect for Palestinian life while murdering them and condemning our people's resistance.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/708	2024-11-02T08:16:51-07:00

It was on the 18th of October, 2011 that Yahya Sinwar was released in the -Wafa al-Ahrar- prisoner exchange deal that liberated 1,027 prisoners held in the occupation's dungeons.

Last night, activists took action to protest AOC at her Astoria office by holding a vigil for the martyrs of Palestine after over a year of lies about supporting a ceasefire as she continues to co-opt progressive politics to run cover for Biden, Harris, and the Democratic Party's genocide in Gaza. The memorial featured Shaban Al-Dalou, the young Palestinian who was filmed burning to death after the occupation bombed refugee tents next to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. AOC has shamelessly already torn down the memorial this morning, hoping to hide the blood on her hands as she desecrates any attempt to honor the over 300k Palestinians murdered with our taxes.

As the zionist entity grows increasingly desperate to delay its inevitable collapse, it has escalated the genocidal aggression against the people of Gaza beyond comprehension. Hours ago the occupation forces bombed Palestinians seeking refuge around Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza, burning them alive in the tents where they were sleeping.

As green-lighted by the United States, the occupation’s primary partner I n facilitating this ongoing genocide, it is clear that this is a coordinated plan to starve, displace, and massacre as many Palestinians in Jabalia as possible.For the past year, the zionist entity has aimed to destabilize the resistance in Jabalia, after failing to defeat the resistance in northern Gaza, particularly in the camp. The IOF have again resorted to cowardly tactics through horrific airstrikes targeting schools, hospitals, and residential areas. Over the past nine days alone, at least 300 Palestinians have been martyred during the ongoing siege of Jabalia.

She was also mother of 3, married, a great friend, and someone who deeply believed in freedom for her people.&nbsp; We pay tribute to Wafa, we hold her and her martyred family, as we honor all the martyrs of Palestine.&nbsp; We invite the community to keep this memorial site going, and to confront AOC and all so-called progressive politicians who act as agents of empire.UPDATE: The memorial, which contained mourning art and photos of martyred children contributed by community members AOC represents, was taken down first thing this morning and shoved in the trash by AOC's staff. AOC's office has chosen to erase the memory of Palestinians. She continues to prioritize the imperial interests of Israeli apartheid over the basic Palestinian right to life.(5/5)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/689	2024-10-17T11:06:08-07:00

We condemn empire, which uses any made up justification at all to drop apartment blocks on people’s heads to further imperial expansion.-'Israel' made the desert bloom.- Kamala Harris, who AOC campaigns for, recently repeated this racist zionist adage.&nbsp; A client told a Native comrade the week of indigenous people’s day: -it was impossible to grow watermelons before -Israel- because it was a desert.-&nbsp; Zionists really think that there was no agriculture done by indigenous peoples of the entire levant, in the famed -fertile crescent- before they began their campaign to colonize Palestine.&nbsp; This, while teenagers and children in Gaza are using shards of plastic and wire to construct tiny greenhouses for their seedlings, so that the people around them may have a bite of freshness to keep their spirits strong amidst US-backed forced famine and genocide.(4/5)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/688	2024-10-17T11:05:53-07:00

AOC ran point on spreading the propaganda that led to this genocide, including signing House Res 966 -condemning rape and sexual violence by Hamas- on October 7th. &nbsp;That was debunked, but has been weaponized to justify mass lynching of Palestinians ever since.-Hamas is a terrorist organization- Ocasio-Cortez said, as she signed resolution 888 declaring -Israel- a jewish ethnosupremacist homeland. -Hamas are terrorists,- she repeated over and over as she maligned NYC-based Palestinian, Arab and Muslim organizing, where they are targeted/beaten/doxxed/surveilled/threatened with murder—for refusing to condemn resistance to colonization by any means necessary. Harris and Biden -are working tirelessly for a ceasefire- she said as they send more than 8.7 billion in September 2024, rounding out an unprecedented year of money to -Israel- in full military support of its genocide (17.9 billion). &nbsp;(3/5)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/687	2024-10-17T11:05:38-07:00

We also redecorated surrounding areas to share the kind of treachery the politician has been involved in.(2/5)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/685	2024-10-17T11:05:20-07:00

Last night, activists took action to protest AOC at her Astoria office by holding a vigil for the martyrs of Palestine after over a year of lies about supporting a ceasefire as she continues to co-opt progressive politics to run cover for Biden, Harris, and the Democratic Party's genocide in Gaza. The memorial featured Shaban Al-Dalou, the young Palestinian who was filmed burning to death after the occupation bombed refugee tents next to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. AOC has shamelessly already torn down the memorial this morning, hoping to hide the blood on her hands as she desecrates any attempt to honor the over 300k Palestinians murdered with our taxes. We call on all New Yorkers in solidarity with Palestine to continue taking creative action to confront all those complicit and responsible for the annihilation of our people.

Within Our Lifetime joins the National Lawyers Guild in condemning the US and Canada's attack on Samidoun and the escalating crackdown on Palestine:-The National Lawyers Guild is outraged by the expanded use of anti-terrorism laws to attack social movements. Like the L.A. 8, this targeting of Samidoun, Khaled Barakat and the Palestinian liberation movement is also an embarrassment to the rule of law, and we call on all peoples of conscience to stand with us as we defend human rights advocates and social movements that practice their constitutional right to freedom of speech, against the genocide of the Palestinian people. We must fight back before it is too late.

Tired of the groceries not lasting to the first of the month. Tired of the threat of ICE coming around. Tired of cops jumping out on us and humiliating us on the block.

After witnessing all of the hospital bombings israel has conducted in the past year, it is easy to forget how the US media worked so diligently to make us believe that they would never do such a thing after the occupation forces bombed Al-Ahli hospital nearly one year ago today on October 17, 2023. We in the US bear responsibility for this genocide as our government and mainstream institutions have been funding and manufacturing consent for the annihilation of our people. Those of us in the belly of the beast, who continue to fund these atrocities with our tax dollars, must not normalize this violence. The time to act is now. Rise and Resist.(2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/678	2024-10-13T19:51:41-07:00

As the zionist entity grows increasingly desperate to delay its inevitable collapse, it has escalated the genocidal aggression against the people of Gaza beyond comprehension. Hours ago the occupation forces bombed Palestinians seeking refuge around Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza, burning them alive in the tents where they were sleeping. This attack followed a successful operation by the resistance in neutralizing military forces. Attacking critical health infrastructure has been a consistent part of the occupation’s strategy to destroy life in Gaza and carry out this genocide.(1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/677	2024-10-13T19:51:02-07:00

This continued siege comes as part of the enemy's plan to displace Palestinians in Jabalia camp. As green-lighted by the United States, the occupation’s primary partner I n facilitating this ongoing genocide, it is clear that this is a coordinated plan to starve, displace, and massacre as many Palestinians in Jabalia as possible.For the past year, the zionist entity has aimed to destabilize the resistance in Jabalia, after failing to defeat the resistance in northern Gaza, particularly in the camp. The IOF have again resorted to cowardly tactics through horrific airstrikes targeting schools, hospitals, and residential areas. Over the past nine days alone, at least 300 Palestinians have been martyred during the ongoing siege of Jabalia. Yet even in the face of this unthinkable violence, our people declare: -Long live the camp, and long live the invincible spirit of Jabalia.-	https://t.me/wolpalestine/675	2024-10-13T17:50:50-07:00
