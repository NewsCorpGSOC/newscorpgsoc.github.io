The freed prisoner Mohammed Al-Ardah recalls the moment Zakaria received the news of his son’s martyrdom, quoting him as saying, -If Mohammed had not been like me [in the struggle], he would not have been my son.-Zakaria, a symbol of the intifada, and a symbol of Palestinian hospitality, as we recall the moments he had offered to donate his bone marrow to the imprisoned leader Walid Daqqah before his martyrdom, embodying his lifelong spirit of sacrifice.In his own words, -There will be no peace or stability in the Middle East until every prisoner is free.- The liberation of our prisoners is only the first step of liberating Palestine within our lifetime.🇵🇸(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/838	2025-01-30T09:18:46-08:00

Zakaria is one of the six heroes who liberated themselves from the maximum security -Gilboa- prison in the 2021 Freedom Tunnel operation.He was a prominent figure during the 2002 Battle of Jenin, in which his mother and brother were both martyred. As he once wrote, -Struggle is the basis for the right to the homeland, freedom, and dignity.-Zakaria Zubeidi returns to his homeland, but this time, he walks free on his own terms, stepping through the fragile prison gates, just as he did in 2021, when he heroically tunneled his way out using a spoon. He returns home, to Jenin Camp, to finally bid farewell to his martyred brother, Dawood Zubeidi, and his martyred son, Mohammed Zubeidi, both of whom carried forward the path of resistance.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/837	2025-01-30T09:18:41-08:00

Hind, who was just 5 years old, is one of over 300,000 Palestinians martyred during the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Hind was shot at by the IOF 355 times, alone for hours as she sat on the phone with paramedics from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, surrounded by her martyred family members who were murdered in cold blood before her. They included her uncle Bashar Hamadeh, her aunt, Anam Hamadeh, as well as four of her cousins, Raghad, Mohammed, Sara and Layan.The PRCS released her final words on call in which she said, -I'm so scared, please come. Please call someone to come and take me.-Two paramedics from the PCRS were also martyred while trying to rescue her. Their names were Ahmed Al-Madhoun and Yusuf Al-Zeino.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/835	2025-01-29T15:52:26-08:00

After a series of continual baseless meetings and appeals, at least 13 students are now suspended from NYU. Join these students, faculty and community members tomorrow on Thursday, at 12:30 for a press conference. Following the press conference, students call for a picket at Bobst, where the university has effectively shut down all forms of protest in response to the campus movement for Palestine.

Days after the ceasefire in Gaza went into effect, zionist forces have launched a large-scale assult against Jenin, its refugee camp and surrounding villages, resulting in the deaths of 10 martyrs with dozens more wounded. During the assault IOF carried out multiple air strikes and have targeted healthcare workers and ambulances. -Operation Iron Wall- follows the humiliation and failure of the IOF and the Palestinian Authority to defeat the Palestinian resistance from Gaza to the West Bank, and a nearly 50 day siege by PA forces. This latest display of security coordination has been firmly rejected by the masses who rose up against the siege by the PA and are now confronting the invasion by the occupation with fierce fighting across Jenin. Although the bombs have stopped falling on Gaza, there is no ceasefire in the West Bank, and the genocide will only end when Palestine is free from the river to the sea. 🇵🇸	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/828	2025-01-21T18:13:37-08:00

Ceasefire Commences⏳As Palestinians hostages are released, bruised and traumatized, the inhumane and brutal conditions of israeli prisons are once again exposed. As the occupation takes measures to prevent any -public displays of joy-, the Palestinian Authority enforces occupational orders by abducting Jivara al-Badri of Al-Jazeera. Yet again, illustrating its partnership with the occupation, attempting to control every aspect Palestinian life — even their joy and their pain. Yesterday, an israeli sniper shot dead a Palestinian child in Rafah, in blatant violation of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. The IOF abducted 60 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank yesterday as well.This is a clear reminder of the occupation’s blood thirsty, fascist agenda on full display despite the ceasefire deal.	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/827	2025-01-21T15:12:14-08:00

The New York Times, which falsely claimed the Gaza death toll was exaggerated, has now admitted that the toll was undercounted. As the imperial core, we have a duty to expose these accomplices and demand accountability. Even before October 7, 2023, this year had already become one of the deadliest for Palestinian children in the West Bank. The violence persists because the occupying entity remains entrenched on stolen Palestinian land. Recently, Jenin Camp was bombed twice in weeks, leaving 12 martyrs as the occupation tightened its grip to crush resistance.Liberation is non-negotiable, and justice cannot wait. Join us to demand justice for Palestine!(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/820	2025-01-16T18:40:22-08:00

The struggle continues, and the flood rises stronger! 🇵🇸Join us 🗓️ Saturday, January 18, at ⏰ 2 PM 📍 in front of The New York Times headquarters at 242 W. 41st St. New York, NY 10036 as we demand full liberation from the river to the sea. This is not just a fight for a ceasefire—it’s a fight to end all U.S. financial, media, political, and diplomatic complicity in the crimes of settler colonialism, genocide, and Zionism.The ceasefire while only temporary, was won through the resilience of Palestinian resistance. But true justice demands more: lifting the siege on Gaza, freeing every Palestinian prisoner, and dismantling the occupation entirely.For decades, Palestinians have endured relentless violence, oppression, and dispossession—fueled by U.S. military aid, diplomatic backing, and media propaganda that enable the apartheid regime. Under the Biden administration and the Democratic Party, this complicity has ensured that the bloodshed continues to their very last days in power.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/819	2025-01-16T18:40:18-08:00

Fathers raised their fists in pride. Children ran through the alleys, their cheers and laughter, a louder defiance than any weapon. This is Gaza: resilient, unyielding, unshaken. Every bomb, every lie, and every attempt to sow division has only strengthened its resolve. The resistance is not separate from the people — it is the people. It is their sacrifice, their unity, and their unshakable will. The ceasefire is not merely a -pause-; it is a testament to their perseverance and faith. To the zionists and their allies who hoped for division, the celebrations in Gaza are a powerful reminder: Gaza’s strength lies in its unity, and this unity is built on resilience, faith, and the unrelenting pursuit of justice. Gaza celebrates dignity and honor — a sentiment known only to those who have risen against oppression, to those who have chosen to resist proudly, and stand far from humiliation. Yesterday, Gaza celebrated not just survival, but defiance. Not just life, but the promise of liberation. This is the beating heart of Palestine. Gaza is victorious. Gaza will always be victorious. From Gaza, the intifada was born, and from Gaza, the flood will continue. 🌊(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/818	2025-01-16T10:00:30-08:00

Through the unwavering determination of its people and their deep connection to their homeland, the Palestinian masses have claimed victory on their own terms, defeating the -israeli- occupation forces. The zionist entity sought to eradicate the idea of resistance in Palestine, failing to understand that this idea is eternal—rooted deeply within the hearts of the Palestinian people. Just as the idea will forever be eternal, so will the spirit of our martyrs who continue to guide us to the ultimate goal: complete liberation from the river to the sea. The colonizers believed Gaza would crumble. They thought fear, destruction, and despair would fracture the bond between the resistance and its people, and that the defenders of Gaza would be abandoned. But yesterday, as the dust settled, Gaza stood with pride, dignity, and honor as it continued to defend the last shred of humanity in the world.

We applaud a ceasefire as an effort to preserve the lives of Palestinian people, and we will continue the struggle for complete liberation of Palestine from the river to the sea. Since the beginning, we have made clear that a ceasefire is only a first step in the struggle for true justice against the imperialist zionist and U.S. war machine. Palestinians have finally won their well-deserved space to grieve, celebrate, mourn our martyrs, rebuild, and breathe. Our hearts are with Gaza today and always, and we are committed to continuing this fight until every inch of Palestine is free.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/816	2025-01-15T18:16:01-08:00

We honor the steadfastness, determination, strength, resilience, and courage of the Palestinan people. This is a victory for resistance and those who refused to abandon the path of liberation.Within Our Lifetime Chair Nerdeen Kiswani stated, -They thought they could turn our people against our resistance, as if they were not one in the same-. Over a year of enduring genocide proved Gaza’s commitment to liberation. Not once did the mighty people of Palestine abandon the forces of resistance despite the world's condemnation.

At the time, following global outrage, the occupation sought to blame the attack on the resistance, and when that didn't work, they claimed it was a -misfire-. After seeing the muted global response to its attack on a hospital, the zionist occupation has since then embarked on an intentional annihilation and mass-murdering campaign, specifically targeting Gaza's healthcare infrastructure.We are urging communities in the NJ/NY area to answer the calls of the steadfast healthcare workers in Gaza, like Dr. Husam Abu Safiya, chief of Kamal Adwan Hospital, who was abducted by occupational forces on Saturday, December 28th of 2024.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/811	2025-01-11T22:19:13-08:00
