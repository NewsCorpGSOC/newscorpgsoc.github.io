Today we also join the global call for freedom for Native American political prisoner and elder Leonard Peltier, now 80 years old, who has been unjustly imprisoned since 1976 and is currently serving a life sentence. Leonard‚Äôs health has seriously declined in recent years and he was just released from hospitalization in late October, just months after he was denied parole most recently in July 2024.Like Mumia Abu-Jamal, the Holy Land Foundation 5 and so many of our political prisoners, Leonard is faced with the reality that if he is not freed, he will die in prison. As Leonard wrote in 1999 in his collection of Prison Writings, -When the oppressors succeed with their illegal thefts and depredations, it's called colonialism. When their efforts to colonize indigenous peoples are met with resistance or anything but abject surrender, it's called war. When the colonized peoples attempt to resist their oppression and defend themselves, we're called criminals.-Leonard‚Äôs ongoing struggle for freedom is an urgent reminder that the struggle of Indigenous people across Turtle Island, the struggle of political prisoners worldwide and the struggle for Palestine is all part of the same fight. Free Leonard Peltier! Free Mumia! Free The HLF5! Free Them All!(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/753	2024-11-28T16:54:52-08:00

Today while many sit down to eat in abundance on -Thanksgiving,- Gaza is starving and Palestinians are lining up by the thousands to obtain a single loaf of bread to feed their families. As many join with family and loved ones, we join with the Indigenous people of Turtle Island in declaring: NO THANKSGIVING ON STOLEN LAND! What is for some a day of celebration is for Native Americans a National Day of Mourning. It is with this in mind that we reiterate that if not for the genocide of Indigenous and African people and the theft of the land we now stand on, there would be no U.S. empire. And if there was no U.S. empire, there would no zionist entity currently occupying Palestine. Without the U.S. lifeline, the occupation would not last a day, and could not carry on the genocide in Gaza. (1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/752	2024-11-28T16:54:29-08:00
