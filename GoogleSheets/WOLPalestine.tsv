The New York Times, which falsely claimed the Gaza death toll was exaggerated, has now admitted that the toll was undercounted. As the imperial core, we have a duty to expose these accomplices and demand accountability. Even before October 7, 2023, this year had already become one of the deadliest for Palestinian children in the West Bank. The violence persists because the occupying entity remains entrenched on stolen Palestinian land. Recently, Jenin Camp was bombed twice in weeks, leaving 12 martyrs as the occupation tightened its grip to crush resistance.Liberation is non-negotiable, and justice cannot wait. Join us to demand justice for Palestine!(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/820	2025-01-16T18:40:22-08:00

The struggle continues, and the flood rises stronger! 🇵🇸Join us 🗓️ Saturday, January 18, at ⏰ 2 PM 📍 in front of The New York Times headquarters at 242 W. 41st St. New York, NY 10036 as we demand full liberation from the river to the sea. This is not just a fight for a ceasefire—it’s a fight to end all U.S. financial, media, political, and diplomatic complicity in the crimes of settler colonialism, genocide, and Zionism.The ceasefire while only temporary, was won through the resilience of Palestinian resistance. But true justice demands more: lifting the siege on Gaza, freeing every Palestinian prisoner, and dismantling the occupation entirely.For decades, Palestinians have endured relentless violence, oppression, and dispossession—fueled by U.S. military aid, diplomatic backing, and media propaganda that enable the apartheid regime. Under the Biden administration and the Democratic Party, this complicity has ensured that the bloodshed continues to their very last days in power.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/819	2025-01-16T18:40:18-08:00

Fathers raised their fists in pride. Children ran through the alleys, their cheers and laughter, a louder defiance than any weapon. This is Gaza: resilient, unyielding, unshaken. Every bomb, every lie, and every attempt to sow division has only strengthened its resolve. The resistance is not separate from the people — it is the people. It is their sacrifice, their unity, and their unshakable will. The ceasefire is not merely a -pause-; it is a testament to their perseverance and faith. To the zionists and their allies who hoped for division, the celebrations in Gaza are a powerful reminder: Gaza’s strength lies in its unity, and this unity is built on resilience, faith, and the unrelenting pursuit of justice. Gaza celebrates dignity and honor — a sentiment known only to those who have risen against oppression, to those who have chosen to resist proudly, and stand far from humiliation. Yesterday, Gaza celebrated not just survival, but defiance. Not just life, but the promise of liberation. This is the beating heart of Palestine. Gaza is victorious. Gaza will always be victorious. From Gaza, the intifada was born, and from Gaza, the flood will continue. 🌊(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/818	2025-01-16T10:00:30-08:00

Through the unwavering determination of its people and their deep connection to their homeland, the Palestinian masses have claimed victory on their own terms, defeating the -israeli- occupation forces. The zionist entity sought to eradicate the idea of resistance in Palestine, failing to understand that this idea is eternal—rooted deeply within the hearts of the Palestinian people. Just as the idea will forever be eternal, so will the spirit of our martyrs who continue to guide us to the ultimate goal: complete liberation from the river to the sea. The colonizers believed Gaza would crumble. They thought fear, destruction, and despair would fracture the bond between the resistance and its people, and that the defenders of Gaza would be abandoned. But yesterday, as the dust settled, Gaza stood with pride, dignity, and honor as it continued to defend the last shred of humanity in the world.

We applaud a ceasefire as an effort to preserve the lives of Palestinian people, and we will continue the struggle for complete liberation of Palestine from the river to the sea. Since the beginning, we have made clear that a ceasefire is only a first step in the struggle for true justice against the imperialist zionist and U.S. war machine. Palestinians have finally won their well-deserved space to grieve, celebrate, mourn our martyrs, rebuild, and breathe. Our hearts are with Gaza today and always, and we are committed to continuing this fight until every inch of Palestine is free.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/816	2025-01-15T18:16:01-08:00

We honor the steadfastness, determination, strength, resilience, and courage of the Palestinan people. This is a victory for resistance and those who refused to abandon the path of liberation.Within Our Lifetime Chair Nerdeen Kiswani stated, -They thought they could turn our people against our resistance, as if they were not one in the same-. Over a year of enduring genocide proved Gaza’s commitment to liberation. Not once did the mighty people of Palestine abandon the forces of resistance despite the world's condemnation.

The destruction of Gaza's hospitals and healthcare system as a whole should horrify everyone, and especially our community members who work in this field and understand intimately how bewildering and outrageous it is for ANYONE to target a hospital.A short 5 years ago, Teaneck became the first in the country to declare a lockdown and quarantine in response to the covid-19 pandemic.

At the time, following global outrage, the occupation sought to blame the attack on the resistance, and when that didn't work, they claimed it was a -misfire-. After seeing the muted global response to its attack on a hospital, the zionist occupation has since then embarked on an intentional annihilation and mass-murdering campaign, specifically targeting Gaza's healthcare infrastructure.We are urging communities in the NJ/NY area to answer the calls of the steadfast healthcare workers in Gaza, like Dr. Husam Abu Safiya, chief of Kamal Adwan Hospital, who was abducted by occupational forces on Saturday, December 28th of 2024.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/811	2025-01-11T22:19:13-08:00

This is not just about your health—it is about drawing a line and disrupting the machinery of apathy that allows these crimes to continue unchecked.This is about action grounded in reality: • The reality that hospitals are sacred spaces meant for healing, not targets of war. • The reality that healthcare workers like Dr. Hussam embody our shared commitment to life itself, and their abduction is a crime against all of us. • The reality that global silence enables genocide. • The reality that Gaza’s destruction is a political choice—and resisting it is our moral obligation.We cannot -go on as normal- while the systematic destruction of Gaza unfolds. Our bodies bear the weight of this violence, even from afar. Let us use our collective exhaustion, our heartbreak, and our anger as tools of resistance. Mobilizing, attending rallies, organizing teach-ins, or doing outreach on this day is not a luxury or a privilege—it is a necessity for our shared survival and humanity.Together, we can turn our sickness into strength, our grief into defiance, and our solidarity into a force too powerful to ignore. For the people of Gaza. For the preservation of healthcare as a human right. For Dr. Hussam and all those who fight to save lives in the face of unimaginable violence. Take the day.

The Palestinian Authority initiated the siege of Jenin Camp under the pretext that it is filled with -outlaws.- In truth, it is a camp of heroism, steadfastly focused on liberating Palestine from the zionist occupation, rather than being drawn into the internal strife that the PA and zionist forces seek to provoke across the West Bank. As the zionist forces are being humiliated in Gaza, under US and -israeli- supervision, the Palestinian Authority was sent to suppress the resistance in Jenin. The PA’s ongoing siege led to the martyrdom of six Palestinians, as it continues to target Palestinians in the camp, whether they are resistance fighters or -civilians.- In reality, there is no distinction between resistance fighters and -civilians.- Every Palestinian is a resistance fighter, whether resisting with an Expo marker like Refaat Al-Areer or with a camera like the journalist, Shatha Al-Sabbagh, the sixth martyr to ascend due to the ongoing treacherous siege of Jenin Camp. Shatha is the sister of the martyr Motasem Al-Sabbagh, who ascended on March 7, 2023, at the hands of the occupation forces. Today, Shatha was martyred by the same evil—the -Palestinian- Authority. Shatha used her voice to defend her camp, heroically ascending to martyrdom while advocating for the truth, an act that made her a target of the PA forces.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/791	2024-12-29T15:02:58-08:00

The Palestinian Authority, which serves zionism rather than representing Palestine, remains a barrier to complete liberation and attempts to obstruct the resistance from achieving its goals.

Christian leaders in Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, have cancelled Christmas celebrations for the 2nd year in a row in recognition of the ongoing genocide in Gaza that has claimed the lives of over 200,000 Palestinians and in solidarity with the threat of total extinction facing Gaza’s Christian community. The zionist entity has repeatedly targeted Gaza’s Christian community, the world’s oldest. In October 2023 the zionist entity bombed the Church of Saint Porphyrius in a brutal attack that claimed the lives of 18 Christian Palestinians, who harbored in the Church in hopes of safety. Church-affiliated hospitals, heritage sites, and more have been devastated. In response to this existential threat, Father Antonios Hananya of the Holy Orthodox Church of Jerusalem urged in an address this year: -If a Priest must fight, just as a Muslim Sheikh defends women and children, I will go and fight myself.-(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/781	2024-12-25T17:29:39-08:00

Fenzel’s plan seeks to suppress resistance in the region to pave the way for peace deals, normalization, and coordination with the occupation. However, this plan is bound to fail, much like the Oslo Accords, as the people of Palestine have consistently rejected plans of normalization while supporting resistance. This is the reality not only in Jenin Camp but across the entire West Bank, where the idea of capitulation has been rejected, and the principled idea of resistance continues to be embraced by the masses. Local sources have reported that Fenzel met with the PA security forces before the operation in Jenin. It is also no surprise that this campaign is being carried out after the IOF has repeatedly failed to defeat the resistance in Jenin Camp. As a result of the PA's ongoing siege, Rebhi Shalabi, Yazid Ja'ayseh, and the child Mohammed Al-Amer ascended to martyrdom. As the siege continues, families are deprived of water and electricity. Children are being denied access to education, and journalists are being silenced to prevent them from reporting on the situation.The people of Jenin Camp remain steadfast, confident in the resistance that will pave the path to victory. Despite being pursued by PA forces and the IOF, they are supported by the mothers of martyrs and the children of Jenin Camp, who envision a future where their homeland is fully liberated from all forms of occupation, including the traitorous -Palestinian- Authority.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/779	2024-12-22T16:43:45-08:00

Jenin is not just the cradle of resistance but it is also the cradle of loyalty to the people of Palestine. Since October 7, Jenin has been targeted for its actions in solidarity with Gaza. However, the suppression of resistance in Jenin Camp predates October 7, as the camp has long been a target of the occupation forces and now it is a target of the PA forces, who justify their treacherous actions by labeling the resistance as -outlaws-, the same term used by the occupation forces when pursuing fighters in the West Bank. In reality, it is the PA forces who are the outlaws as they have repeatedly betrayed the Palestinian cause and abandoned Gaza. (1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/778	2024-12-22T16:41:33-08:00

Righteous soul and grandfather of Reem, our three year old martyr who was murdered by the occupation just a year prior, who Abu Diaa called the -Spirit of my Spirit-. Nabhan was martyred alongside 4 others, he was a devout Muslim with a heart of gold and beloved to everyone he met. Before the egregious zionist entity murdered him, he was helping rescuers and medics take care of injured Palestinian children, playing with them, feeding cats, wandering through campsites and hospitals, feeding communities, spreading joy, hope, and love with a smile on his face that remains in tact as he goes back to be reunited with Reem.We testify to the man you were. We will honor you. We will honor all our martyrs. We will continue to fight for you.	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/776	2024-12-18T14:03:42-08:00
