STARTING AT 12:00 PM EST‼️🇵🇸https://shorturl.at/kMWGLRegister to attend this online conversation with Palestine Diaspora Movement featuring WOL chair Nerdeen Kiswani, titled -Resistance until Return: How the Diaspora Can Help the Homeland.-The primary purpose of this event is to unify the collective power of the Palestinian diaspora and leverage it to liberate our homeland. Our goals include re-educating ourselves on the core principles of Palestine (Al Thawabet), serving the homeland in its struggle for liberation, and emphasizing the central role of Islam in our struggle for self-autonomy.Your learning doesn't end here. The cause for Palestine is not a one-time event. You must continue education and turn it into concrete action. If you are committed to the movement, you are committed long-term. Join in half an hour for an enriching and empowering online event and experience. Together, we can educate and mobilize to serve our homeland.	https://t.me/wolpalestine/538	2024-08-18T08:45:50-07:00

Palestinians living in the refugee camp were forced to become displaced once again due to the aggression by the zionist-allied Phalangist forces. However, the Palestinians refused to accept humiliation, they refused to accept massacres and displacement, and they resisted until their very last breath as they were always determined to one day return to their homeland. This steadfastness continues on today in Gaza, the West Bank, and all of Palestine as the Palestinian masses and its resistance are defending their homeland against the zionist entity knowing that they will one day liberate Palestine within our lifetime.Find all of these posters and more at the Palestine Poster Project: palestineposterproject.org(2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/528	2024-08-12T20:03:42-07:00

It has been estimated that over 3,000 Palestinians were martyred during the siege of the Tal Al-Zaatar Refugee Camp. (1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/525	2024-08-12T20:03:29-07:00
