Happening TODAY, October 10th: join the 2nd public NOISE DEMO at Brooklyn Navy Yard at 4pm to continue to escalate pressure against local genocide profiteers. It has now been one year of US-Israeli genocide in Gaza, and the zionist entity has expanded their attacks into the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. All the while, companies at Brooklyn Navy Yard have quietly been equipping the IOF with the technology used to carry out mass slaughter. This must stop. Through sustained, collective action, we will force Brooklyn Navy Yard to terminate their contracts with Easy Aerial and Crye Precision and cut ties with the military industrial complex.(1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/671	2024-10-10T08:47:52-07:00

We are a collective of collectives who organize autonomously with our respective crews &amp; comrades in our communities. We have come together to articulate our conditions of unfreedom from the poor and struggling margins of the Empire State who aren’t at your marches and protests. We want to point to the interconnectivity of our struggles and lovingly turn our attention (and hopefully yours too) towards the margins and the material conditions there that prevent the people rising up together!

The zionist entity makes the miscalculation of believing that the martyrdom of Lebanese resistance leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah this past weekend will leave the country vulnerable for invasion. But as Palestinian intellectual and martyr Basil Al-Araj wrote, -Those who have died and those who will die will never affect the resistance's system and cohesion because the structure and formations of the resistance are not centralized but horizontal and widespread.- The resistance is in the hearts of 100,000 fighters ready to defend their land and they will do just that.The resistance defeated the zionist occupation in Lebanon twice before, and it will do it again.⁩(3/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/643	2024-10-01T11:25:02-07:00

As the Lebanese resistance prepares for an invasion, the zionist forces are escalating their attempts to trigger a regional war by bombing Damascus, Syria as well as the Ain al Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in South Lebanon last night. Multiple people were wounded and killed in both strikes including Hassan Al-Maqdah, a Palestinian resistance fighter in Ain al Hilweh, and Safaa Al-Ahmed, a Syrian journalist in Damascus. She was martyred shortly after covering the israeli aggressions in both Lebanon and Syria.At the same time as the zionist entity was carrying out these aggressions across the region, Yemen was demonstrating its fearlessness once again, striking Tel Aviv with its second hypersonic missile as the IOF was mounting a sea of tanks at the Lebanese border. Today, Palestinians have conducted multiple shooting operations in Yafa and Tel Aviv while resistance fighters have fended off zionist occupation forces’ attempts to besiege Nablus once again. Just now, Iran launched a barrage of missiles at israel. The past days’ developments make clearer than ever that we are all linked — from Palestine to Lebanon to Syria to Yemen to Iran and beyond. Despite the borders that divide us, our peoples' resistance unites us.(2/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/642	2024-10-01T11:24:47-07:00

Their aim this past week has been to shock and stun the Lebanese people to a point where they do not have the capacity to fight back. They are gravely mistaken.(1/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/640	2024-10-01T11:23:56-07:00

The Al-Aqsa Intifada then, and our people’s unwavering resistance to this day, from Gaza, Jenin, Tulkarem, Nablus, Al-Quds, Al-Khalil, to the occupied interior in 1948 and beyond, embodies our people’s refusal to surrender and steadfastness in fighting for liberation by any means necessary, passed on from generation to generation.From Zakaria Zubeidi’s generation, the generation who led the armed struggle during the Al-Aqsa Intifada from the camps in the West Bank, the struggle was later passed on to the cubs who grew up during the Intifada like the freedom fighters and martyrs Abu Shujaa, born in 1998 in Nur Shams camp in Tulkarem, and Ibrahim Al-Nabulsi, born five years later in 2003 in Nablus.While zionists seek to vilify the word Intifada and demonize Palestinian resistance, the world has come to see the Palestinian cause as a heroic struggle in the face of settler colonialism, ethnic cleansing, genocide and annihilation.Until liberation and return within our lifetime, the Intifada will continue.🇵🇸 (2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/639	2024-09-29T21:22:20-07:00

Twenty four years ago on September 28th 2000, the Al-Aqsa Intifada launched a new chapter of Palestinian resistance, from mass popular uprisings in the streets, to the iconic images of Palestinian youth throwing stones at tanks, to armed struggle waged by Palestinian resistance groups.The Al-Aqsa Intifada was ignited when the zionist war criminal Ariel Sharon stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound under the protection of over 1,000 occupation forces in an act of provocation that was condemned around the world.&nbsp;Sharon’s actions caused outrage amongst Palestinians, who reacted to the attack on Al-Aqsa by confronting and resisting zionist forces throughout Palestine.Over the course of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, nearly 5,000 Palestinians were martyred resisting the zionist enemy.When the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993, the late Palestinian intellectual Edward Said reacted by saying, -Let us call the agreement by its real name: an instrument of Palestinian surrender.- (1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/638	2024-09-29T21:21:59-07:00

On the path to liberating Al-Quds and Palestine, he has always been on the front lines supporting our people in their fight against the zionist entity. For the past 11 months, Lebanon has sacrificed everything for simply confronting the zionist aggression of Gaza. The martyrdom of such a figure may generate feelings of despair, but resistance does not rest in one man's hands — it is in the hearts of millions who refuse to abandon Palestine. Thousands will rise from his place in the earth to challenge this cruel world and carry on our people's task. The weight of his martyrdom will crash down on the heads of the settler colony.-We will not abandon Gaza and its people, Palestine, and the sanctities of the nation in Palestine, no matter the circumstances, challenges, and sacrifices. Any hopes of silencing the support fronts are futile. What we started 11 months ago, we will continue, no matter the intimidations and sacrifices.- These are the eternal words of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, even after his martyrdom, his ideas and legacy will remain a beacon of hope for thousands to honor after him.(2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/637	2024-09-28T10:11:01-07:00

Within Our Lifetime mourns the martyrdom of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Lebanese resistance and a symbol of the steadfast struggle to liberate Palestine. Nasrallah was killed by the zionist entity along with several other members of the resistance's senior leadership amid a hailstorm of bombs which rained down on the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh yesterday, killing hundreds and destroying entire city blocks in the process.Nasrallah built up a guerrilla force and led the Lebanese resistance to defeat the far more advanced israeli occupation of South Lebanon in 2006. As the era of national liberation struggle seemed to come to a close on the global stage, their actions represented the dawn of a new path towards victory and dignity. It is no surprise that the genocidal zionist project would eagerly slaughter countless people in Lebanon — as they have done for decades without justification — in order to extinguish this fire.(1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/636	2024-09-28T10:10:48-07:00

On Thursday we take to the streets not only in protest of Butcher Benjamin Netanyahu, but to confront U.S. imperialism, zionism and all those enabling the ongoing genocide in Gaza and the current bloodbath in Lebanon, which includes the UN itself. Meanwhile the NYPD, whose foot soldiers routinely brutalize and murder Black and Brown New Yorkers with impunity and who just days ago shot multiple people on the subway, are responsible for the -security- of the UN General Assembly. The NYPD, embroiled in federal investigations, resignation and scandal, has said that all pedestrian traffic during the UNGA will be shut down east of 2nd Avenue, showing just how afraid they are of losing control with so many eyes on NYC. Join us and action on Thursday Sept. 26th and show the world that street closures won't stop us. Move like water, split into streams and take action throughout the day using the map above. Then join us for a central rally at 6PM at Pershing Square (42nd St. &amp; Park Ave) where we will flood the streets for Gaza, Palestine, Lebanon, Yemen and all our people resisting around the world.

Some of the top cops overseeing the force and specifically tasked with repressing the movement for Palestine have a record of brutalizing, abusing, and killing New Yorkers in cold blood, including Chief of Patrol John Chell who murdered Ortanzso Bovell in 2008.This latest police mass shooting comes on the heels of a wide-ranging federal investigation against Adams and the NYPD that has already led to the resignations of several Adams affiliates, including NYPD Commissioner Caban and Adam's top lawyer Lisa Zornberg, and today two former City officials were indicted by federal prosecutors. However, we know Adams and the NYPD's true crimes are not merely corruption and campaign finance violations: they stand guilty for the ongoing murders of Black New Yorkers and their unqualified material support to the zionist genocide of Palestinians.Data on NYPD murders for 2022 + 2023 accessible here: https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/neighborhoods#nationwide.

Our liberation struggles are intertwined and as Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims it is our duty to rise up alongside our Black brothers and sisters against NYPD violence which mirrors the zionist occupation in NYC's Black and brown communities. The NYPD has grown increasingly militarized under the Adams administration both in retaliation against popular movements for Black and Palestinian liberation, and in an escalation of Broken Windows-style policing that never left NYC as well as a surge in stop and frisk incidents which have reached their highest frequency in a decade. From drones, bag checks, cops and military personnel occupying every subway station, we are witnessing an witnessing an increasingly violent police state that has been the daily reality of Black people in this country for hundreds of years. We’ve seen more and more police collaboration with the IDF who has been committing a genocide against our people in Palestine for 76 years, killing at least 200,000 Palestinians since October alone.(2/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/590	2024-09-20T06:43:02-07:00

After Easy Aerial executives encouraged Eric Adams to place drones on rooftops in -higher crime areas-, NYPD launched a pilot program called -drones as first responders- in which drones have been stationed on rooftops in Black communities throughout Brooklyn and the Bronx. Crye Precision, which manufacturers camouflage for IOF helmets, vests, and packs, also supplies military equipment to the NYPD, including tactical gear worn by the SWAT teams that raided Hind’s Hall last spring.In the wake of two brutal shootings by IOF-trained NYPD this week and 11 months of genocide by the US-funded IOF, the time is NOW to shut down the the corporations in our communities that enable this violence.

Join the Noise Demo tomorrow Wednesday 9/18 at 8:00 AM and share the call to action widely to SHUT DOWN your local weapons manufacturers in Brooklyn. Military technologies including quadcopter drones and tactical gear are manufactured at Brooklyn Navy Yard and then used by the IOF to murder Palestinians. After being tested in Gaza, these technologies are exported around the world and back into NYC to police Black and brown communities.Easy Aerial, which manufacturers quadcopter drones for the IOF, has also played a key role in lobbying the Eric Adams administration to expand the use of drones for policing in New York.(1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/584	2024-09-17T16:38:57-07:00

Today, September 13th, marks 31 years since the signing of the so-called -Oslo Accords- in 1993 and 31 years of the Palestinian people rejecting Oslo and continuing to resist the illegitimate, genocidal zionist entity by any means necessary. The negotiations, which were brokered by the US, resulted in the PLO recognizing -israel- and denouncing armed struggle. At the time of the signing the late Palestinian intellectual Edward Said declared, -Let us call the agreement by its real name: an instrument of Palestinian surrender.- But surrender the Palestinian masses did not.From the ongoing holocaust in Gaza to the largest invasion and assault on the West Bank since 2002, the Palestinian people continue to resist and resist and resist. From our prisoners to our martyrs, from our freedom fighters to our intellectuals, from Zakaria Zubeidi to Ibrahim Al-Nabulsi, from Khader Adnan to Basil Al-Araj, from Nizar Banat to Abu Shujaa, one generation after the next have declared time and time again: -No surrender!	https://t.me/wolpalestine/576	2024-09-13T20:34:51-07:00
