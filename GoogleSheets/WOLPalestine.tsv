BROOKYLN NAVY YARD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (BNYDC) HOUSES WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS AND IS PROFITING FROM THE OCCUPATION AND GENOCIDE OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE!TEACH-IN + NOISE DEMOWED. 11/20, 10 AM–1PMFLOOD BNYDC to disrupt the meetings of local genocide profiteers this Wednesday morning. The BNYDC is scheduled to hold its Community Relation Committee and Planning Committee meetings from 9:30am to 12:30pm as they continue to be complicit in war crimes against the Palestinian people by housing companies that directly supply lethal technologies and equipment to the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF), enabling the ongoing genocide for over 400 days in Gaza and Lebanon.We have been holding demonstrations and conducting direct outreach to the CEO Lindsey Greene, Board Chair Henry Gutman, Leasing Agent Joseph Colista, and Council Member Lincoln Restler for over two months now with absolutely no response. Instead, they have shamfully deployed their security forces to verbally harrass the community every time we voice our demands. Despite the silence and escalating repression from BNYDC, our movement is only getting stronger with increasing participation of local workers and community members. Enough is enough! We will continue to fight until Crye Precision and Easy Aerial are expelled from the Brooklyn Navy Yard! And we will continue to resist until all war criminals are out of Brooklyn!We also urge all tenants and workers to take autonomous actions at BNYDC and to heed the call for Global Escalation from November 27-29 by joining our campaign to disrupt, strike, and boycott all genocide profiteers during one of the corporation’s most profitable times of the year.---------------OUR DEMANDS: 1.) EVICT EASY AERIAL, CRYE PRECISION, AND ALL OTHER BNYDC TENANTS FOUND TO BE MATERIALLY SUPPORTING GENOCIDE! 2.) PROHIBIT ALL BNYDC TENANTS FROM ENGAGING IN ANY MILITARY-RELATED RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES! 3.) DISCLOSE ALL BNYDC INVESTMENTS AND DIVEST FROM GENOCIDE!__Linktree: linktr.ee/demilitarizebrooklynnavyyardInstagram: @demilitarizebklynnavyyardEmail: demilitarizebrooklynnavyyard@proton.me	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/749	2024-11-19T11:23:27-08:00

Documentation of our third Noise Demo on November 4th when we disrupted BNYDC’s business-as-usual operations at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. We continue to pressure BNYDC to terminate their leases with weapons manufacturers and war profiteers Crye Precision and Easy Aerial. Despite BNYDC cowering behind their hostile building security, we remain steadfast in our demands: 1) Evict Easy Aerial, Crye Precision and all other tenants profiting off the genocide in Gaza; 2) Prohibit all BNYDC tenants from engaging in any military-related research, development and manufacturing activities; 3) Disclose all BNYDC investments and fully divest from genocide.	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/735	2024-11-19T11:23:09-08:00

Day 408 — At least 96 Palestinians have been martyred since dawn today in multiple massacres across Gaza, including 72 killed in a single air strike on a residential building in Beit Lahia. Dozens more are missing and injured as the zionist entity continues its extermination campaign in the northern Gaza Strip with the full backing of the Biden-Harris administration in their final days in office. Reports out of Jabalia have also exposed that the IOF is using robots and explosive barrels to blow up homes. While the world moves on and the mainstream media in the U.S. is now fixated on Trump, these daily massacres are a reminder that the true number of casualties in the ongoing genocide is beyond what we think. Until the siege on the north has been broken, until all of Gaza has been liberated, and until every inch of Palestine is free, our people will continue to resist by any means necessary.	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/734	2024-11-17T10:37:36-08:00

However, the American government has historically stood as an obstacle preventing his release for decades. This obstacle remains as the National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office expressed plans to appeal this decision, so now more than ever before is a critical stage in the campaign for his freedom. His liberation would mark a powerful turning point in the struggle of political prisoners worldwide and would bring hope to the thousands of revolutionary political prisoners awaiting their release. From Georges Abdallah and the Holy Land Five to Leonard Peltier, Mumia Abu-Jamal and the Gilboa 6, the struggle to liberate all political prisoners must continue until they are all free from the shackles of colonialism as their freedom will inevitably lead to the complete liberation of Palestine, within our lifetime.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/733	2024-11-15T16:12:55-08:00

Freedom For Georges Abdallah! — Today a French court ordered the release of Georges Abdallah, the Lebanese freedom fighter, revolutionary and Europe's longest held political prisoner after 40 years in prison. Despite being wounded while defending Lebanon during the israeli invasion in 1978, Georges continued fighting for Palestine and Lebanon by any means necessary. As the genocide in Gaza and the aggression against Lebanon continues, Georges's fight for freedom is an urgent reminder that our people have not stopped resisting the illegitimate zionist entity from generation to generation. Despite being held inside the colonial prison cells since 1984, Georges remains a symbol of steadfastness and resistance, inspiring people of conscience around the world.

Within Our Lifetime took to the streets on Election Day and called on the entire community to STAND UP under whichever presidency comes next.There is no meaningful different between democrats and republicans, and we will keep fighting for liberation no matter which one of them is in power.We will continue organizing against every president that sits at the head of the US empire as they commit a genocide against our people, Trump is no exception. We will continue to hold accountable anyone who is complicit in the genocide in Gaza — including all those cracking down on the movement for Palestine and oppressing Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities across the globe 🇵🇸	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/731	2024-11-14T17:25:29-08:00

Tonight’s event — billed as the -2024 Theodor Herzl Award Dinner- — is a tribute to former U.S. ambassador Jon Huntsman, a devout Mormon who is also a genocidal Zionist, and will also honor Tal Huber, the -graphic designer- behind last year’s KIDNAPPED posters. This is not the first time the museum has lent its space, its tacit support, and its veneer of prestige to individuals and groups that fuel Zionist terror in Palestine. MoMa’s board of trustees includes Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, an asset management firm with massive investments in companies that supply the Israeli army with equipment; Daniel S. Och, a current member and former chairman of the Birthright Foundation, an organization that sends Jewish youth on free trips to -Israel- to support their indoctrination into Zionism; and Paula Crown, who has stakes in the weapons conglomerate General Dynamics, manufacturer of the MK-84 bombs that the IOF has dropped on Gaza for years.In 2021, @strikemoma laid out the case against the museum: -MoMA was founded with the oil wealth of the Rockefellers. Since then it has been a clearing house for capital, a showcase for domination and an ecocidal machine. It has diversified in content, but in practice has been an enemy of the poor and the marginalized, the fired and the furloughed, the displaced and dispossessed, the detained and the deported, the dying and the dead.-MoMA’s affiliations show that the museum is more closely aligned with billionaire warmongers than with working artists in New York City. Down with blood money in the arts! Down with Zionism in our institutions! Free Palestine.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/729	2024-11-12T10:36:26-08:00

New York City’s most prominent art institution is allowing genocidaire Ronald S. Lauder to host his Zionist organization’s annual assembly this evening. A MoMA trustee since 1977, Lauder was the president of the settler-colonial -non-profit- known as the Jewish National Fund from 1997 to 2007, and has since served as Chairman and Chairman Emeritus of its board; he became the president of the rabidly pro-Israel World Jewish Congress in 2007. Because of his extensive political and financial support for Zionist occupation, Lauder's company, Estee Lauder Cosmetics, is a longstanding BDS target. In his speech at last year’s assembly, Lauder said, -The vast majority of Americans support Israel and stand with the Jewish people,- before quoting former president George W. Bush, whose invasion of Iraq killed over a million Arabs, as saying, -There’s only one villain in this conflict, and it's not Israel.- (1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/726	2024-11-12T10:36:24-08:00

For 400 days, Gaza has been on fire, and this fire has not yet been extinguished as the occupation forces continue to bomb every area of the Gaza Strip, resulting in the displacement, hunger, and martyrdom of thousands and thousands of Palestinians. Those who are wounded are left to suffer as oxygen tanks and other medical equipment are no longer functioning in the hospitals of Gaza, making it more difficult to treat patients.Yet despite all of this beign documented day in and day out for the whole world to see, the zionist entity continues its campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide with impunity. Today in the northern Gaza Strip, occupation forces have yet again committed another massacre after bombing a family home in Jabalia Camp, resulting in over 36 martyrs as seen in this photograph taken today.This massacre was carried out by the zionist entity with US funding and weapons. Let this serve as a reminder that the United States has blood on its hands and that blood will not wash away with a new president in office.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/723	2024-11-10T17:32:38-08:00

Yesterday November 9th 2024 marked 400 days of the ongoing genocide in Gaza and 400 days and 76 years of Palestinian resistance to zionist settler colonialism. In recent days, as fires have raged from New Jersey to Prospect Park, NYC has experienced the worst air quality the city has seen in months, with the city issuing warnings of serious health effects. For New Yorkers who have turned a blind eye to the horrors of the genocide in Gaza, this is not even a taste of what Palestinians in Gaza have been experiencing for over 400 days.One can only imagine what Gaza is going through with constant fires erupting due to the repeated bombings and massacres committed by the zionist entity. This past year we have seen the zionist entity burn down tents, homes, and hospitals, leading to our martyrs being burned alive while the world watches.

WOL Chair Nerdeen Kiswani joined the Let’s Talk Palestine Podcast last week to discuss the presidential election. Let it be known that both Harris and Trump intend to continue the genocide in Gaza while continuing to crack down on the movement for Palestine and all peoples' struggles within the belly of the beast. The difference between the two is that Trump remains open and honest about these intentions while the Democratic Party and Harris obscure the truth behind liberal language. Democrats like Harris lie in an attempt to co-opt our movements, using slogans that imply respect for Palestinian life while murdering them and condemning our people's resistance.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/708	2024-11-02T08:16:51-07:00
