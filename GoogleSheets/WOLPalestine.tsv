Yahya Sinwar was a key figure who united the fields against zionism, to the people of Yemen, he said: -I also extend my salute to the great Yemeni people, who have always stood by our Palestinian people and their just cause throughout history- and in regards to Lebanon and Iraq he said, -The unification of our efforts with you and our brothers in the valiant resistance in Lebanon and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq will break this enemy and bring about its defeat, paving the way for its expulsion from our land.-His legacy will live on in the hearts of every revolutionary. Thousands will rise after him to continue the path towards liberation. The martyrdom of our resistance leaders will not weaken the resolve of the masses, as history has shown that while martyrs leave this world, their ideas remain immortal guiding those after them. These enduring ideas, deeply rooted in the people of Palestine, will drive the struggle forward until the zionist entity is dismantled, in a free Palestine, within our lifetime.(3/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/693	2024-10-17T21:41:54-07:00

Now as the Al-Aqsa Flood battle sparked on October 7, Yahya Sinwar fought to keep his promise to liberate the thousands of Palestinian prisoners who remain in the occupation's dungeons.&nbsp;We remember and honor Yahya Sinwar as a fierce leader who did not waver, but advanced the struggle until his very last breath. In the 2021 war on Gaza, the occupation forces bombed his home in an attempted assassination attempt, but with pride, he returned home, sat on his furniture, and took a picture of himself humiliating the zionist entity.&nbsp;(2/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/692	2024-10-17T21:41:45-07:00

Yahya Sinwar, also known as -Abu Ibrahim-, the leader of the Palestinian resistance movement, and the commander fighting alongside his people in Gaza has ascended to martyrdom. Yahya Sinwar was martyred in the heart of Gaza, amongst his people leading them to the front lines. He did not cower away, but instead, he fought, led, and inspired thousands of revolutionaries to stand against genocide, in defense of the honorable Palestinian people.&nbsp;Yahya Ibrahim Hassan Sinwar ascended to martyrdom on the 17th of October, and he was born on the 19th of October in the Khan Younis Refugee Camp as his family was displaced from the city of Majdal Asqalan in 1948 during the ongoing Nakba. It was on the 18th of October, 2011 that Yahya Sinwar was released in the -Wafa al-Ahrar- prisoner exchange deal that liberated 1,027 prisoners held in the occupation's dungeons.

She was also mother of 3, married, a great friend, and someone who deeply believed in freedom for her people.&nbsp; We pay tribute to Wafa, we hold her and her martyred family, as we honor all the martyrs of Palestine.&nbsp; We invite the community to keep this memorial site going, and to confront AOC and all so-called progressive politicians who act as agents of empire.UPDATE: The memorial, which contained mourning art and photos of martyred children contributed by community members AOC represents, was taken down first thing this morning and shoved in the trash by AOC's staff. AOC's office has chosen to erase the memory of Palestinians. She continues to prioritize the imperial interests of Israeli apartheid over the basic Palestinian right to life.(5/5)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/689	2024-10-17T11:06:08-07:00

We condemn empire, which uses any made up justification at all to drop apartment blocks on people’s heads to further imperial expansion.-'Israel' made the desert bloom.- Kamala Harris, who AOC campaigns for, recently repeated this racist zionist adage.&nbsp; A client told a Native comrade the week of indigenous people’s day: -it was impossible to grow watermelons before -Israel- because it was a desert.-&nbsp; Zionists really think that there was no agriculture done by indigenous peoples of the entire levant, in the famed -fertile crescent- before they began their campaign to colonize Palestine.&nbsp; This, while teenagers and children in Gaza are using shards of plastic and wire to construct tiny greenhouses for their seedlings, so that the people around them may have a bite of freshness to keep their spirits strong amidst US-backed forced famine and genocide.(4/5)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/688	2024-10-17T11:05:53-07:00

AOC ran point on spreading the propaganda that led to this genocide, including signing House Res 966 -condemning rape and sexual violence by Hamas- on October 7th. &nbsp;That was debunked, but has been weaponized to justify mass lynching of Palestinians ever since.-Hamas is a terrorist organization- Ocasio-Cortez said, as she signed resolution 888 declaring -Israel- a jewish ethnosupremacist homeland. -Hamas are terrorists,- she repeated over and over as she maligned NYC-based Palestinian, Arab and Muslim organizing, where they are targeted/beaten/doxxed/surveilled/threatened with murder—for refusing to condemn resistance to colonization by any means necessary. Harris and Biden -are working tirelessly for a ceasefire- she said as they send more than 8.7 billion in September 2024, rounding out an unprecedented year of money to -Israel- in full military support of its genocide (17.9 billion). &nbsp;(3/5)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/687	2024-10-17T11:05:38-07:00

We also redecorated surrounding areas to share the kind of treachery the politician has been involved in.(2/5)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/685	2024-10-17T11:05:20-07:00

Last night, activists took action to protest AOC at her Astoria office by holding a vigil for the martyrs of Palestine after over a year of lies about supporting a ceasefire as she continues to co-opt progressive politics to run cover for Biden, Harris, and the Democratic Party's genocide in Gaza. The memorial featured Shaban Al-Dalou, the young Palestinian who was filmed burning to death after the occupation bombed refugee tents next to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. AOC has shamelessly already torn down the memorial this morning, hoping to hide the blood on her hands as she desecrates any attempt to honor the over 300k Palestinians murdered with our taxes. We call on all New Yorkers in solidarity with Palestine to continue taking creative action to confront all those complicit and responsible for the annihilation of our people.

After witnessing all of the hospital bombings israel has conducted in the past year, it is easy to forget how the US media worked so diligently to make us believe that they would never do such a thing after the occupation forces bombed Al-Ahli hospital nearly one year ago today on October 17, 2023. We in the US bear responsibility for this genocide as our government and mainstream institutions have been funding and manufacturing consent for the annihilation of our people. Those of us in the belly of the beast, who continue to fund these atrocities with our tax dollars, must not normalize this violence. The time to act is now.

As the zionist entity grows increasingly desperate to delay its inevitable collapse, it has escalated the genocidal aggression against the people of Gaza beyond comprehension. Hours ago the occupation forces bombed Palestinians seeking refuge around Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza, burning them alive in the tents where they were sleeping. This attack followed a successful operation by the resistance in neutralizing military forces. Attacking critical health infrastructure has been a consistent part of the occupation’s strategy to destroy life in Gaza and carry out this genocide.(1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/677	2024-10-13T19:51:02-07:00

This continued siege comes as part of the enemy's plan to displace Palestinians in Jabalia camp. As green-lighted by the United States, the occupation’s primary partner I n facilitating this ongoing genocide, it is clear that this is a coordinated plan to starve, displace, and massacre as many Palestinians in Jabalia as possible.For the past year, the zionist entity has aimed to destabilize the resistance in Jabalia, after failing to defeat the resistance in northern Gaza, particularly in the camp. The IOF have again resorted to cowardly tactics through horrific airstrikes targeting schools, hospitals, and residential areas. Over the past nine days alone, at least 300 Palestinians have been martyred during the ongoing siege of Jabalia. Yet even in the face of this unthinkable violence, our people declare: -Long live the camp, and long live the invincible spirit of Jabalia.-	https://t.me/wolpalestine/675	2024-10-13T17:50:50-07:00
