We see growing parallels in the U.S., where anti-Palestinian sentiment is reflected in social media platforms and Western media outlets that silence Gazans, pro-Palestinian activists, and organizations critical of the israeli regime. Tactics such as shadow banning, outright censorship, and the spread of debunked israeli propaganda are employed to suppress Palestinians. Additionally, law enforcement have used physical force to intimidate and obstruct our First Amendment right to protest against U.S. involvement in the genocide in Gaza.📸: @oshimages on Instagram(3/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/536	2024-08-18T08:30:21-07:00

For over ten months, Gaza has endured relentless bombardment by israel and the U.S., resulting in the deaths of at least 186,000 Palestinians and widespread devastation. Reports from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization, and the Palestinian government reveal that Israel has severely damaged more than half of Gaza’s homes, 85% of its schools, all hospitals, 65% of its road networks, and 65% of its cropland. At least 500 healthcare workers and 165 journalists have been killed in this U.S.- and israeli-led genocide, aimed both at preventing healthcare to Gazans and intimidating survivors into silence.(2/3)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/534	2024-08-18T08:29:50-07:00
