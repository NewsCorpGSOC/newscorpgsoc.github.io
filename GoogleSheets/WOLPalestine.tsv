Today we also join the global call for freedom for Native American political prisoner and elder Leonard Peltier, now 80 years old, who has been unjustly imprisoned since 1976 and is currently serving a life sentence. Leonard’s health has seriously declined in recent years and he was just released from hospitalization in late October, just months after he was denied parole most recently in July 2024.Like Mumia Abu-Jamal, the Holy Land Foundation 5 and so many of our political prisoners, Leonard is faced with the reality that if he is not freed, he will die in prison. As Leonard wrote in 1999 in his collection of Prison Writings, -When the oppressors succeed with their illegal thefts and depredations, it's called colonialism. When their efforts to colonize indigenous peoples are met with resistance or anything but abject surrender, it's called war. When the colonized peoples attempt to resist their oppression and defend themselves, we're called criminals.-Leonard’s ongoing struggle for freedom is an urgent reminder that the struggle of Indigenous people across Turtle Island, the struggle of political prisoners worldwide and the struggle for Palestine is all part of the same fight. Free Leonard Peltier! Free Mumia! Free The HLF5! Free Them All!(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/753	2024-11-28T16:54:52-08:00

Today while many sit down to eat in abundance on -Thanksgiving,- Gaza is starving and Palestinians are lining up by the thousands to obtain a single loaf of bread to feed their families. As many join with family and loved ones, we join with the Indigenous people of Turtle Island in declaring: NO THANKSGIVING ON STOLEN LAND! What is for some a day of celebration is for Native Americans a National Day of Mourning. It is with this in mind that we reiterate that if not for the genocide of Indigenous and African people and the theft of the land we now stand on, there would be no U.S. empire. And if there was no U.S. empire, there would no zionist entity currently occupying Palestine. Without the U.S. lifeline, the occupation would not last a day, and could not carry on the genocide in Gaza. (1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/752	2024-11-28T16:54:29-08:00

Sixteen years ago today on November 24th 2008 the Holy Land Foundation 5 were wrongfully convicted in the U.S. for the crime of raising money to provide food, health care and education for orphans in Palestine. Today, three of the HLF5 remain unjustly imprisoned: Shukri Abu Bakr, Ghassan Elashi and Mufid Abdulqader. Shukri and Ghassan are both serving 65 year sentences. WOL joins their families, loved ones and people of conscience around the world in demanding freedom for the HLF5 and ALL political prisoners from the U.S. to Palestine. Free Shukri Abu Bakr, Ghassan Elashi &amp; Mufid Abdulqader! Free the HLF5! Free all political prisoners! 🇵🇸	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/751	2024-11-24T14:33:38-08:00

BROOKYLN NAVY YARD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (BNYDC) HOUSES WEAPONS...	BROOKYLN NAVY YARD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (BNYDC) HOUSES WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS AND IS PROFITING FROM THE OCCUPATION AND GENOCIDE OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE!TEACH-IN + NOISE DEMOWED. 11/20, 10 AM–1PMFLOOD BNYDC to disrupt the meetings of local genocide profiteers this Wednesday morning. The BNYDC is scheduled to hold its Community Relation Committee and Planning Committee meetings from 9:30am to 12:30pm as they continue to be complicit in war crimes against the Palestinian people by housing companies that directly supply lethal technologies and equipment to the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF), enabling the ongoing genocide for over 400 days in Gaza and Lebanon.We have been holding demonstrations and conducting direct outreach to the CEO Lindsey Greene, Board Chair Henry Gutman, Leasing Agent Joseph Colista, and Council Member Lincoln Restler for over two months now with absolutely no response. Instead, they have shamfully deployed their security forces to verbally harrass the community every time we voice our demands. Despite the silence and escalating repression from BNYDC, our movement is only getting stronger with increasing participation of local workers and community members. Enough is enough! We will continue to fight until Crye Precision and Easy Aerial are expelled from the Brooklyn Navy Yard! And we will continue to resist until all war criminals are out of Brooklyn!We also urge all tenants and workers to take autonomous actions at BNYDC and to heed the call for Global Escalation from November 27-29 by joining our campaign to disrupt, strike, and boycott all genocide profiteers during one of the corporation’s most profitable times of the year.---------------OUR DEMANDS: 1.) EVICT EASY AERIAL, CRYE PRECISION, AND ALL OTHER BNYDC TENANTS FOUND TO BE MATERIALLY SUPPORTING GENOCIDE! 2.) PROHIBIT ALL BNYDC TENANTS FROM ENGAGING IN ANY MILITARY-RELATED RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES! 3.) DISCLOSE ALL BNYDC INVESTMENTS AND DIVEST FROM GENOCIDE!__Linktree: linktr.ee/demilitarizebrooklynnavyyardInstagram: @demilitarizebklynnavyyardEmail: demilitarizebrooklynnavyyard@proton.me	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/749	2024-11-19T11:23:27-08:00

Documentation of our third Noise Demo on November 4th when we disrupted BNYDC’s business-as-usual operations at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. We continue to pressure BNYDC to terminate their leases with weapons manufacturers and war profiteers Crye Precision and Easy Aerial. Despite BNYDC cowering behind their hostile building security, we remain steadfast in our demands: 1) Evict Easy Aerial, Crye Precision and all other tenants profiting off the genocide in Gaza; 2) Prohibit all BNYDC tenants from engaging in any military-related research, development and manufacturing activities; 3) Disclose all BNYDC investments and fully divest from genocide.	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/735	2024-11-19T11:23:09-08:00	
Day 408 — At least 96 Palestinians have been martyred since dawn ...	Day 408 — At least 96 Palestinians have been martyred since dawn today in multiple massacres across Gaza, including 72 killed in a single air strike on a residential building in Beit Lahia. Dozens more are missing and injured as the zionist entity continues its extermination campaign in the northern Gaza Strip with the full backing of the Biden-Harris administration in their final days in office. Reports out of Jabalia have also exposed that the IOF is using robots and explosive barrels to blow up homes. While the world moves on and the mainstream media in the U.S. is now fixated on Trump, these daily massacres are a reminder that the true number of casualties in the ongoing genocide is beyond what we think. Until the siege on the north has been broken, until all of Gaza has been liberated, and until every inch of Palestine is free, our people will continue to resist by any means necessary.	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/734	2024-11-17T10:37:36-08:00

However, the American government has historically stood as an obstacle preventing his release for decades. This obstacle remains as the National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office expressed plans to appeal this decision, so now more than ever before is a critical stage in the campaign for his freedom. His liberation would mark a powerful turning point in the struggle of political prisoners worldwide and would bring hope to the thousands of revolutionary political prisoners awaiting their release. From Georges Abdallah and the Holy Land Five to Leonard Peltier, Mumia Abu-Jamal and the Gilboa 6, the struggle to liberate all political prisoners must continue until they are all free from the shackles of colonialism as their freedom will inevitably lead to the complete liberation of Palestine, within our lifetime.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/733	2024-11-15T16:12:55-08:00

Freedom For Georges Abdallah! — Today a French court ordered the release of Georges Abdallah, the Lebanese freedom fighter, revolutionary and Europe's longest held political prisoner after 40 years in prison. Despite being wounded while defending Lebanon during the israeli invasion in 1978, Georges continued fighting for Palestine and Lebanon by any means necessary. As the genocide in Gaza and the aggression against Lebanon continues, Georges's fight for freedom is an urgent reminder that our people have not stopped resisting the illegitimate zionist entity from generation to generation. Despite being held inside the colonial prison cells since 1984, Georges remains a symbol of steadfastness and resistance, inspiring people of conscience around the world.

We will continue to hold accountable anyone who is complicit in the genocide in Gaza — including all those cracking down on the movement for Palestine and oppressing Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities across the globe 🇵🇸	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/731	2024-11-14T17:25:29-08:00
