Tonight’s event — billed as the -2024 Theodor Herzl Award Dinner- — is a tribute to former U.S. ambassador Jon Huntsman, a devout Mormon who is also a genocidal Zionist, and will also honor Tal Huber, the -graphic designer- behind last year’s KIDNAPPED posters. This is not the first time the museum has lent its space, its tacit support, and its veneer of prestige to individuals and groups that fuel Zionist terror in Palestine. MoMa’s board of trustees includes Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, an asset management firm with massive investments in companies that supply the Israeli army with equipment; Daniel S. Och, a current member and former chairman of the Birthright Foundation, an organization that sends Jewish youth on free trips to -Israel- to support their indoctrination into Zionism; and Paula Crown, who has stakes in the weapons conglomerate General Dynamics, manufacturer of the MK-84 bombs that the IOF has dropped on Gaza for years.In 2021, @strikemoma laid out the case against the museum: -MoMA was founded with the oil wealth of the Rockefellers. Since then it has been a clearing house for capital, a showcase for domination and an ecocidal machine. It has diversified in content, but in practice has been an enemy of the poor and the marginalized, the fired and the furloughed, the displaced and dispossessed, the detained and the deported, the dying and the dead.-MoMA’s affiliations show that the museum is more closely aligned with billionaire warmongers than with working artists in New York City. Down with blood money in the arts! Down with Zionism in our institutions! Free Palestine.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/729	2024-11-12T10:36:26-08:00

New York City’s most prominent art institution is allowing genocidaire Ronald S. Lauder to host his Zionist organization’s annual assembly this evening. A MoMA trustee since 1977, Lauder was the president of the settler-colonial -non-profit- known as the Jewish National Fund from 1997 to 2007, and has since served as Chairman and Chairman Emeritus of its board; he became the president of the rabidly pro-Israel World Jewish Congress in 2007. Because of his extensive political and financial support for Zionist occupation, Lauder's company, Estee Lauder Cosmetics, is a longstanding BDS target. In his speech at last year’s assembly, Lauder said, -The vast majority of Americans support Israel and stand with the Jewish people,- before quoting former president George W. Bush, whose invasion of Iraq killed over a million Arabs, as saying, -There’s only one villain in this conflict, and it's not Israel.- (1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/726	2024-11-12T10:36:24-08:00

Nerdeen Kiswani speaks on our community’s need for bravery and courage in a time where our tuition and tax dollars are funding genocide and the further colonization of Palestine, amidst constant state and university-sanctioned repression. -You can’t claim to be an ally while you’re killing us- -Nerdeen Kiswani on the Let’s Talk Palestine PodcastStudents must be UNRELENTING in the fight for divestment.

For 400 days, Gaza has been on fire, and this fire has not yet been extinguished as the occupation forces continue to bomb every area of the Gaza Strip, resulting in the displacement, hunger, and martyrdom of thousands and thousands of Palestinians. Those who are wounded are left to suffer as oxygen tanks and other medical equipment are no longer functioning in the hospitals of Gaza, making it more difficult to treat patients.Yet despite all of this beign documented day in and day out for the whole world to see, the zionist entity continues its campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide with impunity. Today in the northern Gaza Strip, occupation forces have yet again committed another massacre after bombing a family home in Jabalia Camp, resulting in over 36 martyrs as seen in this photograph taken today.This massacre was carried out by the zionist entity with US funding and weapons. Let this serve as a reminder that the United States has blood on its hands and that blood will not wash away with a new president in office.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/723	2024-11-10T17:32:38-08:00

Yesterday November 9th 2024 marked 400 days of the ongoing genocide in Gaza and 400 days and 76 years of Palestinian resistance to zionist settler colonialism. In recent days, as fires have raged from New Jersey to Prospect Park, NYC has experienced the worst air quality the city has seen in months, with the city issuing warnings of serious health effects. For New Yorkers who have turned a blind eye to the horrors of the genocide in Gaza, this is not even a taste of what Palestinians in Gaza have been experiencing for over 400 days.One can only imagine what Gaza is going through with constant fires erupting due to the repeated bombings and massacres committed by the zionist entity. This past year we have seen the zionist entity burn down tents, homes, and hospitals, leading to our martyrs being burned alive while the world watches.

For over a century, every U.S. President has supported the zionist project, not only in enabling the colonization of Palestine but also in facilitating its ethnic cleansing. As we mark the 107th anniversary of the Balfour Declaration last week, we are reminded that the United States played a key role in bringing this illegitimate declaration to fruition.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/713	2024-11-04T09:46:25-08:00

WOL Chair Nerdeen Kiswani joined the Let’s Talk Palestine Podcast last week to discuss the presidential election. Let it be known that both Harris and Trump intend to continue the genocide in Gaza while continuing to crack down on the movement for Palestine and all peoples' struggles within the belly of the beast. The difference between the two is that Trump remains open and honest about these intentions while the Democratic Party and Harris obscure the truth behind liberal language. Democrats like Harris lie in an attempt to co-opt our movements, using slogans that imply respect for Palestinian life while murdering them and condemning our people's resistance.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/708	2024-11-02T08:16:51-07:00

The crackdown on our constitutionally protected speech is a worrisome development at any moment in time but in particular right now as social movements confront the US-backed Israeli genocide in Gaza, the Israeli war on Lebanon, and the general global trend toward fascism.Palestinian prisoners are at the heart of the broader struggle for Palestinian national liberation.

Thousands will rise after him to continue the path towards liberation. The martyrdom of our resistance leaders will not weaken the resolve of the masses, as history has shown that while martyrs leave this world, their ideas remain immortal guiding those after them.
