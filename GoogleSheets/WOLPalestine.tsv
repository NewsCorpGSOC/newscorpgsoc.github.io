They are just waiting for you to look away before cracking down on our movement and continuing the genocide in Palestine.	https://t.me/wolpalestine/531	2024-08-14T20:50:50-07:00

Palestinians living in the refugee camp were forced to become displaced once again due to the aggression by the zionist-allied Phalangist forces. However, the Palestinians refused to accept humiliation, they refused to accept massacres and displacement, and they resisted until their very last breath as they were always determined to one day return to their homeland. This steadfastness continues on today in Gaza, the West Bank, and all of Palestine as the Palestinian masses and its resistance are defending their homeland against the zionist entity knowing that they will one day liberate Palestine within our lifetime.Find all of these posters and more at the Palestine Poster Project: palestineposterproject.org(2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/528	2024-08-12T20:03:42-07:00

Today, August 12, we join Palestinians across the world, to commemorate the anniversary of the tragic Tal Al-Zaatar Massacre. 48 years ago in January 1976, the Lebanese Phalangist militia, in coordination with the zionist entity, began a series of attacks on Palestinians living in refugee camps across Lebanon. It has been estimated that over 3,000 Palestinians were martyred during the siege of the Tal Al-Zaatar Refugee Camp. (1/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/525	2024-08-12T20:03:29-07:00

We are reminded that it is his VP, Killer Kamala, who is running to be the next top cop responsible for the annihilation of our people. As israeli society debates the merits of raping Palestinian prisoners, an endemic horror to this fascist settler colony, US -progressives- debate the merits of voting for someone who has not made any commitment to ending US funding for these atrocities.The movement to Free Palestine will not support any candidate of the party of genocide, and we will continue flooding the campaign events of Killer Kamala and the streets of New York City until liberation 🇵🇸🔻(2/2)	https://t.me/wolpalestine/523	2024-08-11T17:23:34-07:00
