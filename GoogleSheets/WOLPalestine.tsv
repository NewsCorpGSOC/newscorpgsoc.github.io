Israeli forces have kidnapped 240 medical personnel from Kamal Adwan Hospital, among them Dr. Hussam, whose fate remains unknown. These abductions mirror the plight of 10,000 other Palestinians forcibly disappeared from Gaza.Northern Gaza now stands without any functioning hospitals, plunging Gaza into an even deeper stage of genocide and catastrophe.#GazaUnderAttack #KamalAdwanHospital(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/789	2024-12-28T14:24:12-08:00

As the last functioning hospital in Northern Gaza, its violent raid and burning by Israeli Occupation Forces left patients and staff displaced, with hundreds of individuals unaccounted for, including hospital director Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya.New testimonies have shed light on the brutal treatment endured by Dr. Hussam. According to the Ministry of Health’s Director General, Dr. Muneer Alboursh, survivors have reported that Dr. Hussam, after believing he had reached safety, was forced to strip by an Israeli officer and was subsequently beaten by multiple soldiers.Survivors interviewed today by @EuroMedHR also revealed that Israeli forces carried out summary executions during the assault, including of individuals carrying white flags—an egregious violation of international law.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/788	2024-12-28T14:24:03-08:00

Kamal Adwan Hospital’s departments, including surgery, laboratories, ambulances, and maintenance units, have been completely burned, leaving Northern Gaza with no functioning hospital amidst an ongoing humanitarian crisis.

On December 27, Israeli Occupation Forces forcibly raided and set fire to Kamal Adwan Hospital, the last remaining functioning hospital in Northern Gaza. Patients and medical staff were evacuated under threat of weapons, with reports of men being stripped, beaten, and searched, while women were searched and forced to remove their hijabs.The evacuated patients, some critically ill, were made to walk over a mile under the escort of a tank to the Indonesian Hospital, which itself is severely damaged, lacking basic medical supplies, water, and electricity. The fate of over 300 individuals remains unknown, including Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the hospital’s head, and journalist Mohammad Al-Sharif, who were detained during the assault.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/786	2024-12-27T19:32:46-08:00

Whether they have shot down zionist ships or U.S. aircrafts, Yemen has embodied what it means to stand in solidarity with Palestine and we commend them for their courage efforts to take down the Zionist entity.‎We applaud those that showcase what it means to stand with Palestine. Yemen has been one of the only brave nations to demonstrate what it means to defend Palestine. ‎The people of Yemen are willing to sacrifice it all for Palestine. When a bomb drops in Yemen they find gratitude for the fact that it wasn’t dropped in Gaza. They embody what it means when we chant, -بالروح بالدم نفديك يا فلسطين-(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/784	2024-12-27T07:34:40-08:00

Yemen’s firm stance against the zionist entity and the imperialist order enabling the genocide in Gaza has demonstrated to the world what unrelenting solidarity with the Palestine people means.‎This week Yemen strikes back to defend against U.S. missile strikes on their country and the ongoing genocide in Gaza by launching rockets into the colonial settlement of Tel Aviv and occupied Palestine time and time again. The Yemeni resistance says its attacks are in solidarity with Palestinian people in Gaza, where the zionist entity has been waging a genocide for over a year.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/783	2024-12-27T07:34:33-08:00

Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church Atallah Hanna has previously called on -the churches of the world, in the east and west, to urgently defend Palestine, the children of Palestine and the Palestinian cause. Let our message this Christmas be to free Palestine and the Palestinian people.- Nerdeen Kiswani, chair of Within Our Lifetime, read the Archbishop’s words aloud during a rally to Flood the Rockefeller Tree Lighting for Gaza in New York City in 2023. We follow the example from Gaza to Bethlehem, to Jerusalem and beyond in calling for solidarity with Gaza’s Christian community and all Palestinians facing annihilation. There can be no Christmas without Gaza, and we can only celebrate by standing against injustice, with the Palestinian people in support of total liberation from the occupation.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/782	2024-12-25T17:29:59-08:00

Christian leaders in Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, have cancelled Christmas celebrations for the 2nd year in a row in recognition of the ongoing genocide in Gaza that has claimed the lives of over 200,000 Palestinians and in solidarity with the threat of total extinction facing Gaza’s Christian community. The zionist entity has repeatedly targeted Gaza’s Christian community, the world’s oldest. In October 2023 the zionist entity bombed the Church of Saint Porphyrius in a brutal attack that claimed the lives of 18 Christian Palestinians, who harbored in the Church in hopes of safety. Church-affiliated hospitals, heritage sites, and more have been devastated. In response to this existential threat, Father Antonios Hananya of the Holy Orthodox Church of Jerusalem urged in an address this year: -If a Priest must fight, just as a Muslim Sheikh defends women and children, I will go and fight myself.-(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/781	2024-12-25T17:29:39-08:00

Today would have marked the 55th birthday of Khaled Nabhan and the 5th birthday of his beloved granddaughter, Reem Ali Badwan.Reem, known as -the soul of his soul,- was tragically martyred at just two and a half years old in Gaza during the relentless Israeli airstrikes in November 2023.Thirteen months later, only eight days before his birthday, Khaled Nabhan was also martyred by the same zionist forces that took Reem’s life.Reem, born on her grandfather’s birthday, brought joy to Khaled’s life. From the moment she was born, she embodied everything beautiful to him. He embraced her tightly and told her mother at the time, -Reem is mine, and I am hers… I would carefully choose her clothes and toys and provide for all her needs.-	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/780	2024-12-23T09:16:51-08:00

Rather than confronting the foreign occupation forces, they focus on suppressing resistance from Jenin Camp to the Gaza Strip, while the so-called -outlaws- of Jenin Camp remain steadfast in their commitment to the liberation of Palestine.The ongoing siege of Jenin Camp is being carried out under the -Fenzel Plan-, a security strategy developed by Michael Fenzel, the U.S. Security Coordinator between -israel- and the -Palestinian- Authority. Fenzel’s plan seeks to suppress resistance in the region to pave the way for peace deals, normalization, and coordination with the occupation. However, this plan is bound to fail, much like the Oslo Accords, as the people of Palestine have consistently rejected plans of normalization while supporting resistance. This is the reality not only in Jenin Camp but across the entire West Bank, where the idea of capitulation has been rejected, and the principled idea of resistance continues to be embraced by the masses. Local sources have reported that Fenzel met with the PA security forces before the operation in Jenin. It is also no surprise that this campaign is being carried out after the IOF has repeatedly failed to defeat the resistance in Jenin Camp. As a result of the PA's ongoing siege, Rebhi Shalabi, Yazid Ja'ayseh, and the child Mohammed Al-Amer ascended to martyrdom. As the siege continues, families are deprived of water and electricity. Children are being denied access to education, and journalists are being silenced to prevent them from reporting on the situation.The people of Jenin Camp remain steadfast, confident in the resistance that will pave the path to victory. Despite being pursued by PA forces and the IOF, they are supported by the mothers of martyrs and the children of Jenin Camp, who envision a future where their homeland is fully liberated from all forms of occupation, including the traitorous -Palestinian- Authority.(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/779	2024-12-22T16:43:45-08:00

Jenin is not just the cradle of resistance but it is also the cradle of loyalty to the people of Palestine. Since October 7, Jenin has been targeted for its actions in solidarity with Gaza. However, the suppression of resistance in Jenin Camp predates October 7, as the camp has long been a target of the occupation forces and now it is a target of the PA forces, who justify their treacherous actions by labeling the resistance as -outlaws-, the same term used by the occupation forces when pursuing fighters in the West Bank. In reality, it is the PA forces who are the outlaws as they have repeatedly betrayed the Palestinian cause and abandoned Gaza. (1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/778	2024-12-22T16:41:33-08:00

Righteous soul and grandfather of Reem, our three year old martyr who was murdered by the occupation just a year prior, who Abu Diaa called the -Spirit of my Spirit-. Nabhan was martyred alongside 4 others, he was a devout Muslim with a heart of gold and beloved to everyone he met. Before the egregious zionist entity murdered him, he was helping rescuers and medics take care of injured Palestinian children, playing with them, feeding cats, wandering through campsites and hospitals, feeding communities, spreading joy, hope, and love with a smile on his face that remains in tact as he goes back to be reunited with Reem.We testify to the man you were. We will honor you. We will honor all our martyrs. We will continue to fight for you.	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/776	2024-12-18T14:03:42-08:00

Until Mufid, Shukri and Ghassan have all walked free, the struggle to #FreeTheHLF5 will continue.-While we are overjoyed to know he will be reuniting with his family soon, the pain of those lost years - stolen - remains.-.-I am sorry for all you have been through.

He was subsequently transferred to a halfway house where he will spend one year according to the Coalition for Civil Freedoms. While he is one step closer to freedom, he is still not fully free.

Over the course of the next six years from 1987-1993, the First Intifada was led by the Palestinian masses, who not only took to the streets to protest and resist the occupation, but also formed local committees to organize popular education when schools shut down and coordinated general strikes, economic boycotts of israeli goods and the withholding of taxes to the occupation. Women’s organizations, youth and students and labor unions in particular took a leading role in these committees.Today, the Intifada continues in the face of the ongoing genocide in Gaza, in the face of the siege and ethnic cleansing of the north, in the face of 76 years of Nakba. Despite the horrors the zionist entity and the U.S. empire have brought upon our people, Palestinians continue to resist and resist and resist: From Beit Lahia to Beit Lahm, from Khan Younis to Tulkarem, from Al-Quds to Nablus, from Rafah to Jenin, from the occupied interior to the camps, to everywhere Palestinians are living in exile.
