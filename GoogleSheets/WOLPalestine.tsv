During this -Operation Iron Wall,- 11 Palestinian children have been martyred, 7 of whom were killed by drones – the same IOF weapons and genocide tech manufactured right here at Brooklyn Navy Yard.

If we are in prison, how can we not seek our freedom? My escape from underground is a search for freedom. Our Palestinian people have been searching for their freedom for a hundred years, and the time has come for them to obtain their freedom.-—Palestinian freedom fighter Zakaria Zubeidi after his release from the occupation’s prisons on Thursday January 30th 2025.Today an additional 183 Palestinian political prisoners were released and reunited with their families and loved ones in the fourth exchange as part of the ceasefire deal in Gaza by orders of the resistance.🇵🇸	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/842	2025-02-02T07:52:56-08:00

In 2002, Deif became the general commander of the resistance's military wing, later becoming known for his illuminating shadow that haunted the enemy for over 35 years. He was the mastermind of the Al-Aqsa Flood operation and was known as a warrior with 9 lives, as seen by his ability to evade capture for decades and survive countless assassination attempts. Even with his martyrdom, his legacy remains alive within the hearts of every revolutionary. The cause he fought for lives on, passed down through generations. His name will not fade into history but will stand as a symbol of resistance, sacrifice, and steadfastness against the defeated occupation.-No matter how much the tyrants try to uproot us the seeds will sprout.-(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/841	2025-02-01T09:08:19-08:00

He came from a Palestinian refugee family that was displaced from Al-Qubeiba during the Nakba in 1948. He pursued higher education, earning a degree in science from the Islamic University of Gaza, where he became an active figure in the student movement, known for his intelligence and composure. He joined the resistance following its establishment in 1987, was arrested in 1989, and spent 16 months in -israeli- occupation prisons on charges of military activity.During his imprisonment, Deif worked with many founding resistance leaders to plan out operations for capturing IOF soldiers, out of hopes of securing prisoner exchange deals.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/840	2025-02-01T09:08:13-08:00

Zakaria is one of the six heroes who liberated themselves from the maximum security -Gilboa- prison in the 2021 Freedom Tunnel operation.He was a prominent figure during the 2002 Battle of Jenin, in which his mother and brother were both martyred. As he once wrote, -Struggle is the basis for the right to the homeland, freedom, and dignity.-Zakaria Zubeidi returns to his homeland, but this time, he walks free on his own terms, stepping through the fragile prison gates, just as he did in 2021, when he heroically tunneled his way out using a spoon. He returns home, to Jenin Camp, to finally bid farewell to his martyred brother, Dawood Zubeidi, and his martyred son, Mohammed Zubeidi, both of whom carried forward the path of resistance.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/837	2025-01-30T09:18:41-08:00

Hind, who was just 5 years old, is one of over 300,000 Palestinians martyred during the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Hind was shot at by the IOF 355 times, alone for hours as she sat on the phone with paramedics from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, surrounded by her martyred family members who were murdered in cold blood before her. They included her uncle Bashar Hamadeh, her aunt, Anam Hamadeh, as well as four of her cousins, Raghad, Mohammed, Sara and Layan.The PRCS released her final words on call in which she said, -I'm so scared, please come. Please call someone to come and take me.-Two paramedics from the PCRS were also martyred while trying to rescue her. Their names were Ahmed Al-Madhoun and Yusuf Al-Zeino.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/835	2025-01-29T15:52:26-08:00

After a series of continual baseless meetings and appeals, at least 13 students are now suspended from NYU. Join these students, faculty and community members tomorrow on Thursday, at 12:30 for a press conference. Following the press conference, students call for a picket at Bobst, where the university has effectively shut down all forms of protest in response to the campus movement for Palestine.

Days after the ceasefire in Gaza went into effect, zionist forces have launched a large-scale assult against Jenin, its refugee camp and surrounding villages, resulting in the deaths of 10 martyrs with dozens more wounded. During the assault IOF carried out multiple air strikes and have targeted healthcare workers and ambulances. -Operation Iron Wall- follows the humiliation and failure of the IOF and the Palestinian Authority to defeat the Palestinian resistance from Gaza to the West Bank, and a nearly 50 day siege by PA forces. This latest display of security coordination has been firmly rejected by the masses who rose up against the siege by the PA and are now confronting the invasion by the occupation with fierce fighting across Jenin. Although the bombs have stopped falling on Gaza, there is no ceasefire in the West Bank, and the genocide will only end when Palestine is free from the river to the sea. 🇵🇸	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/828	2025-01-21T18:13:37-08:00

Ceasefire Commences⏳As Palestinians hostages are released, bruised and traumatized, the inhumane and brutal conditions of israeli prisons are once again exposed. As the occupation takes measures to prevent any -public displays of joy-, the Palestinian Authority enforces occupational orders by abducting Jivara al-Badri of Al-Jazeera. Yet again, illustrating its partnership with the occupation, attempting to control every aspect Palestinian life — even their joy and their pain. Yesterday, an israeli sniper shot dead a Palestinian child in Rafah, in blatant violation of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. The IOF abducted 60 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank yesterday as well.This is a clear reminder of the occupation’s blood thirsty, fascist agenda on full display despite the ceasefire deal.	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/827	2025-01-21T15:12:14-08:00

The New York Times, which falsely claimed the Gaza death toll was exaggerated, has now admitted that the toll was undercounted. As the imperial core, we have a duty to expose these accomplices and demand accountability. Even before October 7, 2023, this year had already become one of the deadliest for Palestinian children in the West Bank. The violence persists because the occupying entity remains entrenched on stolen Palestinian land. Recently, Jenin Camp was bombed twice in weeks, leaving 12 martyrs as the occupation tightened its grip to crush resistance.Liberation is non-negotiable, and justice cannot wait. Join us to demand justice for Palestine!(2/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/820	2025-01-16T18:40:22-08:00

The struggle continues, and the flood rises stronger! 🇵🇸Join us 🗓️ Saturday, January 18, at ⏰ 2 PM 📍 in front of The New York Times headquarters at 242 W. 41st St. New York, NY 10036 as we demand full liberation from the river to the sea. This is not just a fight for a ceasefire—it’s a fight to end all U.S. financial, media, political, and diplomatic complicity in the crimes of settler colonialism, genocide, and Zionism.The ceasefire while only temporary, was won through the resilience of Palestinian resistance. But true justice demands more: lifting the siege on Gaza, freeing every Palestinian prisoner, and dismantling the occupation entirely.For decades, Palestinians have endured relentless violence, oppression, and dispossession—fueled by U.S. military aid, diplomatic backing, and media propaganda that enable the apartheid regime. Under the Biden administration and the Democratic Party, this complicity has ensured that the bloodshed continues to their very last days in power.(1/2)	https://t.me/s/WOLPalestine/819	2025-01-16T18:40:18-08:00
