Nick Matau was a nuclear engineer; then he became a pro-Israel Ti...	Wearing a 'F*ck Hamas' T-shirt, necklaces with maps of Israel and hostages' names, and a tattoo reading 'Am Yisrael Chai', Nick Matau might appear to be just another American Jew explaining Israel on social media through videos and livestreams. In his case, he reaches 50,000 followers on TikTok ('I used to have 100,000, but TikTok closed my account when I started speaking up for Israel and Zionism'). However, the 32-year-old Californian isn't Jewish – and didn't even grow up in a Jewish environment. His only connection to the Jewish people is through the man who raised him from age one, a Samoan, who instilled in him a love for the Jewish people. 'He taught me history and how important it is to support Israel,' Nick explains. 'He's a large Samoan man who occasionally yells at people hanging Palestinian flags in the street, calling them terrorism supporters. He strongly supports what I'm doing but urges me to be careful.' Nick waiving an Israeli flag in front of a pro-Palestinian encampment (@makeabracha) Q: Be careful of what? 'There's tremendous hate on social media. I receive death threats daily and statements saying Hitler didn't finish the job, unfortunately.' Beyond the harsh messages, Nick also receives threats from people claiming to know where he lives and promising to 'eliminate' him. Nick welcomes them, 'I tell them 'Yes, I'm here, and I have a gun in my drawer.' I want to be prepared. I have cameras around the house. There were cases where people called leaving 'Free Palestine' messages, and one woman exposed my ex-wife's and child's personal information. I went to the police, but they said they couldn't do anything until she actually does something – which I think is really stupid.' For 12 years, Nick served in the US Navy as a nuclear engineer, returning to civilian life about a year ago. While he always supported Israel, he rarely discussed it in his social media videos until May 2021. 'When Hamas started launching rockets in 2021 and I felt TikTok was flooded with 'Free Palestine' content without enough support for Israel, I knew I had to speak up. Every day I learn something new about Israel. I always knew antisemitism existed, but I didn't realize how prevalent it was. From the moment I started talking about antisemitism or Zionism, I received enormous hate from followers and blocks from TikTok, but I didn't care. I learned more, read more, speak with many Muslims from Arab countries, and understand I'm on the right side. Before this, I was never blocked once, but since then I've lost 15 TikTok accounts.' Q: Did you reach out to them about this? 'I emailed them and filed an appeal. I even made my main account with 53,000 followers private recently because I had more than 30 videos removed. They restored all but three, with TikTok claiming I was 'promoting hate and supporting a hate organization.' The IDF is considered a hate organization? Most of the time they just respond that I'm violating guidelines.' Early in the war, when pro-Palestinian activists set up encampments at universities and severely harassed Jewish students, Nick and his friend Bracha, who often joins his TikTok livestreams, decided to see firsthand what was happening at Berkeley. 'I went to their encampments and stood in front of 100 pro-Palestinian protesters with their flags, waved an Israeli flag, and started debating them and disproving their claims. They didn't know how to respond, and after a few minutes their 'leader' came out and told them not to talk to me. I was busy arguing and didn't notice one of them opening his jacket to show Bracha, who was standing on the other side, that he had a gun. She left immediately and called to warn me to leave. We went to file a police report, but they didn't do anything.' Nick and Danielle (Nick Matau) Nick doesn't rule out conversion to Judaism. He first visited Israel over a year ago and returned to the United States just days before the Oct. 7 attack. 'I wanted to visit Israel when I started my activism,' he recalls, 'but I was in the Navy, and they always found different reasons not to approve my travel. I first arrived in Israel with my fiancée Danielle just before Yom Kippur last year, and it was an amazing experience. We visited Masada, the Dead Sea, Tel Aviv, and Ramat Gan, leaving shortly before Oct. 7. On the day of the attack, I received a call from a good friend, 'Hebrew Hammer' – the first Zionist I met on TikTok, who called to say Israel was under attack. I replied 'What else is new?' and he said this time was different. Then it got worse moment by moment, and the first thing we thought after crying was that we wanted to return there.' Nick met his fiancée online – thanks to his videos. 'Danielle is an American Jew who moved to Israel at 21 and stayed for 13 years. She happened to see one of my videos about Israel and commented on it. I thought she was really cute and sent her a message, and things moved quickly from there.' Q: Are there plans to return or move to Israel? 'I have an 11-year-old child. When he goes to college, I'd be more than happy to move to Israel.' Q: Have you ever considered converting to Judaism? 'When I was stationed in Guam, there was an Australian rabbi I talked to about it, and he said it's better not to because my voice as a non-Jew is stronger. But on my third visit to discuss conversion, he promised to start working on my conversion process. Shortly after, I left Guam and didn't pursue it further. I identify as a Noahide, and I'm very open to conversion. When I feel God puts things in front of me, I don't resist them.' TikTok responded to a request for comment: 'We operate at all times to strengthen our defense mechanisms in order to keep the platform safe and clean from content that could harm the user community, and we have zero tolerance toward violators of community guidelines. We monitor the content through a combination of technologies and a team of 40 thousand human monitors. Every report about an inappropriate video is treated with full seriousness, and the algorithm does not promote content of one side over another side.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/04/from-navy-nuclear-engineer-to-israel-advocate-meet-nick-matau/	2024-11-04T01:00:14-08:00	
2 IRGC officers killed in mysterious aircraft crash	Two high-ranking members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps perished in a light aircraft crash in southeastern Iran, Al Arabiya news network reported. According to the report, both officers were conducting an 'operational exercise' when the incident occurred. The commander who died in the crash (Arab media) Regional media outlets identified the deceased as Commander Hamid Mazandarani, who led the Nineveh Brigade in Golestan province, and IRGC pilot Hamid Jandaqi. Both served as ground force operatives in the Revolutionary Guards. The fatal crash took place during an operational exercise held in memory of 'Security Martyrs' in the Saravan region. Images of the crashed light aircraft were subsequently circulated across Arab media platforms.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/04/2-irgc-officers-killed-in-mysterious-aircraft-crash/	2024-11-03T21:30:04-08:00	
Israel ends 57-year partnership with UNRWA amid Oct. 7 involvemen...	In a landmark decision, Israel has formally notified the United Nations of its withdrawal from its 1967 agreement with UNRWA, following new legislation barring cooperation with the agency. The move follows mounting evidence linking UNRWA staff to the Oct. 7 attacks and Hamas activities. The newly enacted Knesset legislation bars all Israeli entities from collaborating with UNRWA and withdraws the agency's authorization to operate within Israeli territory. Following the legislation on UNRWA, the State of Israel officially notified the President of the General Assembly of the termination of cooperation with the agency. Despite the overwhelming evidence we submitted to the UN that substantiate Hamas' infiltration of UNRWA, the UN did… pic.twitter.com/UUti6zZrOT — Danny Danon דני דנון (@dannydanon) November 4, 2024 UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini warned that the legislation represents 'collective punishment' that 'should be a concern to all.' He emphasized, 'These bills will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians. It ⁠will deprive over 650,000 girls & boys there from education.' He contends that Israel's action breaches its UN obligations. Acting under Section 1(b) of the UNRWA Activity Termination Law, 2024, Foreign Minister Israel Katz directed ministry Director General Yaakov Blitshtein to formally notify the UN on Sunday evening of Israel's withdrawal from the 1967 Israel-UNRWA agreement. This agreement had served as the cornerstone of Israel-UNRWA relations. 'UNRWA – whose staff members participated in the Oct. 7 massacre and many of whom are Hamas operatives – represents part of Gaza's problem, not its solution,' Katz stated. 'We've presented the UN with extensive evidence of Hamas operatives within UNRWA and the misuse of UNRWA facilities, yet no action was taken. Furthermore, UNRWA chose to ignore even the UN's own recommendations outlined in the Colonna report. 'Claims about UNRWA being irreplaceable are unfounded: currently, 87% of humanitarian aid flows through other organizations, with UNRWA handling just 13%. Israel remains committed to international law and will continue facilitating humanitarian aid to Gaza while ensuring Israeli citizens' security,' Katz added.

Photo credit: IDF IDF Evidence has repeatedly surfaced confirming UNRWA employees' involvement in the Oct. 7 attacks. Numerous additional UNRWA staff members have been identified as operatives of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Fresh cases of UNRWA staff involvement in terrorism continue to emerge. In July, Israel furnished the UN with comprehensive documentation, including a list of 100 Hamas military wing operatives employed by UNRWA – yet the agency took no action. A recent case involved a UNRWA employee from this list who participated in a grenade attack on a shelter. Despite Israel's intelligence sharing, UNRWA failed to act. While the employee was later killed in an IDF operation, UN Secretary-General António Guterres controversially expressed regret over his death. Throughout the war, multiple terror operations were launched from UNRWA facilities. The agency failed to notify Israel about these violations, breaching its neutrality commitments. The agency also neglected to implement basic measures mandated by the UN's own Colonna Report: it retained Hamas and Islamic Jihad-affiliated employees, failed to address facility neutrality violations, and continued using contentious textbooks and materials in UNRWA schools, despite promises to donor countries and Israel to remove such content. The legislation takes effect in approximately three months, allowing time to expand existing partnerships with other international humanitarian organizations and establish alternative aid mechanisms, all within international law parameters. Despite the overwhelming evidence we submitted to the UN that substantiates Hamas' infiltration of UNRWA, the UN did nothing to rectify the situation,' Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon stated on X. 'The State of Israel will continue to cooperate with humanitarian organizations but not with organizations that promote terrorism against us.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/04/israel-ends-57-year-partnership-with-unrwa-amid-oct-7-involvement/	2024-11-03T18:30:58-08:00	
Iran reportedly executes Jew in controversial 'street brawl' case	Iranian authorities have reportedly executed Arvin Ghahremani, an Iranian Jewish citizen, at Kermanshah Central Prison. Ghahremani, who was just 18 years old at the time of his arrest, had been convicted of 'intentional murder' in connection with a mass street brawl. The execution has drawn particular attention from human rights organizations due to its timing amid escalating tensions between Iran and Israel. Arvin Ghahremani Screenshot According to Iran Human Rights Watch, Ghahremani's case exhibited significant procedural flaws common to many qisas (retribution) sentences in the Iranian judicial system. The organization's director, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, specifically highlighted concerns about institutionalized antisemitism within the Islamic Republic, suggesting that Ghahremani's Jewish faith may have played a decisive role in the implementation of his death sentence. در هیاهوی تهدید جنگ با #اسرائیل، جمهوری‌اسلامی #آروین_قهرمانی ، شهروند یهودی ایرانی را نیز امروز اعدام کرد. همچون بسیاری از محکومین به قصاص ، پرونده آروین و روند دادرسی ایرادهای مهمی داشت. اما آروین علاوه بر این یک یهودی بود، و یهودی‌ستیزی نهادینه شده در سیستم جمهوری اسلامی بدون… — Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam (@iranhr) November 4, 2024 'In the frenzy of threatening war with Israel, the Islamic Republic executed an Iranian Jewish citizen today.

WSJ: Iran to hit Israel with 'powerful' warheads not used before	Iranian military planners are preparing an extensive retaliatory strike against Israel that could employ enhanced warheads and sophisticated weaponry, according to Iranian and Arab officials familiar with the planning who spoke to The Wall Street Journal. The warnings emerge in defiance of American diplomatic pressure to avoid escalation, though analysts remain divided on whether these signals represent concrete intentions or strategic messaging. The October 26 Israeli strike has left Iran's air defense network severely compromised, potentially increasing the stakes of any retaliatory action. Future Israeli military responses would be calibrated based on the magnitude and success of Iran's threatened offensive, sources tell The Wall Street Journal. While Israeli forces have previously avoided striking Iran's economic and nuclear assets, officials indicate this restraint could shift depending on Iran's actions. The involvement of Iran's conventional military forces marks a significant shift, diplomatic sources revealed to The Wall Street Journal, citing the casualties sustained in Israel's attack – four military personnel and one civilian. This unprecedented coordination between regular forces and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps suggests an expanded operational scope, though not necessarily direct troop deployment. Israel's military displays what they say is an Iranian ballistic missile which they retrieved from the Dead Sea after Iran launched drones and missiles towards Israel, at Julis military base, in southern Israel April 16, 2024 (Reuters/Amir Cohen) Reuters/Amir Cohen A senior Iranian official, speaking to The Wall Street Journal, emphasized the military's obligation to respond. 'Our military lost people, so they need to respond,' the official stated, adding that the operation might utilize Iraqi territory and target Israeli military installations 'but much more aggressively than last time.' Breaking from previous patterns of drone and missile-only attacks, Iranian strategists are considering a broader range of military options, according to officials who spoke with The Wall Street Journal. The planned response could feature missiles carrying enhanced warheads, surpassing the capabilities demonstrated in Iran's October 1 strike, which deployed Emad and Ghadr missiles alongside advanced Kheibar Shekan and Fattah systems. Iranian planning takes into account the US political calendar, sources tell The Wall Street Journal. While avoiding actions during Tuesday's American elections, Iran intends to execute its response before the January presidential inauguration. US intelligence assessments indicate Iran's preference for Kamala Harris over Donald Trump, the official noted. Diplomatic representatives from Egypt, Bahrain, and Oman informed The Wall Street Journal that Iranian officials outlined these response scenarios despite repeated US warnings. UN Ambassador Linda Thomas–Greenfield recently cautioned of 'severe consequences' for any Iranian aggression against Israel or US interests. 'We believe this should be the end of the direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran,' Thomas–Greenfield declared. Iran's diplomatic stance has undergone a rapid transformation, according to regional sources speaking to The Wall Street Journal. Initial signals of restraint quickly gave way to more aggressive rhetoric. A high–ranking Iranian general promised an 'unimaginable response' on Friday, followed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's Saturday warning of a 'tooth–breaking response.' Western intelligence sources indicate ongoing internal debates within Iranian leadership regarding response options, including whether to strike directly or through proxy forces. Israeli intelligence shares this assessment and has warned of potentially devastating counterstrikes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu highlighted Israel's successful targeting of Iran's 'soft underbelly' while dismissing Tehran's 'haughty words.' 'Today, Israel has greater freedom of action than ever before,' Netanyahu stated. 'We can go anywhere that we need to in Iran.' Despite US efforts to limit Israel's October 26 operation to military targets, Arab officials express growing concern about potential Israeli escalation in future operations. Netanyahu recently reaffirmed that preventing Iranian nuclear weapons capability remains Israel's 'supreme objective.' Iranian authorities continue to deny any nuclear weapons program. Israel's recent military operation demonstrated potential strategic flexibility, striking a facility previously connected to nuclear research. Satellite imagery analysts noted an additional strike on what experts described as a minor target at Iran's Abadan refinery. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian declared Sunday that Iran must respond to Israel's attack, though he suggested 'the type and intensity of our response' might be influenced by potential ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon. While American forces weren't directly involved in Israel's Iranian operation, US military assets would likely support Israeli defenses against retaliation. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has directed additional B–52 Stratofortress bombers, tanker aircraft and Navy destroyers to the Middle East, the Pentagon announced Friday. These reinforcements coincide with the departure of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, marking the first absence of a US carrier in the region since Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/04/iran-retaliation-to-israel-to-include-powerful-warheads-not-used-before/	2024-11-03T15:42:00-08:00	
New intelligence figures suggest dozens hostages already dead	Of the Israeli residents being held by Hamas following the Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel, only 51 remain alive in Gaza, according to the latest Israeli intelligence assessments. Officials believe the remaining hostages have died, though many deaths still lack official confirmation. During a closed-door session with the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in September, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed that roughly half the hostages were still alive. This figure, disclosed here for the first time, has become the working baseline for Israeli agencies managing the crisis. The assessment draws from extensive intelligence gathered since October 7, combining public sources with classified operational data. Analysis points to 50 Israeli hostages who are believed dead, though officials have only confirmed 37 deaths among those whose bodies remain in Hamas custody. Damaged buildings in central Gaza as smoke blankets the sky following an explosion, seen from the Israel-Gaza border, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, August 26, 2024 (Reuters / Amir Cohen) Reuters / Amir Cohen The gap between presumed and confirmed deaths reflects the strict standards required for official death declarations in Israel, which must satisfy both medical and religious criteria. While conclusive proof may be lacking in some cases, intelligence strongly indicates additional hostages did not survive. Sources familiar with the situation told Israel Hayom that officials have kept families fully informed, sharing detailed assessments about their loved ones' status. While some families have accepted the government's conclusions about presumed deaths, others are holding out for definitive proof. Tracking the hostages' status serves multiple critical purposes beyond negotiations. This intelligence helps commanders plan operations to prevent unintended casualties – whether from IDF strikes or deliberate harm by Hamas, which has ordered its fighters to kill hostages at the first sign of any rescue attempt. The execution of six hostages in a Khan Yunis tunnel in August – Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, and Almog Sarusi – proved these weren't empty threats. Intelligence suggests that Hamas killed 27 Israeli captives in custody, while at least seven others died as a result of IDF operations in Gaza. Security officials paint an increasingly bleak picture. While evidence about deceased hostages is conclusive (with 37 officially confirmed), information about the 51 believed alive varies significantly. Intelligence on some remains reliable, while data on others is spotty and outdated. Given the intense military pressure on Gaza and the harsh conditions hostages have endured for over a year, officials fear the actual number of survivors might be even lower. Israel maintains its commitment to bringing home all hostages, dead or alive. While recent negotiation frameworks prioritized returning living captives before remains, the dwindling number of survivors and ongoing threats to their lives have prompted security officials to push harder for an immediate deal. So far, these efforts have hit a wall.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/03/new-intelligence-figures-suggest-dozens-hostages-already-dead/	2024-11-02T23:04:49-07:00	
Iranian woman defies morality police, strips in public	A female student has been arrested at Tehran Islamic Azad University after staging a protest against dress code regulations by partially removing her clothing, according to reports from Euronews and Amnesty Iran. The incident, which was captured on video by other students and widely shared on social media platform X, occurred after security officers allegedly harassed the woman for improper hijab wear. The student, whose identity has not been released, was filmed from a classroom overlooking the campus. The video has garnered significant attention online, with social media users praising the woman's actions as courageous. Video: Arab social media Syed Amir Mahjoub, the university's public relations director, said security personnel handed the student over to police authorities.

NYT: Khamenei orders preparation for strike against Israel	Iran's supreme leader has directed military commanders to prepare for an attack against Israel, senior Iranian officials told The New York Times. Three Iranian officials, speaking to The New York Times on condition of anonymity, revealed that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued the directive during a Supreme National Security Council meeting on Monday. The order came after he reviewed reports detailing damage to Iran's missile production facilities, air defense systems, and critical infrastructure from recent Israeli strikes. Gen Ali Fadavi, deputy commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, declared on Thursday that retaliation was inevitable. 'Iran's response to the Zionist aggression is definite,' Fadavi told Lebanon's Al Mayadeen television station. 'We have never left an aggression unanswered in 40 years. We are capable of destroying all that the Zionists possess with one operation.' The remains of an Iranian missile launched at Israel, Oct. 2, 2024, Arad (Erik Marmor/Getty ImagesErik Marmor/Getty Images) Erik Marmor/Getty ImagesErik Marmor/Getty Images Gholamhossein Mohammadi Golpayegani, head of the supreme leader's office, echoed these sentiments, promising 'a fierce, tooth-breaking response' to what he termed Israel's 'desperate action,' according to Tasnim, a semiofficial news agency affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards. The officials who spoke to The New York Times said military commanders are compiling a list of dozens of potential military targets within Israel. However, they indicated that any attack would likely be delayed until after the American election, citing concerns that regional instability could influence the US presidential race. This latest development follows Iran's launch of approximately 180 ballistic missiles at Israel earlier this month, which Iran characterized as retaliation for Israeli operations against leaders of Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iranian military commanders. Israel responded with strikes on Iranian air defenses near oil refineries, petrochemical facilities, and a major port. While Iranian state media has minimized the impact of Israel's attacks, analysts suggest the strikes effectively compromised key air defense systems around Tehran and energy installations. 'They are willing to take this risk to not appear weak and prove they have a grip on power for both domestic and international credibility,' Sina Azodi, an expert on Iran's military and adjunct professor at George Washington University, told The New York Times. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Israeli military personnel on Thursday, stating that the recent attacks had enhanced Israel's capability to inflict damage in potential future strikes. 'We hit its underbelly. The boastful talk by the Iranian regime's heads cannot conceal and compensate for the fact that Israel now has greater freedom to operate in Iran than ever before,' Netanyahu said. Gen Ismail Ghaani, commander in chief of the Quds Forces, affirmed Iran's support for Hezbollah, which continues to engage in conflict with Israel along the Lebanese border. The timing and nature of Iran's response remain uncertain, as does whether diplomatic intervention might still prevent further escalation. Iranian officials' public statements could potentially serve as leverage in negotiations, though the supreme leader's direct involvement suggests a serious intent to respond.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/01/nyt-khamenei-orders-preparation-for-strike-against-israel/	2024-10-31T23:15:00-07:00

Couple arrested on suspicion of surveilling defense sites for Ira...	Authorities have uncovered an Iranian espionage operation involving a married couple from central Israel who allegedly tracked sensitive security installations and conducted surveillance of a prominent defense researcher. The suspects, both 32, were arrested following an investigation that revealed direct contact with an Iranian intelligence operative. Prosecutors are preparing to file serious charges on Thursday. A joint operation by the Shin Bet security agency and police led to the arrest of Rafael and Lala Guliyev of Lod. The investigation revealed that Rafael Guliyev was recruited by Elshan (Elkhan) Agayev, 56, an Azerbaijani-born operator working for Iranian intelligence, as part of a network targeting Israeli citizens of Caucasus origin. A gas flare on an oil production platform is seen alongside an Iranian flag in the Gulf July 25, 2005 (Reuters/Raheb Homavandi) Reuters/Raheb Homavandi Under Agayev's direction, Guliyev conducted surveillance of several high-security locations, including Mossad headquarters, and gathered intelligence about a researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) whom Iranian operatives had marked for targeting. Guliyev was also tasked with recruiting a potential hit man, with his wife Lala allegedly assisting in several operations. 'These arrests are part of a broader pattern we've uncovered in recent weeks,' a senior Shin Bet official said. 'We've detained multiple Israeli citizens who were carrying out missions for Iranian intelligence. These cases repeatedly demonstrate Iran's persistent efforts to recruit Israeli citizens for espionage and terror operations within Israel.' A high-ranking police official emphasized that law enforcement agencies would maintain their round-the-clock vigilance. 'We will show zero tolerance toward those who collaborate with hostile entities and endanger our citizens and state,' the official stated. In response to the investigation, INSS released a statement, saying, 'The Institute for National Security Studies expresses its profound gratitude to the Shin Bet security agency for preventing the planned operation against our staff member.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/31/iranian-spy-ring-uncovered-couple-accused-of-surveilling-security-sites-tracking-researcher/	2024-10-31T00:45:05-07:00	
Germany closes all Iranian consulates	Germany has decided to close all three Iranian consulates within its borders as a diplomatic response to the execution of Jamshid Sharmahd, a German-Iranian national who Iran accused of terrorism, according to DW. This decision was made public by Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on October 30, 2024. The consulates affected are located in Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Munich, leaving only the Iranian embassy in Berlin operational. Germany has also 'recalled for consultations' its ambassador to Iran, Markus Potzel, for consultations in Berlin following the execution as diplomatic tensions escalate between the two nations, according to Spiegel Politik. The German Foreign Office warned that Iran should expect 'timely measures' in response to the execution. A ministry spokesperson said the killing of a German citizen would 'extremely strain' relations with Iran, which had already been reduced to a minimum. Baerbock strongly condemned the 'murder' of Sharmahd by the Iranian regime. The embassy in Tehran had worked tirelessly on Sharmahd's behalf. A high-ranking team had been sent to Iran multiple times for this purpose. 'Throughout this process, we repeatedly made it unambiguously clear to Tehran that the execution of a German citizen would have serious consequences,' Baerbock stated. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock speaks during a news conference at the German Embassy in Dekwaneh, northern Beirut, Lebanon, Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2024 (Photo: AP/Bilal Hussein) AP This move comes in the wake of escalating tensions due to Sharmahd's execution, which has been internationally criticized as a sham trial. The Foreign Office expressed gratitude for the solidarity shown by European partners, who had also clearly condemned the execution. 'It is also clear that serious consequences loom for EU-Iran relations,' the spokesperson said. The focus would be on 'targeted and significant measures' that would now be pursued jointly. 'In this context, we will naturally also discuss the topic of sanctions.' Iran's judiciary announced Sharmahd's execution on Monday. He had been sentenced to death in spring 2023 in a controversial trial based on terrorism charges. The German government, family members, and human rights activists vehemently rejected the accusations against him. On Tuesday, the Foreign Office had already summoned the chargé d'affaires of the Iranian embassy to convey its sharp protest against the action. Ambassador Potzel had also protested at the Iranian Foreign Ministry in Tehran.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/31/germany-closes-all-iranian-consulates/	2024-10-30T23:30:48-07:00	
Interior Ministry suspends ties with Haaretz after publisher's co...	The Interior Ministry announced Thursday it would suspend all cooperation and advertising with the Haaretz newspaper following controversial remarks made by the paper's publisher, Amos Schocken, at a conference in London where he criticized Israeli policies and called for international sanctions. Speaking at a Haaretz-organized conference, Schocken issued sharp criticism of Israeli policies, described Palestinian attackers as 'freedom fighters,' and claimed Israeli forces were conducting a 'second Nakba' in Gaza. His comments extended to calls for international sanctions against Israel and its leadership, while characterizing government policies in the West Bank and Gaza as an 'apartheid regime.' Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip (IDF Spokesperson's Unit) IDF Spokesperson's Unit The Interior Ministry's official statement described these comments as 'deeply offensive and revealing a fundamental departure from core values, particularly as Israel conducts its most justified war, initiated in response to Hamas's deadly Oct. 7 attack.' Channel 14 correspondent Yishai Friedman reported that Schocken told conference attendees that Prime Minister Benjamin 'Netanyahu's government shows no concern about enforcing cruel apartheid rule over the Palestinian population,' adding that 'achieving a Palestinian state is only possible through sanctions targeting Israel, its opposing leadership, and settlers.' The Interior Ministry's statement emphasized that 'we cannot and will not stand idle while facing attacks on IDF soldiers and the state's efforts to defend its citizens.' The move represents an unprecedented break between a government ministry and a major Israeli news organization.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/31/interior-ministry-suspends-ties-with-haaretz-after-publishers-controversial-london-speech/	2024-10-30T21:00:52-07:00	
Trouble on all fronts: Iran shoots refugees, deports millions, an...	On Saturday night, amid a large-scale aerial strike by the Israeli military on Iranian targets, the Iranian regime faced another attack on its forces. Though the incident was relatively contained, the number of Iranian casualties reportedly exceeded those from the Israeli strikes. Ten Iranian border guards were killed in an assault in Sistan and Baluchestan province. According to Iranian claims, these border guards died in combat on a local road against members of Jaish ul-Adl (Army of Justice), a Sunni terrorist group seeking independence for the Baluchi minority. This organization frequently ambushes and plants explosives targeting Iranian and Pakistani security forces. Sistan and Baluchestan is a persistent trouble spot within Iran, a hotspot of internal conflicts. Just a week before, the area made headlines due to a violent incident in which hundreds of people were killed: Iranian border guards reportedly opened fire on Afghan refugees attempting to cross from Pakistan into Iran, killing approximately 250 people, according to reports. The aftermath of Israel's attack in Iran | Photo: Social media Initially, Iran denied the incident's occurrence, which had been reported by local human rights organizations. Yet afterwards, Tehran's ambassador to Kabul stated that taking 'lawful' action against illegal entry is a legitimate right of all nations, and that border guards are mandated to prevent the entry of unauthorized foreigners. Given that the casualties were Afghan citizens, the Taliban government in Kabul launched an investigation, and the United Nations also sought to look into the incident. UN special rapporteur for human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, expressed concern about its implications. These two events highlight some of Iran's challenges along its eastern border, particularly at the tri-border area with Afghanistan and Pakistan. This isn't the first incident of Iranian border guards opening fire on refugees trying to cross the border this month. Tehran doesn't publicize these incidents, often denying them outright, but various reports indicate that at least 13 migrants were killed along the border, in this exact same area. The issue of Afghan refugees is a sensitive one in Iran. Many have fled Taliban rule in recent years, with estimates suggesting over a million have entered Iran since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Overall, Iran claims to host around six million Afghan refugees, many of whom have escaped war, poverty, and hardship over decades. Even the UN refugee agency estimates about four million Afghans are currently in Iran. These refugees place a significant strain on Iran, whose economy is already burdened by international sanctions and struggling with internal challenges. Iran also diverts substantial resources to support armed militias and terrorist organizations across the Middle East and beyond. This international support strains local resources, especially with the added burden of feeding millions more. Iranian President Mahmoud Pazhkyan. Photo: EPA To address the refugee issue, Iran is not only taking border measures against migrants but actively deporting refugees back to Afghanistan. Reports indicate that only in September, Iran expelled over 100,000 people. Many refugees report being beaten, denied basic access to food and water, and detained in special camps by Iranian authorities. Taliban officials claim that since the beginning of the year, nearly half a million refugees have entered Afghanistan from Iran, with the rate increasing. Iran has now set an ambitious target to deport two million undocumented Afghan refugees within six months. However, Iran is not alone in this approach. Both Turkey and Pakistan are also expelling Afghan refugees despite the humanitarian consequences and global outcry. Concerns over the dangers awaiting these refugees back in Afghanistan—economic hardship and potential Taliban persecution—haven't deterred authorities in Tehran, Ankara, or Islamabad from taking these measures. Iran's planned mass deportation program is moving forward, forcibly sending refugees back without judicial oversight or international intervention. Regional conflict with Pakistan In the border regions with Pakistan and Afghanistan, Iran also faces threats from ethnic separatist movements like the one responsible for killing Iranian border guards on Saturday. The Jaish ul-Adl terrorists represent Iran's Baluchi minority, around three percent of the country's population. Alongside Kurds, Sunni Baluchis are among the most persecuted minorities in Iran, which is governed by a Shiite majority. They live in Sistan and Baluchestan in severe poverty, with high unemployment and limited access to basic infrastructure and essential resources such as food and water. Many locals turn to smuggling goods, such as fuel or food, and some are involved in drug trafficking. The conditions in this region have been likened to certain impoverished areas in Africa. Jaish ul-Adl is perhaps the primary voice of Baluchi dissent and terrorism within Iran. Tehran accuses Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in supporting the organization, with hints of Israeli backing as well. This organization has a bloody history with Iranian security forces: in 2019, for example, Jaish ul-Adl killed 13 officers of Iran's Revolutionary Guards in Zahedan, following up with other attacks on Iranian targets. As recently as September, the group claimed responsibility for two attacks on Iranian police, killing three people. In June, they kidnapped nine individuals linked to the Revolutionary Guards, and in April, they carried out five coordinated attacks on Iranian military bases and other sites. The Pakistan Monument in Islamabad. Photo: Shutterstock These escalations prompted Iran to intensify its response. The Iranian military launched drones and missiles into Pakistani territory, targeting what it claimed were extremist training camps linked to Israel. In retaliation, Pakistan carried out a nearly identical strike on Iranian 'terrorist targets,' resulting in seven Iranian deaths. This confrontation led to diplomatic repercussions: Pakistan expelled the Iranian ambassador and withdrew its own representative from Tehran, temporarily downgrading relations. Ten days later, however, the crisis was resolved, with both countries restoring diplomatic ties, and Pakistan even inviting Iran's then-Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian for a visit. Despite this, the diplomatic incident doesn't appear to have soured Pakistan's overall stance towards Iran. Following Israel's airstrikes on Iranian targets, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry issued a harsh condemnation, accusing Israel of full responsibility for escalating regional tensions. A broader regional and global trend After its unsuccessful efforts to stem terrorism or mass migration from Afghanistan through attacks on its neighbors, Iran is now taking another approach. Since mid-month, Iran has resorted to crackdowns on refugees and initiated the construction of physical barriers to control its border. The new initiative began last January, when Iran started building a border fence, wall, and other obstacles along its long eastern border. The project began in Baluchestan with a four-meter-high wall spanning 300 kilometers of Iran's vast border with Pakistan and Afghanistan. The plan aims to cover 1,000 kilometers on each border, with Iran spending an estimated $3 billion on construction, expected to be completed within three years. According to Iranian military officials, the wall aims to control border crossings and stop Afghan refugees from entering. Commentators suggest that the wall represents a shift in Iran's security strategy, emphasizing defensive measures to manage cross-border threats without escalating to open conflicts, as seen in its recent clashes with Pakistan. This trend of constructing physical barriers aligns with similar measures worldwide. While modern threats like drones or rockets often bypass physical defenses, walls still provide protection against terrorism, illegal migration, and trafficking. Pakistan, for instance, is considering similar initiatives along its borders with Iran, just as it has along its Afghan border. Though countries like Israel and the US have faced criticism for building such barriers, this trend continues to grow globally. Despite high costs, walls help control sprawling borders and prevent crises from escalating into broader conflicts. This situation also underscores Iran's need to manage threats on multiple fronts beyond its ongoing tensions with Israel, including resource demands on defense, personnel, and weapons. Iran recently announced a 200% increase in its defense budget—a huge rise reflecting the complex priorities it must balance amid escalating international sanctions and its nuclear ambitions. With rising pressures, Tehran may soon need to make strategic choices on its long-term focus and capabilities.

Despite evidence, Iran denies disruption of missile production	Iranian Defense Minister Aziz Naser Zadeh has stated on Wednesday that the recent Israeli attack over the weekend did not disrupt missile production processes in the Islamic Republic. It is worth recalling that published satellite images revealed that the Israeli attack caused extensive damage, destroying a key Iranian missile production facility on Iranian soil, This satellite photo from Planet Labs PBC shows a damaged large building at the Revolutionary Guard's Shahroud Space Center in Semnan province, Iran, Tuesday Oct. 29, 2024 | Photo: AP/Planet Labs PBC AP On Tuesday, a senior Iranian official mentioned that 'There was minor damage during recent Israeli regime strikes against Iran. With our scientific expertise and power, we immediately compensated for it.' According to reports, Israel attacked a solid fuel mixer plant, crucial for launching the 'Khaibar' and 'Qassem' ballistic missiles, which had been launched towards Israel earlier this month. Reports also indicated that it might take one to two years to repair the damage, effectively incapacitating Iranian missile production capabilities. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi: 'Israel Used Iraqi Airspace'Photo: Arab Networks At the same time, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi declared, 'The Zionist fighter jets used Iraqi airspace against us, which is under American control, and we will pursue this issue through legal action.'

Analysis of high-resolution imagery purchased from Planet Labs by AP shows a central building at the Shahrud base sustained direct hits, with multiple vehicles visible around the impact site. Three auxiliary facilities nearby also suffered damage, along with a newly constructed hangar. 'The presence of protective earthen barriers around this building suggests it handled highly explosive materials,' notes Hinz, who has extensively studied the site and believes it served as a solid rocket fuel production facility.

X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, suspended a new Hebrew-language account associated with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday, amid heightened tensions between Iran and Israel. The account, which appeared briefly on Sunday, was suspended by early Monday with a notification stating: 'X suspends accounts which violate the X Rules.' The specific violation was not detailed, and X did not respond to The Associated Press' request for comment. Commuters drive past an anti-Israel billboard covering the facade of a building in Tehran on October 26, 2024 (AFP / Atta Kenare) AFP / Atta Kenare The suspension comes in the wake of Israel's first direct strike on Iranian territory this weekend. In response to the Israeli action, which followed Iran's earlier ballistic missile attack, Khamenei delivered a measured statement on Sunday, saying the strikes 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while not calling for immediate retaliation. Before its suspension, the account posted its inaugural message in Hebrew, stating: 'In the name of God, the most merciful,' a traditional Islamic greeting as well as a threat to Israel saying, 'The Zionist regime made a mistake, and miscalculated regarding Iran. We will make them understand what power, capability, initiative, and will the Iranian nation has.'' The 85-year-old supreme leader's office has historically maintained multiple X accounts in various languages. This isn't Khamenei's first encounter with social media restrictions. In February, Meta removed his Facebook and Instagram accounts following his expressions of support for Hamas after its October 7 attack on Israel. Iranian citizens are generally unable to access platforms like X and Facebook without using virtual private networks, as these platforms remain blocked within the country. In related developments, Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has stated that his country will respond 'appropriately' to what he termed Israeli aggression. Speaking on state TV, Pezeshkian said, 'We are not seeking war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country.' *Iran has reported one civilian casualty from the Israeli strike. The state-run IRNA news agency identified the victim as Allahverdi Rahimpour, a resident of southwestern Tehran, emphasizing he was not affiliated with the armed forces.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/28/irans-supreme-leader-account-suspended-on-x-after-threats-on-israel/	2024-10-28T00:29:24-07:00	
Horrific moment cleric shot dead in Iran captured on tape	The Friday Prayer Imam of Kazeroun in southern Iran was fatally shot on Friday, as reported by IRNA News, marking the third such killing of the provincial town's top cleric since the Islamic revolution of 1979. Mohammad Sabahi succumbed to his injuries at Namazi Hospital in Shiraz despite medical intervention, Kazeroun's governor Mohammad Ali Bekhrad confirmed to IRNA on Friday evening, the anti-ayatollah outlet Iran International reported Saturday. Video: Iranian cleric being shot by attacker in Iran's Kazeroun / Credit: Social Media The shooting occurred after Friday prayers, according to IRNA, which notably avoided characterizing the death as martyrdom – a term typically reserved for deaths with political or religious significance in Iran. Commuters drive along a street in Tehran on October 26, 2024 AFP / Atta Kenare Friday prayer imams, who are appointed by religious authorities under Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's oversight, hold significant religious and political influence in Iranian communities. Initial reports about the incident were contradictory, with Iranian media first announcing Sabahi's death, then describing his condition as critical. The assailant reportedly took his own life following the attack. Governor Bekhrad dismissed terrorism as a motive, suggesting to IRNA that personal grievances might have prompted the shooting. He indicated that investigations are ongoing. When news of the shooting emerged, claims on a popular Telegram channel that the attacker was a war veteran were quickly refuted by Mehdi Mazarei, head of Kazeroun's Martyrs Foundation, who warned against spreading misinformation. Mizan News, affiliated with Iran's judiciary, reported that the assailant had a criminal history rather than military service. According to their report, the individual had previously attempted to attack a judge with explosives two decades ago, suffering self-inflicted injuries, and served six years in prison for bombing incidents in Gachsaran and other offenses, including weapon theft and bribery. Before his appointment to Kazeroun in November 2019, Sabahi had served as Friday Imam of Kharameh in Fars province for ten years. The town of Kazeroun, with approximately 100,000 residents, has witnessed similar attacks before. In May 2019, Friday Imam Mohammad Khorsand was fatally stabbed after Ramadan prayers. The perpetrator, Hamid Reza Derakhshandeh, was executed within two months. In July 1981, another Friday Imam, Abdolrahim Daneshjou, was shot dead near his home after evening prayers, with state sources attributing the attack to MEK members, now an exiled opposition group in Albania.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/27/horrific-moment-cleric-shot-dead-in-iran-captured-by-camera/	2024-10-26T23:05:00-07:00	
Imagery shows extent of damage to infamous testing facility in Ir...	Israeli airstrikes on Saturday targeted buildings linked to Iran's missile production capabilities, including a facility previously connected to Tehran's nuclear weapons program, according to analysis of commercial satellite imagery shared with Reuters. David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector, and Decker Eveleth, an associate research analyst at CNA, independently assessed that Israel struck facilities in the Parchin military complex near Tehran. The attacks also hit the Khojir missile production site, which Reuters reported in July was undergoing significant expansion. Commuters drive along a street in Tehran on October 26, 2024 (AFP / Atta Kenare) AFP / Atta Kenare 'Israel may have significantly hampered Iran's ability to mass produce missiles,' Eveleth told Reuters. The Israeli military confirmed that three waves of Israeli jets struck missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran at 3:00 a.m. Saturday, responding to Iran's October 1 barrage of more than 200 missiles against Israel. Iranian military officials characterized the Israeli warheads as 'very light' and said they struck border radar systems in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan, and areas surrounding Tehran. Albright, who heads the Institute for Science and International Security research group, said satellite imagery showed Israel damaged multiple buildings at Parchin, including a structure known as Taleghan 2 that was previously used for testing during Iran's Amad Plan nuclear weapons development program. The International Atomic Energy Agency and US intelligence indicate Iran ended this program in 2003, though Iran maintains it never pursued nuclear weapons. Albright, who reviewed program files obtained by Israel's Mossad in 2018, noted that while Iran may have removed key materials before the strike, the building held 'intrinsic value' for potential future nuclear weapons-related activities. One of the sites targeted by Israel in Iran on Oct. 26, 2024 (Reuters) Analysis of Planet Labs satellite imagery by Eveleth revealed that Israeli strikes destroyed three ballistic missile solid fuel mixing buildings and a warehouse at Parchin. Additional strikes hit two similar fuel mixing facilities at the Khojir complex. 'Israel says they targeted buildings housing solid-fuel mixers,' Eveleth explained to Reuters. 'These industrial mixers are hard to make and export-controlled. Iran imported many over the years at great expense, and will likely have a hard time replacing them.' According to Axios, citing three unnamed Israeli sources, the strikes destroyed 12 'planetary mixers' used in producing solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles, potentially severely limiting Iran's ability to replenish its missile stockpile. US officials say Iran maintains the Middle East's largest missile arsenal and has provided missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine, as well as to Yemen's Houthi rebels and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah. Both Tehran and Moscow deny Russian receipt of Iranian missiles. Earlier satellite imagery analyzed by Eveleth and Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey showed major expansions at Khojir and the Modarres military complex near Tehran that they assessed were for increasing missile production, as reported by Reuters. Three senior Iranian officials confirmed this assessment.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/27/satellite-images-show-extent-of-damage-to-infamous-testing-facility-in-iran/	2024-10-26T22:38:23-07:00	
Report: Israeli strikes near critical sites cause major concern i...	Israel's strikes early Saturday destroyed air-defense systems protecting several crucial Iranian oil and petrochemical facilities, while deliberately avoiding damage to the facilities themselves, according to Iranian and Israeli officials speaking to The New York Times. The targeted sites included defensive installations at the Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex in Khuzestan Province, the adjacent Bandar Imam Khomeini port, and the Abadan oil refinery. Additional strikes hit air-defense systems in Ilam Province near the Tange Bijar gas field, officials speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attending a meeting in the command center of the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv on October 26, 2024 (AFP /Government Press Office) AFP /Government Press Office The strategic targeting has sparked serious concerns within Iran, as these critical energy and economic hubs now face potential vulnerabilities in future confrontations between the two nations. 'Israel is sending a clear message to us,' said Hamid Hosseini, an expert on Iran's oil and gas industry and member of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce. 'This can have very serious economic consequences for Iran, and now that we understand the stakes we need to act wise and not continue the tensions.' Iranian military officials reported that four soldiers working with air defenses were killed in the attacks, with casualties expected to rise. Two of the deceased soldiers were identified as residents of Mahshahr, near the Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex. According to Israeli officials, initial strike plans developed after Iran's October missile attacks on Israel had included targets connected to Iran's energy industry and nuclear program. However, the United States urged Israel to avoid striking energy, oil, and nuclear facilities directly, fearing such attacks could provoke an escalated Iranian response and potentially trigger a broader regional conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had previously indicated through diplomatic channels that attacks on energy infrastructure would cross a red line, prompting a forceful response. In a letter to the United Nations on Saturday, Araghchi condemned Israel's actions as 'unlawful and aggressive' and 'against the sovereignty and territorial integrity' of Iran. The Iranian Armed Forces stated that the attacks targeted radar air-defense systems in multiple provinces, causing minor damage. They claimed their defenses successfully neutralized most Israeli missiles and drones, adding that Israeli fighter jets operated from Iraqi airspace without entering Iranian territory. Israeli officials reported that command-and-control trailers and radar systems were among the targets, with post-strike assessments indicating severe damage to the systems. They emphasized that satellite imagery would confirm their precision in targeting only the air-defense battery at the Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex. The strikes also disabled four S-300 air-defense systems purchased from Russia, with one previously neutralized in April near Isfahan Province and three more targeted Saturday at Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport and the Malad missile base, according to both Iranian and Israeli officials.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/27/report-iran-strikes-disabled-air-defenses-while-avoiding-infrastructure-damage/	2024-10-26T22:26:47-07:00

After four hours, Israeli sources reported that the operation had concluded, with approximately 20 different targets struck. 'In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran,' Hagari said as the operation was unfolding. 'The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7 – on seven fronts – including direct attacks from Iranian soil. Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond. Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized. We will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel.' Video: Israeli strikes in Tehran.

The IDF announced that all air force planes returned safely to their bases in Israel following the operation, codenamed 'Days of Repentance'. The multi-wave assault lasted several hours, targeting missile production facilities that threatened Israel, air defense installations that could restrict Air Force freedom of operation, and ground-to-ground missile launchers.

The military campaign quickly expanded to include multiple waves of attacks targeting missile production facilities, air defense systems, and ground-to-ground missile launchers across several regions in Iran, including Isfahan, Mashhad, and Kurdistan. Dozens of fighter jets, intelligence aircraft, and refueling planes participated in the operation, striking targets more than 1,600 kilometers (1,200 miles) from Israel. The IDF confirmed that all aircraft returned safely to their bases following the mission's completion. The White House acknowledged the operation, stating they understood Israel was conducting focused strikes against military targets in Iran as an act of self-defense. During the operation, US Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden, who was at his private residence in Delaware, received regular updates on the developments. Explosion in Iran.

Iraq also suspended civilian aviation operations across all its airports during the operation. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari later announced the completion of Israel's response to Iran's attacks, emphasizing that the military had successfully neutralized immediate threats to Israel. He warned that any further escalation by Iran would be met with a decisive response, demonstrating Israel's capability to act decisively anywhere in the Middle East. The operation was unanimously approved by Israel's Diplomatic-Security Cabinet, with the US receiving advance notice hours before the aircraft departed. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin maintained communication throughout the operation to coordinate ongoing efforts.

Report: This is why Israel's strike was limited	A senior official with direct knowledge of Israel's military strategy revealed that the country deliberately calibrated its recent strike on Iran to provide Tehran with room for a measured response, according to reporting by Washington Post. A page on the Flightradar24 website, taken in Nicosia early on October 26, 2024, displaying commercial flights around Iran's airspace (AFP) AFP The strike was carefully orchestrated to minimize casualties while allowing Iranian authorities to downplay its significance, according to a person briefed on Israel's strategic planning, speaking to Washington Post on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information. 'Iran's power humiliates the enemies of the motherland,' First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref wrote on social media, exemplifying Tehran's restrained official response to the incident. The operation represented an expanded version of Israel's April response to Iran's missile and drone barrage, the anonymous source told the Washington Post. During that earlier exchange, Iranian officials had maintained that Israel's strike in central Iran caused no damage. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement condemning the Israeli action, describing it as 'a violation of its sovereignty and a violation of international laws and norms.' The ministry urged all parties to exercise restraint, warning that the widening Middle East conflict 'threatens the security and stability of the countries and people of the region.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/26/sources-this-is-why-israels-strike-was-limited/	2024-10-25T15:36:09-07:00	
US confirms prior knowledge of Israel's air strikes on Iran	The White House confirmed on Friday that it was informed in advance about Israel's air strikes targeting military sites in Iran, according to a US defense official who spoke to AFP. The Israeli attack, which lasted for hours before sunrise in Tehran, targeted military sites, including manufacturing facilities used to produce missiles, ground-to-air missile sites, and additional Iranian air capabilities. A general view of Tehran after several explosions were heard, in Tehran, Iran, October 26, 2024 (Majid Asgaripour (West Asia News Agency)) Majid Asgaripour (West Asia News Agency) The Israeli military described the action as 'precise strikes on military targets' in Iran, characterizing it as an 'exercise of self-defense' in response to ongoing attacks by the Iranian regime against Israel. This indicates that Israel views these strikes as necessary measures to protect its national security interests against perceived threats from Iran. This notice to the United States came after weeks of discussions about avoiding strikes on Iran that could ignite a wider regional conflict, particularly following US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent visit to the Middle East. In recent weeks, senior US officials have made their views clear that Israel's response, both in terms of nature and targeted locations, should avoid being unnecessarily escalatory, urging caution to prevent exacerbating regional tensions. Senior US officials have also stated that Israel's response should not affect the global economy, according to a source familiar with the discussions. US President Joe Biden is currently in Wilmington, Delaware. Joe Biden's advisers do not plan to meet in the Situation Room at this time.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/26/us-confirms-prior-knowledge-of-israels-air-strikes-on-tehran-military-sites/	2024-10-25T15:04:15-07:00	
IDF reveals close ties between Hamas, Al-Jazeera	After the IDF released the names of six journalists from Al-Jazeera who were also operatives for Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, the IDF's Arabic spokesperson, revealed documents related to the issue. Among the revelations, Lt. Col. Adraee disclosed documents indicating that Al-Jazeera was forbidden from criticizing Hamas, including hiding instances of failed rocket launches and establishing a secure communication line between Hamas and the Qatari channel. The Al-Jazeera-Hamas Documents. Photo: IDF Spokesperson Adraee added: 'In a 2022 document, Hamas outlined how it provided Al-Jazeera with clear instructions for covering a failed rocket launch by Islamic Jihad in Jabalia, which resulted in the deaths of several civilians. The directives included not using the word 'massacre' to describe the event, minimizing the display of images from the scene, and preventing panel members from criticizing Hamas.' The Al-Jazeera-Hamas Documents. Photo: IDF Spokesperson Another document from the same year reveals the guidance Hamas gave to journalist Tamer Almisshall while covering Islamic Jihad activities during Operation 'Breaking Dawn' on his program 'Much Remains Hidden'. He was instructed to support the 'resistance' in Gaza and to avoid criticizing the rocket capabilities of the terror organization despite the high number of failed launches. The Al-Jazeera-Hamas Documents. Photo: IDF Spokesperson A 2023 document shows that Hamas decided to establish the 'Al-Jazeera Phone'—a secure line that would allow the organization to communicate with the channel in a classified manner and during emergencies. The documents demonstrate how Hamas manipulates the channel's media coverage to serve its own interests, preventing the public in Gaza and worldwide from discovering the truth about its crimes against the people of Gaza. Qatar's Prime Minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, responded to the revelation that six journalists from the Qatari channel 'Al-Jazeera' are operatives for Hamas and Islamic Jihad. He stated that Qatar is proud of the channel and its coverage of global conflicts: 'Al-Jazeera operates according to the highest international standards. There is no justification for attacking journalists, and the excuses for it are unacceptable.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/23/idf-reveals-close-ties-between-hamas-and-al-jazeera/	2024-10-23T11:55:17-07:00	
7 arrested in Iran plot to assassinate Israeli nuclear scientist,...	A new espionage case has come to light today (Tuesday), involving seven east Jerusalem residents who were arrested in September. The suspects are accused of planning serious attacks, including assassinations targeting a senior nuclear scientist and a mayor in central Israel. According to investigators, the cell was promised approximately $55,000 for the assassinations. The primary suspect, a 23-year-old from Beit Safafa, confessed during interrogation to establishing contact with an Iranian operative, acknowledging he was working with an enemy state. He admitted to receiving funds from the Iranians and passing crucial information to the cell while recruiting relatives for various missions. According to his testimony, his motives were nationalistic, and he sought to harm the state. He also stated that his connection with the Iranian operative made him feel empowered. The counterfeit police license plate. Photo credit: Israel Police Israel Police During searches of the suspects' homes, police seized approximately $14,000, a counterfeit police license plate, and numerous credit cards. The suspects, aged 19-23, began with relatively simple tasks such as spray-painting graffiti before progressing to more dangerous missions. Their activities included setting fire to two vehicles in Jerusalem, attempting to attack police vehicles, and planning to throw a grenade at a soldier's home – an operation that was ultimately not carried out. As part of their assigned tasks, the suspects spray-painted graffiti associated with the hostages' protest slogans, including messages such as '[Bring them home] now.' Despite his involvement, the suspect was not active in known Iranian groups, and no security-sensitive materials were found in his possession. Prosecutors plan to charge him with aiding an enemy during wartime, along with terrorism-related charges based on his actions and confessions during interrogation. Investigators discovered that the suspects knew the soldier whose home they planned to attack with a grenade. One cell member was acquainted with the Jewish soldier in Jerusalem, and they had begun planning the attack and acquired grenades, but the plot was thwarted before execution. The cell had reached advanced stages of weapons acquisition, including grenades and firearms, intended for attacks against civilians and property. Their primary assigned missions included assassinating a mayor of a city in central Israel and a senior Israeli nuclear scientist, aiming to demonstrate their capability to conduct such operations against Israel. Each suspect has been linked to various incidents, with some facing more serious charges than others. The method of recruitment – whether through online means or other channels – remains under investigation. Indictments are expected tomorrow, including serious charges of aiding an enemy during wartime and conspiracy to commit attacks. Further investigation revealed no involvement of Turkish or Russian entities, unlike in other cases. The connection was directly between the Iranian operative and the cell's main operative. Regarding the planned assassination of the mayor, the cell received detailed information from the Iranian contact and conducted field surveillance. They managed to gather information about their target but were arrested before executing their plan. The investigation also revealed that the Iranian representative did not seek information about Israel's nuclear facility but intended to demonstrate Iran's ability to target Israeli officials, hence ordering the assassination of a senior nuclear scientist. The suspects, arrested in Beit Safafa, had no prior security or criminal records and were not affiliated with known organizations. Credit cards that were seized from the suspects. Photo credit: Israel Police Israel Police Investigators learned that some suspects approached the senior scientist's residence and, for approximately $140, photographed the location to facilitate the planned assassination. While financial gain wasn't the sole motivation, the young suspects acted on nationalistic grounds, receiving minimal compensation for basic tasks. They understood the implications of their actions and the risk to national security. Upon completing the investigation, prosecutors gathered sufficient evidence against the suspects and filed a prosecutor's statement earlier this week. Their detention has been extended until Oct. 24, and the Jerusalem District Attorney's Office is expected to file indictments for serious security offenses. According to a senior Shin Bet official, 'Intelligence gathered by the security establishment indicates that scientists, mayors, senior defense officials, and other Israeli officials are targeted by Iranian entities.' This investigation once again exposes Iran's efforts to recruit and exploit Israeli citizens and residents, including east Jerusalem residents, to advance attacks in Israel. Israel's security agencies, including the Shin Bet and Israel Police, will continue their collaborative efforts to detect Iranian activity and prosecute all those involved in such operations to the fullest extent of the law. The police stated: 'The Jerusalem District Police and the Shin Bet continue to focus their counterterrorism efforts against threats at all times and locations, working to protect Israeli citizens. In recent days, following another joint investigation, an indictment was filed against a suspect from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in east Jerusalem, who had planned an attack against hostages' families protesters in Tel Aviv.' It was revealed on Monday that seven Jewish Israelis, including two minors, have been detained since September on suspicion of spying for Iran. They allegedly operated for hundreds of thousands of shekels, and today prosecutors filed a statement requesting their detention until the end of proceedings. Security officials are still trying to understand how they operated under the radar for about two years without detection by the Shin Bet, IDF, police, and Mossad.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/22/7-east-jerusalem-residents-arrested-in-iran-directed-plot-to-assassinate-israeli-nuclear-scientist-mayor/	2024-10-21T23:00:15-07:00	
Oct. 7 survivor found dead on her birthday	Hundreds attended Monday's funeral, including numerous Nova festival survivors, to pay their last respects to Shirel Golan, who passed away on her 22nd birthday. Her family revealed that her mental state had deteriorated after surviving Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 massacre. They maintain that despite suffering from PTSD, she received neither treatment nor support from the state. At the cemetery, Nova survivors displayed a banner reading: 'Shirel was murdered on October 7, yet remained alive until today. Thousands of souls died and survived that day.' After reciting the Kaddish [Jewish mourning prayer], her father Meir said: 'Shirel, rest in peace. You had a difficult year. The National Insurance Institute and the state failed to help you. Let the state know there are 3,000 more Nova survivors who need help. May you be the last Nova casualty.' Mourners at the funeral of Shirel Golan, a Nova festival survivor who was found dead on her birthday. Photo credit: KOKO קוקו Her brother Eyal eulogized: 'Shirel didn't end her life – she was murdered. She was murdered twice, first spiritually on Oct. 7. While she escaped the terrorists that day, she couldn't survive the crushing weight of bureaucratic failure. No one saw you, Shirel, except Mom and Dad. Where is our beloved state of Israel? Wake up. Shirel, I swear your case will become a turning point for all Nova survivors… We won't allow another Nova survivor to endure what Shirel suffered.' Her brother Lior said: 'Shirel, I loved you more than anything in the world. You were beautiful and talented. If she had received help, we probably wouldn't be here today. A family cannot cope with something like this alone.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/22/oct-7-survivor-found-dead-on-her-birthday/	2024-10-21T20:30:22-07:00
