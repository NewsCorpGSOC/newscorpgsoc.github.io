Source says Iran to 'pay heavy price' for attempt on Netanyahu's ...	As Israel braces for a tense week ahead, officials are now pointing the finger at Iran for Saturday's attempted drone strike on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea, even as the country deliberates its response to a recent Iranian attack. First responders in Caesarea in northern Israel (Photo: Shmuel Buchris) Shmuel Buchris While Hezbollah launched the drone from Lebanon, a diplomatic source told Israel Hayom that Iran is ultimately responsible. 'Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy, so Iran bears responsibility for this incident as well,' the source said, adding, 'There will be consequences for the attempt on Prime Minister Netanyahu's life.' The threats against the prime minister are well-known to security services, prompting frequent changes to his locations over the past year. However, the shift from threats to an actual attempt crosses a red line that Israel won't ignore. Senior officials told Israel Hayom, 'We've long known that Iran and Hezbollah wanted to target the prime minister, but this attempt breaks all the rules. It's an assassination attempt on the prime minister, and Iran will pay a heavy price for it, sooner or later.' All eyes in Israel and the US are on Israel's next move. Even before the attempt on Netanyahu, US President Joe Biden had called for a measured response to Iran's Oct. 1 missile attack on Israel, which was meant as a retaliation for alleged Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil in late July and the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in late September. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit Israel this week to discuss the ongoing Gaza campaign following the elimination of Sinwar, as well as other fronts. The attempt by Iran's proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake. This will not deter me or the State of Israel from continuing our just war against our enemies in order to secure our future. I say to Iran and its proxies in its axis of evil:… — Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) October 19, 2024 Responding to the drone attack, Netanyahu said, 'Iran's proxies who tried to assassinate me and my wife today made a grave error. This won't deter me or Israel from continuing our war of resurgence against our enemies to secure our future. I tell Iran and its partners in the axis of evil: Anyone who harms Israeli citizens will pay dearly.' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated, 'The attempt on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his family aims to strike at Israel and its government symbols. Our defense system will continue to target any terror element and hit hard any enemy that has harmed or tries to harm Israel. Our actions across the Middle East have proven this and will continue to do so. Israel is advancing on all war fronts – dismantling Hamas, significantly reducing Hezbollah's capabilities, and eliminating the terror leaders who waged war on us. Hezbollah's attempts to deter us and prevent us from achieving our war goals will fail.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/20/source-says-iran-will-face-consequences-for-attempt-on-netanyahus-life/	2024-10-20T00:00:03-07:00	
How to see deleted messages on WhatsApp	Have you ever received a message on WhatsApp, only for it to be deleted right after? It turns out that on many Galaxy devices, you can still view the content of the deleted message. The catch: you can't have received more than seven notifications since the message was originally sent. WhatsApp's message deletion feature, introduced in 2017, allows users to delete sent messages, both from their own chat and the recipient's, within a limited time frame. This option applies to both private chats and group conversations. When a message is completely deleted, it is replaced with the text 'This message was deleted' for all participants in the chat.

Did Sinwar's wife go into hiding with Birkin bag?	The discovery of what seems to be a luxury Hermès Birkin handbag in the possession of eliminated Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's wife has sparked controversy amidst the ongoing war in Gaza. The high-end accessory, potentially worth tens of thousands of dollars, was spotted in images of released by the IDF on Saturday evening, showing Sinwar, his wife, and children, going underground on Oct. 6, the evening before the massacre. The image has raised questions about the lifestyle of Hamas leadership in contrast to the conditions faced by regular Gazans. Video: Sinwar and his family going underground on Oct. 6 / Credit: IDF Spokesperson's Unit Social media platforms buzzed with activity following the release of photos from Gaza's underground tunnels. The leather masterpiece, inspired by fashion icon and actress Jane Birkin, stands as one of the world's most prestigious and desired handbags. It has evolved into a global emblem of status, reflecting affluence, prominence, and refined taste. Crafted through a meticulous six-stage process, each Birkin requires approximately 20 hours of skilled handiwork, commanding exorbitant prices. Acquiring a Birkin from a Hermès boutique is no simple feat. Prospective owners must cultivate strong relationships with the brand's staff and invest in other Hermès products – such as silk scarves, timepieces, and footwear – before they might 'earn' the privilege of purchasing the illustrious accessory. While it's possible that the bag glimpsed in the tunnel images could be a replica or imitation, this caveat has done little to quell the fervent discussions among netizens.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/20/did-sinwars-wife-go-underground-with-birkin-bag/	2024-10-19T18:30:22-07:00	
Biden: We know when and how Israel will strike Iran	President Biden spoke to reporters this evening (Friday), commenting on Israel's anticipated response to the Iranian missile attack earlier this month. When asked if he has a good understanding of the when and how of Israel's response, Biden responded with 'Yes, and yes', but refrained from giving additional information. Video: President Joe Biden addressed Israel's response to the Iranian missile strikes earlier this month The President also remarked that while there is a chance to promote a ceasefire in Lebanon, reaching such an agreement in the Gaza Strip is expected to be much harder. Biden's statements follow his conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday and after a senior Israeli official said today that there will be an Israeli response in Iran soon.

New details emerge on Sinwar's elimination, physical state	Forensic experts at the National Center of Forensic Medicine (Abu Kabir) have concluded their meticulous examination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was successfully eliminated by IDF troops on Thursday. In a move that hints at strategic considerations, the remains were promptly transferred to an undisclosed site, fueling speculation about their potential role in future negotiations.

The primary cause of death appears to be a long-range gunshot wound to the head, executed with sniper-like precision. However, this was not the only mark of violence on the body. Examiners noted additional trauma consistent with shell impact, and the corpse was riddled with shrapnel fragments after the house where he was staying was fired upon by a tank. Video: Footage from an IDF drone showing Yahya Sinwar moments before his elimination Surprisingly, despite the harsh conditions of underground warfare, Sinwar's body showed no signs of malnourishment. Weighing in at 152 pounds, it appears that even while orchestrating operations from hidden tunnels, the Hamas leader maintained access to adequate nutrition. In addition, the forensic team found no evidence of significant health deterioration attributable to Sinwar's extended periods in subterranean hideouts. As the investigation continues, toxicology reports, which could reveal the presence of any drugs or medications in Sinwar's system at the time of his death, are still being processed.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/18/new-details-emerge-on-sinwars-elimination-physical-state/	2024-10-17T23:52:30-07:00	
Outrageous interference': Lebanese PM furious with Iran	Lebanon's interim Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, expressed anger today (Friday) over Iran's interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. This reaction followed a statement from the Iranian parliament speaker, who suggested that Tehran is willing to negotiate with France regarding the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701. According to the 2006 resolution, Hezbollah is required to withdraw its forces to the Litani River in southern Lebanon. 'We were surprised by the comments from Iranian parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who said that Tehran is prepared to negotiate with France on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701,' Mikati said. 'This position is an outrageous interference in Lebanon's affairs and an unacceptable attempt to impose unwarranted guardianship over Lebanon.' Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf. Photo: EPA He emphasized that 'any negotiations regarding the UN resolution should be conducted by the Lebanese state, and everyone is required to support this effort, not seek to impose new patrons who are rejected in every national and sovereign sense.' Mikati noted that Lebanon had informed Iranian parliamentary and foreign ministry delegations during their visits that they must 'understand Lebanon's situation, especially given that the country is facing unprecedented Israeli aggression. We are working with all of Lebanon's friends - including France - to pressure Israel into agreeing to a ceasefire.' Lebanese commentator Mohammad Ali al-Husseini also reacted to Ghalibaf's remarks, writing, 'Ghalibaf's audacity reveals the behavior of the Iranian regime, which is always ready to negotiate with the West to secure its own benefits. Tehran's claim that it is ready to negotiate with France over Resolution 1701 and the cessation of the war in Lebanon means that Iran is controlling the conflict at the expense of Lebanese blood. Iran, the merchant, has already sold out Hezbollah once and is prepared to sell it again to preserve its regime's stability.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/18/outrageous-interference-lebanese-prime-minister-furious-with-iran/	2024-10-17T20:03:36-07:00	
Israel yet to release damaging info on UNRWA despite evidence	Several months after conclusive evidence was found linking the UNRWA agency to Hamas, Israel's political leadership has still not directed the IDF and its intelligence agencies to release the 'damaging materials' on the UN refugee agency. This was confirmed to Israel Hayom by a well-placed source. According to this source, this is why the State of Israel has not yet launched an official public relations campaign against UNRWA. It also explains why even the United States opposes legislation intended to sever ties between Israel and the agency. Yesterday, an UNRWA staff ID was found on the body of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar after his elimination. This is just one more piece of evidence in a long series proving the close connection and collaboration between Hamas and UNRWA. During the war in Gaza, a direct link was uncovered between UNRWA's headquarters in the Rimal neighborhood and Hamas computer labs located directly underneath it. Additionally, a principal of an UNRWA school in Lebanon was found to be the commander of Hamas' Lebanon branch and a member of the organization's external political bureau. For years, Israel has known that UNRWA plays a central role in perpetuating the conflict between the Arabs of Israel and the State of Israel. Despite the intelligence community's possession of this information, the Prime Minister and the government have yet to instruct the IDF or other relevant agencies to distribute these damaging materials to various public relations and policy-making bodies. IDF Soldiers at UNRWA Headquarters in Gaza (Archive), Photo: Reuters Without such directives, the IDF has kept the information to itself. It has not been shared domestically or internationally, neither with policymakers nor with local or international media outlets. As a result, the international community remains largely unaware of the reasons behind the pending legislation in the Knesset to sever ties between Israel and UNRWA. This may explain Hungary and the Czech Republic's decision yesterday to block the European Union from issuing a unified statement against the UN agency. It should be noted that Prime Minister Netanyahu has not yet taken a firm public stance in favor of shutting down UNRWA. Instead, he has stated that alternatives should be found to replace it in Gaza. However, to date, Netanyahu has not taken steps to delay the legislation that is expected to pass in the Knesset immediately after the holidays. According to diplomatic sources, a statement was prepared by the European External Action Service and circulated among member states for approval. Two of Israel's closest allies in the European Union refused to support it. Since EU decisions require consensus, this blocked the condemnation of Israel. One diplomatic source commented, 'The Czech Republic indeed holds views similar to those of the current Israeli government. Nevertheless, it's surprising that the Czech Republic would oppose a statement aimed at ensuring the continued functioning of the UN refugee agency as part of upholding international humanitarian law.' Since the beginning of the conflict, there have been numerous shifts in positions on the issue of UNRWA funding among EU member states, even within the European Commission itself. 'We are talking about the only institution that provides assistance to Gaza on such a scale,' the diplomatic source added. The Czech Foreign Ministry confirmed that it had indeed opposed the statement, mainly because 'we cannot predict the final wording of the proposed law.' This is the second time in recent days that the Czech Republic has vetoed an EU statement. A few days ago, Prague opposed a European declaration criticizing Israel's military actions in Lebanon. As a result, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who is soon to step down, had to issue a statement in his own name rather than on behalf of all EU member states. So far, there has been no response from the Israeli Prime Minister's Office.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/18/israel-yet-to-release-damaging-info-on-unrwa-despite-evidence/	2024-10-17T20:00:27-07:00	
Watch: dramatic footage of Sinwar's elimination	The IDF spokesperson unveiled new details and footage from the elimination of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas and the chief architect of the October 7 massacre. Video: Footage from an IDF drone showing Yahya Sinwar moments before his elimination In a video, captured by an Israeli drone, shows Sinwar sitting on a couch inside a destroyed building. Upon noticing the drone hovering above, Sinwar, who had already lost his hand from earlier gunfire, attempts to throw a piece of wood at the drone in a futile effort to knock it down.

In his statement, the IDF spokesperson said: 'For months, IDF and Shin Bet forces have been working to gather intelligence in order to eliminate Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the Hamas terrorist organization and one of the founders of its military wing. Sinwar had been hiding in an area our forces surrounded for an extended period. We didn't know he was there, but we continued to act with determination. The forces found Sinwar with a vest, a pistol, and 40,000 shekels in cash. He tried to flee, and our forces eliminated him.' Sinwar's belongings: This Is What the IDF forces found near his body. 'There were no hostages with the terrorists we eliminated,' the spokesperson clarified. 'The forces are now scanning the area and are proceeding with the necessary caution.' Regarding Sinwar's presence in the Rafah tunnel where the bodies of the six hostages, who were murdered in captivity, were discovered, he added: 'After an investigation, we can confirm that Sinwar's DNA was found in an underground tunnel, a few hundred meters from the tunnel where the hostages were killed.' 'We had known Sinwar's estimated location for some time despite the high level of secrecy that Hamas employed regarding his whereabouts,' military sources stated. 'We knew he had been in Rafah, and we have been extracting information from underground tunnels there to understand where he was.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/18/watch-dramatic-footage-of-sinwars-elimination/	2024-10-17T14:14:36-07:00	
British elites are in complete denial about attempts to Islamize...	Borrowing from the Israeli discourse after Oct. 7, Jewish-British journalist Melanie Phillips (73) is one of the UK's earliest and most famous 'disillusioned' figures: from being a senior left-wing journalist and a 'Jew by accident,' to becoming a fighter for neo-conservative values in the West and an outspoken pro-Israel voice. Lebanon, now in the spotlight of both the conflict and media attention, played a crucial role in Phillips' process of leaving the British left. 'The first time I was exposed to the hypocrisy towards Israel in the world press was in 1982, when the First Lebanon War began,' she recalled. 'I hadn't visited Israel before, had no such plans, and didn't know much about the Israeli-Arab conflict. To my shock, the coverage in the British press portrayed Israel as a Nazi state. I'll never forget how Ariel Sharon, then defense minister, was described as a Nazi general and mass murderer. Out of nowhere, and for the first time since the Holocaust, displays of antisemitism towards Jews in Britain began to emerge, claiming that we, British Jews, support a state that is committing 'genocide' against Palestinians in Lebanon. 'At that time, I was a senior writer at The Guardian. I asked my colleagues – educated and wonderful people on a personal level who advocate moral principles – how it was that a shocking tragedy in the Middle East, where the army of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad murdered between 25,000 and 40,000 people in the city of Hama in Syria, received a side headline in our newspaper, while Israeli attacks against Palestinians in Lebanon received front-page headlines and extensive coverage. 'We have a double standard towards Israel,' I told them.' The answer she heard changed her life: 'Of course we have a double standard,' her colleagues explained. 'Israel is a Western country, so we judge you by our morals, while from the Arab world, which wasn't educated on human rights values, we don't have similar expectations. If we made such a comparison, it would be racism on our part.' Phillips replied: 'What are you talking about? If someone claims that Arabs can't be expected to be as moral as the West, in my eyes, that's racism.' People carry a huge Palestinian flag during a pro-Palestinian rally in Rome, Italy, 12 October 2024. Photo credit: EPA/Fabio Frustaci EPA This conversation was a turning point for her: 'The left revealed itself as fundamentally racist. This realization stunned me. They weren't the moral knights I thought they were. Although it took me time to part ways with The Guardian and the left, in retrospect, this was the moment when my previous world began to crumble.' Beyond the ideological debate, Phillips realized that in her colleagues' eyes, she was a Jew representing Israel, and accordingly, they addressed her with expressions like 'you' and 'you all.' The series of attacks on the London Underground on July 7, 2005, sent shockwaves through the UK. Four Al-Qaeda terrorists with British citizenship detonated bombs in three train stations, killing about 52 people and injuring about 700. This tragedy catalyzed the publication of Phillips' most famous book in 2006: 'Londonistan: How Britain Created a Terror State Within.' Despite being published by a small, unknown publishing house, the book quickly became a bestseller in Britain and the US. 'The major publishing houses in Britain boycotted me and refused to publish my books,' Phillips explained. ''Londonistan' sparked a wide public debate on the integration of Muslim immigrants in Britain and the West's failure to address the internal Muslim threat, not only in terms of terrorism but also on the cultural front.' Q: 18 years after the publication of 'Londonistan,' how do you view the current attitude of the British elites towards Muslim immigration? 'The situation hasn't improved but worsened, in the sense that they're still in complete denial of the religious component of the attempts to Islamize the West, which is essentially jihad. On the other hand, in the general public, people understand that this is a terrible problem that only gets worse year by year. One can't ignore the fact that in France, there's a phenomenon of churches being deliberately and symbolically burned by Muslims, and that entire communities essentially function as enclaves operating under Sharia law.' Police secure the area on the south side of Westminster Bridge close to the Houses of Parliament in London after a man drove his rented SUV into pedestrians at London's Westminster Bridge, killing four people and stabbing a police officer to death on March 22, 2017. Photo credit: AP Photo/Matt Dunham AP 'I still hold the same values' 'When asked about my transition from left to right,' Phillips said, 'I emphasize that I still hold the same values that have always guided me: giving voice to the weak against the centers of power, presenting the truth against lies, and going where the evidence leads me. I'm simply a Jew who believes in tikkun olam [a concept in Judaism about healing the world] and a journalist who believes in telling the truth. In many ways, I haven't changed; I just realized over time that the environment that surrounded me, those I thought were with me 'on the same front,' were never really there.' An example of Phillips' approach in British media can be seen from her appearance in March on the BBC's long-running program, 'Question Time.' Phillips argued that Israel is not systematically starving Gaza residents as a means of warfare. The audience reacted with astonishment, some even with overt laughter. Panel members and the program's host also expressed opposition to her statements. Q: At times it seemed like everyone there was against you. 'When you see how a story like the Palestinian narrative, which is entirely based on lies, receives such support in the West, you understand the power of the intellectual and moral degeneration that has struck its elites, in Britain and in general. 'Palestinianism,' the Palestinian ideology aimed at fighting Israel, plays a much more central role today compared to other destructive ideologies: it's a moral cancer at the heart of Western civilization. It has distorted collective logic by paralyzing our ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and has emasculated the West from defending its way of life.' The full interview will be published in Makor Rishon in the coming days.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/15/british-elites-are-in-complete-denial-about-attempts-to-islamize-the-west/	2024-10-14T23:00:03-07:00	
PM said to tell Biden IDF would only target Iran military sites	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated to the Biden administration that Israel is considering a more measured response to Iran's recent missile attack, targeting military infrastructure rather than nuclear or oil facilities, officials familiar with the matter have told The Washington Post. According to the report, Netanyahu conveyed this intention during a phone call with President Joe Biden on Wednesday, their first conversation in over seven weeks amid reported rising tensions between the two leaders. The Israeli prime minister stated he was planning to target military sites in Iran, according to a US official and another official familiar with the discussion, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the talks. The remains of an Iranian missile launched at Israel, Oct. 2, 2024, Arad (Erik Marmor/Getty ImagesErik Marmor/Getty Images) Erik Marmor/Getty ImagesErik Marmor/Getty Images The White House has not provided immediate comment on the matter. In a statement, the Prime Minister's Office said, 'We listen to the opinions of the United States, but we will make our final decisions based on our national interest.' Sources indicate that the proposed retaliatory action would be calibrated to avoid the perception of 'political interference in the US elections,' signaling Netanyahu's awareness of the potential impact on the presidential race. An Israeli strike on Iranian oil facilities could lead to a surge in energy prices, while targeting the country's nuclear research program might eliminate remaining boundaries in Israel's conflict with Tehran, potentially drawing the US into a more direct military role. The apparent moderation in Netanyahu's stance reportedly influenced Biden's decision to deploy a powerful missile defense system to Israel. On Sunday, the Pentagon announced the deployment of its anti-ballistic THAAD battery system, along with approximately 100 US military personnel, to Israel. The system is expected to arrive in the coming days, underscoring 'the United States' ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel,' according to the Pentagon statement. An official familiar with the matter stated that the Israeli strike on Iran would likely occur before the US elections on Nov. 5, as inaction could be interpreted by Iran as a sign of weakness. 'It will be one in a series of responses,' the official added.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/15/netanyahu-tells-biden-israel-to-target-iran-military-sites-not-nuclear-or-oil-facilities/	2024-10-14T22:11:16-07:00	
Quds Force chief appears in public, ending speculation	Putting an end to weeks of speculation about his fate, Esmail Ghaani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, made a public appearance at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport early Tuesday. His presence dispels rumors of his death or injury that had circulated following an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs in late September. In the pre-dawn hours of Tuesday, Esmail Ghaani, commander of Iran's Quds Force, was spotted at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport. He was there to receive the body of Abbas Nilforoushan, a high-ranking official of the organization in Lebanon, who was killed alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. People attend the funeral ceremony of Iranian Revolutionary Guards' (IRGC) deputy commander Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan who was killed in the Israeli strikes on Beirut, in Tehran, Iran, October 15, 2024 (Photo: Majid Asgaripour/WANA/Reuters) via REUTERS An Israeli strike targeted the southern Beirut neighborhood of Dahieh in late September, reportedly aimed at Hashem Safieddine, the designated successor to Hezbollah's secretary-general. Israeli intelligence suggests that Nasrallah's intended heir was eliminated in the operation. In the days following the strike, unverified reports emerged suggesting Ghaani had been killed or wounded. Iranian sources later confirmed to Reuters that Ghaani had been in Beirut in the period leading up to the aerial bombardment of the underground bunker. Subsequently, Revolutionary Guards spokespersons asserted that he was unharmed. More recently, reports from Sky News and the Middle East Eye website alleged that Ghaani was under investigation by the Revolutionary Guards. According to Sky News sources, Ghaani was being questioned about a suspected intelligence leak and had reportedly been hospitalized after suffering a heart attack. Iranian officials once again refuted these claims. A correspondent for the Lebanese channel Al-Mayadeen, reporting from Iran, stated that Tehran had deliberately released live footage of Ghaani to counter what it called 'completely false narratives' about him circulated by certain media outlets. The public appearance of Ghaani at Mehrabad Airport seems to be a calculated move by Iranian authorities to quash rumors and demonstrate the Quds Force commander's continued active role in the country's military leadership.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/15/iranian-quds-force-chief-appears-in-public-ending-speculation/	2024-10-14T20:00:32-07:00	
Model, ex-minister, defense chief's janitor: The Israelis who bec...	In recent years, Israel has faced an increasing number of espionage attempts orchestrated by Iranian intelligence services, ranging from social media manipulation to the recruitment of Israeli citizens. Vladislav Viktorson (Free usage under Israeli copyright law (Section 27A) Most recently, 30-year-old Vladislav Viktorson, from Ramat Gan, was detained for questioning in connection with alleged espionage activities conducted with his partner, Anna Bernstein. The investigation reveals that Viktorson was reportedly tasked with sabotaging communication infrastructure and ATMs, as well as setting forests ablaze, for a sum of approximately $5,000. Investigators claim Viktorson even agreed to carry out an assassination of a high-profile figure in Israel and to lob a grenade at a residence. The probe uncovered that since last August, Viktorson had been in contact via social media with an individual using the name 'Mari Hossi.' Their exchanges were conducted in Hebrew. Anna Bernstein (Instagram) As part of this connection, Viktorson allegedly performed various tasks under the guidance of the Iranian operative, fully aware of their identity. These tasks included graffiti, poster hanging, money planting, and even torching vehicles in Tel Aviv's Yarkon Park area. Subsequently, Viktorson was reportedly instructed to sabotage communication infrastructure and ATMs, and to ignite forest fires. Some of these missions were documented, with payments exceeding $5,000 received for their execution. The investigation also suggests that Viktorson worked to procure weapons, including a sniper rifle, pistols, and fragmentation grenades. Bernstein, an 18-year-old Ramat Gan resident, who works as a model, allegedly participated in some of the missions. Moti Maman (Dudu Grushpan) In a separate case, Moti Maman, a 72-year-old Ashkelon resident, was apprehended in August 2024 in a joint operation by the Shin Bet security agency and Israel Police. He faces serious espionage charges. The indictment reveals that Maman had a criminal history, including five previous convictions for various offenses such as extortion and tax evasion, with his most recent conviction in 2013. According to the charges, the Israeli-Jewish businessman, who had resided in Turkey for an extended period, was recruited by Iranian intelligence agents. He allegedly agreed – through Turkish intermediaries – to meet with an Iran-based businessman, ostensibly to promote business activities. For this purpose, Maman traveled to Samangad, Turkey, where he met with two representatives sent on the businessman's behalf. The three held a phone conversation with the businessman, who was unable to leave Iran. The indictment charges Maman with offenses against state security, including contact with a foreign agent and entering an enemy state without authorization. Similarly, last July, the Shin Bet and the Israel Police's Unit of International Crime Investigations, known in Hebrew by its acronym Yahbal, arrested three Israeli citizens. They were suspected of planting money-filled packages and hanging posters in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv under the direction of Iranian intelligence agents. The Shin Bet and Yahbal investigation exposed a network of Iranian intelligence operatives who, disguised as foreign entities, approached Israeli citizens to recruit and deploy them for missions within Israel. One of the citizens faces charges of contact with a foreign agent. Elimelech Stern, a 21-year-old Vizhnitz Hassid from Beit Shemesh, was suspected of communicating with a Telegram profile named 'ANNA ELENA'. Iranian operatives allegedly tasked him with various missions, such as hanging posters in Tel Aviv, planting money at different locations in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, setting a forest on fire, and delivering packages containing a severed animal head or doll (along with a knife and threatening message) to be placed at Israeli citizens' doorsteps. The investigation revealed that Stern agreed to most tasks, excluding murder and forest arson. To accomplish the poster hanging, money planting, and package deliveries, he recruited two other Israeli citizens, who carried out some of the missions for financial compensation. Stern received cryptocurrency payments from ANNA ELENA for completing the tasks. Gonen Segev (Flash 90) In 2022, a complex case of Iranian attempts to recruit spies from among Iranian expatriates in Israel came to light. The operation used a fake Facebook account under the name 'Rambod Namdar,' posing as an Iranian Jew interested in immigrating to Israel. The account contacted dozens of people, mainly Jewish women of Iranian descent, building trust through lengthy conversations. Gradually, 'Rambod' requested various tasks, including photographing Israeli sites and transferring money. In November 2021, five suspects were arrested and brought to trial in the Jerusalem District Court. The case shocked Israel's Persian community and exposed Iran's sophisticated methods for infiltrating Israeli systems. However, during the trial, most defendants were acquitted, with only one convicted of contact with a foreign agent. Nahum Manbar (Yehoshua Yosef) In 2018, Gonen Segev, a former energy ministry, was arrested on suspicion of spying for Iran. Segev, who served as a minister in Israel during the 1990s, was convicted of severe espionage and providing information to the enemy. Recruited by the Iranian embassy in Nigeria, he provided information on strategic facilities, the security system, and Israeli officials. Segev was ultimately sentenced to 11 years in prison as part of a plea bargain. The Shin Bet stated that Segev, who resided in Nigeria, was transferred to Israel from Equatorial Guinea in May 2018 after being denied entry due to his criminal record. He was immediately arrested upon arrival in Israel. The investigation revealed that Segev had been recruited by Iranian intelligence in 2012, meeting his handlers in Iran and various locations worldwide. He passed information related to Israel's energy sector, security sites, and political and security officials. Segev also attempted to connect Israeli citizens to Iranian intelligence agents under the guise of business opportunities. Omri Goren In 1997, Nahum Manbar, an Israeli businessman, was arrested on suspicion of maintaining connections with Iran. Manbar was convicted of aiding the enemy after selling secrets about nerve gas production to Iran. And perhaps most shockingly, in November 2021, Omri Goren, an Israeli citizen employed at Defense Minister Benny Gantz's residence, was charged with espionage. The investigation revealed that Goren, on his own initiative, contacted a figure associated with Iran through social media shortly before his arrest. He offered assistance in various ways, leveraging his access to the minister's house. Among other things, he proposed to the representative of the Iranian-associated hacking group Black Shadow that he could plant malware on the minister's computer via a USB device in exchange for financial compensation.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/15/supermodel-former-minister-defense-chiefs-janitor-the-israelis-who-became-spies-for-iran/	2024-10-14T18:30:43-07:00	
Hamas blocks Gazans from evacuating to safe zones	Fresh evidence has come to light regarding Hamas' ruthless exploitation of Gaza civilians as human shields. As Jabaliya area residents try to heed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) calls to evacuate to safe zones due to ongoing military operations, Hamas is reportedly obstructing their efforts, even resorting to violence. During a conversation between a Gaza resident and an IDF representative, as part of the IDF's efforts to warn civilians in Jabaliya, the Gazan individual stated, 'Hamas members are beating us with batons, blocking our evacuation attempts, and forcing us back from the designated humanitarian zone.' When the IDF official sought confirmation that Hamas was indeed preventing the evacuation, the distressed resident confirmed, adding, 'What are we supposed to do? We want to leave but they're beating us.' Hamas members shoot the feet of Gazans accused of 'disrupting order.' Photo credit: Arab social media As previously reported, following the start of the IDF's operations in the Jabaliya area last week, the IDF urged Jabaliya residents to leave their homes for their own safety. Hamas continues to use Gazan civilians as human shields, impeding their ability to respond to IDF evacuation calls to safer areas.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/14/hamas-blocks-gazans-from-evacuating-to-safe-zones/	2024-10-13T22:00:54-07:00	
Israeli couple hired by Iran to assassinate prominent figure	In a coordinated counterintelligence effort, Israel's Security Agency (Shin Bet) has uncovered a network of Iranian intelligence operatives working to recruit and activate Israeli citizens, the Israeli authorities revealed on Monday. As part of this operation, authorities arrested Vladislav Viktorson, a 30-year-old Ramat Gan resident, for questioning. Investigators found that since August, Viktorson had been in contact via social media with an individual using the name 'Mari Hossi.' Their communications were conducted in Hebrew. Under the direction of an Iranian operative, and fully aware of their identity, Viktorson allegedly carried out various tasks. These included spray-painting graffiti, hanging posters, planting money, and even torching vehicles in Tel Aviv's Yarkon Park area. He was later instructed to sabotage communication infrastructure and ATMs, and to set fires in forests. Some of these activities were documented, and Viktorson received over $5,000 for their execution. The investigation revealed that Viktorson even agreed to assassinate a prominent figure in Israel and to throw a grenade at a house. Following this, he took steps to acquire weapons, including a sniper rifle, handguns, and fragmentation grenades. The cars allegedly burnt by the couple Israel Police To assist in his operations, Viktorson recruited two additional citizens, including his girlfriend, Anna Bernstein, an 18-year-old Ramat Gan resident, who participated in some of the missions. Viktorson was also tasked with locating homeless individuals for recruitment and photographing protesters during demonstrations. On the day of their arrest, the couple was at City Tower in Ramat Gan, where police apprehended them in broad daylight. Their Iranian handler assigned them various missions. Initial tasks included spray-painting 'Bibi Hitler' and burning cars, allegedly to test their commitment. A senior police official stated, 'They carried out not only test missions but also operations that caused actual damage.' The final mission was to assassinate an individual whose identity remains unknown. Viktorson reportedly agreed but was arrested two days before the planned hit. Prosecutors recently filed indictments against those involved on security-related charges. Such activity by Iranian intelligence entities through social media is a known tactic for recruiting Israelis through deception to carry out various missions. While these tasks may initially seem harmless, they have the potential to significantly compromise state security. The recruiters communicated in various languages, including English and Hebrew, through platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter. Citizens responded to these approaches for financial gain. It's worth noting that a significant number of Israeli citizens who received suspicious approaches did not respond and alerted the relevant authorities. A senior Shin Bet official stated: 'In recent months, we've exposed several networks of Iranian intelligence operatives working to recruit Israeli citizens for various missions, including plans to harm individuals in Israel. We identified and monitored numerous fictitious Iranian profiles on social networks and gathered information about the entities behind their operation. Exposing this activity led to the arrest and interrogation of Israeli citizens who were tempted to carry out these missions.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/14/iranian-intelligence-operation-that-recruited-israeli-citizens-to-carry-out-acts-of-sabotage-and-potentially-assassinate-a-high-profile-target/	2024-10-13T19:11:49-07:00	
Report: Quds Force commander suffers heart attack during interrog...	The Arabic branch of Sky News reported today (Thursday) that Ismail Ghaani, the commander of the Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards, is suspected of having communicated with Israel. According to the report, Ghaani was interrogated regarding an intelligence breach and suffered a heart attack during the investigation, after which he was taken to a hospital. Sky News also reported that Ghaani's chief of staff is under suspicion of communicating with Israel. There is no confirmation of the report from any other source. Esmail Ghaani and Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran. Photo: Getty Images In recent days, it was reported that Ghaani was supposed to receive an honorary award from Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, following statements from Revolutionary Guards spokesperson asserting that he was in good health. It was previously claimed that Ghaani had been in Beirut two days before the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in late September. According to reports last week, Ghaani had not been in contact with the Iranian regime for several days following the attack in Dahiya that targeted senior Hezbollah official Hisham Safi al-Din, who had been designated to succeed Nasrallah. The New York Times reported that Ghaani had visited Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut prior to the attack. Earlier this week, Ghaani's deputy, Ariaj Masjedi, addressed the reports, stating that the commander is in good condition and carrying out his duties. 'Many are asking where Ghaani is. He is healthy and active,' Masjedi said this past Sunday.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/11/report-quds-force-commander-suffers-heart-attack-during-interrogation-over-ties-with-israel/	2024-10-11T03:15:53-07:00	
Iran's proxies prepare for Israeli strike	The Gulf's concerns, Iran's conflicting messages, and the preparations of pro-Iranian militias in Iraq: a possible Israeli attack on Iran is stoking fears across the Middle East about a wider regional conflict. According to Arab reports, Syria's Fourth Division, part of Bashar al-Assad's regime, has taken new measures to avoid Israeli strikes. The division, commanded by Maher al-Assad, the brother of the Syrian dictator, has ordered a halt to the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah or the hosting of Hezbollah operatives and pro-Iranian militias in its bases and headquarters. Another directive prohibits pro-Iranian elements or those affiliated with Hezbollah from approaching the Golan Heights border. Iranian Foreign Minister in a meeting with Bashar al-Assad, Photo: AFP Simultaneously, sources in Sana'a informed the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which is close to Hezbollah, that the Houthis are preparing militarily for a direct maritime confrontation with Israel as part of a 'new phase of escalation.' According to the report, the Houthis are targeting American naval forces and the Israeli navy. Additionally, Hezbollah and Iraqi militias are expected to participate in such attacks. The Houthis view the preparations by Israel and the US for a strike on Iran as a 'new escalation' and are readying themselves for a response. Houthi troops in Yemen. Photo: EPA Similar threats are emerging from Iraq. An Iraqi military expert confirmed to Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Shia militias in the country have displayed various types of drones launched from Iraqi territory toward Israel. According to the expert, these militias are now employing larger drones carrying more explosives. Arab sources indicate that the main militias behind the 'Islamic Resistance in Iraq,' which has claimed responsibility for the drone launches, include Kata'ib Hezbollah in Iraq, Sayyid al-Shuhada Brigades, Imam Ali Brigades, the al-Nujaba Movement, and Ansar Allah Brigades. Some of these groups have threatened to attack U.S. bases if Israel strikes Iran. Missile firing test in Iran (archive). Photo: AFP. Today, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visited Iraq, stating that the purpose of the trip was to consult and coordinate positions with Iraq. He claimed the coordination was aimed at 'curbing Israel and its attempts to escalate tensions in the region. We do not wish to expand the war, but we are prepared for any scenario.' Araghchi added that 'Iran will have no red lines when it comes to defending its citizens.' In contrast, diplomatic sources reported an Iranian message indicating that Tehran would respond to a limited Israeli attack. Meanwhile, Gulf states are applying pressure on the US to prevent Israeli strikes on Iran's oil facilities. In Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other Gulf nations, there are concerns that their oil installations could become targets if tensions escalate. According to Reuters, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar are refusing to allow Israeli aircraft to fly over their airspace for any potential strikes on Iran. These messages have been relayed to the Biden administration.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/11/from-the-houthis-in-yemen-to-the-militias-in-iraq-irans-proxies-prepare-for-israeli-strike/	2024-10-11T01:33:47-07:00	
How Israel can win in Iran's own dangerous game	The world watches with bated breath, wondering how Israel will respond to Iran's second missile salvo. Behind closed doors in Jerusalem, a crucial strategy is taking shape – one aimed at preventing Tehran's preferred scenario: a war of attrition. Such a conflict would unfold in a predictable, yet dangerous pattern: Israel retaliates, Iran launches more missiles at Israel and potentially other regional countries, Israel counters, and the cycle continues ad infinitum. Israeli leadership, keenly aware of this trap, is reportedly considering a response of overwhelming force. According to Israel Hayom, the goal is clear: to strike Iran so decisively that the Islamic Republic will think twice before engaging in a protracted conflict with Israel. It's worth noting that Iran's strategy of wearing down Israel and other US allies in the region is not merely a choice, but a necessity. Militarily, it's the only card left in Tehran's hand. Iran neither desires nor possesses the capability to deploy ground forces against Israel, given the vast geographical distance and intervening countries. Moreover, while Israel boasts one of the world's most formidable air forces, Iran's air capabilities are comparatively limited. Israel's trump card in this high-stakes game is its unparalleled air defense system. For years, Iran had counted on its network of proxy organizations to provide a protective umbrella against Western strikes. However, a year into the current conflict, this strategy lies in tatters: Hamas is reeling, Hezbollah is on the back foot, and the various militias in Iraq and Yemen amount to little more than an irritant for Israel. The result? Iran finds itself unexpectedly exposed. The Iranian barrage on Israel on Oct. 1, 2024 (KOKO) KOKO Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior researcher at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), offers valuable insight into Iran's evolving strategy. 'April was a watershed moment,' he explains. 'Since the first missile attack, we've seen Israel decisively seize the initiative, escalating the situation to its advantage. Iran, caught off guard, has found its military options severely limited.' Ben Taleblu, who has spent years studying Iran's missile capabilities, emphasizes the murky nature of the information landscape. 'Concrete data on Iran's missile arsenal is scarce,' he notes. 'But estimates suggest they possess around 3,000 short and medium-range ballistic missiles – the largest such stockpile globally.' These weapons, crucially, can reach Israel. The second Iranian attack, in Ben Taleblu's assessment, showed marked improvement. 'They doubled the missile count and employed more advanced systems,' he observes. 'While they didn't use the hypersonic missiles they've boasted about, they did deploy more maneuverable variants.' Oded Eilam, drawing on his experience as a former senior Mossad official, offers a more conservative estimate of Iran's capabilities. 'Their arsenal likely numbers around 2,000 missiles,' he suggests. 'It's substantial, but their production capacity is constrained, with some lines dedicated to supplying Russia.' Even assuming the higher estimate of 3,000 missiles, questions linger about their operational readiness. Sources reveal that in the aftermath of the first attack, Iranian leaders initially doubted Israel's claims of successful interceptions. The reality of their failure took time to sink in, prompting a period of intense analysis and testing. Learning from these setbacks, Iran deployed more advanced Fateh-2 missiles in their second strike. However, Eilam estimates their stockpile of these advanced weapons is limited to between 400 and 800. With 200 already expended in a single attack, Iran's reserves of truly effective missiles may be running low. This raises a critical question: can Iran sustain a prolonged ballistic exchange with Israel? The numbers suggest their capacity for attrition warfare may be more limited than they'd like to admit. Eilam is unequivocal in his assessment of the strategic balance: 'Iran faces a significant disadvantage against Israel. They lack a single Arrow missile and there isn't a single shelter in Tehran. They're vulnerable in terms of maintaining operational continuity or recovering from an attack – precisely the opposite of Israel's capabilities.' To break the cycle of escalation, Eilam proposes a bold strategy. 'Israel should consider a severe, but targeted strike,' he argues. 'Hit the nuclear program – even if we can't destroy it entirely. Target weapons depots and missile factories. Strike symbols of regime power, like the Revolutionary Court in Tehran. The goal is to send a message that resonates with every Iranian citizen, even without access to the internet.' Crucially, Eilam emphasizes the importance of coordination with Washington. He suggests securing a US commitment: if Iran dares to launch a third strike against Israel, the American response would target Iran's oil industry – the regime's economic lifeline. This approach, Eilam contends, offers the best chance of deterring a war of attrition. But even if Iran miscalculates and strikes again, he believes the strategic math remains in Israel's favor. 'They can inflict pain, certainly,' he acknowledges. 'But they're exposed in ways they never anticipated. The regime isn't built for multi-front warfare, and their overriding concern is survival.' Eilam's final assessment is sobering: 'If Iran, against all logic, opts for a war of attrition, Israel's response must be overwhelming. Collapsing the oil industry on Kharg Island would be a potential endgame. At that point, the regime's fate would be sealed.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/11/how-israel-can-win-against-iran-in-its-own-dangerous-game/	2024-10-10T21:53:01-07:00

Civilians beat us': Israeli teen reveals ordeal of Hamas captivi...	In a poignant interview for the 'Children of October 7' social media project, 13-year-old Eitan Yahalomi from Nir Oz, shared the harrowing details of his captivity in Gaza. The young survivor, who was released in November as part of a hostage release deal, recounted instances of physical abuse, persistent hunger, and being forced to watch disturbing footage. Yahalomi was kidnapped from his home during the Oct. 7 attack. His father, who was shot during the abduction, remains in captivity, while his mother and sister managed to escape an attempted kidnapping.

We heard gunshots and Arabic shouting. They were waiting for us. They were civilians,' Eitan said, describing his initial entry into Gaza. When asked if he had felt scared, he responded candidly, 'A bit, to be honest.' Throughout his captivity, Eitan faced constant hunger. 'My daily ration was a pita and a cucumber,' he revealed. He also spoke of being subjected to disturbing content. 'They showed me videos of them killing people. They seemed happy about it.' The Yahalomi family: father Ohad, mother Batsheva, son Eitan and daughter When asked about whether he tried to avoid watching, Eitan explained, 'No, it wouldn't have mattered anyway, he wouldn't have allowed it. I saw even worse things. These images are constantly in my mind.' As for his ability to sleep at night, Eitan added with stark honesty, 'Not much. I've been through the worst, and that's that.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/10/civilians-beat-us-israeli-teen-reveals-ordeal-of-hamas-captivity/	2024-10-09T22:00:44-07:00	
Gaza hostage marks 2nd birthday in captivity	Yarden Bibas has become the first of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza to mark a second birthday in captivity. The gravity of this statement takes a moment to sink in. Yarden, the father of the widely known Ariel and Kfir Bibas, the young ginger children who were also kidnapped to Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, is turning 35 while being held against his will for the second year running. 'It's unfathomable that a year has gone by and they're still being held captive,' Ofri, Yareden's sister said. 'I keep wondering when I'll reach my breaking point. When it will become unbearable. My son Afik is four months old. Kfir, Yarden's son, was taken when he was just nine months old. I can't help but dread the possibility that they might still be hostages by the time Afik reaches Kfir's age.' Footage of Yarden Bibas' kidnapping on Oct. 7, 2023. Photo credit: Social media On Oct. 7, 2023, Yarden was taken from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. His wife Shiri and their children Ariel, then 4, and Kfir, a nine-month-old infant at the time were forcibly abducted in a separate incident. Hamas released video footage that captured the terror in Shiri's eyes during their abduction, an image that has haunted Israel and communities abroad alike. 'Yarden's last birthday marked the first time we received proof he was alive,' Ofri recalled. 'After seeing the images of Shiri in Gaza released shortly after the kidnapping, I was convinced Yarden had been killed. But when we were told he wasn't in the house and there were no signs of bloodshed, he was classified as missing. Three days later, on the morning of his birthday, someone contacted us saying they believed they had identified him in and sent us the image. It was indeed him. Since then, we've been in a constant state of anguish.' When asked what she would wish for her brother, she said: 'Dodgy,' using his family nickname, 'I wish for you to return to life, to come back to us alive. To smile again, to laugh, to feel the warmth of sunlight, and breathe fresh air. I wish you freedom. And above all – I wish for you to kiss Shiri again and embrace Ariel and Kfir.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/10/gaza-hostage-marks-2nd-birthday-in-captivity/	2024-10-09T22:00:36-07:00	
Turkey bans Discord for not sharing user information	Turkey has blocked access to the instant messaging platform Discord following a court decision, as the platform refused to share user information requested by Ankara, Turkish officials announced on Wednesday, according to Reuters. Transport and Infrastructure Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu highlighted the challenges faced by authorities in monitoring and intervening when illegal or criminal content is shared on Discord. 'Security personnel cannot go through the content. We can only intervene when users complain to us about content shared there,' he told reporters in parliament. Uraloglu added, 'Since Discord refuses to share its own information, including IP addresses and content, with our security units, we were forced to block access.' Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan addresses members of parliament from his ruling AK Party (AKP) during a meeting at the Turkish parliament in Ankara, Turkey, October 9, 2024 (Photo: Reuters/Cagla Gurdogan) REUTERS The block comes in the wake of public outrage in Turkey over the murder of two women by a 19-year-old man in Istanbul earlier this month. Social media content revealed that some Discord users subsequently praised the killings, prompting authorities to take action. Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc explained that an Ankara court decided to block access to Discord from Turkey due to 'sufficient suspicion that crimes of child sexual abuse and obscenity' had been committed by some users on the platform. Turkey has banned Discord. And hey I don't love Discord, but that's because too many people use is as a coordination tool when it was designed for gaming communities. It absolutely should not be banned by any government. This is why decentralization actually matters. — abigail carlson (@abigailcarlson_) October 9, 2024 This development follows a similar move by Russia's communications regulator, which blocked Discord on Tuesday for violating Russian law. The platform had previously been fined for failing to remove banned content, according to the TASS news agency.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/10/turkey-blocks-discord-for-not-sharing-user-information/	2024-10-09T18:30:14-07:00	
Pro-Israel journalist attacked in Barcelona	A disturbing attack on an Israel supporter unfolded in Spain as far-left activists hurled red paint at journalist and author Pilar Rahola during her lecture marking the start of the academic year. The incident occurred while Rahola was speaking at Marti i Loma University in La Garriga, a Barcelona suburb. 'You're stained with blood - this is what happens to supporters of genocide in Palestine,' the assailants shouted before fleeing the hall. Before the event, they had protested outside, waving Palestinian flags and a large banner reading: 'We'll destroy the Zionist state of Israel' and 'Zionism is fascism.' Video: Footage of a far-left group's attack on journalist Pilar Rahola. Credit: Social media Rahola, a former Catalan politician, stood her ground, pausing her lecture only to wipe off the red paint and change her shirt. She responded defiantly, saying, 'They won't silence me. I won't hide, and I won't fear them. I'm a free citizen in a free country - and fascists, whether right-wing or left-wing, will never stop me from exercising my freedom. This is what you, the attackers, are afraid of.' she added. 'You're afraid of freedom.' Barcelona's Jewish community swiftly condemned the attack. 'Some seek lies and hatred, while others seek truth and blessing,' their statement read. 'Some invest in terror and destruction, while others invest in building, life, and progress. Amidst the darkness, there's much light, and today we face a clear choice: to be light or darkness. Clearly, there's no place in universities for those who destroy and attack. Thank you, Pilar.' No me callarán. No me esconderé. No les tendré miedo. Soy una ciudadana libre en un país libre. Nunca el fascismo, ni de derechas, ni de izquierdas impedirá que ejerza mi libertad. De eso tenéis miedo, vosotros, los agresores. Tenéis miedo de la libertad. — Pilar Rahola (@RaholaOficial) October 8, 2024 The assault on Rahola reflects the hostile, anti-Israel climate in Spain, partly fueled by the government. On Oct. 7, several leading Spanish newspapers published articles criticizing the Israeli government, some in harsh terms. While Madrid's Foreign Ministry issued a statement honoring those killed in the Hamas massacre, many far-left politicians used the occasion to criticize Israel. For instance, a Podemos member of the European Parliament protested in the European Parliament against its support for 'terrorist Israel committing genocide.' On Oct. 8, she posted, 'A year ago, a new phase in the Palestinian genocide by the terrorist state of Israel began.' Recently, Yolanda Diaz, Spain's former Deputy Prime Minister from the far-left Sumar party, shared an anti-Israel video, concluding with the infamous saying, 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.' The atmosphere in Barcelona around the Oct. 7 massacre anniversary was equally tense. 'The anniversary again triggered an anti-Israel and antisemitic wave in Barcelona,' says Shai Deutsch, Community Development Manager at Israeli Community Europe (ICE). 'On October 6, pro-Hamas rallies were held in the city, which was plastered with anti-Israel and anti-Jewish graffiti and posters. As they've done all year, the Israeli community acted swiftly, covering the city overnight with posters about the hostages and information about the massacre's anniversary. We also organized a major memorial event to ensure Barcelona remembers the events of October 7 and the past year.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/09/pro-israel-journalist-attacked-in-barcelona/	2024-10-08T20:00:46-07:00	
Can you call a bus 'Israel' in India? Driver defends unusual gest...	A bus owner in Mangaluru in the state of Karnataka, India has found himself at the center of an unexpected controversy, as reported by the Times of India. Lester Kateel, who has been working in Israel for the past 12 years, recently named his bus 'Israel Travels,' only to face backlash on social media platforms. The bus, which operates on the Moodbidri-Kinnigoli-Kateel-Mulki route, became the subject of heated online attacks by Muslim antagonists as tensions between Israel and its terrorist enemies escalated. According to the Times of India, a section of social media users began sharing pictures of the vehicle, calling for police action against the owner for using the name 'Israel.' The bus that has come under attack (Photo: Courtesy) In response to the growing controversy, Kateel made the decision to rename his bus 'Jerusalem.' He told the Sunday Times of India, 'Soon after noticing these messages on social media, I decided to change the name.' The bus owner expressed confusion over the backlash, stating, 'I have no idea why people have issues with 'Israel Travels'.' Kateel mentioned that the police had not pressured him to alter the name of his vehicle. Those advocating for the name change argued that if police can register an FIR (First Information Report) for updating a WhatsApp status in support of 'Palestine,' similar action should be taken against the bus owner for naming his vehicle after Israel. The police has dismissed the claims of any wrongdoing on his behalf.In this region of southwest India, there is a large Catholic Christian minority, and for them, the connection to the Holy Land is almost self-evident. Speaking with Israel Hayom Kateel said, 'I love Israel so much. It's because I've worked here for so many years, and I love how this country works and operates. I feel very protected here even during wartime.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/08/can-you-call-a-bus-israel-in-india-pro-israel-driver-fights-on/	2024-10-08T01:41:32-07:00	
Israel unlikely to strike Iran's nuclear sites without US backing...	Israel has spent 22 years planning for a potential strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, but experts suggest such an attack is unlikely in the current climate and could prove ineffective without American support, according to reporting from The New York Times. The Israeli Air Force recently conducted drills over the Mediterranean Sea, simulating 'long-range flight, aerial refueling and striking distant targets,' as described by the Israel Defense Forces. These exercises serve to intimidate Iran and signal to the Biden administration that Israel is prepared to act unilaterally if necessary. However, President Biden has warned Israel against striking nuclear or energy sites, emphasizing that any response to Iran's recent missile attacks should be 'proportionate.' Defense Secretary Lloyd J Austin III has urged his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, to avoid actions that could lead to further escalation. Members of the media and officials tour the water nuclear reactor at Arak, Iran December 23, 2019 (Reuters / West Asia News Agency) Reuters / West Asia News Agency Despite these cautions, some Israeli officials advocate for immediate action. Naftali Bennett, a former prime minister, argued on social media: 'Israel has now its greatest opportunity in 50 years, to change the face of the Middle East. We must act now to destroy Iran's nuclear program, its central energy facilities, and to fatally cripple this terrorist regime.' He added, 'We have the justification. We have the tools. Now that Hezbollah and Hamas are paralyzed, Iran stands exposed.' The debate has become a political issue in the United States as well. Former President Donald J Trump suggested that Israel should 'hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later.' Representative Michael R Turner criticized President Biden on CBS's Face the Nation, saying: 'It's completely irresponsible for the president to say that it is off the table, when he's previously said it's on the table.' Experts question the effectiveness of an Israeli strike, concerned it might drive Iran's nuclear program deeper underground. Iran has consistently denied intentions to develop nuclear weapons, citing a 2003 fatwa by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Israel's capability to carry out such an attack is limited by its aging fleet of Boeing 707 aerial refueling planes. General Frank McKenzie, former head of US Central Command, noted: 'The nuclear target is a very difficult target. There are a lot of other alternatives to that target,' adding that many of them, including energy infrastructure, would be easier to execute. Ehud Barak, who served as Israel's highest-ranked uniformed officer and prime minister, said in a 2019 interview with The New York Times that President George W Bush's warning against striking Iran 'did not really make any difference for us.' As of the end of 2008, he said, Israel did not have a feasible plan for attacking Iran. The situation is further complicated by reports of Russian technical assistance to Iran's nuclear program. Secretary of State Antony J Blinken has raised concerns about this, describing it as 'technical assistance' without evidence of Russia providing hardware for warhead development. American officials, starting with President Biden, have argued against such strikes.

The Oct. 7 attack caught Israel off guard, with thousands in southern communities and at the Nova music festival suddenly running for their lives. Despite the shock, danger, and overwhelming sense of helplessness, many chose to document the chaos as they fled – sometimes capturing the final images of those who didn't survive. Video: Michal's footage of the Oct. 7 attack at the Nova Festival site. Credit: courtesy 'My close friends Osher and Michael Waknin, who are no longer with us, were part of the Nova festival production team this year and invited me to join,' Michal Ohana, 27 from Jerusalem, recounted. Ohana had spent the previous year working as a veterinary nurse in Portugal. 'I returned to Israel just days before Oct. 7 to visit family, celebrate the holidays, and because my older sister was about to give birth.' Nothing could have prepared Ohana for the terror she was about to experience. During the festival, she found herself documenting horrific scenes of people fleeing from attackers, injuries, gunfire, and life-threatening danger. 'At 6:29 a.m., the rocket barrage began, and I sensed something was terribly wrong. I had this gut feeling. So I started filming everything,' she recalled. 'I believe every moment from 6:29 a.m. until my evacuation in the late afternoon was crucial to document. I captured my own escape and videos that now serve as final memories for families of those murdered. I recorded the gunfire, the fear, and the sheer madness we all experienced. These videos convey the most horrific feelings imaginable, and it's all real. Thanks to my footage, people found vital information about missing persons, murder victims, and hostages. Most importantly, I documented the most brutal massacre in our history, ensuring it can never be denied.' Despite being wounded during an encounter with attackers, Ohana continued filming. 'My phone became my eyes. I gripped it tightly, fearing I'd drop it while running. When I came face-to-face with the terrorists, they fired an RPG at me. As I fled, I was shot in the leg. Even while bleeding, I kept filming because I knew that if I died, someone would find my phone and see what happened to us,' she recalled. 'The videos and photos I took are irrefutable proof of what Hamas did that day. They murdered, raped, looted, and mutilated bodies – some were my friends. These videos are shocking and difficult to watch, but they show the truth.' Video: Michal's footage of the Oct. 7 attack at the Nova Festival site. Credit: courtesy In hindsight, Ohana believes her decision to document everything was the right choice. 'I realize now that while I was in the situation, I was also viewing it from the outside through my camera – and that protected me from the horrific sights I witnessed. When I encountered the terrorists face-to-face, I knew I was likely to die. It was a terrifying realization, but I decided to keep filming as long as I was alive. I hoped that if someone found my phone, it might change something in the future. Now I know my footage is being shared worldwide, helping people understand what happened to us.' 'I knew I might be the last witness' Liron Avigzer, 27, from Netanya, manages bars and helps set up event booths. On Oct. 7, she was at the Nova festival site, where she had set up a jewelry booth with her friend Shay. When gunshots suddenly rang out, Avigzer realized the gravity of the situation and decided to document what was happening from her hiding spot in a bush. 'I wanted to ensure the world would know what happened here, that there would be evidence of our experience,' she explained. 'The most critical moment to document was when I realized there was no escape and that I might not survive. I sat alone in that bush for hours, watching in horror as the events unfolded around me. I knew I might be the last witness to what happened there, and I wanted to make sure our story would be told, so even when my phone battery dropped to 2%, I kept filming.' Liron Avigzer hiding in a bush on Oct. 7. Photo credit: Courtesy Courtesy Avigzer says her biggest challenge was the paralyzing fear that kept her from moving or exposing herself. She coped by focusing her mind on a single goal. 'These images and videos show the brutal reality of what happened, illustrate the scale of the disaster, and convey the terror we experienced,' she said. 'Even now, I feel at peace with my decision to document the attack, despite how difficult and painful it was. Recording was an important part of the story and helped me process what I went through. It's a miracle my phone kept working even after eight hours of filming and texting my mom from inside that bush. Finally, my friend who had been at the booth with me called to say a tank had arrived – and that's when I emerged from hiding.' Smartphones as weapons 'The need to document is fundamental to human nature. We want to preserve our experiences and tell our stories,' Nirit Tzuk, an expert in child and youth culture research, explained. 'Throughout history, people have documented their lives through writing or pictures – even in times of great distress. With the rise of screens and social media, the ability to document became more accessible, allowing everyone to share their story online through smartphones and selfies.' Generation Z has taken this impulse even further through social networks. 'Stories have become a tool for sharing everything that happens at the moment, whether it's a meal at a restaurant or a fun outing – but also the difficult things we experience, including moments of fear, crying, or shock,' Tzuk said. 'It's another way for this generation to make their voices heard and, at the same time, call for help. Sometimes, the act of documenting can create a sense of psychological distance, allowing the person to step back and observe the situation.' Video: Liron's footage of the Oct. 7 attack at the Nova Festival site. Credit: courtesy 'By sharing their footage, survivors can show the world the shocking experiences they've endured and ask for it to be spread widely,' Tzuk continued. 'Smartphones have also become a kind of 'weapon', providing a sense of security through apps that can quickly connect to emergency services or loved ones. When Hamas tried to deny what happened, countless Israelis took to social media to share evidence of the atrocities themselves.' 'Technology allows us to keep the story alive' Dr. Ayelet Cohen Wieder, a clinical psychologist on the guidance team of Safe Heart, an organization providing mental health support to Oct. 7 survivors, explains that the need to bear witness is deeply human – and technology now enables it in new ways. 'Documenting their final moments turns victims into witnesses, ensuring their stories become testimony,' she said. 'Technology answers our need to keep our stories alive and existing, even when we are gone.' Is wartime phone documentation unique to Generation Z? 'This is certainly the medium through which they're accustomed to experiencing the world,' Dr. Cohen Wieder noted. 'But from what I've heard from survivors, people of all ages left messages and described what was happening – perhaps as a desperate cry for help, or out of a desire for the world to witness the horror. Documentation can also serve as a form of resistance against an enemy trying to silence and erase our existence. It can be seen as an attempt to connect with the 'sane' world and mentally extract ourselves from an unthinkable situation by communicating with the outside.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/08/i-knew-i-might-be-the-last-witness-oct-7-survivors-explain-why-they-filmed-the-attack/	2024-10-07T18:30:35-07:00	
Israeli Arab teacher arrested for video 'celebrating' Oct. 7 anni...	Israeli authorities have arrested an educator from northern Israel for posting a video on social media that initially appeared to celebrate the October 7 Hamas attacks, as the nation marked one year since the deadly assault, although this was later slammed as a misinterpretation of the meaning of the video. The 41-year-old woman from Tamra, in the Lower Galilee, uploaded a TikTok video of herself dancing at a Nazareth school where she works to the song 'Another Good Time,' with a caption that reads, 'On this day 7/10/23,' but it then turned out that this video had in fact been uploaded well before the war broke out and may have just been simply reposted under the 'on this day' option on TikTok. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir commented on the early morning arrest, stating: 'A teacher from a Nazareth school uploaded a video to social media yesterday, showing herself dancing to the song 'Good Times' with the date 7.10.23 in the background. I forwarded the footage to the team I established within the Israel Police to handle online incitement, and she was promptly arrested at her home in Tamra.

Harris ducks question over Iran nuclear bomb	In a wide-ranging 60 Minutes interview, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed critical foreign policy issues, with a particular focus on Iran and US-Israel relations. The conversation began with a direct question about America's greatest foreign adversary. Harris responded unequivocally: 'I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands.' She emphasized the recent attack on Israel, stating, 'This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles, what we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities.' The Iranian barrage on Israel on Oct. 1, 2024 (KOKO) KOKO The interviewer asked: 'So if you have proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon, would you take military action?' To which Vice President Harris responded: 'I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment.' Harris defended US aid, explaining, 'The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel.' She highlighted threats from 'Hamas, Hezbollah... Iran,' asserting it is 'without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.' Addressing diplomatic efforts, Harris said, 'The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done, which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire.' She added, 'We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.' When questioned about Netanyahu's apparent resistance to U.S. advice, Harris countered, 'The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.' The interviewer highlighted potential escalation, noting, 'He [Netanyahu] has promised to make Iran pay for the missile attack and that has the potential of expanding the war.' When asked about the personal relationship with Netanyahu, Harris pivoted, stating, 'I think with all due respect, the better question is: do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people, and the answer to that question is yes.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/08/harris-ducks-question-over-iran-nuclear-bomb/	2024-10-07T15:59:23-07:00

Eating the Cats' performer wins praise for defending Israel on X	div]:bg-bg-300 [&_pre]:-mr-4 md:[&_pre]:-mr-9'> _*]:min-w-0'> In a social media exchange on X (formerly Twitter), South African musician @TheKiffness and pro-Palestinian account @Africa4Pal engaged in a heated debate over the events of October 7, 2023, with the former correcting his rival on inaccuracies. The exchange which occurred on the one-year anniversary of the horrific Hamas atrocities. Scott, a South African musician, producer, and internet personality, has recently become a household name among millions around the world when he created a remix of former President Donald Trump's comment during a televised debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. Scott, known for his 'cast remixes,' took Trump's own words, in which he accused immigrants in Springfield, Ohio of eating the pets of local residents. The song 'Eating the Cats' became viral overnight. Kibbutz Nirim in southern Israel bordering the Gaza Strip: a damaged house following the deadly October 7 attack by Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip (AFP / Menahem Kahana) AFP / Menahem Kahana The spat began when @Africa4Pal showed tweets posted by Kiffness in which he made sure to show the Israeli version of events, including one replying to South African President Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa, in which the artist said the following: 'Today marks one year since Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel. They murdered over 1180 Israelis and kidnapped 251 people. If you're going to side with Palestine, that is your prerogative, but at least get the facts straight. You are an embarrassment to South Africans who love the truth. Your are not my president.' After @TheKiffness was attacked as being pro-Israel and 'casually overlooking the nuance of the region's troubles' and saying that 'Atrocity blame can be equally allocated,' he shot back, writing: 'We're not talking about nuances here, we're talking about what happened on October 7, 2023.' He went on to and framed the discussion by presenting a binary choice regarding the events of October 7, asking whether it marked 'the start of an onslaught against the Palestinian people' or 'the day that Hamas launched an attack on Israel.' The exchange quickly devolved into accusations of bullying and ad hominem attacks, with @TheKiffness claiming to be the target of personal attacks rather than substantive engagement with his arguments. The introduction of a third user, Yair Katz (@YairKatz), further intensified the debate by praising @TheKiffness for 'standing up for the truth' and accusing @Africa4Pal of supporting Hamas and Hezbollah.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/07/easting-the-cats-performer-wins-praise-for-defending-israel-on-x/	2024-10-07T04:22:31-07:00	
World leaders stand with Israel on Oct. 7 anniversary	US President Joe Biden issued a special statement Monday to mark the first anniversary of the October 7 tragedy. He spoke of a day that should have been a joyous Jewish holiday but instead became the deadliest for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Biden expressed profound sorrow for the loss of more than 1,200 lives, including 46 Americans, and reaffirmed his commitment to Israel's security and the release of hostages still held by Hamas. In his statement, Biden said: 'Today marks one year of mourning for the more than 1,200 innocent people of all ages, including 46 Americans, massacred in southern Israel by the terrorist group Hamas. One year since Hamas committed horrific acts of sexual violence. One year since more than 250 innocents were taken hostage, including 12 Americans. One year for the survivors carrying wounds, seen and unseen, who will never be the same. And one year of a devastating war.' Biden emphasized that the United States stands behind Israel's right to defend itself against attacks from Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthi rebels. He recalled how American forces assisted in protecting Israel from Iran's ballistic missile attack just last week. A woman looks at charred vehicles burned in the Oct. 7 cross-border attack by Hamas outside the town of Netivot, southern Israel, Oct. 7, 2024 (Photo: AP/Ariel Schalit) AP/Ariel Schalit Biden condemned the global surge in antisemitism and called for a united front against all forms of hatred. He also expressed hope that October 7 would be remembered as a dark day for Palestinians due to the conflict it sparked. 'We will not stop working to achieve a ceasefire deal in Gaza that brings the hostages home, allows for a surge in humanitarian aid to ease the suffering on the ground, assures Israel's security, and ends this war,' he said. The president concluded with a call for unity and reaffirmed his administration's commitment to regional stability and diplomatic solutions. 'We also continue to believe that a diplomatic solution across the Israel-Lebanon border region is the only path to restore lasting calm and allow residents on both sides to return safely to their homes.' Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated her commitment to Israel's security and the release of the hostages: 'I will do everything in my power to ensure that the threat Hamas poses is eliminated, that it is never again able to govern Gaza, that it fails in its mission to annihilate Israel, and that the people of Gaza are free from the grip of Hamas. I will never stop fighting for the release of all the hostages, including the seven American citizens, living and deceased, still held: Omer, Edan, Sagui, Keith, Judy, Gad, and Itay.' French President Emmanuel Macron, who recently suggested considering an arms embargo on Israel, tweeted in Hebrew, English, and French: 'October 7. The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity. We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts.' October 7. The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity. We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts. — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) October 7, 2024 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who was among the first to visit Israel and express public support after October 7, issued a special statement Monday morning: 'There can be no justification for Hamas' acts of terror. They brought immense suffering not only upon the people of Israel, but also upon innocent Palestinians. We reiterate our call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, for the unconditional release of all hostages and for an end to the conflict. One year on, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is appalling. The European Union will keep doing its utmost to mobilise financial assistance and facilitate deliveries and distribution of humanitarian aid, to the Palestinian people, and now also in Lebanon. Hamas' terrorist attacks on Israel ignited a spiral of violence which has brought the entire region to a state of extreme tension and volatility. All parties must act responsibly, with restraint, and engage to de-escalate the current tensions.' She also addressed goals for after the wars end: 'While we address the immediate crisis, the European Union is ready to help prepare for the day after. We will work in support of all efforts to set the conditions for a durable peace, leading to a two-state solution, where Israel and Palestine coexist side-by-side in peace, with security for both. It's the only viable path forward, to finally end the suffering.' The new NATO Secretary General and former Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, expressed support for Israel: 'One year on from October 7, my thoughts are with the people of #Israel, with the families of the victims and hostages taken by Hamas. I welcome efforts by Allies to bring about a ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages, and an end to the conflict.' Dutch politician Geert Wilders, known for his staunch support of Israel, tweeted a message of solidarity against the backdrop of the Israeli flag: 'Today we honor the innocent victims of the barbaric Islamic terrorist attack on October 7 last year in Israel. But commemorating isn't enough; there must also be commitment. This day's memory only holds value when we wholeheartedly support Israel in its existential struggle for survival, while those behind the attacks – the terrorist organizations Hamas, Hezbollah, and all their affiliates – are destroyed. We must confront antisemites in our country and expel them wherever possible.' Argentinian President Javier Milei tweeted in Hebrew and English, 'Our hearts are captive in Gaza. BRING THEM HOME NOW.' הלב שלנו שבוי בעזה BRING THEM HOME NOW — Javier Milei (@JMilei) October 7, 2024 Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a known supporter of Israel, also issued a statement: 'A year after the October 7 massacre it feels as though the world is forgetting the horror and the evil that took place that day. It is time for us to stand with Israel. Bring back moral clarity. Bring back the hostages.'

Matteo Salvini, Italy's Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, wrote: 'A year after the horrific massacre on October 7, our thoughts are with the Israeli people – with children killed in their cradles, young lives cut short, women violated, those who died in captivity, and those still held hostage. We must always remember Israel's right to exist, to defend itself against Islamic terror, and finally to live in peace with its neighbors.' In Germany, the hostage symbol was placed in the German Parliament. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz posted a picture of the hostage symbol in the Bundestag and wrote, 'We share your grief.' Justice Minister Marco Buschmann added: 'The Hamas terror attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, was the largest mass murder of Jews since the end of the Holocaust. Israel continues to be a target for terrorist actions. As any country would, Israel defends itself against these attacks... We protect Jewish life in Germany... We stand with Israel and with the Jews in Germany.' We share your grief. pic.twitter.com/T89QnG1QOE — Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (@Bundeskanzler) October 7, 2024 Several foreign ministries worldwide also sent special messages. The Danish Foreign Ministry tweeted: 'Today, on 7 October, we mourn the loss of lives caused by Hamas' brutal terrorist attack against Israel one year ago. More than 100 people are still held hostages in Gaza. Our thoughts go out to all of those affected by the tragic event.' Spain's Foreign Ministry, one of the more critical voices towards Israel, also published a statement. However, Israel's name was notably absent: 'The Spanish Government recalls and restates its strongest condemnation of the atrocious Hamas terrorist attacks of 7 October 2023 and conveys its solidarity to the families and relatives of the victims.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/07/biden-macron-express-solidarity-on-first-anniversary-of-hamas-attack/	2024-10-07T01:30:56-07:00	
Kindergarten teacher turned hero on Ofakim's 'death street'	In the early hours of October 7, 2023, Tali Hadad, a 49-year-old kindergarten teacher and mother of six from Ofakim, was thrust into an unimaginable situation. As Hamas launched its assault on southern Israel, Hadad's maternal instincts and quick thinking led her to become an unexpected hero, rescuing her wounded son and other victims amidst intense gunfire. Hadad's day began at 6:45 am with the sound of sirens and gunfire, signaling an attack far more severe than the typical rocket barrages the region had grown accustomed to over the years. Her son Itamar, a soldier on leave for the weekend, immediately grabbed his rifle and ran towards the danger. 'I ran toward the playground,' Hadad told Fox News Digital. 'I hid behind a wall and saw a line of terrorists walking with rifles, heading in the direction where my son had gone.' Moments later, she heard gunshots and, fearing for her son's life, sprinted towards the sound. Dodging through alleys under heavy fire, Hadad witnessed the unfolding devastation. 'People were yelling from windows, begging for help,' she recounted. 'But there were no ambulances coming, no one to save them.' When she found Itamar, he had been shot multiple times – in the stomach, leg, and thigh. Two of his comrades lay dead beside him. Despite the danger, Hadad made multiple trips to rescue a total of 13 people, driving them to safety at high speeds to avoid terrorist gunfire. 'I knew if I drove slowly, the terrorists would shoot me,' Hadad explained, describing her harrowing journey to the local emergency medical station. The attack on Ofakim, a small city of 50,000 residents located 15 miles from the Gaza border, resulted in 47 deaths. Hadad's street became known as 'Death Street' due to the intensity of the violence there. The remains of a house in Kibbutz Beeri, Israel, near the Gaza Strip, Nov. 1, 2023 (Photo: Moshe Shai) ??? ?? Hadad, like many in Ofakim and across Israel, continues to grapple with the emotional aftermath of the attack. 'We're still bleeding,' she said. The experience has profoundly changed her life, leading her to put her teaching career on hold to care for her recovering son. Five of Hadad's six children currently serve in the IDF, either on active duty or in the reserves. Two are currently fighting in Gaza, while her youngest daughter is set to enter the army in a month. Ofakim is slowly rebuilding. The community has established a memorial, painted murals, and planted olive trees to symbolize resilience and renewal. However, the psychological scars remain deep, with long waiting lists for trauma counseling and overwhelming available resources. In response to the growing need for mental health support, the Israel Psychoanalytic Society and the NGO IsraAid have established a multidisciplinary trauma center offering free services to survivors of the massacre. As Ofakim continues its healing journey, the memories of October 7 remain vivid in the community's collective consciousness. Hadad reflected on the day's impact, saying, 'We remember how our children ran through the streets barefoot, fighting like lions. No politicians come here anymore. No tour buses arrive. But we remember. We will always remember.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/07/kindergarten-teacher-turned-hero-on-ofakims-death-street/	2024-10-06T23:30:34-07:00	
Idan Shtivi declared killed on Oct. 7; body held by Hamas	Idan Shtivi, previously thought to be held captive by Hamas, was killed on Oct. 7, and his body is still being held by the terror group, according to a joint announcement by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum and the Petah Tikva municipality. Shtivi's family received the devastating news Sunday night from IDF officials. He leaves behind his parents, three siblings, and his partner, Stav. 'Idan had a passion for nature, photography, and animals' (sharkandstitch photography) The forum shared, 'Idan Shtivi, 28, had a passion for nature, photography, and animals. He shared a deep connection with dogs and other animals, and was set to begin his second year studying sustainability and government at Reichman University. Idan consistently put others first, often sacrificing his own interests for the sake of others.' On the morning of Oct. 7, Shtivi arrived at the Nova Music Festival to document his friends' performances and workshops, but never made it inside. As the attack unfolded, he helped two strangers – a man and a woman he had just met at the site entrance – to escape. This selfless act ultimately led to his death and capture.

Iran 'evil empire,' Israeli leader tells Saudi television	In a wide-ranging interview with Al-Arabiya News, President Isaac Herzog discussed the ongoing conflict in Gaza, tensions with Iran, and his vision for the future of the Middle East. Speaking on the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack, Herzog emphasized Israel's commitment to regional stability while defending its actions in Gaza.

He accused Tehran of fueling conflicts across the region through its proxies, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen. Herzog argued that Iran's actions are not only a threat to Israel but to the entire world, citing the disruption of global shipping in the Red Sea as an example. 'Iran is the only country in the world who calls for the eradication of another member state of the United Nations,' Herzog stated, emphasizing the existential threat Israel faces. When questioned about the international community's shifting perception of Israel over the past year, Herzog staunchly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. He insisted that Israel adheres to international humanitarian law and that any instances of misconduct by soldiers are thoroughly investigated and prosecuted. The president acknowledged the suffering of Palestinian civilians but placed the blame squarely on Hamas, accusing the group of using civilian infrastructure to hide weapons and launch attacks. 'We care for the pain of our neighbors,' Herzog said, 'but we have the right to defend ourselves.' Looking ahead, Herzog emphasized the need for a 'day after' plan for Gaza. He expressed hope that regional leaders would be involved in shaping a better future for both Gazans and Israelis. The president drew parallels to Israel's 2005 disengagement from Gaza, lamenting that the vision of creating a 'Hong Kong of the Middle East' was derailed by Hamas's takeover. Herzog called for a 'NATO-like structure' in the region to combat radicalism and promote peace. He highlighted the potential for cooperation between Israel and moderate Arab states, referencing the connectivity plan proposed by President Biden before the October 7 attack.

He expressed concern over Hezbollah's actions, accusing the group of violating international resolutions and putting Lebanon at risk. Regarding Iran's recent missile attack on Israel on Tuesday, Herzog described it as 'extremely unpleasant' but refrained from providing details on potential retaliation. He emphasized ongoing dialogue with the United States on strategic and operational considerations.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/06/iran-evil-empire-israeli-leader-tells-saudi-television/	2024-10-06T04:08:32-07:00
