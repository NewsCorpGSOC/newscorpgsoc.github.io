IDF assessment: Sinwar alive, using hostages as human shields	Security sources report that Yahya Sinwar – the top Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip – has been out of contact for some time, prompting an investigation into the cause of his silence. Current assessments indicate that Sinwar is alive and using hostages as human shields. However, authorities are exploring other scenarios, particularly given Israel's recent bombing campaign targeting tunnels in areas where Sinwar was believed to be hiding. Video: Yahyah Sinwar flees in the tunnel at the start of war / Credit: IDF At present, there is no evidence suggesting Sinwar is dead, apart from his prolonged silence. It's important to note that throughout the war, there have been substantial periods when Sinwar was incommunicado, either due to being on the move or deliberately choosing to cut off contact for strategic reasons.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/23/idf-intel-sinwar-alive-using-hostages-as-human-shields/	2024-09-22T20:00:06-07:00	
WATCH: IDF eliminates terrorists caught looting Gaza aid convoy	The IDF eliminated Saturday several armed terrorists caught looting a humanitarian aid convoy in the Gaza Strip. During the mission to secure the humanitarian corridor for Gaza civilians, troops from the Tzabar Battalion of the Givati Brigade identified armed terrorists looting an aid truck. In a swift response, forces guided drones to locate the operatives who had fled in a vehicle. The terrorists were then eliminated by an Israeli Air Force aircraft, as well as an additional operative who had attempted to escape. בניסיון השתלטות על משאיות הומנטיריות: כך לוחמי גבעתי סגרו מעגל ברפיח לכל הפרטים: pic.twitter.com/R9luSS3CAM — צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) September 21, 2024 In recent weeks, Givati Brigade forces have been operating in the Rafah area, having eliminated dozens of Hamas terrorists, uncovered numerous weapons caches, and destroyed terror cells and tunnel networks used to attack Israeli civilians. The IAF conducted precision strikes on about 20 terror targets across the strip in the past day. Targets included terror cells, military structures, and groups of terrorists planning attacks against Israel. In the afternoon, a surgical strike was carried out on a Hamas command and control center established in a former school building in Gaza City. Acting on intelligence from the Military Intelligence Directorate and Southern Command, the IDF eliminated Mohammad Mansour, a key Hamas figure described as a significant technological asset in the terror group's military intelligence. Several other Hamas operatives who had orchestrated attacks against IDF forces were also eliminated.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/22/watch-idf-eliminates-terrorists-caught-looting-gaza-aid-convoy/	2024-09-21T21:01:41-07:00	
Israeli FM's gaffe about Jesus sparks online fury	Hundreds took to social media platform X after the Israeli Foreign Ministry made a factual error about Jesus' birthplace in a post on their account titled 'Israel,' and then corrected it. Nazareth, the hometown of Jesus, is under attack by Hezbollah. The Israeli town, also known as 'the Arab capital of Israel,' has a population that is around 70% Muslim and 30% Christian. pic.twitter.com/OiJSuOq6BO — Israel ישראל (@Israel) September 22, 2024 Early Sunday, Israeli northern cities suffered a major attack by the Lebanese terror organization Hezbollah, with over 100 rockets being launched. One affected city was Nazareth – known for its large Arab population and significant Christian minority (about 30% of its residents) – where rocket debris caused a fire. Lmfao you guys are something else. pic.twitter.com/L2e85G5lye — Assaf, MD (@_Assaf_MD) September 22, 2024 The account reported the attack, initially saying 'Nazareth, the birthplace of Jesus, is under attack by Hezbollah.' The post was also accompanied by a photo showing a fire in Nazareth, which was later clarified to be from a previous incident, not the current attack. Users quickly responded with comments criticizing the account's admin for its lack of knowledge, as well as referring to it as a 'propaganda fail.' 'The idiots running this official account don't even know the birthplace of Jesus is Bethlehem,' one comment said. 'Another day another propaganda fail,' another user added. The ongoing online battle between anti-Israel users and pro-Israel users is nothing new, yet some comments even targeted Jews, saying: 'Why are you flexing Jesus? Didn't your people kill him?' Video: Interceptions over Nazareth The Foreign Ministry swiftly corrected the post, mentioning Nazareth as Jesus' hometown, but not quickly enough to avert the current social media buzz.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/22/israeli-fms-gaffe-about-jesus-sparks-online-fury/	2024-09-21T18:00:30-07:00	
8 injured after antitank missiles hit northern border; 2 in serio...	Anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) struck the Ramim ridge in northern Israel early Thursday morning, causing casualties and prompting swift retaliation from Israeli forces. The attack, which occurred around 8:05 AM local time, saw two ATGMs hit the Upper Galilee region, marking a dangerous new phase in the ongoing border conflict. Eight injured were reported, including two who were treated for severe wounded. Video: An attack on a chicken coop in northern Israel, Sept. 19, 2024 The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) immediately responded with artillery fire into Lebanon, signaling a rapid intensification of cross-border exchanges. Additional ATGM impacts in Tel Hai were also reported. The recent attack from Lebanon comes as Israel anticipates Hezbollah's response to the mysterious explosions all across Lebanon that involved detonations of pagers held by its members, with many speculating this was an Israeli covert operation. Dozens of terrorists were killed and thousands injured In the hours following the missile attacks, the IDF launched a series of retaliatory strikes. An IDF spokesperson announced that overnight air operations targeted Hezbollah military structures in several areas of southern Lebanon, including Shiheen, Al-Taybeh, Blida, Mays al-Jabal, Aytaroun, and Kfar Kila. The air force also struck an arms depot used by Hezbollah in the Al-Khiam area. The escalation wasn't limited to the northern border. Israeli naval vessels reportedly shelled the coast of Gaza City, while Palestinian sources reported two airstrikes in Gaza's Zeitoun neighborhood, accompanied by artillery barrages.

A senior U.S. official, speaking to the Wall Street Journal, said they were worried the situation could be 'spiraling out of control.' However, other sources emphasized that Israel has not yet taken actions indicative of an imminent ground incursion into Lebanon, such as mobilizing reservists to the area. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin discussed the evolving crisis in both Lebanon and Gaza with his Israeli counterpart. According to a Pentagon spokesperson, Austin's stance prioritizes achieving a deal for the release of hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza, as well as pursuing a diplomatic solution for the Lebanese border conflict. פגיעת הנ'ט בלול במרגליות pic.twitter.com/EtpRB8CA6Z — ישראל היום (@IsraelHayomHeb) September 19, 2024 As tensions continue to rise, local authorities in the Golan Heights have decided to proceed with regular school activities, following a security assessment with regional military commands.

UN backs Palestinian arms embargo call against Israel	On Wednesday, the United Nations General Assembly approved a Palestinian resolution urging sanctions and an arms embargo against Israel. The proposal also included a demand from the Palestinian Authority for Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza within a year. The resolution passed with 124 countries in favor, 14 against, and 43 abstentions. It's important to note that General Assembly resolutions are non-binding and will not directly lead to actions or sanctions against Israel. Israel's Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, condemned the vote, saying, 'This is a shameful decision that backs the Palestinian Authority's diplomatic terrorism. Instead of marking the anniversary of the October 7 massacre by condemning Hamas and calling for the release of all 101 of the remaining hostages, the General Assembly continues to dance to the music of the Palestinian Authority, which backs the Hamas murderers.'

Among those abstaining were Germany, Britain, Italy, Australia, Canada, Ethiopia, Albania, and Bulgaria. Notably, Britain abstained despite its new Labor government, and Australia abstained despite its government's critical stance towards Israel. Other abstaining countries included Ukraine, Serbia, Slovakia, South Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Nepal, the Netherlands, Korea, Romania, Lithuania, Georgia, Guatemala, Haiti, and Kenya. As reported by Israel Hayom, the Palestinian delegation to the UN submitted a draft resolution earlier this month for voting in the General Assembly. The resolution calls for implementing the International Court of Justice's decision and includes a six-month timeline for withdrawal from 'Palestinian territories,' a call for an arms embargo on 'settlements,' and sanctions against Israeli officials.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/18/un-backs-palestinian-arms-embargo-call-against-israel/	2024-09-18T00:00:51-07:00	
First female KIA in Iron Swords War	In a somber development, Sgt. Agam Naim, a 20-year-old paramedic from Kibbutz Mishmarot, became the first female soldier to fall in combat in Gaza during Israel's ongoing Swords of Iron War. Naim, a paramedic in the 52nd Battalion of the Iron Tracks Brigade (401), died in a building explosion in Gaza alongside three IDF soldiers. She is survived by her parents and two sisters. Staff Sgt. Dotan Shimon (21) from Elazar, Staff Sgt. Agam Naim (20) from Mishmarot, Staff Sgt. Amit Bakri (21) from Yoshivia, and Cpt. Daniel Mimon Toaff (23) from Moreshet were killed in action in Gaza yesterday. ▸Sgt. Bakari is the first female soldier to be killed… pic.twitter.com/hKrMMWzjR5 — Jewish News Syndicate (@JNS_org) September 18, 2024 Dorit, Agam's mother, recently shared her concerns about her daughter's service: 'Agam was summoned for the paramedics course. We were overjoyed – maybe she'd become a doctor someday. Isn't that worth it? She graduated with honors and was assigned to the Armored Corps. Two days after finishing the course, she was already in Gaza with the Engineering Corps. We stopped breathing, stopped sleeping. Life changed; I suddenly experienced panic attacks that came without warning.' Dorit continued, 'At home, it was manageable, but one day it happened at the kindergarten. Agam called to say she was going in. I wasn't prepared; she wasn't supposed to deploy for a few more days. It was a sharp pain, like a knife twisting in my heart, stomach, throughout my entire body.' 'We choose to live in hope. May all our soldiers return safely, may the hostages come back soon – but very soon, may my own child return home, healthy in body and spirit. May the war end, and we return to normalcy. Amen. My Agami, I'm proud of you, child. I'm waiting for you, my love,' Dorit concluded. Yarin, Agam's sister, wrote in her eulogy: 'My Agami, the most beautiful girl in kindergarten – the purest, smartest, most cheerful, most sociable, bravest, most excellent. The simplest of all. Before I left, we talked, and you promised to take care of yourself. But each time, you reminded us that if not you, there would be no one to do your job. No one to protect the soldiers and treat them. My hero, a true hero.' Yarin added, 'You were the little sister in the family but always acted as if you were a decade ahead of everyone. We always laughed about how they mixed up our ages, and you were actually older than me. You had such an aura that everyone in the room would smile when you entered. Your smile was contagious. You were 20, and in three days, you were supposed to turn 21. And you'll always remain 20.' Mariel, Agam Naim's aunt, recounted with anguish: 'Agam was a paramedic, assigned to an armored battalion after finishing her course. She graduated with honors, so they placed her at the forefront. For the past six months, she was in Gaza, sometimes with the Engineering Corps, sometimes with the Givati Brigade. The parents worried, of course – how could they not? Her father is a bereaved brother, so he worried twice as much. There were many concerns. She's a daughter, she's a child, she didn't have to go, but she really wanted to enter Gaza. She's the youngest – the youngest of three.' 'She was the most beautiful, the happiest, the most talented. She volunteered with Magen David Adom, did a year of service, and worked with post-hospitalization youth. They took the most exceptional one,' Mariel continued. 'The truth is, she wasn't supposed to return to Gaza. She was accepted to instruct in the paramedics course and was set to begin. Last weekend, she was home sick. The commander told her she didn't have to return and could stay home before starting her instruction role. She said she didn't want to leave without saying goodbye to her comrades. So she went in for just three more days. She entered on Monday.' IDF forces in Gaza (Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit) IDF Spokesperson's Unit The Paramedics Organization also paid tribute: 'The Paramedics Organization mourns the fall in battle of Agam Naim, 20, from Mishmarot, a combat paramedic in the 52nd Battalion of the Armored Corps. Agam, one of the pioneers serving as a paramedic in a combat role, stood at the front lines of the battles in the Gaza Strip in a position requiring a unique combination of courage, dedication, and boundless professionalism. Agam was there to fight for the lives of her unit comrades, carrying an enormous responsibility to treat and save lives in the most challenging field conditions. Even today, almost a year into the war, we must remember that it is only thanks to our finest daughters and sons, fighters like Agam, who gave their lives, that the citizens of Israel sit safely in their land. May her soul be bound in the bond of life. May her memory be a blessing.' Mali Kaplan, principal of the Mevo'ot Iron educational institution where Agam studied, eulogized her: 'Agam, a graduate of Mevo'ot Iron, excelled in every field she touched. She was an outstanding student, studied biology and computer science, and even completed a final project in social sciences. Agam was active in the boarding school and youth society of Mevo'ot Iron and was also a member and counselor in the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement.' Kaplan added, 'Upon completing her studies, Agam received a social excellence certificate for her role as a counselor in Hashomer Hatzair. After graduation, Agam chose to do a year of service at 'Pnimiyat Adanim' in Beit Kama, working with youth discharged from hospitals. She aspired to be a paramedic and served in the 52nd Battalion, Iron Tracks Brigade, out of a desire to contribute as much as possible to society. Agam was always surrounded by friends, patient with everyone, and kind-hearted. We are in pain and mourning. This is a tremendous loss for the staff, students, and alumni of Mevo'ot Iron. We embrace and share in the sorrow of her parents, Dorit and Dudi, her sisters, and the entire family.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/18/israel-mourns-first-female-soldier-killed-in-gaza/	2024-09-17T23:00:25-07:00	
Gaza pride parade can get you $1 million	Are you interested in earning $1 million? A watchdog organization has announced a provocative $1 million offer to any US LGBTQ advocacy group willing to host a gay pride parade in Gaza or the West Bank, Fox News reported. The New Tolerance Campaign (NTC) says the initiative is designed to be a 'wake-up call' to groups like 'Queers for Palestine' that have emerged since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Gregory T. Angelo, president of NTC and former president of Log Cabin Republicans, told Fox News Digital, 'I don't want people to just shrug off this campaign as some kind of publicity stunt or something that is supposed to be comical. It actually is a legitimate offer.' The campaign aims to highlight the stark contrast in LGBTQ rights between Israel and Palestinian territories, where homosexuality remains deeply taboo and LGBTQ individuals often face severe persecution. 'This campaign emerged to call out these purported advocates of LGBT equality and put our money where their mouths are,' Angelo continued. He added that the offer could either expose the challenging conditions for LGBTQ people in Palestinian territories or potentially serve as a 'breakthrough moment for pluralism and peace in the Middle East.' NTC plans to promote the campaign using mobile billboards near Columbia University, the Human Rights Campaign headquarters in Washington, DC, and UCLA. The organization has also set up a system for Americans to directly message leaders of prominent LGBTQ rights groups, encouraging them to advocate for LGBTQ rights in Palestinian territories and Arab countries. Students meet ahead of a midnight deadline set by Columbia President for student protesters to disband the protest encampment at Columbia University in New York City, U.S., April 23, 2024. Photo credit: REUTERS/Caitlin REUTERS Angelo criticized what he sees as a tendency on the left to equate all forms of oppression, telling Fox News, 'On the left in the United States, all oppression is the same oppression. And I think the left, quite to their disservice, lumps everything from racial discrimination to sexual orientation discrimination to gender discrimination to Islamophobia, all under the same umbrella. That's certainly not the case.' He contrasted the legal protections and social acceptance for LGBTQ individuals in the US with the situation in Palestinian territories, where same-sex marriage is not recognized and there are no employment protections based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The campaign comes against a backdrop of ongoing tension in the region. In 2019, Palestinian Authority police banned a gay and transgender rights group from holding events in the West Bank and threatened to arrest participants. Meanwhile, Israel has actively promoted its tolerance of LGBTQ issues, with Tel Aviv known as a popular destination for gay and lesbian travelers, especially during the time of the annual parade. The New Tolerance Campaign describes itself as a 'watchdog organization mobilizing Americans to confront intolerance double-standards by establishment institutions, civil rights groups, universities, and socially-conscious brands.' Its website states that 'NTC action campaigns empower ordinary Americans to hold accountable self-proclaimed arbiters of tolerance when they betray their own stated values.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/18/gaza-pride-parade-can-get-you-1-million/	2024-09-17T20:00:26-07:00

Iran envoy to Lebanon loses eye, severely injured	Iranian state media reported Tuesday that Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was injured in the Hezbollah communication devices explosions. The incident has brought renewed attention to the close ties between Iran and the Lebanon-based terror group, with implications for regional security and diplomacy. div]:bg-bg-300 [&_pre]:-mr-4 md:[&_pre]:-mr-9'> _*]:min-w-0'> Additionally, sources in the Revolutionary Guards told The New York Times that Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amini, lost one eye and was severely injured in his second eye during the explosions in Beirut yesterday. The Guards members also said that his injuries were more severe than Iran initially reported and that he will be transferred for medical treatment in Tehran. Video: Iran's ambassador being evacuated after injury According to the Iranian news agency Fars, Ambassador Amani suffered superficial injuries and was evacuated to the hospital. His wife reportedly stated that he was lightly injured. The Al-Mayadeen channel, which is close to Hezbollah, reported that Amani 'was not carrying a pager,' but was injured by the explosion of a device carried by one of his escorts. Video: The scene of one of the explosions in Lebanon The reports did not specify whether the explosion involved a device Amani was carrying himself. If so, it would serve as evidence of Iran's deep involvement in Hezbollah's activities. Amani is considered one of the most important liaisons between the Tehran government and the organization in Lebanon. Previously, it was estimated that Hezbollah hosted meetings at the Iranian embassy. Concurrently, reports emerged of Hezbollah operatives being injured in Syria due to similar explosions. An official source stated that in total, at least 1,000 members were wounded in various areas across Lebanon.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/17/iran-envoy-to-lebanon-wounded-in-hezbollah-blasts/	2024-09-17T07:39:13-07:00	
Israel expands war goals	In an overnight session spanning Monday to Tuesday, the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet amended its war goals to incorporate a crucial new objective: facilitating the secure return of northern residents to their homes. The move could further fuel speculation that Israel may be heading toward an escalation in the north, as it comes just hours after it was reported that a major reshuffle could be underway that would include replacing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who has had odds with Netanyahu over the conduct of the war.

Israel will continue to act to implement this objective,' the Prime Minister's Office said on X. This strategic pivot, spearheaded by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, emerges not only in response to growing public concern but also due to mounting political pressure. Key figures driving this change include Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and former war cabinet minister Benny Gantz.

Instagram introduces 'Teen Accounts' with enhanced privacy featur...	Instagram is set to launch a new initiative aimed at bolstering privacy and safety measures for its teenage users. The social media platform, owned by Meta, will begin automatically placing teens into 'teen accounts' with built-in restrictions and enhanced parental controls. Naomi Gleit, head of product at Meta, explained the rationale behind the move: 'Everyone under 18, creators included, will be put into teen accounts,' she told NBC News. 'They can remain public if their parent is involved and gives them permission and is supervising the account. But these are pretty big changes that we need to get right.' The new accounts will limit messaging, tagging, and mentions to only those individuals the teen already follows. This represents Meta's most significant effort to date in managing how minors interact with the platform. The initiative comes in the wake of recent controversies surrounding child safety on social media platforms. In January, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg issued an apology to parents during a Senate hearing on online child safety, where some testified that Instagram had contributed to their children's suicides or exploitation. While Meta has previously introduced various opt-in restrictions for teen users, including parental supervision controls, their application has been inconsistent. Gleit acknowledged the feedback received from parents, citing simplicity, consistency, and increased control as key areas of focus for this launch. The rollout of teen accounts will be gradual. New users under 18 will be automatically placed into these accounts upon sign-up, but existing teen users may not see immediate changes. According to Meta, many users worldwide won't be transitioned to teen accounts until next year. Parental supervision feature in Instagram's 'Teen Accounts.' Screenshot: fb.com fb.com Teen accounts will also feature the most restrictive content settings, limiting potentially sensitive material from unfollowed accounts. The Hidden Words feature will be activated by default, automatically filtering offensive words or phrases from comments and direct messages. Users under 16 will require parental or guardian permission to modify their teen account settings, while those over 16 can adjust settings independently unless their accounts are linked to parental supervision. Anticipating attempts to circumvent these measures, Meta plans to implement various age verification methods. These include requesting government IDs or video selfies when users attempt to create new accounts on the same device. The company is also developing AI technology to predict whether users claiming to be adults might actually be teens, based on behavioral signals such as account creation date, content interactions, and writing style. Gleit declined to provide detailed information about this technology, citing concerns that teens might learn to bypass detection tools. The age prediction tools are scheduled for testing in the US early next year. For parents utilizing supervision controls, new features will allow them to view their teens' messaging contacts – without reading the actual conversations – and see topics of interest selected by their teens for the Explore page. Additional features include a 'Sleep Mode' replacing the existing Quiet Mode and Night Nudges, which will silence notifications from 10 pm to 7 am. Teen accounts will also receive 'Daily Limit' prompts encouraging app closure after 60 minutes of use. To prevent misuse of parental controls, Meta will implement restrictions on teen account supervision and limit the number of teen accounts one person can oversee. Gleit emphasized the company's approach: 'We think parents know their teens best, and so I don't think that all of those controls are necessarily right for everyone, but we want to give parents the options to choose what's right for their child.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/17/instagram-introduces-teen-accounts-with-enhanced-privacy-features/	2024-09-16T20:30:44-07:00	
Ukraine says it hit Russian base in Syria	Ukraine's Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR) special forces conducted an operation against a Russian military base in Syria on Sunday according to a source in Ukrainian military intelligence who spoke to the Kyiv Post. The attack targeted a facility on the southeastern outskirts of Aleppo, where Russian forces were reportedly manufacturing and testing strike UAVs. The Kyiv Post obtained exclusive footage of the operation, which shows a HUR flag visible behind a berm near a garage used as a Russian base. The video, filmed by an intelligence officer, captures an explosion at the Russian facility followed by the detonation of ammunition. Military and explosive experts who examined the footage for the Kyiv Post suggested that the explosion was likely triggered by a rifle shot rather than an RPG, possibly striking pre-planted explosives inside the facility. The targeted base was allegedly used by Russian forces to produce 'camouflaged improvised explosive devices' and store their warheads, according to HUR. This operation is part of a series of strikes carried out by Ukrainian special forces against Russian military targets in Syria. In June, the Ukrainian special forces attacked enemy positions in Syria's Golan Heights. Russia's involvement in Syria dates back to 2015 when it intervened to support President Bashar al-Assad's regime during the civil war. This intervention led to the permanent deployment of thousands of Russian troops in the country. However, in the fall of last year, Moscow reportedly transferred some of these forces to Ukraine, potentially weakening their presence in Syria. The prolonged Russian presence in Syria has resulted in the establishment of recruitment centers for Syrian mercenaries to fight in Ukraine. Lt Gen Kyrylo Budanov, chief of HUR, stated in May 2023 that they would 'destroy Russian war criminals anywhere in the world they may be.' This commitment extends beyond Syria, with Ukrainian HUR special forces reportedly targeting pro-Kremlin Wagner mercenaries in Sudan and other parts of Africa.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/17/ukraine-says-it-hit-russian-base-in-syria/	2024-09-16T20:30:25-07:00	
Is Iran about to end hijab rules?	Iran's newly appointed president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has indicated that the country's morality police will no longer 'bother' women over the mandatory hijab headscarf, according to a report by the BBC. The statement comes just days after the United Nations cautioned that women in Iran were still facing violent punishment for violating the strict dress code. Pezeshkian's comments, made during his first press conference since taking office in July, coincided with the second anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death in police custody. Amini, 22, was arrested for allegedly not wearing the hijab properly, an incident that sparked nationwide protests in 2022. Responding to a female reporter who mentioned taking detours to avoid police vans on her way to the press conference, Pezeshkian stated, 'The morality police were not supposed to confront [women]. I will follow up so they don't bother [them].' The exchange, broadcast live on major state TV networks including rolling news channel IRINN, has since gone viral online. The president's remarks suggest a potential shift in the enforcement of Iran's mandatory hijab law. During his election campaign, Pezeshkian pledged to oppose police patrols enforcing the headscarf requirement and vowed to ease some of the country's long-standing internet controls. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian (Majid Saeedi/Getty Images) Getty Images However, the UN's latest fact-finding mission paints a different picture. In a report released last week, the UN stated that Iran's government had 'intensified efforts' to suppress women's rights and crush activism since the 2022 protests. The report noted that authorities have 'enhanced surveillance of hijab compliance' in both public and private environments while escalating violence in punishing women and girls who break the rules. The UN mission also highlighted that a 'Hijab and Chastity' bill is in the final stages of approval before Iran's Guardian Council. If passed, the legislation would introduce harsher penalties for women who do not wear the mandatory hijab, including substantial fines, longer prison sentences, restrictions on work and educational opportunities, and travel bans. Despite these concerns, there were signs of a potentially more relaxed attitude at Pezeshkian's press conference, where some female journalists wore loose head coverings. This marked a departure from previous official events where full hijab was typically required for female journalists, the BBC reported. Pezeshkian, who became president after his predecessor died in a helicopter crash, is viewed as a potentially reformist leader. His comments on the morality police and hijab enforcement have sparked discussions about possible changes in Iran's approach to women's rights and personal freedoms. As Iran grapples with these internal issues, the international community continues to monitor the situation closely. The contrast between Pezeshkian's statements and the UN's findings highlights the complex and evolving nature of Iran's social and political landscape.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/17/iran-signals-shift-on-hijab-enforcement/	2024-09-16T18:30:16-07:00

A heated debate has erupted on social media over recent changes made to the Wikipedia entry for Zionism, sparking accusations of historical revisionism. Users on social media have over the past several 24 hours, posted a comparison between the 2023 and 2024 versions of the Wikipedia page, with one online user, Liv Lovisa, claiming that 'history is being rewritten.' Blake Flayton, a vocal commentator on Jewish and Israeli issues, responded to the post, calling the changes 'egregious' and urging someone with expertise to edit the page to reflect what he considers a more accurate portrayal.

The 2023 version of the page framed Zionism as a nationalist movement born in the 19th century that sought to secure Jewish self-determination. In contrast, the 2024 version of the entry introduces more charged terminology, describing Zionism as an 'ethno-cultural nationalist' movement that engaged in 'colonization of a land outside of Europe,' with a heightened focus on the resulting conflicts with Palestinian Arabs. 'Zionists wanted to create a Jewish state in Palestine with as much land, as many Jews, and as few Palestinian Arabs as possible,' it writes. Wikipedia lets editors who have gained status on its platform to change things according to various guidelines, which usually ensure that there is a balanced approach. It is unclear what led to the sudden change in the defintion, and whether this was a result of more weight given to pro-Palestinian users. On its website, Wikipedia says the following on its policies: 'Wikipedia has no central editorial board. Contributions are made by a large number of volunteers at their own discretion. Edits are neither the responsibility of the Wikimedia Foundation (the organization that hosts the site) nor of its staff, and edits will not generally be made in response to an email request.' The Wikipedia page for Zionism; 2023 vs 2024. History is being rewritten. pic.twitter.com/8pglmWJKBB — Liv Lovisa (@eljest_) September 16, 2024 Critics, including Flayton, argue that this new language unfairly distorts the historical narrative, positioning Zionism in a more negative light by drawing parallels to colonialism and downplaying the movement's core goal of creating a safe homeland for Jewish people. The use of the term 'colonization,' in particular, has been a flashpoint, as it evokes a political context that some feel misrepresents the motivations behind the establishment of Israel and overlooks the historical persecution faced by Jews that led to the Zionist movement. Another Twitter pro-Israel voice, Hen Mazzig, wrote: The new Wikipedia entry on Zionism isn't just inaccurate, it's downright antisemitic. It asserts that the origin of Ashkenazi Jews is 'highly debated and enigmatic,' echoing Khazar theory, the dangerous lie that Ashkenazi Jews are converts and not descendants of the Jews exiled from the Land of Israel.' He added, 'This theory is often weaponized to call Israelis 'colonizers' and thus dehumanize us. In fact, Jewish history of repeated exile and migration from Israel to Europe is incredibly well-docmented, as are genetic studies linking our people to the Middle East. Any balanced article discussing Jewish genetics and Israel would mention that. @Wikipedia has become a hate site. I hope they'll change course.' This is disgusting and it throws Wikipedia's entire project of neutrality and accuracy into question. — Brianna Wu (@BriannaWu) September 16, 2024 > The uproar underscores broader concerns about the influence of Wikipedia, one of the most visited websites in the world, and the potential for bias or misinterpretation in politically sensitive topics like Zionism. As a public, user-edited platform, Wikipedia is often subject to scrutiny, especially when it comes to contentious issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With millions of readers relying on the site for information, changes to entries like these can have significant implications for public understanding of historical events and modern geopolitical debates. Israel Hayom has yet to receive a response from Wikipedia. What on earth is going on at @Wikipedia? The current state of the entry for 'Zionism' is beyond appalling.

Hamas mastermind's low-tech means to stay alive	Hamas's top leader Yahya Sinwar has managed to elude Israeli intelligence and military efforts to locate him, thanks to a low-tech communications system developed during his time in prison, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. The system, which relies heavily on handwritten notes and a network of couriers, has allowed Sinwar to direct Hamas operations while hiding in underground tunnels in Gaza. This method has frustrated Israeli attempts to track and target the mastermind behind the October 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Arab cease-fire mediators have provided insight into Sinwar's communication methods. A typical message from the Hamas leader is handwritten and passed through a chain of trusted couriers, some of whom may be civilians. The messages often use complex codes that vary depending on the recipient, circumstances, and timing. The Israeli military declined to comment on the matter, while Hamas did not respond to questions about Sinwar's communication methods. Sinwar's approach to evading detection has become increasingly sophisticated following Israeli strikes that killed other high-ranking Hamas and Hezbollah officials. The assassination of Saleh al-Arouri, Hamas's deputy political leader, in Beirut prompted Sinwar to further tighten his security measures. Palestinian men walk along a narrow street past destroyed buildings in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip on June 11, 2024 (AFP / Eyad Baba) AFP / Eyad Baba The rudimentary communication system has its roots in Hamas' early years and was refined during Sinwar's time in Israeli prisons. As the founder of Hamas's internal security police, Majd, Sinwar developed methods for distributing encoded messages within prisons, including wrapping letters in bread balls that could be tossed between prison sections. Israel estimates that Sinwar spent years planning for a major conflict, including the construction of an extensive tunnel network and the establishment of a communication system designed to circumvent modern intelligence gathering techniques. The effectiveness of Sinwar's methods has made it difficult for Israeli forces to confirm his location, with some speculating that he may not even be in Gaza. His role has become increasingly crucial following the reported assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's former political leader, in Tehran – an attack attributed to Israel. Sinwar's cautious approach has at times slowed negotiations to end the war, which has resulted in the deaths of more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials. Hamas-led fighters took about 250 people hostage in the October 7 attacks, with 97 still remaining in Gaza, many believed to be dead. Despite the challenges posed by his communication methods, Sinwar has managed to relay messages quickly when necessary. For example, he sent a condolence letter to Haniyeh within hours of an Israeli airstrike that killed three of Haniyeh's sons in April. The Hamas leader's ability to evade detection highlights the limitations of even the most sophisticated intelligence-gathering techniques when faced with determined low-tech counter-measures. As Thomas Withington, an expert on electronic warfare and an associate research fellow at London's Royal United Services Institute think tank, noted, 'That split second where you forget discipline, that can sign your death warrant.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/16/exposed-hamas-masterminds-low-tech-means-stay-alive/	2024-09-16T06:22:07-07:00	
Reshuffle likely underway	Likud party insiders reported Monday that negotiations with New Hope — The National Right party leader Gideon Sa'ar have made substantial headway. They suggest that the primary hurdle to forming a government with Sa'ar hinges on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision regarding Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's future – a decision yet to be finalized despite the strained relationship between the two. Likud sources hint at a possible rotation agreement for the defense portfolio between Sa'ar and Foreign Minister Israel Katz, with Katz becoming defense minister and Sa'ar becoming foreign minister, until a later point in which they would swap. Sa'ar's office has remained tight-lipped, stating simply: 'There is nothing new.' Political observers speculate that New Hope MK Zeev Elkin might be tapped for the health minister position. Will Gideon Sa'ar become defense minister during the war? (Photo: Oren Ben Hakoon) Oren Ben Hakoon Netanyahu's office swiftly dismissed the reports saying, 'The claims regarding negotiations with Gideon Sa'ar are inaccurate.' The Shas Haredi party echoed this sentiment. However, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum reacted with fury, 'Appointing Gideon Sa'ar as defense minister would be tantamount to the prime minister admitting he has abandoned the hostages for good,' they said. Netanyahu appears to be in no rush to oust Gallant and opposes the idea of moving Israel Katz from the Foreign Ministry to accommodate Sa'ar. Sources close to the prime minister argue it's illogical to sideline Katz, a party loyalist, while rewarding Gallant, who has taken opposing stances to Netanyahu. Gallant's office has yet to comment, though insiders suggest there might be some truth to the reports. The government and Likud are keen to bring Sa'ar back into the fold to broaden the Coalition, hoping Gallant's potential exit might resolve conscription disputes with ultra-Orthodox parties. The question remains whether Sa'ar would be amenable to compromises on conscription – compromises Gallant rejected, leading to the current impasse. Government officials believe Sa'ar's security stance aligns more closely with the majority of the cabinet than Gallant's does. In a candid interview with Israel Hayom just before his March resignation, Sa'ar stated: 'Had I pledged support for the conscription law, I'd be sitting in the War Cabinet today. Naturally, I declined. Our principles and values are not up for negotiation.' He elaborated: 'Various offers were on the table. Some fell short of an adequate alternative to the War Cabinet, while others came with strings attached that I couldn't accept. I believe my demand was reasonable – after all, in this administration, all party leaders either hold portfolios or sit on the War Cabinet.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/16/major-reshuffle-reportedly-in-the-works-amid-netanyahu-gallant-tensions/	2024-09-16T04:02:40-07:00	
Female hunger strike in Tehran honors Mahsa Amini	A group of 34 female prisoners at Tehran's Evin Prison began a hunger strike Sunday, commemorating the second anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death in police custody, which sparked nationwide protests in Iran. According to VOA News, an Instagram account linked to jailed Nobel peace laureate Narges Monammadi announced the hunger strike, describing it as marking the anniversary of the 'Woman, Life, Freedom' movement and Amini's death. Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died on Sept 16, 2022, days after being detained by Iran's morality police for allegedly violating the country's mandatory hijab law. Her death ignited widespread protests throughout Iran, with demonstrations erupting in streets, universities, and schools that persisted for months. The government's response to the 2022 protests resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries and arrests, as reported by VOA News. People hold up a photo of Iranian woman Mahsa Amini as they participate in a protest against Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi outside of the United Nations on Sept. 21, 2022 in New York City (Stephanie Keith/Getty Images/AFP) AFP On the anniversary, the Kurdistan Human Rights Network reported that Ministry of Intelligence officials have surrounded the home of Amini's parents in Saqqez. The officials allegedly threatened the family and forbade them from leaving their house or visiting their daughter's grave. In western and northwestern Iranian cities, including Sanandaj, Saqqez, Divandarreh, Mahabad, and Bukan, tradespeople and shopkeepers are reportedly staging a strike to mark the anniversary. Amini's mother, Mozhgan Eftekhari, took to Instagram to address those responsible for her daughter's death. 'They will be eternally disgraced in history,' she declared. Reflecting on the events of two years ago, Eftekhari emphasized that Mahsa Amini was seized by 'those dark-hearted individuals who could not tolerate the beauty of their nation's daughter' during her trip to the capital. The family had alleged that Amini was beaten in the police van after her arrest. Police rejected these allegations, stating that Amini died after being taken to a hospital due to a heart attack. However, her family disputes this claim, according to VOA News. As the anniversary renews focus on Iran's human rights record and the ongoing tensions between the government and civil society, the international community continues to watch developments closely.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/16/female-prisoners-on-hunger-strike-to-mark-mahsa-amini-death-anniversary/	2024-09-15T18:30:30-07:00	
IDF says it accidentally killed 3 hostages in 2023	The IDF disclosed Sunday that the families of hostages Sergeant Ron Sherman, Corporal Nik Beizer, and Elia Toledano – who were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip on October 7 from the Nova rave – have been officially informed of the news that their loved ones were killed as a result of IDF fire, months after their bodies were found. The three hostage who were killed by IDF fire (Courtesy) Courtesy Military officials briefed the families on the findings of an investigation, providing the first confirmation that the hostages died due to an IDF strike. At that time, it was reported that the pathological examination could not conclusively determine the cause of death for two of the hostages. The IDF has now presented the families with key findings from the pathological report and details surrounding the recovery of the bodies. Military officials emphasized to the bereaved families that during the operation in the underground area where the strike occurred, there was no intelligence indicating the presence of hostages at the location. The remains of two of the deceased were retrieved from a Hamas tunnel during an IDF operation in Jabalia on December 14, 2023, alongside Toledano's body. Just two days prior, the bodies of Eden Zacharia and Staff Sergeant Ziv Dado, who fell victim to Hamas on October 7, were recovered from the same vicinity. Initially, it was stated that the pathological examination could not definitively determine the cause of death for two of the hostages. The IDF has now presented the bereaved families with crucial findings from the pathological report and details surrounding the recovery operation. Military officials stressed to the families that during the operation in the underground area where the strike occurred, there was no intelligence suggesting the presence of hostages at the site. In close proximity to where the bodies were discovered, the IDF had targeted a tunnel that led to the elimination of Ahmed Ghandour, the commander of the Northern Brigade of Gaza. The investigation uncovered that during the strike, the IDF had no knowledge of hostages in the area. The forces stumbled upon the bodies during tunnel searches, without any prior intelligence about their whereabouts. The forensic report revealed no signs of physical trauma or gunshot wounds on the bodies, indicating they were not killed by direct impact from the strike. Given the condition of the remains, the precise cause of death could not be established.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/15/idf-says-it-accidentally-killed-4-hostages-whose-bodies-were-recovered-in-january/	2024-09-15T05:14:41-07:00	
Nuclear express: Russia-Iran pact might spill bomb secrets	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and US President Joe Biden have voiced alarm over the possibility of Russia sharing nuclear expertise with Iran in exchange for ballistic missiles used against Ukraine. The issue was a key topic during their summit in Washington DC on Friday, as reported by The Guardian. The leaders acknowledged the tightening military cooperation between Russia and Iran at a time when Tehran is reportedly advancing its uranium enrichment program. British sources indicated that concerns were raised about Iran's potential trade for nuclear technology, highlighting a deepening alliance between the two nations. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had previously warned of this development during a visit to London last week. 'Russia is sharing technology that Iran seeks – this is a two-way street – including on nuclear issues as well as some space information,' Blinken stated, accusing both countries of engaging in destabilizing activities. Russian President Vladimir Putin (Gavriil Grigorov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) AP Britain, France, and Germany jointly cautioned last week that Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium had 'continued to grow significantly, without any credible civilian justification.' The three nations reported that Iran had accumulated four 'significant quantities' that could each be used to produce a nuclear bomb. The extent of Tehran's technical capability to construct a nuclear weapon remains unclear. However, collaboration with experienced Russian specialists could potentially accelerate the process, although Iran denies any intention to build nuclear weapons. The 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and Western nations, which aimed to halt Iran's nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions relief, was abandoned in 2018 by then-US President Donald Trump. Iran subsequently breached agreed limits on enriched uranium stockpiles. Western concerns about Iran's nuclear capabilities have contributed to heightened tensions in the Middle East, already strained by the ongoing war in Gaza. Iran and its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, support Hamas, making Tehran's nuclear development a direct threat to Israel. The growing alliance between Russia and Iran has been evident in their military cooperation. Iran has supplied Shahed drones to Russia for use in Ukraine and recently launched a missile and drone attack against Israel, which was largely thwarted with US and UK assistance. During their summit, Starmer and Biden also discussed the potential use of long-range Anglo-French Storm Shadow missiles by Ukraine against targets within Russia. The decision would require US approval due to American-made components in the missiles. The leaders and their teams engaged in a comprehensive discussion about strategy, covering topics including the war in Ukraine, the Middle East crisis, Iran, and the emerging competition with China.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/15/us-uk-concerned-over-potential-iran-russia-nuclear-deal/	2024-09-14T20:30:17-07:00	
Missile from Yemen hits central Israel in Houthi attack	More than 2,365,000 people sought shelter Sunday morning as sirens unexpectedly sounded across central Israel, breaking a long period of relative calm in the region. Video: The site of the impact following a missile strike on central Israel / Credit: Usage under Israeli intellectual property law section 27a The alerts, triggered at 6:32 a.m., lasted about 90 seconds and covered several key areas including parts of the great Tel Aviv area, the Coastal Plain, the Yarkon region, the Judean Foothills, and parts of Samaria. The site of the impact of the UAV in central Israel on July 19, 2024 (Photo: Erez Linn) Erez Linn The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the detection of a surface-to-surface missile crossing into Israeli airspace from Yemen. Officials attributed the loud explosions heard by residents to interceptor missiles. The incoming projectile reportedly landed in an open area between Kfar Daniel and the Gezer power station. Remnants of an interceptor were later discovered near the Paatei Modi'in train station. Israelis seek shelter at Ben-Gurion International Airport (Photo: Yossi Zeliger) Yossi Zeliger The incident resulted in minor injuries to five individuals who were hurt while hurrying to protected spaces. As of now, following consultations with the Home Front Command, authorities have not issued any new directives, and educational institutions are operating on their regular schedules. However, in the country's north, officials have raised alert levels, and students in northern regions will start their school day later than usual. Video: Passengers taking cover as sirens blast at Ben-Gurion International Airport on September 15, 2024 / Yossi Zeliger Sharing an image of the Houthi leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, a member of the terrorist group's political bureau in Yemen, Hizam al-Assad, wrote, 'Whether you're in underground shelters or outside, you should listen carefully today, in the afternoon hours, to what this great leader, a speaker of truth and an honest actor, will say.' Luai Ahmed, a Yemeni exile and pro-Israeli, wrote on Sunday that 'the Houthi terrorists are at it again – firing missiles towards Israel. Each missile costs more than a million dollars. Meanwhile, more than 10 million Yemeni children are starving to death. Only antisemitic terrorists do such things.' Projectile fragments and damage caused by the blast of the incoming missile on Sept. 15, 2024, in the Modi'in train station (Usage under Israeli Intellectual Property Law Section 27a) This missile marks the first such event over central Israel since August when a missile fell into the sea without triggering alerts. A month earlier, a drone launched by the Houthi rebels in Yemen hit central Tel Aviv, resulting in one Israeli fatality and triggering an unprecedented strike by the Israeli Air Force on the strategic Yemeni port of Hodeidah. The sirens Sunday echoed through major population centers, including Or Yehuda, Yehud-Monosson, Kiryat Ono, Holon, Ramat Gan, Rishon LeZion, Rehovot, Lod, Ramla, Ness Ziona, Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, Elad, and Shoham. The alert system was also activated in the Latrun area and select parts of Samaria. Central Israel has not had a siren for incoming projectile in months. A senior Houthi official said over the weekend that 'there will be surprises' in the coming days that Israel and the US would not be expecting. Since July, the Houthis have been threatening a response to the Israeli strike on the port of Hodeidah.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/15/missile-from-yemen-lands-in-central-israel/	2024-09-14T20:00:57-07:00	
Report: Israeli commandos surprised strategic Syrian site; took I...	A Turkey-based media outlet opposing the Assad regime, reported Wednesday night that Israeli forces conducted a dramatic operation near Masyaf in Syria's Hama region, several days after initially being reported as an Israeli air strike. The attack allegedly involved ground troops rappelling from aircraft, though no Israeli planes landed. The report claimed that Israeli drones carried out strikes to secure the area where the forces were deployed. According to the report, the operation targeted a primary military research center reportedly used for chemical weapons production and affiliated with Iran. Israeli helicopters were said to have hovered over the attacked area as commandos rappelled to the ground. Concurrently, Israeli drones allegedly destroyed vehicles belonging to the regime's security forces and blocked roads leading to the landing site. It's important to note that these reports remain unconfirmed by additional sources. The attack on Syria on Sept. 9, 2024 (Photo: Arab social media) Social media The operation reportedly sparked intense firefights, resulting in three Syrian fatalities and multiple injuries, including civilians. The Israeli commandos purportedly succeeded in capturing two Iranian officers. Sources indicated that Syrian regime security forces delayed rescue teams' access to the affected area, with military casualties being transferred to an undisclosed location. Some sources speculate that the Syrian regime or its affiliates may have assisted in facilitating the Israeli operation. Reports also suggest that a Russian communication center was targeted, with a Russian radar expert allegedly injured in the attack. This strike is considered one of the most significant in recent months. Syrian state media reported 16 fatalities and 36 injuries. A local journalist described the attack's intensity as unprecedented, noting that it targeted several military sites and research centers where Iranian and Syrian regime forces are stationed. In response to the attack, the Syrian regime has established a high-level investigative committee. This team, comprising commanders from air defense, intelligence, and electronic warfare units, aims to assess the operation and probe the surrounding circumstances. Additionally, reports indicate that Israel recently targeted crucial Syrian air defense systems, significantly impairing the regime's aerial surveillance capabilities.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/12/report-israeli-commandos-surprised-strategic-irgc-site-with-ground-assault/	2024-09-12T03:33:02-07:00	
Israel's drastic plan if Palestinians win at UN	Israel is girding for a high-stakes diplomatic confrontation at the United Nations next week as the Palestinian Authority pushes for sweeping measures against the Jewish state, including calls for an international arms embargo and sanctions. Israeli officials have crafted a series of escalating countermoves, from freezing funds to cutting security ties with the Palestinian Authority, should the UN adopt the proposed resolutions. The Diplomatic-Security cabinet, Foreign Ministry, and other key bodies have held marathon sessions to devise action plans. These range from gradual steps to potentially crippling blows against the Palestinian Authority, including halting fund transfers and severing security cooperation. Israel's response will be calibrated to match Palestinian actions in New York, where a flurry of anti-Israel proposals and votes is expected in the coming days. The crescendo will be a General Assembly resolution calling for an international arms embargo and sanctions against Israel. On Monday, the UN Security Council is slated to convene on Gaza's humanitarian situation, with Sigrid Kaag, the UN's top humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, set to brief the council. Tuesday will see the General Assembly open debate on the Palestinian-submitted resolution. It primarily advocates for sanctions and an arms embargo while disregarding Israel's security concerns, based on what Israeli officials call a skewed and extreme reading of the International Court of Justice's recent ruling. Israel's UN envoy, Danny Danon, is expected to speak, blasting the move and urging democratic nations to reject a resolution that he says turns a blind eye to Palestinian terrorism. Ambassador Danny Danon holds a picture of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was murdered by Hamas after being kidnapped on Oct. 7, during a United Nations Security Council meeting Sept. 4, 2024 (Reuters/David 'Dee' Delgado) REUTERS The anti-Israel crescendo is set for Wednesday: a vote on the Palestinian resolution, widely expected to pass by a comfortable margin. With no veto power in such General Assembly votes, Israel faces an uphill battle. These moves directly follow efforts to bolster the Palestinian Authority's UN standing in May. Now, as a complementary step, they aim to further erode Israel's global standing. The diplomatic onslaught continues Thursday with a 'monthly' Security Council session focused on the West Bank. Chaired by Slovenia's foreign minister, it centers on implementing the contentious Security Council Resolution 2334. This resolution, passed in the twilight of President Barack Obama's term in 2016, deemed Israeli settlements in territories captured in 1967 – referred to by the Security Council as 'occupied Palestinian territories' – illegal. 'The Palestinians are waging diplomatic terror, and the UN is complicit – it's a new moral low,' Danon told Israel Hayom. 'It's a blatant politicization and misuse of UN resources, dedicating an entire week to Palestinian issues while turning a blind eye to 101 hostages languishing in Gaza without Red Cross access, and hundreds of thousands of Israelis displaced by multi-front Iranian attacks. I urge UN member states to oppose these moves that effectively reward terrorism and the slaughter of innocent civilians,' he said. As high-level diplomatic consultations unfold, Foreign Minister Israel Katz has directed his team to draw up graduated measures against the Palestinian Authority. If Ramallah follows through on its UN threats and violates the Oslo Accords, Jerusalem won't hesitate to 'go all the way,' diplomatic sources warn. The Foreign Ministry is weighing options to pressure the Palestinian Authority, including freezing fund transfers and suspending security cooperation. Sources say Katz aims to enforce the Oslo Accords by shuttering foreign missions operating in Palestinian Authority territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will ultimately decide on escalating measures, following months of pressure from Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. 'The PA's diplomatic and legal offensive poses a grave threat,' Smotrich argues. 'Our ostensibly weakest foe is inflicting the most damage. More ministers now grasp what I've been shouting since 2016 – the PA is more liability than asset.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/12/israel-braces-for-un-showdown-as-palestinians-seek-sanctions/	2024-09-11T22:20:32-07:00	
Australia mulls social media ban for youth under 14	The Australian government is planning to implement a minimum age requirement for social media usage, a move that has ignited controversy among digital rights advocates. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the proposal, citing concerns about the mental and physical health impacts of social media on young people. According to Reuters, Albanese stated that his center-left government intends to conduct an age verification trial before introducing age minimum laws for social media later this year. While the specific age limit has not been finalized, the prime minister suggested it would likely fall between 14 and 16 years old. 'I want to see kids off their devices and onto the footy fields and the swimming pools and the tennis courts,' Albanese told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. 'We want them to have real experiences with real people because we know that social media is causing social harm.' While the specific age limit has not been finalized, the prime minister suggested it would likely fall between 14 and 16 years old (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto/Dolgachov) Getty Images/iStockphoto/Dolgachov The proposed legislation would position Australia as one of the first countries globally to impose an age restriction on social media access. Previous attempts to implement similar measures, including those by the European Union, have faced opposition due to concerns about limiting the online rights of minors. Australia boasts one of the world's highest rates of social media usage, with over four-fifths of its 26 million residents active on various platforms, according to government and tech industry figures. The announcement comes amid an ongoing parliamentary inquiry into the societal effects of social media. The inquiry has heard emotional testimony regarding the negative mental health impacts on teenagers, further fueling the government's push for regulatory action. In Australia, both the Federal government and the opposition party are working to enforce Digital ID for all social media use, banning of VPN access and ultimately muzzling of free speech. Also, our Prime Minister talks like a drunk.pic.twitter.com/Oa339Vwh0S — Paul Swanson (@pswnsn) September 10, 2024 However, the proposal has met with resistance from digital rights advocates and some experts. Critics argue that age restrictions could inadvertently harm younger users by driving their online activity underground or limiting access to crucial support networks. Australia's eSafety Commissioner cautioned in a June submission to the inquiry that 'restriction-based approaches may limit young people's access to critical support' and potentially push them towards 'less regulated non-mainstream services.' Daniel Angus, director of the Queensland University of Technology Digital Media Research Centre, expressed concern about the potential consequences of the proposed legislation. 'This knee-jerk move ... threatens to create serious harm by excluding young people from meaningful, healthy participation in the digital world, potentially driving them to lower-quality online spaces,' he said. Jordy Kaufman, a psychology researcher at Swinburne University, echoed these sentiments, stating, 'For teens who gravitate to social media because of their struggles, a ban could potentially worsen their situation by reducing one of the interaction options available to them.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/11/australia-mulls-social-media-ban-for-youth-under-14/	2024-09-10T18:30:01-07:00	
Iran vows ‘nightmare’ attack on Israel	Israel is 'shaking' in fear of Iran's expected vengeance for the Ismail Haniyeh assassination, said IRGC head Hossein Salami. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Iran continued its war of words with Israel Sunday, with a top military commander threatening a 'nightmare' attack on the Jewish state, Al-Arabiya reported Monday. At a meeting in Yasuj, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Hossein Salami claimed that Israel’s leaders and people are frightened of Iran’s promised vengeance for Hamas political head Ismail Haniyeh being assassinated in July in the heart of a well-guarded compound in Tehran by an explosive planted in his bedroom. The success greatly embarrassed the Islamic Republic and it immediately blamed Israel, although Jerusalem never took public credit for the assassination of one of its key enemies. 'The nightmare of Iran's inevitable response is shaking Israel day and night,' Salami said. Warning that Iran’s response will be 'painful and different' than expected, he added, 'The usurping Zionist regime and its allies should not think that they will be struck and run away. Rather, they should realize that they will be struck and will not be able to run away. They will receive great lessons and learn not to play with the lion's tail.' Iran’s leaders have threatened vengeance many times since Haniyeh was eliminated, although they have been careful to state that it would come at a time of their own choosing. When attempting to avenge the IAF elimination of several of its top military men in Damascus in early April, the mullahs launched more than 300 missiles at Israel less than two weeks later. Almost none of them got through an aerial defense that included the militaries of the U.S., Great Britain, France and Jordan as well as Israel. Practically no damage was caused by the few that landed, and there was only one injury, of a young girl who recovered after a few months in the hospital. One possible scenario could be that Iran unleashes its top terror proxy, Hezbollah in Lebanon, to go all out against the Jewish state. So far, the Shiite terrorists have launched over 7,000 rockets, missiles, UAVs and other airborne projectiles over the border to support Hamas in its war with Israel, forcing the evacuation of some 60,000 Israelis from border communities. However, Hezbollah was also prepared to fire over a thousand rockets at once some two weeks ago, in what was seen as a possible Iranian-ordered revenge attack, but the IDF destroyed all the launchers in a pre-emptive strike. Still, it is believed to have some 140,000 rockets left in its arsenal, and many more trained fighters than Hamas. Israel has been on high alert in the north since the beginning of the war, keeping a substantial number of troops there and sending its air force to strike innumerable Hezbollah targets in Lebanon almost daily in response to the terrorists’ launches. There are many voices in Israel calling for an all-out attack on Hezbollah because it is untenable that the terrorists have succeeded in shutting down a whole area of the country for almost a year. The U.S. is trying to defuse the situation by using diplomatic means, believing that all-out war in the north could turn the conflict into a regional one and be 'catastrophic.'
