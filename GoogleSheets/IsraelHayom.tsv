World leaders stand with Israel on Oct. 7 anniversary	US President Joe Biden issued a special statement Monday to mark the first anniversary of the October 7 tragedy. He spoke of a day that should have been a joyous Jewish holiday but instead became the deadliest for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Biden expressed profound sorrow for the loss of more than 1,200 lives, including 46 Americans, and reaffirmed his commitment to Israel's security and the release of hostages still held by Hamas. In his statement, Biden said: 'Today marks one year of mourning for the more than 1,200 innocent people of all ages, including 46 Americans, massacred in southern Israel by the terrorist group Hamas. One year since Hamas committed horrific acts of sexual violence. One year since more than 250 innocents were taken hostage, including 12 Americans. One year for the survivors carrying wounds, seen and unseen, who will never be the same. And one year of a devastating war.' Biden emphasized that the United States stands behind Israel's right to defend itself against attacks from Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthi rebels. He recalled how American forces assisted in protecting Israel from Iran's ballistic missile attack just last week.

He also expressed hope that October 7 would be remembered as a dark day for Palestinians due to the conflict it sparked. 'We will not stop working to achieve a ceasefire deal in Gaza that brings the hostages home, allows for a surge in humanitarian aid to ease the suffering on the ground, assures Israel's security, and ends this war,' he said. The president concluded with a call for unity and reaffirmed his administration's commitment to regional stability and diplomatic solutions. 'We also continue to believe that a diplomatic solution across the Israel-Lebanon border region is the only path to restore lasting calm and allow residents on both sides to return safely to their homes.' Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated her commitment to Israel's security and the release of the hostages: 'I will do everything in my power to ensure that the threat Hamas poses is eliminated, that it is never again able to govern Gaza, that it fails in its mission to annihilate Israel, and that the people of Gaza are free from the grip of Hamas. I will never stop fighting for the release of all the hostages, including the seven American citizens, living and deceased, still held: Omer, Edan, Sagui, Keith, Judy, Gad, and Itay.' French President Emmanuel Macron, who recently suggested considering an arms embargo on Israel, tweeted in Hebrew, English, and French: 'October 7. The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity. We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts.' October 7. The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity. We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts. — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) October 7, 2024 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who was among the first to visit Israel and express public support after October 7, issued a special statement Monday morning: 'There can be no justification for Hamas' acts of terror. They brought immense suffering not only upon the people of Israel, but also upon innocent Palestinians. We reiterate our call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, for the unconditional release of all hostages and for an end to the conflict. One year on, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is appalling. The European Union will keep doing its utmost to mobilise financial assistance and facilitate deliveries and distribution of humanitarian aid, to the Palestinian people, and now also in Lebanon. Hamas' terrorist attacks on Israel ignited a spiral of violence which has brought the entire region to a state of extreme tension and volatility. All parties must act responsibly, with restraint, and engage to de-escalate the current tensions.' She also addressed goals for after the wars end: 'While we address the immediate crisis, the European Union is ready to help prepare for the day after. We will work in support of all efforts to set the conditions for a durable peace, leading to a two-state solution, where Israel and Palestine coexist side-by-side in peace, with security for both. It's the only viable path forward, to finally end the suffering.' The new NATO Secretary General and former Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, expressed support for Israel: 'One year on from October 7, my thoughts are with the people of #Israel, with the families of the victims and hostages taken by Hamas. I welcome efforts by Allies to bring about a ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages, and an end to the conflict.' Dutch politician Geert Wilders, known for his staunch support of Israel, tweeted a message of solidarity against the backdrop of the Israeli flag: 'Today we honor the innocent victims of the barbaric Islamic terrorist attack on October 7 last year in Israel. But commemorating isn't enough; there must also be commitment. This day's memory only holds value when we wholeheartedly support Israel in its existential struggle for survival, while those behind the attacks – the terrorist organizations Hamas, Hezbollah, and all their affiliates – are destroyed. We must confront antisemites in our country and expel them wherever possible.' Argentinian President Javier Milei tweeted in Hebrew and English, 'Our hearts are captive in Gaza. BRING THEM HOME NOW.' הלב שלנו שבוי בעזה BRING THEM HOME NOW — Javier Milei (@JMilei) October 7, 2024 Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a known supporter of Israel, also issued a statement: 'A year after the October 7 massacre it feels as though the world is forgetting the horror and the evil that took place that day. It is time for us to stand with Israel. Bring back moral clarity. Bring back the hostages.'

Matteo Salvini, Italy's Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, wrote: 'A year after the horrific massacre on October 7, our thoughts are with the Israeli people – with children killed in their cradles, young lives cut short, women violated, those who died in captivity, and those still held hostage. We must always remember Israel's right to exist, to defend itself against Islamic terror, and finally to live in peace with its neighbors.' In Germany, the hostage symbol was placed in the German Parliament. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz posted a picture of the hostage symbol in the Bundestag and wrote, 'We share your grief.' Justice Minister Marco Buschmann added: 'The Hamas terror attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, was the largest mass murder of Jews since the end of the Holocaust. Israel continues to be a target for terrorist actions. As any country would, Israel defends itself against these attacks... We protect Jewish life in Germany... We stand with Israel and with the Jews in Germany.' We share your grief. pic.twitter.com/T89QnG1QOE — Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (@Bundeskanzler) October 7, 2024 Several foreign ministries worldwide also sent special messages. The Danish Foreign Ministry tweeted: 'Today, on 7 October, we mourn the loss of lives caused by Hamas' brutal terrorist attack against Israel one year ago. More than 100 people are still held hostages in Gaza. Our thoughts go out to all of those affected by the tragic event.' Spain's Foreign Ministry, one of the more critical voices towards Israel, also published a statement. However, Israel's name was notably absent: 'The Spanish Government recalls and restates its strongest condemnation of the atrocious Hamas terrorist attacks of 7 October 2023 and conveys its solidarity to the families and relatives of the victims.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/07/biden-macron-express-solidarity-on-first-anniversary-of-hamas-attack/	2024-10-07T01:30:56-07:00	
Kindergarten teacher turned hero on Ofakim's 'death street'	In the early hours of October 7, 2023, Tali Hadad, a 49-year-old kindergarten teacher and mother of six from Ofakim, was thrust into an unimaginable situation. As Hamas launched its assault on southern Israel, Hadad's maternal instincts and quick thinking led her to become an unexpected hero, rescuing her wounded son and other victims amidst intense gunfire. Hadad's day began at 6:45 am with the sound of sirens and gunfire, signaling an attack far more severe than the typical rocket barrages the region had grown accustomed to over the years. Her son Itamar, a soldier on leave for the weekend, immediately grabbed his rifle and ran towards the danger. 'I ran toward the playground,' Hadad told Fox News Digital. 'I hid behind a wall and saw a line of terrorists walking with rifles, heading in the direction where my son had gone.' Moments later, she heard gunshots and, fearing for her son's life, sprinted towards the sound. Dodging through alleys under heavy fire, Hadad witnessed the unfolding devastation. 'People were yelling from windows, begging for help,' she recounted. 'But there were no ambulances coming, no one to save them.' When she found Itamar, he had been shot multiple times – in the stomach, leg, and thigh. Two of his comrades lay dead beside him. Despite the danger, Hadad made multiple trips to rescue a total of 13 people, driving them to safety at high speeds to avoid terrorist gunfire. 'I knew if I drove slowly, the terrorists would shoot me,' Hadad explained, describing her harrowing journey to the local emergency medical station. The attack on Ofakim, a small city of 50,000 residents located 15 miles from the Gaza border, resulted in 47 deaths. Hadad's street became known as 'Death Street' due to the intensity of the violence there. The remains of a house in Kibbutz Beeri, Israel, near the Gaza Strip, Nov. 1, 2023 (Photo: Moshe Shai) ??? ?? Hadad, like many in Ofakim and across Israel, continues to grapple with the emotional aftermath of the attack. 'We're still bleeding,' she said. The experience has profoundly changed her life, leading her to put her teaching career on hold to care for her recovering son. Five of Hadad's six children currently serve in the IDF, either on active duty or in the reserves. Two are currently fighting in Gaza, while her youngest daughter is set to enter the army in a month. Ofakim is slowly rebuilding. The community has established a memorial, painted murals, and planted olive trees to symbolize resilience and renewal. However, the psychological scars remain deep, with long waiting lists for trauma counseling and overwhelming available resources. In response to the growing need for mental health support, the Israel Psychoanalytic Society and the NGO IsraAid have established a multidisciplinary trauma center offering free services to survivors of the massacre. As Ofakim continues its healing journey, the memories of October 7 remain vivid in the community's collective consciousness. Hadad reflected on the day's impact, saying, 'We remember how our children ran through the streets barefoot, fighting like lions. No politicians come here anymore. No tour buses arrive. But we remember. We will always remember.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/07/kindergarten-teacher-turned-hero-on-ofakims-death-street/	2024-10-06T23:30:34-07:00	
Idan Shtivi declared killed on Oct. 7; body held by Hamas	Idan Shtivi, previously thought to be held captive by Hamas, was killed on Oct. 7, and his body is still being held by the terror group, according to a joint announcement by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum and the Petah Tikva municipality. Shtivi's family received the devastating news Sunday night from IDF officials. He leaves behind his parents, three siblings, and his partner, Stav. 'Idan had a passion for nature, photography, and animals' (sharkandstitch photography) The forum shared, 'Idan Shtivi, 28, had a passion for nature, photography, and animals. He shared a deep connection with dogs and other animals, and was set to begin his second year studying sustainability and government at Reichman University. Idan consistently put others first, often sacrificing his own interests for the sake of others.' On the morning of Oct. 7, Shtivi arrived at the Nova Music Festival to document his friends' performances and workshops, but never made it inside. As the attack unfolded, he helped two strangers – a man and a woman he had just met at the site entrance – to escape. This selfless act ultimately led to his death and capture. IDF representatives informed the family that Shtivi was taken from the Tel Gama area, near Re'im. The decision to officially declare Shtivi's death was based on intelligence information and received approval from a committee of experts from the Health Ministry, in collaboration with the Religious Affairs Ministry and the Israel Police.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/07/hostage-idan-shtivi-declared-killed-on-oct-7-body-held-by-hamas/	2024-10-06T20:00:54-07:00	
Iran 'evil empire,' Israeli leader tells Saudi television	In a wide-ranging interview with Al-Arabiya News, President Isaac Herzog discussed the ongoing conflict in Gaza, tensions with Iran, and his vision for the future of the Middle East. Speaking on the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack, Herzog emphasized Israel's commitment to regional stability while defending its actions in Gaza. Video: Herzog speaks with Al-Arabiya / Credit: Al-Arabiya Herzog did not mince words when discussing Iran, repeatedly referring to the country as an 'empire of evil.' He accused Tehran of fueling conflicts across the region through its proxies, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen. Herzog argued that Iran's actions are not only a threat to Israel but to the entire world, citing the disruption of global shipping in the Red Sea as an example. 'Iran is the only country in the world who calls for the eradication of another member state of the United Nations,' Herzog stated, emphasizing the existential threat Israel faces. When questioned about the international community's shifting perception of Israel over the past year, Herzog staunchly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. He insisted that Israel adheres to international humanitarian law and that any instances of misconduct by soldiers are thoroughly investigated and prosecuted. The president acknowledged the suffering of Palestinian civilians but placed the blame squarely on Hamas, accusing the group of using civilian infrastructure to hide weapons and launch attacks. 'We care for the pain of our neighbors,' Herzog said, 'but we have the right to defend ourselves.' Looking ahead, Herzog emphasized the need for a 'day after' plan for Gaza. He expressed hope that regional leaders would be involved in shaping a better future for both Gazans and Israelis. The president drew parallels to Israel's 2005 disengagement from Gaza, lamenting that the vision of creating a 'Hong Kong of the Middle East' was derailed by Hamas's takeover. Herzog called for a 'NATO-like structure' in the region to combat radicalism and promote peace. He highlighted the potential for cooperation between Israel and moderate Arab states, referencing the connectivity plan proposed by President Biden before the October 7 attack.

He expressed concern over Hezbollah's actions, accusing the group of violating international resolutions and putting Lebanon at risk. Regarding Iran's recent missile attack on Israel on Tuesday, Herzog described it as 'extremely unpleasant' but refrained from providing details on potential retaliation. He emphasized ongoing dialogue with the United States on strategic and operational considerations.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/06/iran-evil-empire-israeli-leader-tells-saudi-television/	2024-10-06T04:08:32-07:00	
IDF unveils Hamas arsenal from Oct. 7 attack	Marking one year since the deadly October 7 massacre, the IDF has curated an extensive display of materiel seized from Hamas terrorists who infiltrated Israel that day. The exhibit's purpose is to expose the world to the scale and nature of the threat. The display will be visited by diplomats, representatives from international research institutes, and foreign correspondents throughout the week. Guns from Hamas' October 7 brutal attack on Israel (Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit) The exhibit features an array of vehicles and equipment used by the terrorists during their October 7 incursion, including pickup trucks, motorcycles, and tractors. Also on display are uniforms worn by the attackers and intelligence materials recovered in the aftermath. The arsenal showcased includes anti-tank missiles, RPG rockets, various rockets and missiles, explosive devices, small arms, and unmanned aerial vehicles belonging to Hamas. Since the onset of the conflict, the IDF's Unit for Salvage Collection has confiscated approximately 70,000 items, among them about 1,250 anti-tank and RPG missiles and roughly 4,500 explosive devices. Motorcycles from Hamas' October 7 brutal attack on Israel (Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit) The Technology and Logistics Division of the IDF, spearheaded by the Unit for Salvage Collection, established the exhibit at the Tzrifin base. This unit, primarily composed of reserve soldiers, is tasked with gathering the weapons displayed in the exhibit. Their responsibilities include locating, documenting, and collecting salvaged materials from all combat zones.

Anti-Israel rallies sweep West ahead of Oct. 7 anniversary	As the world braces for the anniversary of Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 attack, pro-Palestinian groups and organizations supporting Iran's Axis of Resistance have unleashed a wave of protests across Western nations. Some demonstrations featured Hezbollah flags and calls for Israel's destruction, igniting concern among Jewish communities and government officials. Video: Protesters in central Dublin supporting terror organizations Pro-Palestinian organizations and supporters of Iran's regional allies have kicked off a series of demonstrations in Western countries as the world prepares to mark the events of Oct. 7. In some locations, protesters waved Hezbollah flags and chanted for Israel's destruction. Dublin, Ireland's capital, saw pro-Palestinian demonstrations on Saturday, with Hamas and Hezbollah flags flying side by side on O'Connell Street in the heart of the city. Protesters chanted inflammatory slogans, including, 'Hezbollah – make us proud, burn the settlers to the ground.' Another demonstration, ominously titled 'Funeral for Zionism,' is scheduled for tomorrow in Dublin. Protesters wave Hamas and Hezbollah flags in Dublin, Ireland. Photo credit: Reuters These protests have sent shockwaves through Ireland's small Jewish and Israeli communities. Lior Tibet, an Israeli student, shared her experience: 'When the war began, we saw flags of the Popular Front [for the Liberation of Palestine]. We were stunned – how could they wave the flag of a group involved in the massacre? We complained. We yelled. But it fell on deaf ears due to 'freedom of expression.' A year later, we're witnessing Hamas and Hezbollah flags on the streets and calls to bomb Tel Aviv. Are we shocked? No. This is what happens when Ireland's president blames Israel for everything simply because it's popular. Still, witnessing such a display of hatred yesterday, in broad daylight, is incredibly painful – it's a slap in the face to the Israeli-Jewish community here. Feeling that no one will stop this is devastating.' Oslo, Norway, is bracing for both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrations on Monday. Similar events marking Oct. 7 are set to unfold in several German cities on the same day, including Berlin and Cologne. Across the globe in Australia, hundreds converged on Hyde Park in Sydney for a large rally supporting Hezbollah and Palestinian groups. Australian authorities warned protesters via large screens that anyone displaying a Hezbollah flag would face arrest. They also prohibited images of Hezbollah's Secretary-General, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by Israel, citing the organization's status as a recognized terror group in the country. Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, while affirming the right to assemble, deemed the timing of the protests 'very regrettable' and urged people not to participate. 'Given what we're commemorating today and tomorrow, these demonstrations are deeply troubling,' Marles stated.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/06/anti-israel-rallies-sweep-west-ahead-of-oct-7-anniversary/	2024-10-06T00:45:22-07:00	
Is this why Hamas kept Hezbollah in dark on Oct. 7?	A new study by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs reveals that Hamas began implementing its plan for the October 7 attack on Israel as early as 2021. The report suggests that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar aimed to claim the mantle of 'liberator of Palestine' for Sunni Islam, opting to act independently despite alliances with Iran and Hezbollah. Lt Col (Res) Jonathan Dahoah Halevi's study analyzes primary sources from Hamas archives. A key finding reveals that Hamas planned a multi-pronged attack involving territorial seizure, rocket launches, and an uprising in the West Bank. Yahya Sinwar freed in a prisoner exchange for Gilad Shalit in 2011 The research also shows that Hamas exploited Israel's political crisis and its impact on IDF preparedness. The group executed a deception plan, misleading Israel about its true intentions and projecting an image of a deterred organization. Hamas also created a false impression that Israel would primarily face tunnel-based attacks, while the actual assault involved a ground invasion, air and sea infiltrations, and the use of drones. Interestingly, the study notes that Hamas began hinting at the impending attack as early as December 2022, when Sinwar announced a 'roaring flood' (Tufan Hader in Arabic). In preparation, Hamas conducted annual military drills focusing on invading Israel. The final exercise, unusually advanced, took place less than a month before the October 7 attack. These drills incorporated advanced technologies like drones and special forces deployments from the sea, simulating the capture of IDF positions, settlement takeovers, and the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers. The Jerusalem Center points out that while Hamas forged alliances with Iran and Hezbollah, it ultimately decided to act independently. The study suggests that Sinwar viewed the attack as part of an 'end of days' scenario – the Islamic prophecy of Muslim victory over non-believers. The IDF have had chances to kill arch-terrorist leader Sinwar. But he is surrounded by hostages. The bag he's holding in this video is filled with dynamite. 'A few times we have had the chance to kill him, but if we do, he will kill all the hostages around him.' pic.twitter.com/jZEOY4Wl9V — Adam Ma'anit (@adammaanit) October 5, 2024 Halevi states, 'Sinwar needed the alliance with Iran and Hezbollah to build Hamas's military capabilities in Gaza. However, when the moment arrived, it appears he chose to reserve the title of Palestine's liberator for Sunni Islam, rather than ceding it to the Shiite forces of the resistance axis. He likely assumed they would join his campaign against Israel under his leadership.' The report also highlights lessons from Operation Guardian of the Walls, which prompted Hamas to revise its strategy against Israel. The group prioritized military enhancement, force training, and professional preparation to unify all confrontation arenas into a single front. The planned surprise attack was meant to include 'seizing the Galilee and Negev regions, inciting an armed uprising among Palestinians in the West Bank and Arab Israelis, and launching massive rocket and missile barrages to cripple air and sea ports and strike strategic targets.' The study concludes that Sinwar's decision to launch the campaign without prior coordination with Hezbollah disrupted the execution of the original plan.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/06/did-sinwar-act-independently-of-iran-on-oct-7/	2024-10-05T18:30:36-07:00	
Will Iran rush to nuclear weapons amid losses?	According to reporting by The Washington Post, Iran has faced a series of military setbacks in recent months, including the loss of key commanders and allies to Israeli strikes. This has led former US officials and analysts to worry that Iran's conventional losses could trigger a dash toward nuclear weapons capability. Iran has been steadily advancing its nuclear program since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal. Now, experts fear Tehran may increase its use of potential nuclear status as a deterrent against adversaries. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a stark warning after Iran's recent missile attack on Israel: 'Iran made a big mistake tonight, and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to retaliate against our enemies.' The Iranian attack on Israel. Photo: TPX While Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the attack 'extraordinary,' he acknowledged recent losses, particularly praising the assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as a 'brother' and 'shining jewel of Lebanon.' David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, told The Washington Post: 'If the axis of resistance isn't working then the only deterrent might be a nuclear deterrent.' He added that the weakening of Hamas and Hezbollah, combined with Iran's failure to inflict significant damage on Israel, means 'there's a better chance Iran could decide to build nuclear weapons.' The losses to Hezbollah have been particularly devastating for Iran. Sina Azodi, an expert on Iran and lecturer at George Washington University, explained to The Washington Post: 'When you think of a chess board, Hezbollah is Iran's queen. It's the most successful militia force that Iran created.' The degradation of Hezbollah leaves Iran more exposed, as it 'gives Israel more freedom of action in the region,' Azodi added. People visit the site of the remains of an Iranian missile in the Negev desert near Arad on October 3, 2024, in the aftermath of an Iranian missile attack on Israel. Photo credit: Menahem Kahana /AFP AFP Iranian rhetoric around nuclear weapons has shifted noticeably since October 2023. While previously denying intentions to develop such weapons, officials have recently asserted that Tehran possesses the necessary capabilities but chooses not to pursue them. A February report from the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence described the Iranian nuclear threat in starker terms compared to previous assessments. The report stated that while Iran does not appear to be actively developing a weapon, it has 'undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.' US officials confirm that Iran could potentially produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb in as little as a few days, although additional time would be needed to develop a reliable nuclear warhead. Missile firing test in Iran (archive). Photo: AFP. As tensions escalate, attention turns to potential Israeli retaliation for Iran's missile attack. Gregory Koblentz, an associate professor at George Mason University, told The Washington Post: 'It is highly likely that this time Israelis will target Iranian nuclear facilities, especially if they believe Iran has already resumed nuclear weaponization work.' Koblentz added that Israel's recent attacks against Hezbollah aimed, in part, to diminish the group's substantial arsenal of rockets and missiles, which were 'widely seen as Iran's insurance policy against an Israeli attack on their nuclear facilities.' He noted, 'With Hezbollah functionally disarmed, for now, Israel has a window of opportunity to strike Iranian nuclear sites and a low risk of retaliation from Hezbollah.' However, experts caution that even a successful strike might only delay Iran's nuclear ambitions. A former White House adviser on nonproliferation, speaking anonymously to The Washington Post, warned that an attack on Iran's main enrichment facilities would 'set back, not end the program' and could potentially lead to 'a change in Iranian nuclear intentions — going from a covert threshold program to an overt weapons program.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/05/will-iran-rush-to-nuclear-weapons-amid-regional-losses/	2024-10-05T13:35:17-07:00	
IDF prepares for 'significant operation in Iran'	As October 7 2024 inches ever closer, with Israel currently engaged in seven different theaters of war, 'Israel Hayom' offers an overview on the current status of the conflict engulfing the middle east, with Israel at its center. IDF Operations in Southern Lebanon. Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit Military blockade on Lebanon In Lebanon, the IDF is conducting focused raids, destroying Hezbollah weapons and underground infrastructure. The assessment is that 400 terrorists have been eliminated in the maneuver alone, including the elimination of a significant number of tactical-level commanders. Currently, the IDF has complete control over which aircraft lands or doesn't land in Lebanon, as Hezbollah continues trying to smuggle weapons into Lebanon through civilian routes. These attempts led to the IDF strike at the Mazna border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. In the Bekaa Valley, Israeli forces are targeting weapon depots - primarily Iranian arms - intended for Hezbollah. The IDF is determined to prevent Hezbollah from rearming - aiming is to facilitate the return of northern Israeli residents to their homes. IDF Operations in Southern Lebanon.

However, Hezbollah still poses a challenge to Israel, and it is expected that difficult moments lie ahead. Thus far, Israel's defense systems have proven effective, and no operational infrastructure has been damaged. The Iranian attack.

UN Secretary-General, UNRWA nominated for Nobel Prize	UN Secretary-General António Guterres, the UNRWA agency, and the International Court of Justice in The Hague have all been nominated for the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize, as reported by Reuters on Thursday. According to the report, experts close to the process told the news agency these two organizations and the veteran diplomat are considered frontrunners in the race for the prize, which supposably aims to honor those who have brought peace, security, and the protection of the vulnerable. Video: IDF raid on UNRWA compound, finding drones, rockets, machine guns, and more António Guterres assumed his role as UN Secretary-General in 2017, having previously served as Portugal's Prime Minister and President of the Socialist International. Since taking office, Russia has invaded Ukraine, committing numerous atrocities. Additionally, devastating civil wars have broken out in Myanmar, Sudan, and Ethiopia, and the Middle East has entered an unprecedented state of conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. In Israel, Guterres is viewed as pro-Palestinian, and this week Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz declared him a 'persona non grata' - an unwelcome persona - within the State of Israel, following his refusal to condemn Iranian aggression after a missile attack on Israel earlier this week. IDF Soldiers at UNRWA Headquarters in Gaza (Archive), Photo: Reuters However, UNRWA's nomination is even more problematic than that of the UN Secretary-General. Throughout the past year of fighting in Gaza, the extent of the Hamas' infiltration into the UN agency has repeatedly come to light. The organization itself admitted that some of its employees, including senior figures, participated in the massacres of October 7 and in the kidnapping of Israeli civilians. The organization's schools and supply systems were commandeered by Hamas, and the group even established a computer and server base beneath UNRWA's headquarters in Gaza City.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/03/un-secretary-general-unrwa-nominated-for-nobel-peace-prize/	2024-10-03T10:00:48-07:00	
IDF rescues Yazidi woman kidnapped by ISIS in Iraq	After ten years: Fawzia Amin Sido, a Yazidi girl kidnapped by ISIS in Iraq and brought to Gaza at the age of 11, was rescued this week by IDF forces from the Gaza Strip and reunited with her family. Fawzia, a Yazidi girl kidnapped by ISIS from Iraq and brought to Gaza at just 11 years old, has finally been rescued by the Israeli security forces.

'Fawzia was held for years by a Palestinian affiliated with Hamas-ISIS,' read the post. 'Her story reminds us of the cruelty Yazidi children suffered when abducted against their will.' The post also added: 'We must remember that 101 Israeli hostages are still being held in Gaza.' The IDF released a statement detailing the operation's behind-the-scenes. According to the statement, the terrorist holding Fawzia was killed, likely during IDF airstrikes in Gaza, and she managed to flee to a hiding place. Following complex coordination between Israel, the US Embassy in Israel, the United States, and other international partners, she was secretly extracted from Gaza via the Kerem Shalom crossing in recent days. After entering Israel, Fawzia continued to Jordan through the Allenby Bridge crossing. From there, she returned to her family in Iraq.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/03/idf-rescues-yazidi-woman-kidnapped-by-isis-in-iraq/	2024-10-03T09:00:00-07:00	
87% of Gaza border residents have returned home	A year after the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas onslaught, a report from Israel's Tekuma Administration – the government's arm for rehabilitating the Gaza periphery – reveals significant progress in resettling and rebuilding the affected communities. Released Tuesday, the report shows that 87% of residents have returned to their homes, with efforts continuing to address housing, security, and economic challenges. On the eve of the attack, 63,978 residents lived in communities adjacent to Gaza. Of these, 49,449 people have returned, while 12,708 remain in temporary housing solutions. The report details 244 projects initiated, totaling $1.7 billion - 90% of the annual budget allocated for rehabilitation and development of the Tekuma region. Temporary housing solutions fall into three categories: urban, integrated, and rural. Each project addresses security, community rehabilitation, construction, infrastructure, economic development, and heritage preservation. Video: Volunteer describes horrific aftermath of Hamas onslaught / Credit: ZAKA Search and Rescue The Administration has invested significantly in security infrastructure upgrades, including the establishment of a centralized operations center to coordinate defense activities and implement comprehensive security measures for residents in the region. This arm of the Tekuma Administration, working on behalf of the Defense Ministry, coordinates IDF activities in the region and implements security measures for residents. A pilot program to enhance community security response is underway in five communities closest to the Gaza border, testing new technological components such as observation devices, drones, and a dedicated civilian communication network. This program is expected to expand to more towns in the region. The administration documented extensive damage through 3D mapping of physical infrastructure in most Tekuma communities and public areas. An architectural preservation survey was also conducted, creating a community documentation file and a survey of historic buildings. Looking ahead, the administration plans to promote legislation defining the region as a 'national focus area,' outlining its authorities and budgets. Additionally, it will seek a complementary government decision for development components in the 2025-2028 strategic plan, totaling $1.3 billion. Several regulatory easements have been implemented to streamline reconstruction efforts, including exemptions from certain permits and plans.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/01/87-of-gaza-border-residents-have-returned-home-report-shows/	2024-09-30T18:30:00-07:00	
Netanyahu makes direct appeal to Iranians, 'You deserve better'	In a surprising diplomatic move, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has issued a direct statement to the people of Iran, bypassing the country's leadership to address its citizens. The statement, released today, marks a significant shift in Israel's communication strategy towards Iran. 'I speak a lot about the leaders of Iran. Yet at this pivotal moment, I want to address you – the people of Iran,' Netanyahu began, setting the tone for a message that sought to distinguish between the Iranian government and its populace. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the people of Iran: people of Iran should know - Israel stands with you. pic.twitter.com/hCSGnPQWjk — AP (@AP_from_NY) September 30, 2024 The Israeli leader didn't mince words when criticizing the current Iranian regime. 'Every day, you see a regime that subjugates you, make fiery speeches about defending Lebanon, defending Gaza. Yet every day, that regime plunges our region deeper into darkness and deeper into war,' he stated. Netanyahu also asserted Israel's military capabilities, warning, 'Every day, their puppets are eliminated. Ask Mohammed Deif. Ask Nasrallah. There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach. There is nowhere we will not go to protect our people and protect our country.' A significant portion of Netanyahu's message focused on economic issues, accusing the Iranian government of mismanaging resources at the expense of its citizens. 'The vast majority of Iranians know their regime doesn't care a whit about them. If it cared about you, it would stop wasting billions of dollars on futile wars across the Middle East. It would start improving your lives,' he argued. The prime minister painted a picture of what Iran could achieve if these resources were redirected toward education, healthcare, and infrastructure.

(Photo: Atta Kenare / AFP) AFP Looking to the future, Netanyahu envisioned a prosperous Iran free from its current leadership. 'When Iran is finally free and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think – everything will be different,' he predicted. He described a future where Israel and Iran could be at peace, benefiting from global investment, tourism, and technological innovation. In a direct appeal to Iranian citizens, Netanyahu stated, 'From Qom to Esfahan, from Shiraz to Tabriz, there are tens of millions of good and decent people with thousands of years of history behind them and a brilliant future ahead of them. Don't let a small group of fanatic theocrats crush your hopes and your dreams. You deserve better. Your children deserve better. The entire world deserves better. I know you don't support the rapists and murderers of Hamas and Hezbollah, but your leaders do.' He concluded with a message of solidarity: 'The people of Iran should know – Israel stands with you.' The effectiveness and reach of this message within Iran remain to be seen, given the Iranian government's tight control over media within the country. It will be crucial to monitor both the Iranian government's response and any potential reaction from the Iranian public.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/30/netanyahu-makes-direct-appeal-to-iranians-you-deserve-better/	2024-09-29T21:30:39-07:00	
AP under fire for describing Hezbollah leader 'charismatic and sh...	The Associated Press (AP) found itself at the center of controversy after publishing a biographical article about Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah that painted the terrorist group's chief in an overly positive light. The article, which appeared to be a preemptive piece anticipating Nasrallah's potential death after the IDF's strike on Hezbollah's headquarters, initially bore the headline 'Charismatic and shrewd: A look at longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.' This characterization drew immediate comparisons to The Washington Post's controversial description of al-Qaida leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as an 'austere religious scholar' following his death in 2019.

The rapid edit seemed to be a direct response to the flood of criticism on X, formerly known as Twitter. AG Hamilton, a prominent social media user, highlighted the disparity in AP's treatment of different figures by juxtaposing the Nasrallah headline with one about the late US Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK). The latter read: 'Former US Sen Inhofe, defense hawk who called human-caused climate change a 'hoax,' dies at 89.' .@AP I'm sorry for your loss.

Rep Mike Waltz (R-FL) dismissed AP's portrayal, stating, 'Nasrallah was a ruthless, murderous terrorist.' Similarly, Rep Anthony D'Esposito (R-NY) asserted, 'Nasrallah is not a 'charismatic leader.' He is a bloodthirsty, anti-Semitic terrorist.'

Mike Waltz (@michaelgwaltz) September 28, 2024 The Daily Wire noted that AP's article went through 12 paragraphs before mentioning the word 'terrorist.' Instead, it referred to Nasrallah using terms such as 'astute strategist,' 'archenemy of Israel,' and 'a fiery orator viewed as an extremist.' This incident marks one of many in which renowned media outlets, such as AP, were scrutinized for their portrayal of Israel's ongoing conflict with Gaza's Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah. A comprehensive study has revealed that the BBC's coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict was markedly biased against Israel, with the British broadcaster reportedly violating its own 'editorial guidelines' more than 1,500 times. Other prominent international media outlets were criticized mainly on social media for refraining from using the word 'terrorist' or 'terrorism' in describing Hamas and Hezbollah since the war broke out after Hamas' deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping 250.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/29/ap-under-fire-for-describing-hezbollah-leader-charismatic-and-shrewd/	2024-09-28T20:00:06-07:00	
Sky News host receives death threats for supporting Israel	Sky News Australia host Erin Molan went viral internationally for supporting Israel on her show last week and denouncing worldwide hypocrisy for having a double standard when it comes to Israel's campaign in Lebanon. Two days ago, during her show, she shared receiving numerous death threats for doing so, as well as feeling scared for her and her 6-year-old daughter's safety. A media personality supporting Israel openly is an uncommon stance in the current media landscape, which led to the social media buzz surrounding Molan's monologue. During her speech, she said, 'Nobody knows what will happen next in the Middle East, but I know without any doubt in my mind who I'm rooting for, and it's not the terrorists who celebrate death, – it's the country fighting desperately for life.' She shared that the responses were 'overwhelming,' further adding that 'Thousands in the Israeli and Jewish communities have reached out, thanked me, said how brave I am for thinking with moral clarity on this issue.' However, she dismissed that characterization, saying she was 'not brave at all…I'm absolutely terrified – of what the world looks like right now, of where it appears to be heading. I'm scared beyond belief that evil is starting to overcome good.' While most of the world's media attacks Israel, a brave Sky News Australia anchor, Erin Molan, gave an incredible speech on her show about the hypocrisy both in Australia and around the world against Israel! pic.twitter.com/L5p6hW4E2y — יוסף חדאד - Yoseph Haddad (@YosephHaddad) September 26, 2024 Molan explained why she speaks 'loudly and strongly,' even if her 'voice shakes inside.' She referred to her worry about her safety and her daughter's: 'I'm not Israeli, I'm not Jewish…I'm not being paid by anyone to say anything.' She then asked, 'But what about the long term? What kind of world will exist if all those who don't feel directly involved in the conflict will stay silent?' She emphasized the worldwide implications of what seems like a Middle East issue: 'It's a fight for everything that should matter, and does,' urging people to stand up for 'what's right' and encouraging viewers to use their voices even when it is hard. Recently, many international media outlets such as the AP, BBC, and more, have been under scrutiny for their portrayal of the Israel-Hamas conflict ever since the war broke out following Hamas' deadly attack on Oct. 7. Israeli and Jewish communities around the world expressed disappointment and astonishment at the media's biased portrayal of terrorist organizations Hamas and Hezbollah, marking Molan's words as unprecedented in a major international media channel.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/29/sky-news-host-receives-death-threats-for-supporting-israel/	2024-09-28T18:30:55-07:00	
Draft your will': The message Nasrallah got – but refused to hee...	Since Friday the Arab world has been engrossed in the remarks made by Lebanese researcher Mohammad Ali Al Husseini, who is based in the Gulf. During an interview with the Saudi network Al-Arabiya approximately three days ago, Al-Husseini cautioned Hassan Nasrallah, the now-eliminated Hezbollah leader, about his potential demise. By Friday, Israel had already carried out a strike in Beirut's Dahieh neighborhood, resulting in a successful killing. 'I tell Nasrallah, prepare your will, because those who bought you have now sold you,' the Shiite cleric said, known for his pro-Saudi leanings. 'You've become the primary target now. So draft your will, and I'm speaking in all seriousness. This isn't an idle threat. Let's wait and see. All your dreams of marching into Jerusalem have led you astray.' The Lebanese analyst, who heads an organization called the Arab Islamic Council in Lebanon further stated: 'The events of 2006 (referring to the First Lebanon War) were agreed upon and contained, but today there's no such policy. Israel will demolish everything. This isn't psychological warfare. The Israeli military will enter and invade Lebanon.' Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah speaks via a video link, as his supporters raise their hands, during the Shiite holy day of Ashoura, in the southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, in Beirut, Lebanon, Tuesday, Aug. 9, 2022 (AP/Hussein Malla) AP Photo/Hussein Malla During his commentary, he asserted: 'There's a state of worry and tension, unprecedented within Hezbollah, even in the Shura Council. An intifada is brewing against Hassan Nasrallah. Yes, an intifada. There's a lack of trust in Hassan Nasrallah at the decision-making level. It's evident that Hezbollah is in retreat, suffering casualties daily.' As noted, the Arab world extensively circulated his words, with the interview receiving numerous shares. A Syrian opposition activist wrote, 'The wise foresee the future. Mohammad Al-Husseini warned Hassan Nasrallah of assassination in an Al-Arabiya interview. He told him candidly – prepare a will because Iran has sold you out.' An Arab-Christian TV host commented: 'Prophetic words that foretold Nasrallah's demise, that Iran had betrayed him.' محمد علي الحسيني: أقول لحسن نصر الله جهز وصيتك فمن اشتراك قد باعك.. ما حدث في 2006 كان متفق عليه أما اليوم فلا سياسة والإسرائيلي سيدمر كل شيء#لبنان#قناة_العربية#ساعة_حوار pic.twitter.com/zb52GvWnE6 — العربية (@AlArabiya) September 26, 2024 Following the elimination, Al-Husseini posted on his social media account: 'We began this journey together, marched side by side, liberated the south as one, and celebrated our victories together. But loyalty drew a line between us. I remained true to Arabism and our nation. You, however, post-liberation, fell into Iran's embrace. You pledged them unwavering loyalty and blind obedience. You offered yourself to their service, and in return, they abandoned and traded you away – while the Arabs embraced me, true to their chivalrous nature and loyalty. I counseled you repeatedly, urging caution, so you couldn't claim ignorance later. I forewarned you of the impending destruction that would befall you and the Lebanese people. Let this serve as a cautionary tale for anyone who forsakes their homeland, their Arab identity, and their nation in favor of another.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/28/draft-your-will-the-message-nasrallah-got-but-refused-to-heed/	2024-09-28T01:36:16-07:00	
PM tells UN 'Hamas must go', warns 'no place in Iran Israel canno...	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly on Friday as part of the annual General Debate, defending his nation's response to the Oct 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas and warning Iran against striking Israel. Netanyahu took the podium to refute what he called 'untruths' heard from other leaders earlier in the week. 'I didn't intend to come here this year. My country is at war, fighting for its life,' Netanyahu said. 'But after I heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium, I decided to come here and set the record straight.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly at the United Nations headquarters in New York City on September 27, 2024 (Charly Triballeau / AFP) AFP/Charly Triballeau He came armed with visual aids: In his right hand, he held a map showing Iran's malign influence on the region through its proxies in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen (including Hezbollah and the Houthis); in the other hand, he was holding a map showing the potential benefit 'for the betterment of the entire world,' as Netanyahu put it, showing in green Israel, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, which according to Netanyahu will be part of the 'landbridge connecting Israel to the Indian Ocean' via railways that will be set up once peace is fully in place with Riyadh. He said the world must choose the map of the blessing, not the map of the curse, and that the blessing will materialize eventually, despite the delay imposed on the region because of the 'unspeakable atrocities' carried out by Hamas on Oct. 7, which triggered the long war since. He added, 'Hamas must go.' Netanyahu insisted that Israel wanted peace but issued a stark warning to Iran: 'If you strike us, we will strike you.' He once again blamed Iran for being behind many of the problems in the region. 'We must defend ourselves against these savage murderers. Our enemies seek not only to destroy us, they seek to destroy our common civilization and return all of us to a dark age of tyranny and terror.' He added, 'There is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach. And that's true of the entire Middle East. Far from being lambs led to the slaughter, Israel soldiers have fought back with incredible courage,' Netanyahu said even as some diplomats, including Iranians, stormed out.

But Hamas is still holding hostage more than 100 Israelis. Video: Reaction to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he walks toward the podium at the UN on Sept. 27/ Credit: UNTV In recent days, Israel has expanded its military operations to the border with Lebanon as Hezbollah, which joined Hamas in targeing Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, refused to stop its incessant rockets on civilians for 11 months. Israel has vowed to step up its attacks on Hezbollah until its citizens can safely return to their homes. The United States, France, and other allies have called for an 'immediate' 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations as fears grow that the escalating violence could lead to a full-scale war. The United Nations reports that over 90,000 people have been displaced by five days of Israeli strikes on Lebanon, bringing the total number of displaced people in Lebanon to 200,000 since the conflict began. 'I have another message for this assembly and for the world outside this hall: We are winning,' Netanyahu said on the ongoing war in Gaza, adding that all Hamas has to do in order to have the Israeli campaign stop is 'release all the hostages and lay down its weapons.' He sent a similar message to Hezbollah, saying Israel will not relent until its residents can come back safely to their homes on the northern border. As Netanyahu took the stage, there was enough commotion in the audience that the presiding diplomat had to shout, 'Order, please.' The two speakers who preceded Netanyahu on Friday each made a point of criticizing Israel's actions. 'Mr Netanyahu, stop this war now,' Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob said as he closed his remarks, pounding the podium. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, speaking just before the Israeli leader, declared of Gaza: 'This is not just a conflict. This is systematic slaughter of innocent people of Palestine.' He thumped the rostrum to audible applause.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/27/pm-tells-un-hamas-must-go-vows-to-fight-until-victory/	2024-09-27T07:08:34-07:00	
US is sending $375 million in military aid to Ukraine and will an...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Wednesday that the U.S. will send Ukraine an undisclosed number of medium-range cluster bombs and an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles in a military aid package totaling about $375 million; a U.S. official also said billions more in assistance over the coming months would be announced Thursday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the $375 million package as global leaders met at the U.N. General Assembly this week and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy used his appearance there to rally support. Zelenskyy will meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington on Thursday to continue his push to get them to allow his troops to use long-range weapon s to strike deeper into Russia. The package announced by Blinken includes air-to-ground bombs, which have cluster munitions and can be fired by Ukraine's fighter jets, as well as munitions for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Javelin and other anti-armor systems, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, bridging systems and other vehicles and military equipment. 'The United States is committed to Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s brutal aggression,' Blinken said in a statement. 'We will deploy this new assistance as quickly as possible to help Ukraine protect its territory and its people.' The latest package of weapons, provided through presidential drawdown authority, is one of the largest approved recently and will take stocks from Pentagon shelves to deliver the weapons more quickly to Ukraine. It comes as nearly $6 billion in funding for aid to Ukraine could expire at the end of the month unless Congress acts to extend the Pentagon’s authority to send weapons from its stockpiles to Kyiv. A U.S. official said, however, that the Biden administration is expected to notify Congress on Thursday of its intent to spend the remaining amount of money under presidential drawdown authority contained in the supplemental budget for Ukraine after the current fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. That amount, $5.5 billion, must either be used or notified to Congress by Sept. 30 or be lost and returned to the Treasury. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the expected move, said lawmakers would be told that the administration will spend the money in multiple aid packages that will be announced after Oct. 1, in the next budget year. Ukrainian and Russian forces are battling in the east, including hand-to-hand combat in the Kharkiv border region where Ukraine has driven Russia out of a huge processing plant in the town of Vovchansk that had been occupied for four months, officials said Tuesday. At the same time, Ukrainian troops continue to hold ground in Russia’s Kursk region after a daring incursion there last month. The aid announcement also came on the heels of Zelenskyy's highly guarded visit on Sunday to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank the workers who are producing 155 mm shells, one of the most critically needed munitions for his country’s fight to fend off Russian ground forces. Including this latest package, the United States has provided more than $56.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russian forces invaded in February 2022. ___ Lee reported from New York.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-to-send-375-million-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-including-medium-range-cluster-bombs/	2024-09-25T16:02:47-07:00	
Ukraine's president calls for unspecified global 'action' to forc...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Ukraine’s president dismissed the notion of peace talks with Moscow on Tuesday, calling instead for unspecified global 'action' to force Russia into peace for invading his country and to comply with the U.N. Charter’s requirement that every country respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all other nations. Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council that Russian President Vladimir Putin is committing 'an international crime' and has broken so many international rules that he won’t stop on his own. 'And that’s why this war can’t simply fade away. That’s why this war can’t be calmed by talks,' Zelenskyy said at a meeting on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly. 'Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what’s needed — forcing Russia into peace as the sole aggressor in this war, the sole violator of the U.N. Charter.' The high-level meeting on the more than 2½-year war in Ukraine was attended by ministers from 14 of the council's 15 member nations. Russia chose to send its lower-level U.N. ambassador. Vassily Nebenzia opened the meeting protesting that Zelenskyy was being given the U.N. spotlight again. He also criticized Slovenia — which holds the rotating council presidency this month — for allowing the Ukrainian leader's 'chorus' to speak. He meant about 10 European Union and NATO members who aren’t on the council but march 'in lockstep' every time they come to the council 'to malign the Russian Federation.' 'When it comes to listening to these hackneyed statements, and these cookie-cutter statements, we have no intention of wasting time on that,' Nebenzia said. Ukraine's sovereignty is defended U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres briefed the council, reiterating the United Nations’ strong support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity under the U.N. Charter. 'Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 – following the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol a decade ago – is a clear violation of these principles,' the U.N. chief said. Zelenskyy said Ukraine knows some countries want to talk to Putin. But, he asked, 'What could they possibly hear from him — that he’s upset because we are exercising our right to defend our people, or that he wants to keep the war and terror going just so no one thinks he was wrong?' China has repeatedly called for talks between Ukraine and Russia. Its foreign minister, Wang Yi, told the council that the suffering and destruction and increasing volatility in the region 'must be turned around.' Wang stressed that Chinese President Xi Jinping believes 'the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected.' China is pursuing peace talks and conducting shuttle diplomacy, Wang said, and its efforts have received wide international support. He pointed to a joint China-Brazil peace plan issued earlier this year. Zelenskyy also went after countries that supply weapons and ammunition to Russia, telling the council Moscow has no legitimate reason to make Iran and North Korea 'de facto accomplices.' The U.S. includes China, Iran and North Korea in its accusations U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised similar issues but also accused China, which has close ties to Russia, of providing Russia with machine tools, microelectronics and other items it is using 'to rebuild, restock and ramp up its war machine and sustain its brutal war.' Wang, who spoke after him, didn't directly respond but said: 'I also wish to make it clear that on the Ukraine issue, any move to shift responsibility onto China or attack and smear China is irresponsible and will lead nowhere.' Blinken also accused Iran of providing armed drones to Russia since 2022 and transferring hundreds of short-range ballistic missiles a few weeks ago – which its new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has denied. North Korea has also delivered trainloads of weapons and ammunition to Russia including ballistic missiles and artillery rounds, Blinken said. 'The more Russia relies on their support, the more Iran and North Korea extract in return,' Blinken said. 'And the more Putin gives to Pyongyang and Tehran, the more he exacerbates threats to peace and security.' To those who ask how the United States and others can help Ukraine defend itself and criticize countries supplying military materiel to Russia, Blinken said the answer is simple: 'Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim.' ___ Edith M.

Starmer's unfortunate gaffe on Hamas hostages	In a speech addressing the ongoing war in Gaza and escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer made an unfortunate verbal slip that quickly went viral on social media. During Tuesday's Labor Party conference, Starmer mistakenly called for the return of 'sausages' instead of 'hostages' when discussing Israelis held captive by Hamas. 'I call again for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The return of the sausages,' Starmer declared, before quickly correcting himself to say 'hostages.' Despite Starmer's immediate recovery from the slip-up, video clips of the error spread rapidly across various social media platforms, drawing attention away from the serious nature of his address. A demonstrator raises an Israeli flag smeared with red paint and others sit on yellow ribbons painted on the ground, as they block traffic on a main road during a protest calling for action to secure the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, on September 13, 2024. Photo credit: Jack Guez/AFP AFP After correcting his mistake, Starmer continued his speech, emphasizing the need for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. He called for 'a recommitment to the two-state solution, a recognized Palestinian State alongside a safe and secure Israel.' Starmer's comments came amid heightened concerns over the Israel-Hezbollah situation, which has seen a marked increase in tensions over the past week. The Labour leader's address sought to articulate his party's position on the complex and evolving crisis in the region. Sky News host Andrew Bolt commented on the incident, saying 'Where are the great leaders of the West…Slip of the tongue, I've got it, but instantly it has made him a laughing stock around the world.' This gaffe adds to a series of other incidents involving political leaders, with the most recent being when US President Joe Biden called not to move on Haifa, instead of Rafah, in the context of the war in Gaza.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/25/hostages-or-sausages-starmers-gaza-war-speech-goes-viral/	2024-09-24T18:30:26-07:00	
Trump praises Russia's military record in argument to stop fundin...	SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — Donald Trump on Tuesday praised Russia's military record in historical conflicts and derided U.S. aid to Ukraine as he again insisted he would quickly end the war launched by Moscow's invasion if elected president. Speaking in Savannah, Georgia, Trump mocked President Joe Biden's frequent refrain that the U.S. would back the Ukrainian armed forces until Kyiv wins the war. He raised two long ago conflicts to suggest Moscow would not lose — the former Soviet Union's role in defeating Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in World War II in the 1940s, and French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's failed invasion of Russia more than a century earlier. Trump insisted that the U.S. had 'to get out,' though he did not specify how he would negotiate an ending to U.S. involvement in the war. 'Biden says, ‘We will not leave until we win,’' Trump said, lowering his voice to mimic the Democratic president. 'What happens if they win? That’s what they do, is they fight wars. As somebody told me the other day, they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon. That’s what they do. They fight. And it’s not pleasant.' An official on Trump's campaign also said Tuesday that the Republican nominee will not meet this week with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is visiting the U.S. to attend the opening of the U.N. General Assembly. No meeting had been scheduled between the two, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning, despite a statement from Ukrainian officials last week that said Zelenskyy had planned to see the former president. Trump on Tuesday repeated his characterization of Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for winning U.S. aid to help Ukraine. 'Every time Zelenskyy comes to the United States, he walks away with $100 billion,' Trump said, erroneously. The U.S. has provided more than $56 billion in security assistance since Russia invaded in 2022, according to the State Department. Trump and Zelenskyy have a long history dating back to the former U.S. president's time in the White House. The then-president pressured Zelenskyy to open investigations of Biden and his son Hunter as well as a cybersecurity firm Trump falsely linked to Ukraine. That call — and the hold placed by the White House on $400 million in military aid — led to Trump's first impeachment. Zelenskyy plans to meet with Biden and Harris in Washington. Earlier this week, in an interview with The New Yorker, Zelenskyy implied Trump does not understand and oversimplifies the conflict, and said his running mate JD Vance is 'too radical' and essentially advocates for Ukraine to 'make a sacrifice' by 'giving up its territories.' On Monday, Trump's son Donald Jr. criticized Zelenskyy on X, reminding his followers that the suspect in his father's second assassination attempt had lambasted Trump's approach to foreign policy, including the war in Ukraine. 'So a foreign leader who has received billions of dollars in funding from American taxpayers, comes to our country and has the nerve to attack the GOP ticket for President?' he posted. ___ Associated Press writer Michelle L.

Biden in farewell U.N. address says peace still possible in confl...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Joe Biden declared in his final address to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that the U.S. must not retreat from the world, as Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon edged toward all-out war and Israel’s bloody operation against Hamas in Gaza neared the one-year mark. Biden used his wide-ranging address to speak to a need to end the Middle East conflict and the 17-month-old civil war in Sudan and to highlight U.S. and Western allies' support for Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. He also raised concern over artificial intelligence and its potential to be used for repression. His appearance before the international body offered Biden one of his last high-profile opportunities as president to make the case to keep up robust support for Ukraine, which could be in doubt if former President Donald Trump defeats Vice President Kamala Harris in November. Biden insisted that despite global conflicts, he remains hopeful for the future. 'I’ve seen a remarkable sweep of history,' Biden said. 'I know many look at the world today and see difficulties and react with despair but I do not.' 'We are stronger than we think' when the world acts together, he added. Biden came to office promising to rejuvenate U.S. relations around the world and to extract the U.S. from 'forever wars' in Afghanistan and Iraq that consumed American foreign policy over the last 20 years. 'I was determined to end it, and I did,' Biden said of the Afghanistan exit, calling it a 'hard decision but the right decision.' He acknowledged that it was 'accompanied by tragedy' with the deaths of 13 American troops and hundreds of Afghans in a suicide bombing during the chaotic withdrawal. But his foreign policy legacy may ultimately be shaped by his administration's response to two of the biggest conflicts in Europe and the Middle East since World War II. 'There will always be forces that pull our countries apart,' Biden said, rejecting 'a desire to retreat from the world and go it alone.' He said, 'Our task, our test, is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than the forces pulling us apart.' The Pentagon announced Monday that it was sending a small number of additional U.S. troops to the Middle East to supplement the roughly 40,000 already in the region. All the while, the White House insists Israel and Hezbollah still have time to step back and de-escalate. 'Full scale war is not in anyone’s interest,' Biden said, and despite escalating violence, a diplomatic solution is the only path to peace. Biden had a hopeful outlook for the Middle East when he addressed the U.N. just a year ago. In that speech, Biden spoke of a 'sustainable, integrated Middle East' coming into view. At the time, economic relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors were improving with implementation of the Abraham Accords that Israel signed with Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates during the Trump administration. Biden's team helped resolve a long-running Israel-Lebanon maritime dispute that had held back gas exploration in the region. And Israel-Saudi normalization talks were progressing, a game-changing alignment for the region if a deal could be landed. 'I suffer from an oxymoron: Irish optimism,' Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they met on the sidelines of last year's U.N. gathering. He added, 'If you and I, 10 years ago, were talking about normalization with Saudi Arabia ... I think we’d look at each other like, ‘Who’s been drinking what?’' Eighteen days later, Biden's Middle East hopes came crashing down. Hamas militants stormed into Israel killing 1,200, taking some 250 hostage, and spurring a bloody war that has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza and led the region into a complicated downward spiral. Now, the conflict is threatening to metastasize into a multi-front war and leave a lasting scar on Biden's presidential legacy. Israel and Hezbollah traded strikes again Tuesday as the death toll from a massive Israeli bombardment climbed to nearly 560 people and thousands fled from southern Lebanon. It's the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Israel has urged residents of southern Lebanon to evacuate from homes and other buildings where it claimed Hezbollah has stored weapons, saying the military would conduct 'extensive strikes' against the militant group. Hezbollah, meanwhile, has launched dozens of rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes last week that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters. Dozens were also killed last week and hundreds more wounded after hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah militants exploded, a sophisticated attack that was widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. Israel's leadership launched its counterattacks at a time of growing impatience with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah's persistent launching of missiles and drones across the Israel-Lebanon border after Hamas started the war with its brazen attack on Oct. 7. Biden reiterated his call on the parties to agree to a cease-fire and hostage release deal, saying it's time to 'end this war' — even as hopes for such a deal are fading as the conflict drags on. Biden, in his address, called for the sustainment of Western support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Biden helped galvanize an international coalition to back Ukraine with weapons and economic aid in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 assault on Ukraine. 'We cannot grow weary,' Biden said. 'We cannot look away.' Biden has managed to keep up American support in the face of rising skepticism from some Republican lawmakers — and Trump — about the cost of the conflict. At the same time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pressing Biden to loosen restrictions on the use of Western-supplied long-range missiles so that Ukrainian forces can hit deeper in Russia. So far Zelenskyy has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Putin has warned that Russia would be 'at war' with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. Biden and Harris are scheduled to hold separate meetings with Zelenskyy in Washington on Thursday. Ukrainian officials were also trying to arrange a meeting for Zelenskyy with Trump this week, though a Trump campaign official said it wasn't going to materialize. The president also sounded an alarm about the rapid advances in artificial intelligence development, particularly around disinformation, respect for human life and the potential exploitation by totalitarian powers. He told the world leaders, 'There may well be no greater test of our leadership than how we deal with A.I.' 'We must make certain that the awesome capabilities of A.I. will be used to uplift and empower everyday people, not to give dictators more powerful shackles on the human spirit,' he added. Later, he held a bilateral meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and joined other world leaders in an event highlighting their partnership to combat the production and distribution of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which drive tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S. annually alone. Biden struck a wistful tone in his remarks, peppering his speech with references to his first time attending the General Assembly more than 50 years ago, and quoting Irish poetry. Biden held up his decision to step aside up as an instructive moment as he addressed a gathering that has no small share of totalitarian and nondemocratic leaders. 'Some things are more important than staying in power,' Biden said. 'It’s your people that matter the most. Never forget, we are here to serve the people. Not the other way around.' ___ Miller reported from Washington.

Irish president accuses Israel of leaking his letter to Iran	President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins has accused the Israeli Embassy in Dublin of circulating a letter he wrote to Iran's newly appointed president, sparking a diplomatic row. The Israeli Embassy has strongly denied the allegation, calling it 'baseless' and 'highly inflammatory.' The controversy began last month when Higgins' letter to Masoud Pezeshkian, following his appointment as President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, became public. Speaking at the United Nations (UN) in New York on Sunday, Higgins suggested that Israeli officials were behind the letter's circulation. 'You should ask where the criticism came from and how the letter was circulated and by whom and for what purpose,' Higgins told journalists. When pressed further, he stated, 'I believe it was circulated from the Israeli Embassy' in Dublin. Higgins defended his letter, explaining that it was customary to congratulate a new head of state and that there had been interest in restarting nuclear talks with Iran. In the letter, Higgins told Pezeshkian that Iran had a 'crucial role' in peace in the Middle East following the death of his predecessor, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash in May. The letter, which appeared in the Jewish Chronicle, prompted criticism in both the UK and Ireland. It read in part, 'I regret of course the circumstances that brought about the election, and take the opportunity to repeat the condolences of the people of Ireland for the deaths of your predecessor President Raisi.' The Israeli Embassy in Dublin swiftly responded to Higgins' accusation, stating, 'This baseless accusation is highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous, and the embassy rejects it completely.' The embassy's statement added that it is the 'burden of the author to defend its content, which did not mention the threat Iran poses in the region.' Irish President Michael D. Higgins' leaked letter to President of the Islamic Republic of Iran (L) and the Iranian Embassy's post on the social media platform X. Screenshot: @DublinIran X The embassy also referenced the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, in which approximately 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage, with 101 still being held in Gaza. Simon Harris, the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) also present at the UN in New York, defended the Irish president. Harris stated that his primary concern was the loss of life in Gaza, asserting that Israel 'is continuing to allow a horrific humanitarian situation continue.' Harris further commented, 'I think the Israeli embassy should be focusing on things other than amplifying, circulating or referencing a letter that does really conform with normal diplomatic protocol between heads of state.' 'I have no interest whatsoever in getting into any sort of tit-for-tat or back-or-forth with the Israeli embassy or the government of a country that is continuing to allow this horrific humanitarian situation continue,' Harris added. However, screenshots proved that it was the Iranian Embassy itself who circulated the letter. Ireland is known for its critical stance towards Israel, yet among the widespread support the president received for his accusations against Israel, which were later proven false, one media report particularly stood out. One of the journalists covering the affair was Gavan Reilly, the political correspondent for Virgin Media News. In one of his reports on the incident, Reilly chose to say that 'the global Jewish lobby and organizations sympathetic to Israel' attacked the president for publishing a congratulatory letter to the incoming leader of the Islamic Republic. The use of conspiratorial terms like 'global Jewish lobby' caused great anger in the Jewish and Israeli community in Dublin. 'The report not only reeked of antisemitism and the oldest conspiracies in the world against Jews, it also showed us again that in Ireland of 2024, antisemitism is not only tolerated but welcomed with open arms on live broadcast,' said a source in the Irish Jewish community. 'We've reached a point where statements like 'global Jewish lobby' are made without any shame. It's often said that Ireland is the most critical country towards Israel and that this leads to antisemitism, but we're no longer sure if antisemitism is simply there and is what's leading Ireland to be the most critical country in Europe towards Israel.' Rabbi Yoni Wieder, chief rabbi of Ireland, expressed great disappointment with the conduct of the country's leaders and local media in the affair. 'The baseless accusations against the Israeli Embassy and the support from politicians and media figures in the country, who barely bothered to check the claim which is factually incorrect, reveal a disappointing and worrying trend. However, in light of what we've been experiencing and seeing here in recent months, unfortunately, it's no longer surprising.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/24/irish-president-accuses-israel-of-leaking-his-letter-to-iran/	2024-09-23T18:30:32-07:00
