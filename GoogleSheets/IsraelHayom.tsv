Inside the Netanyahu-Trump summit: How a 5-hour meeting could res...	In what senior diplomatic sources are characterizing as a watershed moment in US-Israel relations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu concluded an extensive five-hour White House meeting that sources say exceeded all expectations and carried 'profound implications for Israel's future.'

The two leaders proceeded to the Roosevelt Room, where the prime minister signed the guest book in the presence of both delegations. Netanyahu presented President Trump with both a gold-plated and standard pager as gifts, to which Trump responded, 'That was a tremendous operation,' referring to the sophisticated Israeli attack on Hezbollah in September, which included thousands of exploding pagers killing many of the terrorist group's operatives. Moving to the Oval Office, they delivered statements and fielded press questions before engaging in comprehensive discussions on pressing matters. The American delegation included Vice President J.D. Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and United States Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff. Secretary of State Marco Rubio joined via secure telephone line. The Israeli delegation comprised Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, National Security Council Chairman Tzachi Hanegbi, Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter, Chief of Staff Tzachi Braverman, and Netanyahu's military secretary, Major General Roman Gofman. Following these discussions, the prime minister and the president held a private one-on-one conversation. According to the diplomatic source, 'The president sent warm regards to the prime minister's wife, Sara Netanyahu, and their son Yair, recalling how impressed he was with them during dinner at Mar-a-Lago, and particularly noting Mrs. Netanyahu's influence regarding the urgency of securing the hostages' release.' The meeting concluded with a press conference, after which Trump gave Netanyahu a personal tour of the White House's second floor, including the Lincoln Bedroom. They proceeded to a two-hour dinner, characterized by its warm, friendly, and relaxed atmosphere. The president presented the prime minister with an inscribed and signed photograph of them together, reading: 'To Bibi, a great leader.' The diplomatic source emphasized that 'the relationship between Netanyahu and Trump has never been stronger or closer. Those hoping to see rifts between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu were sorely disappointed. Trump proposed brilliant solutions to challenges that have confronted Israel since its establishment. The prime minister thanked President Trump for releasing weapons that were previously withheld while Israel fought on seven fronts, as well as for his unwavering support of Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu.' The source added: 'President Trump spoke out against the Deep State in Israel and criticized the absurdity of requiring the prime minister to attend court proceedings three times weekly while managing a war that is reshaping the Middle East. It's now universally understood that attempting to topple a right-wing government during Trump's presidency represents national irresponsibility and severely damages the right-wing camp. We have nearly two years to achieve historic changes, and we must not squander this opportunity.'

Level it out, create development': Trump says US ready to 'take ...	President Donald Trump proposed that the United States take control of the Gaza Strip and completely rebuild the area during a White House press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday.

The president outlined his vision for American oversight of the territory, which would include clearing unexploded ordnance and rebuilding the region's infrastructure. Trump explained his plan would involve leveling damaged structures and fostering economic development to create jobs and housing. 'Do a real job. Do something different. Just can't go back. If you go back, it's going to end up the same way it has for 100 years,' Trump said. 'Level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area,' Trump elaborated. The meeting marked Netanyahu's position as the first world leader to visit the White House under Trump's second administration. When asked about the proposed American control of Gaza, Trump expressed his view that US oversight could bring regional stability.

He added that his consultations on the matter had received positive feedback, noting the potential for transforming an area currently marked by destruction. Netanyahu, addressing reporters' questions about Gaza, reaffirmed his three primary objectives, emphasizing the need to prevent future threats to Israel. 'President Trump is taking it to a much higher level,' Netanyahu said. 'He sees a different future for that piece of land that has been the focus of so much terrorism.' The leaders' discussions encompassed the ongoing ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Iran's regional influence, and plans for relocating Gaza residents to other countries. Trump characterized Gaza's current state as 'a symbol of death and destruction for so many decades,' suggesting that its future should take a different direction from its past. Netanyahu praised Trump's innovative thinking and willingness to challenge conventional wisdom. 'Your willingness to puncture conventional thinking, thinking that has failed time and time and time again, your willingness to think outside the box with fresh ideas, will help us achieve all these goals,' Netanyahu said. The Israeli leader concluded by emphasizing the shared nature of their nations' success, stating: 'Israel's victory will be America's victory. We will not only win the war working together, we will win the peace.'

Erdogan taking over? Turkey-Syria agreement revealed	Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are expected to discuss a joint defense pact today (Tuesday) in Ankara, which would include the establishment of Turkish air bases in central Syria and training for the new Syrian army, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. During the Syrian civil war, Turkey backed certain rebel groups, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which was led by al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammad al-Julani According to Reuters sources, including a Syrian security official, two foreign security officials based in Damascus, and a senior regional intelligence officer, the agreement may allow Turkey to establish new air bases in Syria, use Syrian airspace for military purposes, and take a leading role in training the forces of the new Syrian army. Abu Mohammad al-Julani. Photo: Reuters A regional intelligence source stated that potential locations for these air bases include the Palmyra military airfield and the Syrian army's T4 base, both of which were previously used by Iranian militias and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Over the past decade, these bases have been the target of numerous airstrikes attributed to the Israeli Air Force. Last week, al-Sharaa declared himself Syria's interim president, a month and a half after the fall of the Assad regime. In the same speech, he also announced the disbanding of 18 armed militias that participated in the offensive that led to Assad's downfall. 'We have broken the chains of Assad's regime, freed the tortured, and lifted the dust of humiliation and disgrace from the shoulders of al-Sham (the Levant). The sun of Syria has risen again, the people cheered, and the victory was great,' al-Sharaa declared in his speech. Erdogan presides over unprecedented military buildup. Photo: AFP An official from the Syrian presidential office told Reuters that al-Sharaa would discuss with Erdogan 'the training of the new Syrian army, as well as new deployment zones and areas of cooperation,' without specifying the locations. According to the official, Ankara is eager to establish bases in the region as a message to Kurdish autonomy forces in northeastern Syria. Although Turkey has previously threatened military action in the area, it has refrained from doing so while the new Damascus government engages in talks with Kurdish authorities over the fate of their military forces.

Iran preparing for rapid nuclear weapon development	New intelligence obtained by the US indicates that Iran is exploring faster ways to develop a nuclear weapon, according to The New York Times, The report was published overnight (Tuesday). This development comes as Iran's relatively new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has conveyed messages indicating his interest in engaging in dialogue with the new US administration. In addition, The New York Times reports that this intelligence was gathered in the final months of the Biden administration, and was transferred to Trump's team during the transition of power.

American officials told the newspaper that they believe Iran and its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have not yet made a final decision to develop a nuclear weapon.

Photo: AFP The new intelligence also reveals that, in light of Iran's failure to penetrate Israel's defenses and cause significant damage in its recent attacks, Tehran is examining the development of a new weapon intended to deter Israel and the US from attacking Iran. According to The New York Times, US intelligence estimates indicate that Iran is on the verge of possessing a nuclear bomb. This issue is expected to be a key topic in today's White House meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump.

Saudi researcher: Permanent Gaza ceasefire is prerequisite for no...	Normalization has become increasingly politicized, Saudi Arabia has developed a more nuanced understanding of Israeli dynamics, and security considerations have taken on unprecedented relevance. In an exclusive interview with Israel Hayom, senior Saudi researcher Dr. Aziz Alghashian provides insights into the intricate relationship between Riyadh and Jerusalem, while examining the profound impact of the Oct. 7 terror attack. Born into a prominent Saudi family with close ties to the ruling elite, Dr. Alghashian's early exposure to international diplomacy came through his childhood years in Washington, DC, where his father served at the Saudi embassy in the US. This experience sparked his enduring interest in Saudi foreign policy. After returning to Saudi Arabia in his youth, he pursued what he terms an 'academic journey,' completing his studies in Britain, earning his doctorate from the University of Essex, and teaching international relations and Middle East studies at the same institution. A central focus of his research has been examining why Israel and Saudi Arabia lack formal diplomatic relations despite their apparent convergence of interests. 'The relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia doesn't follow a linear trajectory. In fact, this process often experiences significant setbacks. The notion that 'my enemy's enemy is my friend' isn't necessarily correct. Many observers view bilateral relations through this simplistic lens, and unfortunately, this perspective persists even now. Even Israel's ambassador to the United States, in his remarks to the Jerusalem Post, continues to embrace this view. However, the reality is far more complex. While shared interests exist, they don't automatically translate into official relations.' Ceasefire for normalization Q: Recent reports indicate renewed interest from the Trump administration in reviving Israel-Saudi normalization talks. 'This clearly ranks among their [the Americans'] top priorities, but the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel and the potential for normalization hinges on two key elements – the Palestinian issue, and what can be offered through a US-Saudi agreement in the Senate. These two policy layers create inherent complexity. The outcome always depends on multiple factors. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends a EU - Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in Brussels on October 16, 2024. Photo credit: Ludovic Marin/AFP 'We've seen previous instances where normalization discussions were followed by regression. While I acknowledge ongoing efforts, I maintain that a permanent ceasefire is the primary prerequisite for normalization, among other conditions. Furthermore, the Saudis have consistently demanded credible and irreversible steps toward Palestinian statehood. It's worth noting that while these steps have been discussed, such conversations have typically remained confined to Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The Palestinians must also engage in negotiations and articulate their requirements for these steps. This dynamic reflects the current state of Saudi-Palestinian cooperation. This is what we're observing. 'Regarding the Palestinian component in normalization, a two-state solution framework is essential. Any normalization framework lacking strong, credible, and concrete steps in this direction seems improbable. Why? The Saudis require internal legitimacy. This becomes particularly crucial when considering that not only the broader Arab population but also Saudi citizens are closely monitoring developments in Gaza (during the war). 'Additionally, the Saudis have gained a more sophisticated understanding of how Palestinian and Israeli dynamics have evolved. They've developed insights into Netanyahu's conflict management approach, which involves constraining moderate elements while enabling Hamas, making it difficult to accept superficial gestures toward normalization. The Saudis will need to confront this reality. It's remarkable how some parties seem unwilling to accept 'no' as an answer. The Israel-Saudi normalization issue has become highly politicized in both Israel and Washington, which explains why it generates such extensive discussion.' The Saudi researcher then elaborated on additional factors underlying the Palestinian issue's significance for Saudi Arabia. 'From their perspective, this is fundamentally a security matter. Many overlook that it's not merely about legitimacy. I recall the terrorist attacks against Saudi Arabia, including a wave of al-Qaida violence. While this history might be forgotten or unknown to many outside Saudi Arabia, these terrorists consistently exploited the Palestinian issue. A soldier operating as smoke billows in the Gaza Strip, amid continuing battles between Israel and the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas on December 19, 2023. Photo credit: IDF, AFP When al-Qaida targeted the US, they characterized Americans as occupiers and facilitators of cooperation with Israel. This underscores the necessity of establishing a secure pathway toward Palestinian statehood.' The Palestinian issue Alghashian continued: 'From the Saudi perspective, even before the events of Oct. 7, they maintained that resolving the Palestinian issue was crucial for regional progress, citing the economic benefits of regional stability. However, I believe the Oct. 7 events and their aftermath transformed what was once a theoretical consideration into an immediate Saudi security concern. Essentially, the unresolved Palestinian issue has evolved into a direct security challenge. 'I sincerely believe there are Israelis committed to peace. This is undeniable, and I believe the current moment calls for enhanced dialogue and more proactive engagement,' the researcher concluded. However, he emphasized that despite recent enthusiasm surrounding Israel-Gulf relations and assumptions about moving beyond the Palestinian issue, the actual situation reflects a different reality.

Report: Iran develops nuclear missiles that can hit Israel, Europ...	The British Telegraph reported that Iran is developing missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads with a range of up to 3,000 kilometers, citing information from an exiled opposition group. Additionally, Iran unveiled what it claims to be a new ballistic missile capable of striking targets up to 1,700 km away - well within range of Israel. According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an opposition group, the Ayatollah regime has been using two facilities for missile development, concealing them as communication satellite launch sites. Work at these locations is conducted under strict secrecy and stringent security measures. The report identifies two key facilities where development and production are taking place. The first is located 35 kilometers from the northern Iranian city of Shahroud. The site reportedly employs personnel from the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND), which serves as the regime's arm for nuclear weapons development, alongside specialists from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) working on nuclear warheads. Satellite Image of the facility in Shahroud. Photo: David Schmerler/Center for Nonproliferation Studies According to the report, Iran aims to adapt nuclear warheads to be compatible with the Qaem-100 satellite launcher, which has already been successfully used at least three times for satellite launches. This system, the report claims, would enable Iran to target locations within a 3,000-kilometer range, bringing even European targets within reach. The second site, known as the Imam Khomeini Facility, is situated about 70 kilometers southeast of the central Iranian city of Semnan. At this location, Iran is reportedly developing missiles based on North Korea's Unha-1 rocket, which Pyongyang uses to launch satellites into space. The report indicates that the site contains underground facilities and has seen the addition of new structures over the past decade. The opposition organization shared satellite images with the British newspaper, showing suspicious activity at the site, activity that has previously been reported by international media.

The missile, named Etemad, meaning 'Trust' in Persian, was presented as the latest step in strengthening Iran's defensive capabilities. 'Developing defense capabilities and space technologies... aims to ensure that no country dares to attack Iranian territory,' Pezeshkian said in a televised speech. The path to a nuclear weapon To acquire nuclear weapons, in addition to fissile material, two other key components are required: designing the material into a nuclear warhead (where the processes leading to a nuclear explosion occur) and developing a system capable of delivering the warhead to its target, such as a ballistic missile, aircraft, or another platform.

Photo: Reuters While Iran continues to enrich uranium to levels approaching weapons-grade, following the attack on Iran in October 2024, reports indicated that Israel successfully targeted two other pillars of Iran's nuclear program. The first was planetary mixers, which are essential for ballistic missile production. The second, according to a report by journalist Barak Ravid on Axios, was a site in Parchin, where advanced equipment used to create a critical component of a nuclear warhead was reportedly damaged.

Freeing Hostages, ending Hamas rule: Talks on phase two begin	Negotiations on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement and of hostage deal will begin tomorrow in Washington with a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. As stipulated in the initial agreement, talks on the second phase are set to begin on the 16th day of the deal - tomorrow - and it now appears that this is about far more than just another stage in a temporary agreement. Israel seems to be on the path toward a comprehensive diplomatic agreement, with its foundation in Gaza and its head in Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu hinted at this just before his departure when he spoke about broadening the circle of peace. The fact that the talks are being orchestrated by the White House through Ron Dermer and will begin with Netanyahu's own meeting tomorrow, indicates that a significant diplomatic agreement is on the table. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Photo: AP/Evelyn Hockstein Entering the second phase of negotiations Tomorrow, Netanyahu will launch the talks in Washington, while Minister Ron Dermer will act as a senior coordinator on the issue with Witkoff and the US administration moving forward. The actual negotiations will be led by the Israeli negotiating team, headed by Mossad chief David 'Dadi' Barnea, who will only be dispatched for talks with the mediators after receiving directives from the White House. Unlike the previous discussions, which took place in a roundtable format with the participation of the US, Egypt, Qatar, and Israel, this phase will be managed entirely by the White House. Later this week, Witkoff is expected to initiate similar discussions with Qatar's prime minister and senior Egyptian officials, followed by another likely meeting with Netanyahu to coordinate the Israeli delegation's travel schedule for negotiations. Prime Minister Netanyahu and Steve Witkoff. Photo: Maayan Toaf (GPO) The focus of the talks will be political, with security aspects regarding Gaza's future governance, including the end of Hamas rule in the Strip. The negotiations will take place through 'shuttle diplomacy' led by Trump administration representatives, moving between Israel and the mediators following this week's discussions in Washington. It is worth noting that Netanyahu seems to have broad support in his coalition for entering negotiations on the second phase of the deal, which also includes long-term arrangements. Even those who had previously insisted on continuing the war at all costs appeared to have softened their stance over the weekend, allowing the Trump administration to present a formula for ending the war without a return to full-scale conflict. Tens of thousands of Gazans head to northern Gaza. Photo: Reuters With both the US and Israel looking toward Saudi Arabia in the next phase, it is important to note that the second phase and the return of the remaining hostages cannot be finalized without a commitment to ending Hamas rule in Gaza—something that would require Hamas representatives to agree to as well. Until now, Hamas has refused any framework that entails ending the war and its governance, thereby forcing Israel to continue fighting. Now, however, the talks will be restarted under new directives from the White House, and possibly a renewed willingness on the part of the Israeli government to bring the war to an end.

Iran says it has powerful new ballistic missile	Iran has revealed what it claimed to be new ballistic missile capable of travelling 1,056 miles, marking a significant display of military technological advancement during a ceremony attended by President Masoud Pezeshkian. Iran's supreme leader arriving at a joint graduation ceremony for cadets from armed forces academies in the Iranian capital Tehran on October 10, 2023 (Khamenei.ir / AFP) The missile, named Etemad – meaning 'trust' in Persian – was broadcast on state television on Sunday, with officials highlighting its substantial range. According to Agence France-Presse, the Iranian defense ministry described it as their 'most recent ballistic missile'. Western nations have increasingly expressed concerns about Iran's expanding ballistic missile program, viewing it as a potential destabilizing factor in the Middle East. The missile's capabilities are particularly notable as it can potentially reach Israel, which Iran targeted twice during the recent Gaza conflict. President Pezeshkian emphasized the strategic importance of the missile, stating in a televised address that the development of defense capabilities 'aims to ensure that no country dares to attack Iranian territory,' Agence France-Presse reported. The unveiling occurred on Iran's national Aerospace Day, just days before the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Republic's establishment on February 10, 1979. This event follows a pattern of military demonstrations that have intensified since the return of US President Donald Trump, who previously pursued a 'maximum pressure' approach towards Iran. Agence France-Presse noted that Tehran has simultaneously signaled openness to restarting negotiations over its nuclear program, a long-standing source of tension with Western countries. Historically forced to develop its own military equipment after US sanctions following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has constructed a substantial domestic arsenal. Despite being under an arms embargo during its devastating war with Iraq from 1980 to 1988, the country has since developed an extensive range of domestically produced weapons, including missiles, air defense systems, and drones. The missile's presentation underscores Iran's continued commitment to military self-sufficiency and technological independence in the face of international sanctions and geopolitical pressures.

Trump's vision for a new Gaza – and how Hamas might surrender	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embarks Sunday on a Washington visit centered around a pivotal Tuesday meeting with President Donald Trump. While the Prime Minister's Office announced a Friday return to Israel, concurrent preparations suggest a possible extension until the following Sunday. The leadership summit will address all major regional and international issues and their interconnections: Gaza ceasefire status, ongoing hostage liberation efforts, and subsequent phases of the hostage agreement. The agenda encompasses Hamas' eradication from Gaza, Iranian threats – particularly nuclear developments, and normalization agreements between Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the broader Arab world. Hamas terrorists secure an area in a square before handing over four Israeli hostages to a Red Cross team in Gaza City on January 25, 2025 AFP / Omar Al-Qattaa Israel Hayom has learned that mass evacuation from Gaza, including both Hamas operatives and those categorized as 'uninvolved population,' represents a cornerstone of American regional strategy – beyond mere public statements as many Israeli observers believe. During his visit, presidential envoy Steve Witkoff's messages indicated that through substantial Gazan emigration, the administration seeks to align Trump's war conclusion objectives with his stance, shared by many in the new administration, that Hamas must cease controlling Gaza. Significantly, during his Israel discussions, Witkoff stressed that considering October 7's atrocities, he too considers future Hamas governance of Gaza untenable. The American perspective holds that with minimal or no population remaining, Hamas control becomes unsustainable. Arab nations oppose relocation plan A phone conversation between Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi took place Saturday following multiple Arab nations' decisive rejection of Gaza evacuation proposals. Egyptian Presidential Palace communications termed the discussion 'positive dialogue' without elaborating. Earlier, foreign ministers of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates issued a joint statement 'rejecting forced Palestinian displacement while expressing readiness to collaborate with Trump on Israeli-Palestinian two-state solution implementation.' Israel would welcome extensive Gaza emigration, with Minister Ron Dermer, the prime minister's envoy, initially presenting the concept to Trump. However, Jerusalem maintains discretion given the matter's sensitivity. Ruling out Hamas 'shadow authority' In exclusive comments to Israel Hayom, a senior Israeli official suggested Hamas might voluntarily surrender Gaza control rather than face war-end demands. 'The option of renewed military action to achieve objectives remains viable, and we stand prepared,' the official stated. However, they consider Hamas leadership's voluntary relinquishment of control the most probable outcome. 'Within Palestinian faction discussions, Hamas recognizes the necessity of transferring authority. Their desire for ceasefire generates momentum for continued hostage releases. Consequently, further warfare might prove unnecessary, with the framework potentially satisfying war objectives,' the senior official told Israel Hayom. However, they emphasized Israel's rejection of any Hamas shadow authority in Gaza – contrasting with Hezbollah's years of Lebanese dominance.

EXCLUSIVE: Trump support revives Israeli plan for voluntary Gaza ...	A confidential document obtained by Israel Hayom reveals that the Ministry of Intelligence prepared an analysis in the second week of the war concluding that 'voluntary humanitarian evacuation of the civilian population from Gaza to other countries worldwide' represents the option that 'will yield positive, long-term strategic results for Israel.' The ministry advocates this approach over alternatives such as installing Palestinian Authority governance in Gaza or fostering local Arab leadership. Drafted before Israel's ground operation in Gaza, the recommendation to facilitate population evacuation was initially aimed at minimizing civilian casualties. While the Biden administration expressed reservations about Gazans leaving the Gaza Strip, and Egypt's firm opposition ultimately led to shelving the idea, Israeli sources now indicate the proposal has gained renewed relevance, particularly given the possibility of resumed combat operations. These sources point to historical precedent, noting that humanitarian corridors for civilian populations proved crucial during the US-led coalition's campaign against ISIS in the previous decade. The document specifically states that 'humanitarian evacuation of the population from the combat zone serves the best interests of Gaza's civilians.' Displaced Palestinians walk on a road in central Gaza to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip, Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2025. Photo credit: Abdel Kareem Hana/AP AP The initiative has gained fresh momentum after President Donald Trump recently voiced strong support for Gaza migration during a meeting with Intelligence Minister Gila Gamliel. This prompted renewed work on the plan originally formulated a year ago. Gamliel, who initiated discussions on the second day of the war and engaged with ministers from potential receiving countries last year, had previously suspended the initiative amid international legitimacy concerns and accusations of forced transfer. Current assessments suggest that securing the first country willing to accept Gaza residents could create a domino effect. Israeli officials estimate that 100,000 to 200,000 Gaza residents have already left the Gaza Strip since the war's outbreak, primarily through the Rafah crossing, with most settling in the Cairo area. An additional 1,000 wounded individuals and their escorts have departed via Israel's Ramon Airport to various countries. Professional sources continue to advocate for building international legitimacy around this 'outside-the-box' proposal. The strategy envisions prioritizing wounded individuals and humanitarian cases for initial departures. While experts anticipate initial criticism and backlash, they believe the international community will gradually accept the concept, noting that the right to emigrate is protected under the UN Declaration of Human Rights.

Photo credit: Brian Snyder/Reuters Israeli sources consistently emphasize, both now and previously, that the proposal strictly excludes forced evacuation, focusing solely on voluntary migration options, whether temporary or permanent. They stress Israel's commitment to allowing all who choose to leave the ability to return to Gaza at their discretion.

How real are US-Israel plans for Gaza emigration?	The White House is scheduled to inform Israel Tuesday about the timing of the anticipated meeting between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While initial preparations point to next week for the summit, final confirmation from the American side remains pending, with the possibility of the meeting taking place the following week. Then-President Donald Trump during an event in New Jersey in 2020 (AP / Alex Brandon) The upcoming summit will see both leaders establishing core policy directives between the new administration and the Israeli government that will shape relations in the months ahead. Priority issues include the Iranian nuclear situation, prospects for Israeli-Saudi peace, the Gaza Strip crisis, and the interconnections between these critical matters. A senior Israeli diplomatic source with direct knowledge indicates that discussions about voluntary migration from Gaza remain at the conceptual stage. The initiative was first raised during early meetings between Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Trump following the November election victory, with the White House now exploring potential approaches and ways to convince prospective countries to accept Gaza residents. However, no concrete or mutually agreed-upon plan has emerged. Prime Minister Edi Rama forcefully dismissed claims about Albania's potential role in resettling Palestinians from Gaza, calling such reports 'absolutely untrue' and emphasizing that no one has approached Albania about such an initiative. 'I haven't heard something so false in a long time – and there's been plenty of fake news recently! This is absolutely untrue,' Rama stated in his response to the reports that Trump wanted to have the Balkan country accept relocated Gazans permanently. Trump made similar calls on Arab states, including Jordan and Egypt. While expressing 'full respect and solidarity' for Gaza's residents, who he said have 'suffered greatly due to the violent Hamas regime' and endured war following October 7, Rama emphasized that Albania has not been approached about intervention and cannot take on such responsibility. The Albanian leader highlighted his country's strong relationships across the Middle East, including with Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and the Palestinian people, whose state Albania recognized years ago. However, he stressed Albania's European identity as a limiting factor. 'Albania is not located in the Middle East, and as a country in the heart of Europe, we cannot do more than any other European country on this matter,' Rama explained.

The IDF was compelled to fire warning shots skyward and resort to aimed fire to disperse the crowds. Israeli officials characterize this action as Hamas's attempt to exert pressure through civilians seeking to return to their homes. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem stated this morning that they had requested mediators to pressure Israel into permitting Gazans' return to northern Gaza. He indicated ongoing discussions with mediators to develop a solution for opening the Netzarim route. Concerning US President Donald Trump's remarks about Jordan and Egypt needing to absorb more Gazans, Qassem stated that 'Trump's statements are dangerous and align with extreme Israeli right-wing positions.' The IDF Arabic spokesman issued a directive to southern Lebanon residents: 'Do not return to the border villages until further notice.' With the conclusion of the 60-day pause, all readiness units along the northern border were activated to enhance alertness levels.

Trump tells Arab nations to accept Gazans, ends embargo on Israel	President Donald Trump revealed his support for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Arab countries and announced the restoration of powerful bomb shipments to Israel, Associated Press reported Saturday. Speaking to reporters during a 20-minute session aboard Air Force One, Trump disclosed that he had lifted restrictions on sending 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. 'We released them today,' Trump said, Associated Press reported. When asked about his reasoning, he added, 'Because they bought them.' The former president discussed his recent conversation with King Abdullah II of Jordan and announced plans for an upcoming discussion with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi about accepting Palestinians from Gaza, AP noted. 'I'd like Egypt to take people,' Trump said, according to Associated Press. 'You're talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say, 'You know, it's over.'' Kibbutz Nirim in southern Israel bordering the Gaza Strip: a damaged house following the deadly October 7 attack by Hamas terrorists from the Gaza Strip (AFP / Menahem Kahana) AFP / Menahem Kahana Trump praised Jordan's previous acceptance of Palestinian refugees and expressed interest in expanding this approach. 'I'd love for you to take on more, cause I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it's a mess. It's a real mess,' Trump said he told the Jordanian king. The decision to resume bomb shipments marks a departure from his predecessor's policy. President Joe Biden had suspended the delivery of these weapons in May to discourage an Israeli offensive in Rafah. 'Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,' Biden told CNN in May, explaining his decision to withhold certain weapons. According to Associated Press, Trump acknowledged Gaza's current state of destruction. 'It's literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything's demolished, and people are dying there,' he said. He suggested his solution would involve working 'with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location, where they can maybe live in peace for a change.' The announcement comes as a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas continues, allowing for hostage releases and prisoner exchanges. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has not responded to Trump's comments, AP reported. After his inauguration, Trump suggested that Gaza 'really got to be rebuilt in a different way' and called it 'a phenomenal location, on the sea. The best weather, you know, everything is good. It's like, some beautiful things could be done with it,' AP reported.

Amid ceasefire: Gaza terror tunnel discovered near Israel	A year and three months into the war, the shaft of a tunnel was discovered close to the Gaza border. Explosives were found inside, according to information obtained Wednesday by 'Israel Hayom.' Since the ceasefire began, there have been numerous attempts by Gazans to breach the border perimeter. Some instances were met with warning shots, while in other cases, Israeli forces fired to kill in response to infiltrations. During efforts to clear the perimeter, IDF soldiers in southern Gaza located the tunnel shaft. The discovery is particularly concerning given Hamas' ongoing control over significant parts of Gaza and the presence of hundreds of thousands of Gazans in the southern region of the strip.

Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit The proximity of the tunnel shaft to the fence shows that despite aggressive IDF operations in Gaza, the threat of infiltration into Israel persists. This underlines the need for continued efforts to neutralize Hamas, which is reestablishing its control over Gaza. Currently, the IDF is working to establish a series of outposts along the perimeter, which is approximately 700 meters wide in most areas, and as narrow as 400 meters in certain sections.
