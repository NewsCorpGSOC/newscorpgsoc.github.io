Security Council to vote on Gaza ceasefire as US stance unclear	The United Nations Security Council will convene Wednesday to vote on a resolution for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The initiative, spearheaded by the council's ten non-permanent members and formally introduced by the Guyananese delegation, comes after days of intensive diplomatic efforts to craft language that might avert a US veto. Washington's stance on the measure remains uncertain. The United Nations Security Council (Johannes Eisele/AFP) Johannes Eisele/AFP Previously, in June, the United States successfully shepherded through the Security Council a resolution that called for both a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages. While Security Council resolutions currently serve as declarations without immediate enforcement power over Israel, the council retains the authority to implement various measures, including the potential imposition of sanctions. The current Gaza war broke out on Oct. 7, when Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel, killing over 1,000 Israelis and taking over 250 kidnapped. As of Nov. 20, 101 Israelis remain held hostage in Gaza, 35 of whom have been declared dead.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/20/security-council-to-vote-on-gaza-ceasefire-as-us-stance-remains-uncertain/	2024-11-19T22:25:42-08:00	
IDF warns of 'Sabra and Shatila scenario' in debate over US-manag...	A crucial meeting convened yesterday (Monday) by Defense Minister Israel Katz with top IDF brass focused on overhauling humanitarian aid distribution methods in Gaza to circumvent Hamas control. The discussions centered on a controversial proposal to allow a US private security firm to manage civilian affairs and aid distribution in designated Gaza neighborhoods, with the IDF maintaining only peripheral security operations. The high-level gathering included IDF Operations Chief Major General Oded Basyuk, Strategy and Third-Circle Directorate Head Major General Eliezer Toledano, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, and additional military officials. The senior command presented a comprehensive analysis of the plan's merits and potential pitfalls, highlighting several critical concerns. In a particularly pointed intervention, Major General Toledano issued a stark warning, invoking the specter of a 'Sabra and Shatila' scenario. He cautioned that any civilian casualties caused by the private company's operations in Gaza neighborhoods could be attributed to the IDF, given its presence in the area, potentially triggering international backlash.

Photo credit: Reuters/Hatem Khaled REUTERS The historical parallel references the aftermath of the First Lebanon War, when Christian forces, operating under IDF security perimeter, entered the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. While their stated mission targeted PLO fighters, the operation resulted in civilian casualties, leading to widespread international condemnation of Israel as the overseeing force. Defense Minister Katz pushed back against these comparisons, emphasizing the fundamental difference between a professional American security company and the historical events involving Christian factions at Sabra and Shatila, dismissing any parallel between the two scenarios. The concerns voiced by Toledano resonated with other participants, including the head of the International Law Department in the Military Advocate General's Corps, who shared similar reservations about introducing a US private security company into the humanitarian aid operation. Earlier reporting revealed an additional legal complexity: if Israel finances the American company's civilian operations in Gaza neighborhoods, international law could view it as an extension of Israeli authority. To navigate this challenge, officials are exploring alternative funding through foreign nations or international aid organizations. Member of the Security Cabinet, Minister of National Missions Orit Strock offered a stark assessment: 'Each day that humanitarian aid continues to sustain Hamas represents another cycle of self-defeating actions that undermine our war objectives, endanger our soldiers, and compromise our hostages. This paradox cannot continue.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/19/idf-warns-of-sabra-and-shatila-scenario-in-debate-over-us-managed-gaza-aid/	2024-11-19T10:07:13-08:00	
Former Hamas hostage confronts UCLA protest leader in campus deba...	A survivor of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack in Israel delivered powerful testimony about her 54 days in captivity as she faced off with a student protest leader at a campus debate in Southern California. The confrontation, captured in a video segment released Monday by The Gr8 Debate and filmed by Trusted Confidential Coverage (TCC), brought together former hostage Moran Stella Yanai, UCLA encampment leader Aidan Doyle, and Mosab Hassan Yousef, son of Hamas co-founder Sheikh Hassan Yousef. Released hostage Moran Stella Yanai stands up to UCLA Encampment leader Aidan Doyle, who glorified October 7 Massacre.

Doyle, who had previously expressed support for the Oct. 7 attack, avoided eye contact throughout much of Yanai's testimony. 'We went to dance. We didn't attack,' Yanai said of the festival, as Doyle shook his head. 'Don't get annoyed. I'm really asking you as a person, do you support those actions? If you didn't support those actions and October 7th didn't happen, would we sit here, talking right now?' Doyle replied: 'Well yeah, actually, we probably would be.' Yanai described how her ordeal began when she broke her leg while trying to escape through the desert near Mount Negev. She recounted the horror of being taken into Gaza, where she witnessed civilians celebrating her capture despite her visible injuries. 'When I was entering Gaza I saw 100 percent of civilians celebrating me being taken,' she said, describing her broken leg and extensive bruising. 'I didn't know about the other hostages, I thought it was only me.' Her family learned of her kidnapping through a viral TikTok video discovered by her 12-year-old niece, which showed Yanai pleading for her life as her captors shouted in the background. During her 54-day captivity, Yanai was moved between seven heavily guarded locations where she faced constant surveillance, limited access to food and water, and needed permission to use bathroom facilities. She revealed that her captors told her they 'planned to move on and kill as much as they could and slaughter everybody,' unaware that 3,000 people were present at the festival. Nearly 400 festival attendees were killed in the attack. they brought a hostage to a debate — Aidan Doyle (@aidandoyleee) November 18, 2024 Yanai was released last November as part of a hostage exchange agreement. Despite the trauma she endured, she emphasized her desire for dialogue and understanding, telling Doyle, 'I really want to hear your side, that's my agenda, of co-existing.' Currently, 101 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza. Following the debate, Doyle took to X (formerly known as Twitter) dismissively commenting on Yanai's presence, writing 'They brought a hostage to a debate.' Hassan Yousef later offered a scathing critique of Doyle's performance, saying mockingly, 'He came really prepared. He memorized the narrative, even perfected it more than those who had been claiming it for 70 years. He knows a lot more than Yasser Arafat on Palestine.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/19/former-hamas-hostage-confronts-ucla-protest-leader-in-campus-debate/	2024-11-19T06:00:25-08:00	
Legal snag blocks US firm from handling Gaza aid	Israeli defense and political leadership are evaluating a proposal to deploy an American security company in the Gaza Strip to oversee humanitarian aid distribution, with a specific focus on preventing the Hamas terror organization from seizing the supplies. The northern Gaza neighborhood of Al Atatra has been designated as the potential pilot site for this initiative. However, according to information obtained by Israel Hayom, the proposal has yet to reach the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet for approval, facing significant legal hurdles. The primary obstacle stems from international law's definition of 'occupation,' as the American company would effectively function as an Israeli proxy, operating under Israeli authority. Palestinians carry bags of flour they grabbed from an aid truck near an Israeli checkpoint in Gaza City, Feb. 19, 2024 (Reuters/Kosay Al Nemer) Reuters/Kosay Al Nemer Defense officials are exploring alternative funding mechanisms to address these legal challenges, including potential financial support from international aid organizations or foreign nations for the American security company's operations, which are projected to cost tens of millions of dollars. In related developments, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disclosed Monday during a closed-door session of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that he has instructed the IDF to present a comprehensive plan by Thursday to prevent Hamas from intercepting humanitarian aid in Gaza. Addressing the same issue, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told Army Radio that 'the IDF's failure to assume responsibility for humanitarian aid distribution represents one of the significant shortcomings in this war.' The ongoing efforts to establish a secure aid distribution mechanism reflect the broader challenges of ensuring humanitarian assistance reaches Gaza's civilian population while preventing its diversion by Hamas.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/19/legal-snag-blocks-us-firm-from-handling-gaza-aid/	2024-11-19T02:00:34-08:00

WATCH: Noa Argamani surprises young survivor on birthday	The sound of laughter echoed through the home of former hostage Emily Hand's home on Sunday as fellow survivors of Hamas captivity Noa Argamani and Hila Rotem Shoshani arrived bearing gifts, traditional Moroccan doughnuts, and birthday candles to celebrate the young girl's 10th birthday. Life in Kibbutz Be'eri had already dealt Emily significant challenges before the Oct. 7 attack. After losing her mother to cancer as a toddler, she found maternal love through her father's former wife Narkis Hand, who raised her as her own until tragedy struck again. Narkis was among those killed in the massacre, her life cut short at age 54. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Free Our Kids il (@freeourkids_il) That fateful morning, Emily was enjoying a sleepover at her friend Hila's house, unaware that their world was about to change forever. Both girls were taken captive and held in Gaza for approximately two months before being freed together in a hostage exchange agreement. Now, almost a year after their release, Hila returned to Emily's life once more, this time accompanied by Noa, to transform a regular Sunday into a celebration of life and friendship. As Emily blew out her birthday candles, surrounded by those who shared her extraordinary journey, the moment served as a powerful reminder of survival and hope. The young girl, who holds dual Irish-Israeli citizenship, continues to rebuild her life in Israel alongside her 65-year-old father Thomas.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/19/watch-noa-argamani-surprises-young-survivor-on-birthday/	2024-11-18T23:28:19-08:00	
Families of American Oct. 7 victims file lawsuit against Iran	The families of American victims who were murdered in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, along with families of American-Israeli soldiers killed during subsequent military operations in Gaza, have filed a lawsuit against Iran in a US federal court. According to The New York Times, the lawsuit accuses Tehran of providing crucial support for what the plaintiffs describe as the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust, including direct funding for what Hamas leaders internally called 'the big project.' The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in Washington, outlines Iran's extensive financing network supporting Hamas and details Tehran's backing of other terror organizations committed to Israel's destruction. The case builds its foundation, in part, on recently captured Hamas documents discovered in Gaza and subsequently published in media reports. The plaintiffs' legal team has secured original documents revealing a crucial December 2022 clandestine planning meeting of Hamas' political and military leadership. During this high-level gathering, Yahya Sinwar, then Hamas' Gaza chief, sought an additional $7 million in monthly funding from Iran's Revolutionary Guards to finance what would become the Oct. 7 attack, cryptically referred to in documents as 'the big project.' Families gather at the White House to advocate for their relatives held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. Photo credit: AFP AFP According to The New York Times, the lawsuit highlights the Revolutionary Guards' critical role in orchestrating coordination between Hamas and Hezbollah during attack preparations. All organizations named in the lawsuit – Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the US. The Oct. 7 attack claimed the lives of 46 Americans, including children. Hamas took approximately 250 people hostage, among them 12 Americans. While seven Americans remain in Gaza, three have been declared dead. The legal action also encompasses Americans killed in combat operations in Gaza or along Israel's northern front. More than 30 American-Israeli citizens lost their lives while serving in the IDF. Among those fallen was Moshe Leiter, 39, a reservist serving in an elite naval unit. His father, Dr. Yechiel Leiter, is slated to become Israel's ambassador to the US next year. The American casualties included Danielle Waldman, 24, a Palo Alto, California native. She and her boyfriend were among at least 360 people killed at the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023. Evidence suggests she was ambushed in her vehicle, later found with multiple bullet holes and bearing bloodstains. According to The New York Times, the plaintiffs seek damages under both the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and the PATRIOT Act. The case is being pursued by a team of prominent attorneys, including Gary M. Osen, known for representing Nazi victims, and Lee Wolosky. American courts have seen numerous lawsuits against Iran by terror victims over the years. Iran consistently fails to appear in its defense, typically resulting in default judgments for the plaintiffs.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/18/families-of-american-oct-7-victims-file-lawsuit-against-iran/	2024-11-17T23:00:37-08:00	
Canada foils Iranian plot to assassinate Jewish human rights advo...	According to reporting by The Globe and Mail, Canadian law enforcement authorities recently foiled an Iranian plot to assassinate Irwin Cotler, a prominent human rights advocate and outspoken critic of Tehran's leadership. Authorities identified two suspects in the assassination plot, though their current status, whether arrested or fled, remains unclear. Cotler was informed on Thursday that the threat level against him had been significantly reduced. The Jewish 84-year-old has been under 24/7 Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) protection for over a year following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack in Israel. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) informed him he was a high-profile target of Iran. His security detail includes bulletproof vehicles, heavily armed officers and additional protective measures. Since 2008, he has spearheaded a global campaign to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. He has also represented Iranian political prisoners and strongly supports Israel. In June, following opposition party pressure, Canada joined the United States in declaring the IRGC a banned terrorist group. Ottawa cut diplomatic relations with Iran over a decade ago. Cotler served as Canada's first special envoy on Holocaust remembrance and combatting antisemitism from 2020 to 2023. He currently chairs the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights internationally. Today marks 6 months since the black sabbath of October 7th. 1200 brutally murdered, 250 taken hostage,& grave acts of torture & mass sexual violence by Hamas. 134 hostages remain in captivity. Freeing the hostages is standalone humanitarian issue, moral duty, & legal obligation pic.twitter.com/3ysPHrd7l1 — Irwin Cotler (@IrwinCotler) April 7, 2024 The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has also contacted Cotler regarding an unsealed New York indictment involving an Iranian murder-for-hire operation, the source said. While not named in the indictment, the FBI indicated to Cotler that his name emerged during their investigation. On Oct. 22, the US Justice Department charged senior IRGC official Ruhollah Bazghandi in connection with a 2022 plot to kill American human-rights activist Masih Alinejad, allegedly using Eastern European criminal organizations in New York. 'That is happening more and more with intelligence services using criminals to do work for them, and it gives them plausible deniability,' said Alan Treddenick, a former CSIS station chief in Saudi Arabia. Earlier this month, the US Justice Department charged Farhad Shakeri, described as an Iranian government operative previously imprisoned in America for robbery, in an alleged IRGC-ordered plot to kill Donald Trump and Alinejad. Shakeri remains at large in Iran. Two other men face charges for allegedly being recruited by Shakeri to surveil and kill Alinejad. Daniel Stanton, former CSIS senior manager and current director of the national-security program at the University of Ottawa Professional Development Institute, who recently hosted Alinejad, said Iran targets high-profile critics like Cotler and Alinejad as a warning to others. 'Regimes like Iran and also India want to hit the most high-profile, outspoken critics and dissidents because that sends a message to the people who don't have that status to basically shut up,' Stanton said. 'A lot of these intelligence agencies find it difficult to operate in countries like Canada and the United States, so they have to hire unscrupulous proxies to carry out the dirty work and that is easy to detect.' Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, with Minister of Foreign Affairs Melanie Joly, and Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions, and Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic LeBlanc, takes part in a press conference about the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's investigation into 'violent criminal activity in Canada with connections to India,' on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, October 14, 2024 (Photo: Reuters/Blair Gable) REUTERS Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei called the allegations a 'repulsive' plot by Israel and Iranian dissidents to 'complicate matters between America and Iran.' US authorities say the IRGC's elite Quds Force has historically targeted critics and recently began outsourcing assassination plots to organized crime groups and violent criminals. Iran's Quds Force operates as a clandestine wing of the IRGC, responsible for foreign operations, including arming Hezbollah and Hamas and conducting assassinations. Victims of Oct 7 sexual violence deserve recognition, justice & accountability- not gaslighting, silence, and denial. This is not a political issue; it's about human rights. Our Chair, @JayRosenzweig & Dr. @CochavElkayam call for truth & justice in this @Jerusalem_Post op-ed — Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights (@TheRWCHR) November 15, 2024 Cotler, a renowned international human-rights lawyer, has criticized many authoritarian governments, including Iran, for its role in the 2020 downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, which killed about 55 Canadians and 30 permanent residents, as well as Tehran's funding of Hamas. He warned that authoritarian regimes are waging a war against Western countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and many of those in Europe 'through three primary methods – electoral interference, transnational repression, and the spreading of harmful disinformation.' In 2015, Cotler founded the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, a Montreal-based organization dedicated to promoting human rights, advocating for political prisoners, and combatting injustice around the world. The group works in memory of Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved 100,000 Jews during the Second World War by issuing them diplomatic passports and sheltering them in safe houses.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/18/canada-foils-iranian-plot-to-assassinate-jewish-human-rights-advocate/	2024-11-17T23:00:02-08:00

Erdogan: 'We must push Israel into a corner'	Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, addressed relations with Israel today (Wednesday) and stated that there should be a complete break in trade relations with the Jewish state. 'Undoubtedly, Turkey dealt a hard blow to Israel by halting commercial activities with it,' the Turkish president said. Erdogan made these remarks in a speech at the climate summit in Azerbaijan, adding that 'coordinated diplomatic efforts must be used to push Israel into a corner.' He noted that it is too soon to determine whether Trump will act to reduce the risk of regional war in the Middle East. Photo: AFP Erdogan has reiterated similar statements in the past, likely due to mounting pressure on him to completely halt trade with Israel after Turkish traders found alternative routes to transfer goods to the Jewish state. More critically, Erdogan is under substantial pressure to stop the flow of oil from Azerbaijan to Israel, but so far he has refrained from taking that step.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/13/erdogan-we-must-push-israel-into-a-corner/	2024-11-13T05:00:52-08:00

Iran building new tunnel in Tehran due to Israel strikes	Iran has launched construction of what it describes as a 'defensive tunnel' in central Tehran, according to a Tuesday report by the Tasnim news agency, with officials citing recent Israeli strikes on Iranian territory as the impetus for the project. The underground passage, located in the city's center, will link a major metropolitan transit station to Khomeini Hospital, providing protected subterranean access to medical care in the event of aerial attacks on the capital's streets. Israeli soldier standing next to a ballistic missile retrieved from the Dead Sea after Iran launched drones and missiles toward Israel, April 16, 2024 (Reuters/Amir Cohen) Reuters/Amir Cohen Speaking to Tasnim, which is known for its close ties to Iran's conservative establishment, Tehran's transportation chief emphasized the unprecedented nature of the project: 'This marks the first time in our nation's history that we're constructing a civilian tunnel for preparedness purposes in the capital.' The tunneling initiative reflects Iran's broader strategy of underground fortification, which it has deployed extensively to protect its nuclear program, ballistic missile capabilities, and air force assets. Tehran has recently showcased multiple documentation of its subterranean infrastructure, including footage of underground ballistic missile storage and launch facilities, as well as a substantial underground air base housing combat aircraft. While Iran cites this civilian project as a response to Israeli actions, it bears noting that during last month's retaliatory strikes, Israel exclusively targeted facilities associated with Iran's military industrial complex and security forces, with no civilian installations among the targets.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/12/iran-building-new-tunnel-in-heart-of-tehran-due-to-israel-strikes/	2024-11-11T23:50:44-08:00	
Israel to expand Gaza aid zones as US deadline nears	A joint memorandum from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, delivered to Israel's senior cabinet members, outlined potential weapons transfer restrictions if Israel fails to ease humanitarian aid restrictions to Gaza within the designated timeframe. The US administration's comprehensive demands include a significant expansion of the humanitarian zone in Muwasi, a substantial increase in daily aid deliveries to 350 trucks, renewed engagement with UNRWA, and facilitation of Red Cross access to Hamas detainees. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during their meeting at the Kirya in Tel Aviv Kobi Gideon / GPO Responding to these pressures, the IDF has announced plans to expand humanitarian access zones in Muwasi, encompassing additional northern and eastern sectors. Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer is preparing a formal response indicating Israel's commitment to gradually scaling up aid truck volumes from the current 150-200 daily deliveries to meet the US target of 350 within weeks. The most contentious point remains Israel's stance on UNRWA, following recent legislation barring official contact with the UN agency's personnel due to their complicity in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. However, senior Israeli sources suggest Washington might be willing to show flexibility on this issue if Israel demonstrates substantial progress on other humanitarian measures.

Saudi crown prince leads Riyadh summit with sharp rebuke of Israe...	At Monday's Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman delivered a pointed critique of Israel's actions, reaffirming his nation's opposition to the military campaign in Gaza. 'The Kingdom stands firmly against any diminishment of the Palestinian Authority's role and violations of Lebanese sovereignty,' bin Salman declared, adding that Saudi Arabia 'categorically rejects any interference with humanitarian operations in Gaza.' He emphasized the Palestinian Authority's qualifications for full UN membership and notably expressed opposition to attacks on Iranian territory. The gathering drew an unprecedented assembly of regional leaders, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Jordan's King Abdullah. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas were among the approximately 50 Arab and Islamic leaders present at the conference. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas addresses the Turkish parliament during an extraordinary session on August 15, 2024 in Ankara, Turkey.

The leaders also discussed recent developments in Israel's conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah. Palestinian Authority President Abbas used the platform to advocate for his government's full UN membership bid. He called for Israel to 'end the occupation within a year by the International Court of Justice decision' and urged the international community to reassess their diplomatic ties with Israel. Abbas pushed for the suspension of Israel's UN membership, citing violations of international law, and emphasized the necessity of implementing UN Security Council resolutions 'to halt Israeli aggression in Gaza.' The summit reached its crescendo with Turkish President Erdogan's forceful address, calling for both an arms embargo against Israel and a halt to trade relations. His speech included sharp criticism of the Israeli parliament's recent decision to terminate UNRWA operations within Israeli territory.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/11/saudi-crown-prince-leads-riyadh-summit-with-sharp-rebuke-of-israel/	2024-11-11T00:00:13-08:00	
Footage of Hamas brutally interrogating Gazans uncovered	The IDF has discovered thousands of hours of surveillance footage documenting Hamas terrorists torturing Palestinian civilians at a military facility in northern Gaza, according to reporting from The Mail on Sunday. The videos – found on computers seized from a compound in the Jabalia refugee camp – show disturbing scenes of systematic abuse between 2018 and 2020. The footage reveals prisoners, hooded and chained, being subjected to various forms of torture while their captors appear casual and indifferent. 'The IDF found these CCTV images in March. It took months to go through them all,' a senior Israeli military source told The Mail. In multiple recordings, prisoners are shown with sacks covering their heads, restrained to floors and ceilings. One sequence depicts a guard reclining in a chair while a prisoner hangs by his arms from the ceiling. Another shows a hooded prisoner in chains, barely able to touch the ground with one foot, before being choked by his captor. Hamza Howidy, 27, who fled Gaza after being detained for protesting against Hamas, described his experience to The Mail. 'They would torture you until you broke and say whatever it is they wanted,' he said. 'I could hear my fellow protesters scream in the next room.' According to Howidy, who escaped through the Egyptian border in September last year, one detainee was tortured three times weekly for three years. 'You would never get a lawyer and your family would have no idea what happened to you. I was lucky because my family paid a price for me,' he said. Human rights organizations have long documented Hamas' abuse of civilians. Amnesty International published a 44-page report highlighting a campaign of abductions, torture, and killings following the 2014 conflict. A former Israeli intelligence officer, identified as Guy C, told The Mail that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was eliminated by the IDF last month, was 'obsessed with finding collaborators and held thousands against their will.' The officer detailed brutal torture methods, saying, 'They have been known to melt plastic over skin, electric cables on their body. Some are electrocuted on electricity pylons or dragged on a chain from a vehicle until they die.' Palestinian Ahmed Fouad Alkharib, now a fellow at the Atlantic Council think-tank in the US, said, 'Extreme torture has been a fundamental component of Hamas' governance strategy to ensure they deter people and instill fear in those who speak out.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/10/footage-of-hamas-brutally-interrogating-gazans-uncovered/	2024-11-10T00:00:17-08:00
