Israel's US ambassador on Egyptian military buildup: 'Not tolerab...	Israel's ambassador to the US, Dr. Yechiel Leiter, has issued a stark warning about the growing military presence of the Egyptian army in the Sinai Peninsula, in violation of the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, marking the first time an Israeli official has spoken out on the matter. In a recent briefing to Jewish organization leaders in the US, Leiter described the situation as 'intolerable.' Speaking to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Leiter stated, 'This is an issue that will come up. Egypt is in a very serious violation of our peace agreement in the Sinai. This is an issue which is going to come to the fore, because this is not a tolerable situation.' The ambassador further warned, 'There are bases being built, and they can only be used for offensive operations and offensive weapons. This is a clear violation. For a long time, this issue has been shoved to the side, but it continues. This is a issue that we are going to put on the table – very soon and very emphatically.'

Israel has so far refused to comment on Egypt's overall military buildup, particularly the deployment of large military forces in Sinai, which contradicts the security annex of the peace treaty. Security and diplomatic sources confirmed that over the years, Egypt has repeatedly moved forces into Sinai in violation of the agreement, only to request retroactive approval from Israel, permission that was consistently granted by Netanyahu. Dr. Yagil Henkin, a military affairs expert who first warned about these troubling developments in 2018, explained, 'This happened through a process of creeping annexation. First, they deployed forces, then they sought retroactive Israeli approval, which was always granted. Even after the operational need ended, the forces were never withdrawn.'

It started with two battalions, and today there are tens of thousands of soldiers and dozens of tanks. Some are concentrated near Egyptian Rafah, while others are stationed near former ISIS strongholds in Sinai. The operational necessity to fight ISIS has passed, yet the forces remain. Additionally, Egypt has developed infrastructure, including bridges, roads, and large tunnels, enabling them to transfer entire divisions into Sinai within hours from the western side of the Suez Canal.' Members of the US Congress are aware of Egypt's violations and intend to bring the issue to the agenda. In an internal discussion among Republican lawmakers, a provision was raised stating, 'Egypt is substantially violating the Camp David Accords through the deployment of forces and movement of tanks into Sinai. This poses a strategic threat to Israel's southern border, and specifically falls under US responsibility as the agreement's guarantor.' The agenda item also calls for a review of US economic assistance to Egypt in light of its military presence in Sinai. 'American funding to Egypt must be reevaluated based on these agreements. Egypt must be presented with a timeline for withdrawing its forces from the peninsula,' the policy proposal states.

Hostage's mother: I replay our final conversation every night for...	For 500 days and nights I've missed my beloved firstborn son so much. I have tears in my eyes now when I hear that number. It's inhuman. I'm still stuck on October 7. I must replay, every night, our last conversation. My Edan called before 7 AM and spoke loudly because of the noise around him. I hear explosions in the background that won't stop, and Edan tells me: 'You won't believe what I'm seeing here – war. I took shrapnel to my helmet, but I'm okay.' And I, his mother, beg him: 'Edan, take care of yourself, protect yourself, I'm with you, I love you so much,'' Yael Alexander recounts. The call was cut off. Edan was taken captive to Gaza from a military post near Nirim kibbutz near the Gaza border. Yael says she was beside herself. 'You're just a shell, you're finished. We weren't human beings. I couldn't sleep or eat. Boom. Suddenly your child disappears. For five nerve-wracking days we didn't know day from night. We opened many operations rooms, until after several agonizing days they informed us Edan was captive in Gaza. An insane nightmare. But at least we knew he was alive and walking on his feet.' Yael Alexander with her son, Edan Alexander (Photo: Courtesy) 'It was like a knife in the heart' Since then, Yael, an artist, and her husband, Adi, a diamond dealer, who live in the US, haven't stopped for even a moment crisscrossing Washington and other American states. Edan has American citizenship, and his parents now dedicate their lives to fighting with all their might for his return from captivity – along with all the other hostages. They leave their occupations for days each week for the struggle. Last Friday afternoon, Yael arrived in Israel just as the names of three more released hostages were announced. By Saturday evening she was already at the Hostages Square, raising Edan's photo on stage. 'I admit it was difficult for me. This is my first time in Israel during a release. The TV images of what Hamas is doing simply hurt my stomach. They're stressful.' As part of their heroic struggle, Yael and Adi met with, among others, President Donald Trump ('he's very committed to the hostages'), as well as administration officials and other figures. They conduct interviews and work tirelessly to influence and bring back their captive son. 'It's not Jewish, not ethical, and not moral not to support getting all the hostages out immediately, and now,' says Yael, 'certainly not to support stage two of the deal, during which our Edan is finally supposed to leave this terrible captivity.' 'We saw the latest returnees, and for me, it was like a knife in the heart. On one hand, I was happy for the families, and on the other hand, it wasn't simple to see them. Edan fought to be in the army. Why, why aren't they fighting for him now in return? I cry out – give me back my son already! Bring all the hostages home!' 'He wouldn't give up serving in the IDF' Edan is their firstborn son. When he was just two and a half months old, Yael (45) and Adi (52) moved to the US, and from age 4 Edan grew up in New Jersey. He has a sister, Mika (18), and a brother, Roy (13), who recently celebrated his bar mitzvah without his brother. Edan Alexander with his family (Photo: Courtesy) A warm, united, enveloping, and loving family. Yael speaks with sparkling eyes about her Edan: a child full of joy, charismatic, who always knew how to unite his many friends around him. She gets emotional talking about him, her voice cracking from time to time. 'Our Edan was always super social, super family-oriented. A talented and beloved child, always smiling, someone who really loved life. We were always very, very close. Edan and I loved to travel together for a day of fun in New York. We had deep, moving conversations. He's the funniest person in the world. Hilarious. He devoured life. How much I love this child.' After finishing high school in the US, while his many friends went to study in college, Edan refused to give up on military service in Israel. 'It wasn't simple for us at first,' Yael recalls, 'but Edan was very determined. He was in the Garin Tzabar program here in New York and made aliyah in August 2022. A young man, my precious boy. It was hard for him at first with the distance from home, and for us, too. We missed him very much. Fortunately, I have a very large family in Israel who embraced him, and we also came to Israel a lot and were with him. He, for his part, made sure to come visit us.' In Israel, Edan lived in Kibbutz Hatzor, where 'He has a wonderful adoptive family,' according to Yael. He enlisted in the Golani Brigade in mid-December 2022 as a lone soldier. He frequently visited his grandparents, as well as other family members. Two months before Black Saturday, Edan traveled to visit his family in the US. Yael surprised him when she decided to come to Israel a month and a half later to meet him and her family here. 'I arrived in Israel on September 31, 2023, and Edan and I spent a lot of time together. All the time. With my family in Tel Aviv, with grandmother, Varda, and grandfather, Baruch, with my siblings. We went on an art tour, ate malabi, the dessert he loves so much. And we kept hanging out. That's what Edan is like, full of vitality and energy. We were at the beach, and then went to eat hamburgers. He was happy.' 'He feels us from afar' To Yael's regret, Edan had to return to his base near Nirim. She still managed to drive him to Hatzor, they even took photos in the car and at the entrance to his home in the kibbutz. She didn't know these would be her last pictures with him until he returns from captivity. Yael Alexander with her son, Edan Alexander (Photo: Courtesy) 'On the evening of Simchat Torah, on Friday, the day before October 7, Edan was with us for Kiddush on FaceTime. A handsome boy. There was a wonderful atmosphere. We agreed to talk the next morning. Who knew our next conversation would already be during a terrible war. Our lives turned upside down. It tears my heart apart. Makes me cry so much.' 'My son had a sweet life in the US, and he chose to be somewhere else, in Israel. What kind of terrible reality is this? I want them to bring him back to us already. What happened to us? What kind of leadership do we have? Where is the right, just judgment? I say to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 'Think for just one moment what would happen if this was your son.'' Yael says she must also take care of her two other children, to be strong for them too. She admits that often they are the ones strengthening her. She tells how Mika has already spoken several times at massive rallies across the US for the hostages ('in front of 600,000 people in the crowd'). 'They're amazing, my children. They were unwillingly enlisted in the struggle, in the war to bring their brother back from Gaza. Edan was supposed to come to Roy's bar mitzvah celebration, six months after the day he was kidnapped. That obviously didn't happen. We all went to the event wearing shirts with Edan's picture and the call to bring him home now. Mika and Roy miss their brother very much, they're both very close to him. Like us, they don't stop working toward the goal of his return to them.' Edan Alexander's family with President Donald Trump and Republican commentator Ben Shapiro (Photo: Courtesy) Yael also tells about the proof of life she received from her son, after 421 days in captivity. 'I was in Israel at the time. I suddenly heard they were going to release a video of Edan, our son, and the ground fell out from under me. I couldn't stop crying. It was shattering. Edan appeared in the video pale and thinner, didn't look like our Edan. I was overcome with a range of emotions. On one hand, it was important proof of life for us. Look, Edan is alive. But this is your child, and you see him in such a state. I just wanted to hug him already. I'm an optimistic person, and I want to see good things. My son is strong, and I know he can survive this. I believe he feels us from afar. Since the video we haven't received any additional proof of life from him, and I repeat our request again: get him out of there already!' She tells again and again that her heart is 'constantly torn' and seeking solace. What does a mother hold onto, 500 days without her beloved son? 'I'm eagerly waiting for my meeting with Edan,' says the lioness mother, who has come to Israel again to fight for his release. 'I just want to sit next to him. He has very comforting shoulders. I'll put my head on his shoulder and tell him 'how wonderful, how wonderful that we're together again.' I don't know what he'll want when he's with us again. Maybe he'll say he's craving Thai food. Maybe sushi. I just want to reach that moment already – when our Edan will sit with us at home.'

British Muslim calls for Israel's destruction – while in Israel	A Muslim tourist from Britain who visited Israel documented his trip in a series of videos where he explicitly called for the state's destruction, labeled IDF soldiers as 'baby killers' and displayed overt hostility toward Israel. The incident occurred just one month after a terrorist, who had entered the country under the guise of being a tourist, perpetrated a stabbing attack in Tel Aviv.

Credit: TikTok/isheverything In the videos he posted, the tourist detailed the precautionary measures he took to conceal his Muslim identity when entering Israel. After landing, he ridiculed the Israeli presence at Ben Gurion International Airport and described the state's flags as 'filthy.' His rhetoric intensified during a visit to the Temple Mount, where he explicitly called for Israel's destruction, asserting this was the sole solution to ensure freedom of worship at the al-Aqsa mosque. The emergence of these videos comes approximately one month after the Tel Aviv attack, perpetrated by a terrorist who gained entry to Israel as a tourist, despite raising suspicions during border checks. In response to these recent events, Israel's National Security Minister has instructed the Shin Bet to review procedures and draw conclusions.

Bibi you do whatever you want': Trump doubles down on hostages	President Donald Trump told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 'do whatever you want' regarding Gaza operations, CBS News reported Sunday, as the Israeli leader praised Trump's 'bold vision' for the region's future and accepted a major US weapons delivery previously blocked by the Biden administration. In a joint appearance with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said Israel and the United States share a 'common strategy' regarding Gaza. 'We can't always share the details of this strategy with the public, including when the gates of hell will be opened, as they surely will if all our hostages are not released until the last one,' Netanyahu said, according to CBS News. Rubio, speaking to CBS News 'Face the Nation' moderator Margaret Brennan after meeting Netanyahu, emphasized ongoing efforts to secure the hostages' release. 'Obviously, there are details of how we're pursuing that and coordinating that we're not going to share publicly because we don't want to endanger the hostages and we don't want to endanger this process,' Rubio said. The statements came as the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Gaza approaches its end in two weeks. The second phase, involving the release of remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and Israeli force withdrawal, remains under negotiation. President Donald Trump rides in the presidential limousine known as 'The Beast' as he takes a pace lap ahead of the start of the NASCAR Daytona 500 auto race at Daytona International Speedway, Sunday, Feb. 16, 2025, in Daytona Beach, Fla. (Pool via AP) Netanyahu welcomed Trump's recent proposal for Gaza's future, praising the 'unequivocal support' from the US. Rubio acknowledged that Trump's vision to transform the Gaza Strip into a 'Riviera of the Middle East' had surprised many observers. 'The president's also been very bold about his view of what the future for Gaza should be, not the same tired ideas of the past, but something that's bold and something that, frankly, took courage and vision,' Rubio said, according to CBS News. Trump, speaking to reporters at the Daytona 500, commented on his discussions with Netanyahu: 'I told Bibi you do whatever you want. Because my statement was, they got to comeback.' The former president noted that recently released hostages appeared to be in 'pretty good shape.' Tensions escalated Sunday when the Israeli military conducted an airstrike in southern Gaza. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry reported three police officers were killed while securing aid truck entry near Rafah. Hamas called the attack a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire and accused Netanyahu of attempting to undermine the agreement. The conflict began after Hamas's October 7 attack, which killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 hostages. On Saturday, Israel received a shipment of MK-84 heavy bombs after Trump lifted restrictions previously imposed by the Biden administration, CBS News reported. When asked about the weapons delivery, Trump emphasized, 'Peace through strength. You understand that, right? It's called peace through strength.' During their meeting, Netanyahu and Rubio also addressed concerns about Iran, with both officials emphasizing the need to prevent Iranian nuclear weapons development and counter regional aggression. Netanyahu highlighted Israel's recent actions against Iran since the Gaza war began, expressing confidence in completing 'the job' with Trump's support.

Report: This is Egypt's plan for Gaza reconstruction	The Qatari Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported Saturday morning that Egypt's plan for Gaza's reconstruction is centered on forming a Palestinian committee overseen by the Palestinian Authority, excluding Hamas from the process. According to Egyptian sources, this committee is expected to take responsibility for Gaza's reconstruction as part of the proposed framework. Additionally, Egyptian and other companies will undertake reconstruction projects under the plan, while Arab or international forces may be involved in securing their operations. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Photo: AFP However, the Qatari report noted that Israel has expressed opposition to these proposals during discussions with Egypt and remains committed to alternative options. Egyptian sources added that the presence of Arab or international forces in Gaza is a particularly sensitive issue, as some countries refuse to engage in direct military involvement. Any force that intervenes in Gaza could face internal resistance. The report also highlighted concerns that the reconstruction and rebuilding process could create tensions with Gaza-based terrorist organizations due to the presence of tunnels and other infrastructure used by these groups.

Photo: Reuters A senior Arab diplomatic source told the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat that there is ongoing coordination among Arab states to formulate a comprehensive response to Trump's plan for Gaza. According to the source, Arab leaders are expected to meet to discuss the details before presenting their proposal at an emergency summit in Cairo at the end of the month. Meanwhile, a Reuters report suggested that Arab proposals may include a 'reconstruction fund' and an agreement to sideline Hamas. Sources indicated that at least four proposals have been drafted regarding Gaza's future, though it appears that Egypt's plan is currently the leading framework.

Houthi leader: In the event of escalation we will attack Israel, ...	Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthi Yemeni terrorist organization, stated today (Thursday) in a speech that 'Israel is clearly evading the second phase of the deal, and Netanyahu has announced his intention to extend the first phase. He wants to take from the Palestinians what is included in the second phase, forcing them to release the remaining hostages in the first phase, while he does not fulfill his commitments.' He added, 'Trump has aggressively threatened the Palestinians and the resistance if all the hostages are not released by Saturday. He promises them hell and threatens them. He even denies the agreement he himself guaranteed to implement. The agreement has clear language, specific phases, and certain steps. Trump's position is a deviation from all international norms. It is a deception, a lie, and the use of tyrannical language and threats.' The Houthis. Photo: EPA/Yahya Arhab Following this, the Houthi leader warned: 'If the US and Israel move towards escalation, it means the region will enter into a big problem. There will be consequences for the security of the region. We will immediately take military action if Americans and Israelis, based on Trump's threat, move towards aggression against Gaza. We will not hesitate to attack both Israel and the US together. We are monitoring the implementation of the agreement. When we see a violation of the agreement and new escalation against the Palestinians, along with widespread aggression against them, we will intervene militarily as we did to support them.'

Hamas signals willingness to proceed with hostage deal	The delicate negotiations surrounding the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release agreement showed signs of progress Thursday, as mediators worked intensively to prevent the deal's collapse just 48 hours before Saturday's crucial deadline. Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar reported Thursday morning that talks between Hamas delegates and Egyptian intelligence officials in Cairo had yielded positive results, with sources indicating agreement on key issues that could enable the continuation of hostage releases while ensuring Israeli compliance with humanitarian commitments. The development comes at a critical juncture, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu scheduled to conduct a situational assessment at the Israeli Defense Forces' Southern Command amid growing tensions over the deal's implementation. According to Palestinian sources familiar with the negotiations, mediators have secured an initial Israeli commitment to fulfill humanitarian obligations, including the entry of essential supplies and equipment into Gaza.

Meanwhile, Saudi media reported that mediators have urged all parties to avoid provocations that could jeopardize the agreement's progress. The Qatari channel Al-Araby confirmed Thursday that trucks carrying tents had begun entering northern Gaza through the Zikim crossing, marking a tangible step in the humanitarian aspects of the agreement. Egyptian officials have reportedly rejected any forced displacement plans for Gaza residents and expressed commitment to the territory's reconstruction, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Cairo has also emphasized the importance of maintaining regular medical evacuations and ensuring the agreed-upon volume of aid deliveries continues to reach the enclave.
