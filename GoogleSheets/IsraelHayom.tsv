US is sending $375 million in military aid to Ukraine and will an...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Wednesday that the U.S. will send Ukraine an undisclosed number of medium-range cluster bombs and an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles in a military aid package totaling about $375 million; a U.S. official also said billions more in assistance over the coming months would be announced Thursday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the $375 million package as global leaders met at the U.N. General Assembly this week and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy used his appearance there to rally support. Zelenskyy will meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington on Thursday to continue his push to get them to allow his troops to use long-range weapon s to strike deeper into Russia. The package announced by Blinken includes air-to-ground bombs, which have cluster munitions and can be fired by Ukraine's fighter jets, as well as munitions for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Javelin and other anti-armor systems, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, bridging systems and other vehicles and military equipment. 'The United States is committed to Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s brutal aggression,' Blinken said in a statement. 'We will deploy this new assistance as quickly as possible to help Ukraine protect its territory and its people.' The latest package of weapons, provided through presidential drawdown authority, is one of the largest approved recently and will take stocks from Pentagon shelves to deliver the weapons more quickly to Ukraine. It comes as nearly $6 billion in funding for aid to Ukraine could expire at the end of the month unless Congress acts to extend the Pentagon’s authority to send weapons from its stockpiles to Kyiv. A U.S. official said, however, that the Biden administration is expected to notify Congress on Thursday of its intent to spend the remaining amount of money under presidential drawdown authority contained in the supplemental budget for Ukraine after the current fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. That amount, $5.5 billion, must either be used or notified to Congress by Sept. 30 or be lost and returned to the Treasury. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the expected move, said lawmakers would be told that the administration will spend the money in multiple aid packages that will be announced after Oct. 1, in the next budget year. Ukrainian and Russian forces are battling in the east, including hand-to-hand combat in the Kharkiv border region where Ukraine has driven Russia out of a huge processing plant in the town of Vovchansk that had been occupied for four months, officials said Tuesday. At the same time, Ukrainian troops continue to hold ground in Russia’s Kursk region after a daring incursion there last month. The aid announcement also came on the heels of Zelenskyy's highly guarded visit on Sunday to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank the workers who are producing 155 mm shells, one of the most critically needed munitions for his country’s fight to fend off Russian ground forces. Including this latest package, the United States has provided more than $56.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russian forces invaded in February 2022. ___ Lee reported from New York.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-to-send-375-million-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-including-medium-range-cluster-bombs/	2024-09-25T16:02:47-07:00	
Ukraine's president calls for unspecified global 'action' to forc...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Ukraine’s president dismissed the notion of peace talks with Moscow on Tuesday, calling instead for unspecified global 'action' to force Russia into peace for invading his country and to comply with the U.N. Charter’s requirement that every country respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all other nations. Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council that Russian President Vladimir Putin is committing 'an international crime' and has broken so many international rules that he won’t stop on his own. 'And that’s why this war can’t simply fade away. That’s why this war can’t be calmed by talks,' Zelenskyy said at a meeting on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly. 'Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what’s needed — forcing Russia into peace as the sole aggressor in this war, the sole violator of the U.N. Charter.' The high-level meeting on the more than 2½-year war in Ukraine was attended by ministers from 14 of the council's 15 member nations. Russia chose to send its lower-level U.N. ambassador. Vassily Nebenzia opened the meeting protesting that Zelenskyy was being given the U.N. spotlight again. He also criticized Slovenia — which holds the rotating council presidency this month — for allowing the Ukrainian leader's 'chorus' to speak. He meant about 10 European Union and NATO members who aren’t on the council but march 'in lockstep' every time they come to the council 'to malign the Russian Federation.' 'When it comes to listening to these hackneyed statements, and these cookie-cutter statements, we have no intention of wasting time on that,' Nebenzia said. Ukraine's sovereignty is defended U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres briefed the council, reiterating the United Nations’ strong support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity under the U.N. Charter. 'Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 – following the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol a decade ago – is a clear violation of these principles,' the U.N. chief said. Zelenskyy said Ukraine knows some countries want to talk to Putin. But, he asked, 'What could they possibly hear from him — that he’s upset because we are exercising our right to defend our people, or that he wants to keep the war and terror going just so no one thinks he was wrong?' China has repeatedly called for talks between Ukraine and Russia. Its foreign minister, Wang Yi, told the council that the suffering and destruction and increasing volatility in the region 'must be turned around.' Wang stressed that Chinese President Xi Jinping believes 'the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected.' China is pursuing peace talks and conducting shuttle diplomacy, Wang said, and its efforts have received wide international support. He pointed to a joint China-Brazil peace plan issued earlier this year. Zelenskyy also went after countries that supply weapons and ammunition to Russia, telling the council Moscow has no legitimate reason to make Iran and North Korea 'de facto accomplices.' The U.S. includes China, Iran and North Korea in its accusations U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised similar issues but also accused China, which has close ties to Russia, of providing Russia with machine tools, microelectronics and other items it is using 'to rebuild, restock and ramp up its war machine and sustain its brutal war.' Wang, who spoke after him, didn't directly respond but said: 'I also wish to make it clear that on the Ukraine issue, any move to shift responsibility onto China or attack and smear China is irresponsible and will lead nowhere.' Blinken also accused Iran of providing armed drones to Russia since 2022 and transferring hundreds of short-range ballistic missiles a few weeks ago – which its new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has denied. North Korea has also delivered trainloads of weapons and ammunition to Russia including ballistic missiles and artillery rounds, Blinken said. 'The more Russia relies on their support, the more Iran and North Korea extract in return,' Blinken said. 'And the more Putin gives to Pyongyang and Tehran, the more he exacerbates threats to peace and security.' To those who ask how the United States and others can help Ukraine defend itself and criticize countries supplying military materiel to Russia, Blinken said the answer is simple: 'Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim.' ___ Edith M.

Trump praises Russia's military record in argument to stop fundin...	SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — Donald Trump on Tuesday praised Russia's military record in historical conflicts and derided U.S. aid to Ukraine as he again insisted he would quickly end the war launched by Moscow's invasion if elected president. Speaking in Savannah, Georgia, Trump mocked President Joe Biden's frequent refrain that the U.S. would back the Ukrainian armed forces until Kyiv wins the war. He raised two long ago conflicts to suggest Moscow would not lose — the former Soviet Union's role in defeating Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in World War II in the 1940s, and French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's failed invasion of Russia more than a century earlier. Trump insisted that the U.S. had 'to get out,' though he did not specify how he would negotiate an ending to U.S. involvement in the war. 'Biden says, ‘We will not leave until we win,’' Trump said, lowering his voice to mimic the Democratic president. 'What happens if they win? That’s what they do, is they fight wars. As somebody told me the other day, they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon. That’s what they do. They fight. And it’s not pleasant.' An official on Trump's campaign also said Tuesday that the Republican nominee will not meet this week with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is visiting the U.S. to attend the opening of the U.N. General Assembly. No meeting had been scheduled between the two, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning, despite a statement from Ukrainian officials last week that said Zelenskyy had planned to see the former president. Trump on Tuesday repeated his characterization of Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for winning U.S. aid to help Ukraine. 'Every time Zelenskyy comes to the United States, he walks away with $100 billion,' Trump said, erroneously. The U.S. has provided more than $56 billion in security assistance since Russia invaded in 2022, according to the State Department. Trump and Zelenskyy have a long history dating back to the former U.S. president's time in the White House. The then-president pressured Zelenskyy to open investigations of Biden and his son Hunter as well as a cybersecurity firm Trump falsely linked to Ukraine. That call — and the hold placed by the White House on $400 million in military aid — led to Trump's first impeachment. Zelenskyy plans to meet with Biden and Harris in Washington. Earlier this week, in an interview with The New Yorker, Zelenskyy implied Trump does not understand and oversimplifies the conflict, and said his running mate JD Vance is 'too radical' and essentially advocates for Ukraine to 'make a sacrifice' by 'giving up its territories.' On Monday, Trump's son Donald Jr. criticized Zelenskyy on X, reminding his followers that the suspect in his father's second assassination attempt had lambasted Trump's approach to foreign policy, including the war in Ukraine. 'So a foreign leader who has received billions of dollars in funding from American taxpayers, comes to our country and has the nerve to attack the GOP ticket for President?' he posted. ___ Associated Press writer Michelle L.

Biden in farewell U.N. address says peace still possible in confl...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Joe Biden declared in his final address to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that the U.S. must not retreat from the world, as Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon edged toward all-out war and Israel’s bloody operation against Hamas in Gaza neared the one-year mark. Biden used his wide-ranging address to speak to a need to end the Middle East conflict and the 17-month-old civil war in Sudan and to highlight U.S. and Western allies' support for Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. He also raised concern over artificial intelligence and its potential to be used for repression. His appearance before the international body offered Biden one of his last high-profile opportunities as president to make the case to keep up robust support for Ukraine, which could be in doubt if former President Donald Trump defeats Vice President Kamala Harris in November. Biden insisted that despite global conflicts, he remains hopeful for the future. 'I’ve seen a remarkable sweep of history,' Biden said. 'I know many look at the world today and see difficulties and react with despair but I do not.' 'We are stronger than we think' when the world acts together, he added. Biden came to office promising to rejuvenate U.S. relations around the world and to extract the U.S. from 'forever wars' in Afghanistan and Iraq that consumed American foreign policy over the last 20 years. 'I was determined to end it, and I did,' Biden said of the Afghanistan exit, calling it a 'hard decision but the right decision.' He acknowledged that it was 'accompanied by tragedy' with the deaths of 13 American troops and hundreds of Afghans in a suicide bombing during the chaotic withdrawal. But his foreign policy legacy may ultimately be shaped by his administration's response to two of the biggest conflicts in Europe and the Middle East since World War II. 'There will always be forces that pull our countries apart,' Biden said, rejecting 'a desire to retreat from the world and go it alone.' He said, 'Our task, our test, is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than the forces pulling us apart.' The Pentagon announced Monday that it was sending a small number of additional U.S. troops to the Middle East to supplement the roughly 40,000 already in the region. All the while, the White House insists Israel and Hezbollah still have time to step back and de-escalate. 'Full scale war is not in anyone’s interest,' Biden said, and despite escalating violence, a diplomatic solution is the only path to peace. Biden had a hopeful outlook for the Middle East when he addressed the U.N. just a year ago. In that speech, Biden spoke of a 'sustainable, integrated Middle East' coming into view. At the time, economic relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors were improving with implementation of the Abraham Accords that Israel signed with Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates during the Trump administration. Biden's team helped resolve a long-running Israel-Lebanon maritime dispute that had held back gas exploration in the region. And Israel-Saudi normalization talks were progressing, a game-changing alignment for the region if a deal could be landed. 'I suffer from an oxymoron: Irish optimism,' Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they met on the sidelines of last year's U.N. gathering. He added, 'If you and I, 10 years ago, were talking about normalization with Saudi Arabia ... I think we’d look at each other like, ‘Who’s been drinking what?’' Eighteen days later, Biden's Middle East hopes came crashing down. Hamas militants stormed into Israel killing 1,200, taking some 250 hostage, and spurring a bloody war that has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza and led the region into a complicated downward spiral. Now, the conflict is threatening to metastasize into a multi-front war and leave a lasting scar on Biden's presidential legacy. Israel and Hezbollah traded strikes again Tuesday as the death toll from a massive Israeli bombardment climbed to nearly 560 people and thousands fled from southern Lebanon. It's the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Israel has urged residents of southern Lebanon to evacuate from homes and other buildings where it claimed Hezbollah has stored weapons, saying the military would conduct 'extensive strikes' against the militant group. Hezbollah, meanwhile, has launched dozens of rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes last week that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters. Dozens were also killed last week and hundreds more wounded after hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah militants exploded, a sophisticated attack that was widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. Israel's leadership launched its counterattacks at a time of growing impatience with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah's persistent launching of missiles and drones across the Israel-Lebanon border after Hamas started the war with its brazen attack on Oct. 7. Biden reiterated his call on the parties to agree to a cease-fire and hostage release deal, saying it's time to 'end this war' — even as hopes for such a deal are fading as the conflict drags on. Biden, in his address, called for the sustainment of Western support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Biden helped galvanize an international coalition to back Ukraine with weapons and economic aid in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 assault on Ukraine. 'We cannot grow weary,' Biden said. 'We cannot look away.' Biden has managed to keep up American support in the face of rising skepticism from some Republican lawmakers — and Trump — about the cost of the conflict. At the same time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pressing Biden to loosen restrictions on the use of Western-supplied long-range missiles so that Ukrainian forces can hit deeper in Russia. So far Zelenskyy has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Putin has warned that Russia would be 'at war' with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. Biden and Harris are scheduled to hold separate meetings with Zelenskyy in Washington on Thursday. Ukrainian officials were also trying to arrange a meeting for Zelenskyy with Trump this week, though a Trump campaign official said it wasn't going to materialize. The president also sounded an alarm about the rapid advances in artificial intelligence development, particularly around disinformation, respect for human life and the potential exploitation by totalitarian powers. He told the world leaders, 'There may well be no greater test of our leadership than how we deal with A.I.' 'We must make certain that the awesome capabilities of A.I. will be used to uplift and empower everyday people, not to give dictators more powerful shackles on the human spirit,' he added. Later, he held a bilateral meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and joined other world leaders in an event highlighting their partnership to combat the production and distribution of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which drive tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S. annually alone. Biden struck a wistful tone in his remarks, peppering his speech with references to his first time attending the General Assembly more than 50 years ago, and quoting Irish poetry. Biden held up his decision to step aside up as an instructive moment as he addressed a gathering that has no small share of totalitarian and nondemocratic leaders. 'Some things are more important than staying in power,' Biden said. 'It’s your people that matter the most. Never forget, we are here to serve the people. Not the other way around.' ___ Miller reported from Washington.

Irish president accuses Israel of leaking his letter to Iran	President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins has accused the Israeli Embassy in Dublin of circulating a letter he wrote to Iran's newly appointed president, sparking a diplomatic row. The Israeli Embassy has strongly denied the allegation, calling it 'baseless' and 'highly inflammatory.' The controversy began last month when Higgins' letter to Masoud Pezeshkian, following his appointment as President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, became public. Speaking at the United Nations (UN) in New York on Sunday, Higgins suggested that Israeli officials were behind the letter's circulation. 'You should ask where the criticism came from and how the letter was circulated and by whom and for what purpose,' Higgins told journalists. When pressed further, he stated, 'I believe it was circulated from the Israeli Embassy' in Dublin. Higgins defended his letter, explaining that it was customary to congratulate a new head of state and that there had been interest in restarting nuclear talks with Iran. In the letter, Higgins told Pezeshkian that Iran had a 'crucial role' in peace in the Middle East following the death of his predecessor, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash in May. The letter, which appeared in the Jewish Chronicle, prompted criticism in both the UK and Ireland. It read in part, 'I regret of course the circumstances that brought about the election, and take the opportunity to repeat the condolences of the people of Ireland for the deaths of your predecessor President Raisi.' The Israeli Embassy in Dublin swiftly responded to Higgins' accusation, stating, 'This baseless accusation is highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous, and the embassy rejects it completely.' The embassy's statement added that it is the 'burden of the author to defend its content, which did not mention the threat Iran poses in the region.' Irish President Michael D. Higgins' leaked letter to President of the Islamic Republic of Iran (L) and the Iranian Embassy's post on the social media platform X. Screenshot: @DublinIran X The embassy also referenced the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, in which approximately 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage, with 101 still being held in Gaza. Simon Harris, the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) also present at the UN in New York, defended the Irish president. Harris stated that his primary concern was the loss of life in Gaza, asserting that Israel 'is continuing to allow a horrific humanitarian situation continue.' Harris further commented, 'I think the Israeli embassy should be focusing on things other than amplifying, circulating or referencing a letter that does really conform with normal diplomatic protocol between heads of state.' 'I have no interest whatsoever in getting into any sort of tit-for-tat or back-or-forth with the Israeli embassy or the government of a country that is continuing to allow this horrific humanitarian situation continue,' Harris added. However, screenshots proved that it was the Iranian Embassy itself who circulated the letter. Ireland is known for its critical stance towards Israel, yet among the widespread support the president received for his accusations against Israel, which were later proven false, one media report particularly stood out. One of the journalists covering the affair was Gavan Reilly, the political correspondent for Virgin Media News. In one of his reports on the incident, Reilly chose to say that 'the global Jewish lobby and organizations sympathetic to Israel' attacked the president for publishing a congratulatory letter to the incoming leader of the Islamic Republic. The use of conspiratorial terms like 'global Jewish lobby' caused great anger in the Jewish and Israeli community in Dublin. 'The report not only reeked of antisemitism and the oldest conspiracies in the world against Jews, it also showed us again that in Ireland of 2024, antisemitism is not only tolerated but welcomed with open arms on live broadcast,' said a source in the Irish Jewish community. 'We've reached a point where statements like 'global Jewish lobby' are made without any shame. It's often said that Ireland is the most critical country towards Israel and that this leads to antisemitism, but we're no longer sure if antisemitism is simply there and is what's leading Ireland to be the most critical country in Europe towards Israel.' Rabbi Yoni Wieder, chief rabbi of Ireland, expressed great disappointment with the conduct of the country's leaders and local media in the affair. 'The baseless accusations against the Israeli Embassy and the support from politicians and media figures in the country, who barely bothered to check the claim which is factually incorrect, reveal a disappointing and worrying trend. However, in light of what we've been experiencing and seeing here in recent months, unfortunately, it's no longer surprising.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/24/irish-president-accuses-israel-of-leaking-his-letter-to-iran/	2024-09-23T18:30:32-07:00	
Ukraine accuses Russia of seeking to illegally control strategic ...	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Ukraine on Monday accused Russia of seeking to illegally seize control of the strategically important Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait, as hearings opened in a high-stakes arbitration case between Kyiv and Moscow. The hearings at the Permanent Court of Arbitration are the latest in a string of international legal cases involving Russia and Ukraine linked to Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even as fighting continues to rage on battlefields in Ukraine. 'Russia wants to take the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait for itself, and so it has built a great gate at the entrance to keep international shipping out while allowing small Russian river vessels in,' Ukrainian representative Anton Korynevych told a panel of arbitrators. The gate he referred to is a bridge built by Russia across the Kerch Strait after the annexation of Crimea. The $3.5-billion, 19-kilometer (12-mile) bridge linking the Black and Azov seas carries road and rail traffic on separate sections and is vital to sustaining Russia’s military operations in southern Ukraine. 'The bridge is unlawful and it must come down,' Korynevych told the arbitration panel. Ukraine filed the case in 2016, two years after Russia annexed Crimea. It accuses Moscow of subsequently breaching a United Nations maritime treaty by building the bridge, barring Ukrainian fishermen from waters they traditionally fished, damaging the environment and plundering underwater archeological sites. Kyiv is seeking unspecified compensation. Russia insists the arbitration court does not have jurisdiction. It says that if its five judges decide they do have jurisdiction, the court should dismiss Ukraine's claims. 'Ukraine’s accusations in this case are, of course, completely groundless and hopeless,' Russian Agent Gennady Kuzmin told the panel. He argued that the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait constitute 'internal waters' that are not covered by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the treaty Ukraine alleges Russia is breaching. After Monday's two opening statements, the panel hearings will continue for days behind closed doors. A final ruling could take years. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine:	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraine-accuses-russia-of-seeking-to-illegally-control-strategic-sea-as-arbitration-hearings-open/	2024-09-23T02:51:13-07:00	
IDF assessment: Sinwar alive, using hostages as human shields	Security sources report that Yahya Sinwar – the top Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip – has been out of contact for some time, prompting an investigation into the cause of his silence. Current assessments indicate that Sinwar is alive and using hostages as human shields. However, authorities are exploring other scenarios, particularly given Israel's recent bombing campaign targeting tunnels in areas where Sinwar was believed to be hiding. Video: Yahyah Sinwar flees in the tunnel at the start of war / Credit: IDF At present, there is no evidence suggesting Sinwar is dead, apart from his prolonged silence. It's important to note that throughout the war, there have been substantial periods when Sinwar was incommunicado, either due to being on the move or deliberately choosing to cut off contact for strategic reasons.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/23/idf-intel-sinwar-alive-using-hostages-as-human-shields/	2024-09-22T20:00:06-07:00	
21 wounded in Russian strikes that hit apartment buildings in Ukr...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched new strikes in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv that hit high-rise apartment buildings, leaving at least 21 wounded in a second consecutive nighttime attack, authorities said. The bombs fell Saturday night on the district of Shevchenkivsky, north of the center of Kharkiv, which is the second-largest Ukrainian city, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Residential buildings sustained varying degrees of damage, including 16- and nine-story buildings, he added. Kharkiv's city council said that 18 buildings were damaged. The wounded included an 8-year-old child, according to Syniehubov and Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Terekhov said that 60 residents were evacuated from one of the buildings, a high-rise that was hit directly. Kharkiv has been a frequent target of Russian attacks since Moscow launched its all-out invasion of neighboring Ukraine in February 2022. On late Friday, 15 people, including children ages 10 and 12, were wounded when Russian airstrikes hit three Kharkiv neighborhoods, Terekhov said. Zelenskyy appeals for more weapons Ukrainian officials said that KAB-type aerial glide bombs — a retrofitted Soviet weapon that has for months laid waste to eastern Ukraine — were used in both attacks. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike and urged Kyiv’s Western allies to send more weapons to help it 'protect lives and ensure safety.' 'Ukraine needs full long-range capabilities, and we are working to convince our partners of this,' Zelenskyy said on X, as he prepared to kick off a busy week in the United States shoring up support for Kyiv in the war. And Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said Sunday that Kyiv was in talks with partners in Europe to secure Swedish-made Gripen and European Eurofighter Typhoon jets. Umerov said that commitments were already in place for deliveries of U.S.-made F-16s and French Mirages. Russia sends drones and missiles elsewhere in Ukraine Russia also launched 80 Shahed drones and two missiles at Ukraine overnight into Sunday, the Ukrainian air force said. Ukrainian defenses shot down 71 drones, and another six were lost on location because of electronic warfare countermeasures, the statement said. Farther south, a 12-year-old girl and a woman died after a Russian drone struck a passenger car in the city of Nikopol, local Gov. Serhii Lysak reported. Two others, including a 4-year-old child, suffered wounds. In the eastern Donetsk region, a Russian airstrike on Sunday morning struck homes in the city of Sloviansk, trapping a woman under rubble and wounding two of her neighbors, regional prosecutors reported. In the same province, two miners died and one other person was injured late Saturday after Russian forces shelled a mine west of the city of Pokrovsk, local Gov. Vadym Filashkin and Ukraine’s Energy Ministry reported. Pokrovsk and Sloviansk have both been key targets for Russian forces as they continue their grinding push westwards aimed at capturing the entirety of Ukraine’s industrial east. In southern Ukraine, a Russian drone strike on Sunday morning wounded two civilians in the city of Kherson, regional authorities said. Hours later, police reported that Russian attacks wounded at least four more people elsewhere in the province. Other Russian drone attacks Sunday damaged energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s central Poltava region and the northern city of Shostka, officials reported. Shostka lies in the Sumy region, across the border from Russia's Kursk province — the target of a startling Ukrainian military incursion launched last month. Weeks into the incursion, Zelenskyy said that the aim is to create a buffer zone to prevent further Russian cross-border strikes that have for months wreaked havoc in Sumy. Around 10,000 residents have left the nearby town of Hlukhiv because of intensified Russian shelling, around a third of its prewar population, the local military administration said Sunday. That includes almost 70% of the town’s children, following the regional government’s calls to evacuate parts of the Sumy region nearest the Russian border. Hlukhiv lies less than 15 kilometers (9 miles) from Russian territory, and about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Shostka. Ukrainian troops strike at Russian targets Also on Sunday, a firefighter was killed and two others were injured by a Ukrainian drone in the Russia-occupied Luhansk province in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Emergencies Ministry said. In Russia proper, in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, Ukrainian shelling wounded at least 12 people including a village official and members of a volunteer self-defense force, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov. Several Russian regions, including Belgorod in the south, set up so-called territorial defense units to counter-sabotage activity after Russian troops moved into Ukraine in February 2022. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-over-20-people-wounded-after-russia-strikes-apartment-blocks-in-ukraines-kharkiv/	2024-09-22T18:03:22-07:00

During the mission to secure the humanitarian corridor for Gaza civilians, troops from the Tzabar Battalion of the Givati Brigade identified armed terrorists looting an aid truck. In a swift response, forces guided drones to locate the operatives who had fled in a vehicle. The terrorists were then eliminated by an Israeli Air Force aircraft, as well as an additional operative who had attempted to escape. בניסיון השתלטות על משאיות הומנטיריות: כך לוחמי גבעתי סגרו מעגל ברפיח לכל הפרטים: pic.twitter.com/R9luSS3CAM — צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) September 21, 2024 In recent weeks, Givati Brigade forces have been operating in the Rafah area, having eliminated dozens of Hamas terrorists, uncovered numerous weapons caches, and destroyed terror cells and tunnel networks used to attack Israeli civilians. The IAF conducted precision strikes on about 20 terror targets across the strip in the past day. Targets included terror cells, military structures, and groups of terrorists planning attacks against Israel. In the afternoon, a surgical strike was carried out on a Hamas command and control center established in a former school building in Gaza City.

Israeli FM's gaffe about Jesus sparks online fury	Hundreds took to social media platform X after the Israeli Foreign Ministry made a factual error about Jesus' birthplace in a post on their account titled 'Israel,' and then corrected it. Nazareth, the hometown of Jesus, is under attack by Hezbollah. The Israeli town, also known as 'the Arab capital of Israel,' has a population that is around 70% Muslim and 30% Christian. pic.twitter.com/OiJSuOq6BO — Israel ישראל (@Israel) September 22, 2024 Early Sunday, Israeli northern cities suffered a major attack by the Lebanese terror organization Hezbollah, with over 100 rockets being launched. One affected city was Nazareth – known for its large Arab population and significant Christian minority (about 30% of its residents) – where rocket debris caused a fire. Lmfao you guys are something else. pic.twitter.com/L2e85G5lye — Assaf, MD (@_Assaf_MD) September 22, 2024 The account reported the attack, initially saying 'Nazareth, the birthplace of Jesus, is under attack by Hezbollah.' The post was also accompanied by a photo showing a fire in Nazareth, which was later clarified to be from a previous incident, not the current attack. Users quickly responded with comments criticizing the account's admin for its lack of knowledge, as well as referring to it as a 'propaganda fail.' 'The idiots running this official account don't even know the birthplace of Jesus is Bethlehem,' one comment said. 'Another day another propaganda fail,' another user added. The ongoing online battle between anti-Israel users and pro-Israel users is nothing new, yet some comments even targeted Jews, saying: 'Why are you flexing Jesus? Didn't your people kill him?' Video: Interceptions over Nazareth The Foreign Ministry swiftly corrected the post, mentioning Nazareth as Jesus' hometown, but not quickly enough to avert the current social media buzz.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/22/israeli-fms-gaffe-about-jesus-sparks-online-fury/	2024-09-21T18:00:30-07:00	
Residents in Kyiv told to stay indoors as air pollution blankets ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Authorities in Ukraine advised residents in the capital Kyiv to stay indoors Friday as air pollution, partly caused by fires in the region, blanketed the city. Ukraine’s Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources said the pollution was a result of the burning of peatlands and other wildfires in the region combined with autumn temperature fluctuations. The capital woke up to thick smog with the rancid smell of blazing fires in the air. Some people were spotted wearing masks. The Ukrainian capital topped a list of the most polluted major cities early Friday in a real-time database by IQAir, a Swiss company that monitors air quality levels. Its air quality appeared to have improved somewhat since as the city came down in the ranking later in the day. Kyiv’s Department of Environmental Protection and Climate Change said that 'the likely cause of this is fires in the Kyiv region.' Fires have been reported in the Vyshhorod district, around 20 kilometers (around 12 miles) north of the capital. Officials warned about an increased concentration of suspended particles, such as dust, soot, and smoke, in the air. In some areas of the city, air pollution levels have reached the maximum of the 100-point scale. While human-driven climate change does not directly cause fires, it can increase the risk of wildfire as warming temperatures and increasingly dry air, trees and soil can make it easier for fires to spread. Forest fires around the world have worsened in recent years, with almost twice as much tree cover burning in 2023 than 20 years ago, according to the World Resources Institute. Wildfire smoke can cause air quality to deteriorate even many miles away from fires. The main concern from the wildfire smoke is fine particle pollution, known as PM2.5. Fine particle pollution can cause short-term problems like coughing, as well as long-term impacts on the lungs and heart. Pollution is a major health concern — with one major study estimating that pollution kills around 9 million people globally a year. Residents in Kyiv were advised to close their windows, limit time spent outdoors, drink plenty of water, and use an air purifier. 'Particular attention should be paid to these recommendations by people with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,' said a statement from the Ecology Ministry. Autumn temperature variations trap harmful substances in the air, worsening pollution and reducing air quality, the ministry added.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-residents-in-kyiv-told-to-stay-indoors-as-air-pollution-blankets-the-ukrainian-capital/	2024-09-20T06:39:27-07:00	
Harris hopes to turn Ukraine war into winning issue in battle wit...	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Democrats are stepping up their outreach to Polish Americans in this year's presidential election as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump vie for support from a community that could play a decisive role in razor-thin battleground state contests. Harris hopes to capitalize on Polish Americans' historic animosity toward Russia and on Trump's hesitancy to back Ukraine during last week's debate. The Democratic vice president's team organized a national call with Polish American supporters on Wednesday to encourage local networks to hold their own events and spread the campaign's message. Although Polish Americans are not a particularly large demographic, many of them live in the so-called 'blue wall' states that are critical to victory for either candidate. There are an estimated 784,000 in Michigan, 758,000 in Pennsylvania and 481,000 in Wisconsin, three places that Harris is visiting this week. 'We’re talking about an election where a swing of a few thousand voters in any of those states could make all the difference,' said Tom Malinowski, a Polish-born former Democratic congressman from New Jersey. Filip Jotevski, the newly hired point person for networking with diaspora and ethnic communities, said on Wednesday's Harris organizing call that if Trump returns to power 'he'll sell out Ukraine' after spending years 'cozying up to Vladimir Putin.' Trump was originally scheduled to stop by a Polish American shrine in Pennsylvania on Sunday for the unveiling of a monument to the anticommunist Solidarity movement. However, the visit was cancelled, according to a person familiar with the Republican candidates' plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Trump had been expected to be there at the same time as Polish President Andrzej Duda. The Polish American community was pushed into the spotlight during the Sept. 10 debate in Philadelphia, when Trump twice refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war against Russia. 'Negotiate a deal,' Trump said. 'Because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.' Harris fired back that if Trump had been president when the invasion took place, 'Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe.' 'Why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up,' she said. Some were surprised yet pleased to hear their community mentioned on the debate stage. 'She knew what she was talking about,' said Tony Pol, a 67-year-old retired fire chief in Erie, Pennsylvania, who spent a quarter century helping run a Polish American fraternal organization. 'I think that’s the concern of everybody — if Ukraine goes down, then Poland goes next, and that’s very concerning.' Gosia Dodi, originally from Poland and now an American citizen living in western Michigan, said she 'absolutely agrees' with Harris that Russia could target Poland if Ukraine loses. The 61-year-old described Trump's affection for Putin as 'dangerous for Poland.' 'I want the war over, but not the way he’s saying,' she said. 'He thinks he can fix everything within one day or something, which is ridiculous.' After Poland was devastated in World War II, the country spent decades as a satellite state of the Soviet Union. A revolution ended communist rule in 1989, paving the way for the country's modern multiparty democracy. Poland became a NATO member in 1999. Timothy L. Kuzma, a Pittsburgh resident who leads the Polish Falcons of America, a fraternal organization with 19th-century roots in Chicago’s large Polish immigrant community, said his community's voters want to see a candidate that's committed to strong transatlantic bonds. 'If either candidate doesn’t give those kinds of assurances, that’s problematic,' he said. 'The candidates, both parties, have to pledge their support to Poland, to Ukraine, to NATO and to the overall security of Eastern Europe — and that’s all of Eastern Europe — and Europe as well.' Trump has previously suggested withdrawing the United States from NATO, which would devastate the alliance, and he’s demanded that allies increase their defense spending to reduce the burden on Washington. If they didn't, Trump warned, the U.S. would not uphold its treaty obligations and 'would encourage them' — meaning Russia — 'to do whatever the hell they want.' Pete Alibali, 53, immigrated from Soviet-controlled Poland when he was 16, because his mother, a chemist, wanted to advance her career without becoming a communist party member. A lifelong Democrat who now lives in Madison, Wisconsin, Alibali views Putin as a 'predator and a continuation of the Soviets.' Beyond his concern for his native Poland, he worries that tiny Baltic nations could also be threatened if Ukraine is defeated. Alibali acknowledged that many Polish Americans are conservative, growing up reading Polish newspapers, working in Polish-owned businesses, listening to Polish radio and attending their neighborhood Catholic church. He described his uncle, who lives in Chicago, as a 'very rabid Trump supporter.' 'Trump divided my family,' Alibali said. Polish American voters have swung back and forth between Democrats and Republicans in presidential elections over the years. They supported Trump in 2016 but backed President Joe Biden in 2020. Malinowski said Trump's visit to the shrine 'shows that he’s nervous that he might be losing ground among a group of voters that he may have taken for granted.' He also downplayed any suggestion of friendship between Trump and Duda, a right-wing politician who once suggested renaming a military base in his country as Fort Trump. 'I know the Poles are nervous,' he said. 'The advice they’re getting is, cultivate Trump just in case. They’re doing it with fingers crossed.' Tom Kolano, a 55-year-old Republican in suburban Pittsburgh whose ancestors were Polish immigrants, said he's encouraged by Trump's relationship with Duda. 'I’m not worried that President Trump will abandon Ukraine,' Kolano said. 'Here’s one big reason — I think Poland will have a lot to say about that.' He pointed out that Duda and his political rival, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, used a visit to Washington in March to press a divided Congress to break its impasse over replenishing funds for Ukraine at a critical moment in the war. John Laka, 66, of Appleton, Wisconsin, believes that Trump will be stronger overall on foreign policy than Harris. 'I just don’t have a lot of confidence in her as a leader or president,' he said. 'She’s just really lacking.' Laka's parents immigrated to the United States from Poland, and he's not sure how much the country is really imperiled by Russia. 'The threat of Putin going further is always going to be there unless there’s that idea of deterrence and right now we’re not deterring going anywhere,' he said. ___ Megerian reported from Washington.

8 injured after antitank missiles hit northern border; 2 in serio...	Anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) struck the Ramim ridge in northern Israel early Thursday morning, causing casualties and prompting swift retaliation from Israeli forces. The attack, which occurred around 8:05 AM local time, saw two ATGMs hit the Upper Galilee region, marking a dangerous new phase in the ongoing border conflict. Eight injured were reported, including two who were treated for severe wounded. Video: An attack on a chicken coop in northern Israel, Sept. 19, 2024 The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) immediately responded with artillery fire into Lebanon, signaling a rapid intensification of cross-border exchanges. Additional ATGM impacts in Tel Hai were also reported. The recent attack from Lebanon comes as Israel anticipates Hezbollah's response to the mysterious explosions all across Lebanon that involved detonations of pagers held by its members, with many speculating this was an Israeli covert operation. Dozens of terrorists were killed and thousands injured In the hours following the missile attacks, the IDF launched a series of retaliatory strikes. An IDF spokesperson announced that overnight air operations targeted Hezbollah military structures in several areas of southern Lebanon, including Shiheen, Al-Taybeh, Blida, Mays al-Jabal, Aytaroun, and Kfar Kila. The air force also struck an arms depot used by Hezbollah in the Al-Khiam area. The escalation wasn't limited to the northern border. Israeli naval vessels reportedly shelled the coast of Gaza City, while Palestinian sources reported two airstrikes in Gaza's Zeitoun neighborhood, accompanied by artillery barrages.

A senior U.S. official, speaking to the Wall Street Journal, said they were worried the situation could be 'spiraling out of control.' However, other sources emphasized that Israel has not yet taken actions indicative of an imminent ground incursion into Lebanon, such as mobilizing reservists to the area. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin discussed the evolving crisis in both Lebanon and Gaza with his Israeli counterpart. According to a Pentagon spokesperson, Austin's stance prioritizes achieving a deal for the release of hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza, as well as pursuing a diplomatic solution for the Lebanese border conflict. פגיעת הנ'ט בלול במרגליות pic.twitter.com/EtpRB8CA6Z — ישראל היום (@IsraelHayomHeb) September 19, 2024 As tensions continue to rise, local authorities in the Golan Heights have decided to proceed with regular school activities, following a security assessment with regional military commands.

Ukrainian drones strike a large military depot in a Russian town ...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia overnight, causing a huge blaze and prompting the evacuation of some local residents, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s recently announced — but still confidential — plan for winning the war 'can work' and help end the conflict that is now in its third year. Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed Russian military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 6 kilometers (4 miles) wide. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a 'massive drone attack' on Toropets, which has a population of around 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuation of some local residents. There was no immediate information about whether the strikes had caused any casualties. Successful Ukrainian strikes on targets deep inside Russia have become more common as the war has progressed and Kyiv developed its drone technology. Zelenskyy is also seeking the approval from Western nations for Ukraine to use the sophisticated weapons they are providing to hit targets inside Russia. Some Western leaders have balked at that possibility, fearing they could be dragged into the conflict. Ukraine’s targeting of Russian military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia, as well as making Russian civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine, is part of Kyiv's strategy. The swift push by Ukrainian forces into Russia’s Kursk border region last month fits into that plan, which apparently seeks to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down. Putin, however, has shown no signs of backing down, and has been trying to grind down Ukraine's resolve through attritional warfare and also sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. That has come at a price, however, as the U.K. Defense Ministry estimates that the war has likely killed and wounded more than 600,000 Russian troops. On Tuesday, Putin ordered the country’s military to increase its number of troops by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million by Dec. 1. Zelenskyy last month said his plan to victory includes not only battlefield goals but also diplomatic and economic wins. The plan has been kept under wraps but the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said during a news conference Tuesday that Washington officials have seen it. 'We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,' she said, adding that the United States will bring it up with other world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. She did not comment on what the plan contains. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukrainian-drones-strike-a-large-military-depot-in-a-russian-town-northwest-of-moscow/	2024-09-18T03:10:21-07:00	
UN backs Palestinian arms embargo call against Israel	On Wednesday, the United Nations General Assembly approved a Palestinian resolution urging sanctions and an arms embargo against Israel. The proposal also included a demand from the Palestinian Authority for Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza within a year. The resolution passed with 124 countries in favor, 14 against, and 43 abstentions. It's important to note that General Assembly resolutions are non-binding and will not directly lead to actions or sanctions against Israel. Israel's Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, condemned the vote, saying, 'This is a shameful decision that backs the Palestinian Authority's diplomatic terrorism. Instead of marking the anniversary of the October 7 massacre by condemning Hamas and calling for the release of all 101 of the remaining hostages, the General Assembly continues to dance to the music of the Palestinian Authority, which backs the Hamas murderers.'

Among those abstaining were Germany, Britain, Italy, Australia, Canada, Ethiopia, Albania, and Bulgaria. Notably, Britain abstained despite its new Labor government, and Australia abstained despite its government's critical stance towards Israel. Other abstaining countries included Ukraine, Serbia, Slovakia, South Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Nepal, the Netherlands, Korea, Romania, Lithuania, Georgia, Guatemala, Haiti, and Kenya. As reported by Israel Hayom, the Palestinian delegation to the UN submitted a draft resolution earlier this month for voting in the General Assembly. The resolution calls for implementing the International Court of Justice's decision and includes a six-month timeline for withdrawal from 'Palestinian territories,' a call for an arms embargo on 'settlements,' and sanctions against Israeli officials.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/18/un-backs-palestinian-arms-embargo-call-against-israel/	2024-09-18T00:00:51-07:00	
First female KIA in Iron Swords War	In a somber development, Sgt. Agam Naim, a 20-year-old paramedic from Kibbutz Mishmarot, became the first female soldier to fall in combat in Gaza during Israel's ongoing Swords of Iron War. Naim, a paramedic in the 52nd Battalion of the Iron Tracks Brigade (401), died in a building explosion in Gaza alongside three IDF soldiers. She is survived by her parents and two sisters. Staff Sgt. Dotan Shimon (21) from Elazar, Staff Sgt. Agam Naim (20) from Mishmarot, Staff Sgt. Amit Bakri (21) from Yoshivia, and Cpt. Daniel Mimon Toaff (23) from Moreshet were killed in action in Gaza yesterday. ▸Sgt. Bakari is the first female soldier to be killed… pic.twitter.com/hKrMMWzjR5 — Jewish News Syndicate (@JNS_org) September 18, 2024 Dorit, Agam's mother, recently shared her concerns about her daughter's service: 'Agam was summoned for the paramedics course. We were overjoyed – maybe she'd become a doctor someday. Isn't that worth it? She graduated with honors and was assigned to the Armored Corps. Two days after finishing the course, she was already in Gaza with the Engineering Corps. We stopped breathing, stopped sleeping. Life changed; I suddenly experienced panic attacks that came without warning.' Dorit continued, 'At home, it was manageable, but one day it happened at the kindergarten. Agam called to say she was going in. I wasn't prepared; she wasn't supposed to deploy for a few more days. It was a sharp pain, like a knife twisting in my heart, stomach, throughout my entire body.' 'We choose to live in hope. May all our soldiers return safely, may the hostages come back soon – but very soon, may my own child return home, healthy in body and spirit. May the war end, and we return to normalcy. Amen. My Agami, I'm proud of you, child. I'm waiting for you, my love,' Dorit concluded. Yarin, Agam's sister, wrote in her eulogy: 'My Agami, the most beautiful girl in kindergarten – the purest, smartest, most cheerful, most sociable, bravest, most excellent. The simplest of all. Before I left, we talked, and you promised to take care of yourself. But each time, you reminded us that if not you, there would be no one to do your job. No one to protect the soldiers and treat them. My hero, a true hero.' Yarin added, 'You were the little sister in the family but always acted as if you were a decade ahead of everyone. We always laughed about how they mixed up our ages, and you were actually older than me. You had such an aura that everyone in the room would smile when you entered. Your smile was contagious. You were 20, and in three days, you were supposed to turn 21. And you'll always remain 20.' Mariel, Agam Naim's aunt, recounted with anguish: 'Agam was a paramedic, assigned to an armored battalion after finishing her course. She graduated with honors, so they placed her at the forefront. For the past six months, she was in Gaza, sometimes with the Engineering Corps, sometimes with the Givati Brigade. The parents worried, of course – how could they not? Her father is a bereaved brother, so he worried twice as much. There were many concerns. She's a daughter, she's a child, she didn't have to go, but she really wanted to enter Gaza. She's the youngest – the youngest of three.' 'She was the most beautiful, the happiest, the most talented. She volunteered with Magen David Adom, did a year of service, and worked with post-hospitalization youth. They took the most exceptional one,' Mariel continued. 'The truth is, she wasn't supposed to return to Gaza. She was accepted to instruct in the paramedics course and was set to begin. Last weekend, she was home sick. The commander told her she didn't have to return and could stay home before starting her instruction role. She said she didn't want to leave without saying goodbye to her comrades. So she went in for just three more days. She entered on Monday.' IDF forces in Gaza (Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit) IDF Spokesperson's Unit The Paramedics Organization also paid tribute: 'The Paramedics Organization mourns the fall in battle of Agam Naim, 20, from Mishmarot, a combat paramedic in the 52nd Battalion of the Armored Corps. Agam, one of the pioneers serving as a paramedic in a combat role, stood at the front lines of the battles in the Gaza Strip in a position requiring a unique combination of courage, dedication, and boundless professionalism. Agam was there to fight for the lives of her unit comrades, carrying an enormous responsibility to treat and save lives in the most challenging field conditions. Even today, almost a year into the war, we must remember that it is only thanks to our finest daughters and sons, fighters like Agam, who gave their lives, that the citizens of Israel sit safely in their land. May her soul be bound in the bond of life. May her memory be a blessing.' Mali Kaplan, principal of the Mevo'ot Iron educational institution where Agam studied, eulogized her: 'Agam, a graduate of Mevo'ot Iron, excelled in every field she touched. She was an outstanding student, studied biology and computer science, and even completed a final project in social sciences. Agam was active in the boarding school and youth society of Mevo'ot Iron and was also a member and counselor in the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement.' Kaplan added, 'Upon completing her studies, Agam received a social excellence certificate for her role as a counselor in Hashomer Hatzair. After graduation, Agam chose to do a year of service at 'Pnimiyat Adanim' in Beit Kama, working with youth discharged from hospitals. She aspired to be a paramedic and served in the 52nd Battalion, Iron Tracks Brigade, out of a desire to contribute as much as possible to society. Agam was always surrounded by friends, patient with everyone, and kind-hearted. We are in pain and mourning. This is a tremendous loss for the staff, students, and alumni of Mevo'ot Iron. We embrace and share in the sorrow of her parents, Dorit and Dudi, her sisters, and the entire family.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/18/israel-mourns-first-female-soldier-killed-in-gaza/	2024-09-17T23:00:25-07:00	
Gaza pride parade can get you $1 million	Are you interested in earning $1 million? A watchdog organization has announced a provocative $1 million offer to any US LGBTQ advocacy group willing to host a gay pride parade in Gaza or the West Bank, Fox News reported. The New Tolerance Campaign (NTC) says the initiative is designed to be a 'wake-up call' to groups like 'Queers for Palestine' that have emerged since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Gregory T. Angelo, president of NTC and former president of Log Cabin Republicans, told Fox News Digital, 'I don't want people to just shrug off this campaign as some kind of publicity stunt or something that is supposed to be comical. It actually is a legitimate offer.' The campaign aims to highlight the stark contrast in LGBTQ rights between Israel and Palestinian territories, where homosexuality remains deeply taboo and LGBTQ individuals often face severe persecution. 'This campaign emerged to call out these purported advocates of LGBT equality and put our money where their mouths are,' Angelo continued. He added that the offer could either expose the challenging conditions for LGBTQ people in Palestinian territories or potentially serve as a 'breakthrough moment for pluralism and peace in the Middle East.' NTC plans to promote the campaign using mobile billboards near Columbia University, the Human Rights Campaign headquarters in Washington, DC, and UCLA. The organization has also set up a system for Americans to directly message leaders of prominent LGBTQ rights groups, encouraging them to advocate for LGBTQ rights in Palestinian territories and Arab countries. Students meet ahead of a midnight deadline set by Columbia President for student protesters to disband the protest encampment at Columbia University in New York City, U.S., April 23, 2024. Photo credit: REUTERS/Caitlin REUTERS Angelo criticized what he sees as a tendency on the left to equate all forms of oppression, telling Fox News, 'On the left in the United States, all oppression is the same oppression. And I think the left, quite to their disservice, lumps everything from racial discrimination to sexual orientation discrimination to gender discrimination to Islamophobia, all under the same umbrella. That's certainly not the case.' He contrasted the legal protections and social acceptance for LGBTQ individuals in the US with the situation in Palestinian territories, where same-sex marriage is not recognized and there are no employment protections based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The campaign comes against a backdrop of ongoing tension in the region. In 2019, Palestinian Authority police banned a gay and transgender rights group from holding events in the West Bank and threatened to arrest participants. Meanwhile, Israel has actively promoted its tolerance of LGBTQ issues, with Tel Aviv known as a popular destination for gay and lesbian travelers, especially during the time of the annual parade. The New Tolerance Campaign describes itself as a 'watchdog organization mobilizing Americans to confront intolerance double-standards by establishment institutions, civil rights groups, universities, and socially-conscious brands.' Its website states that 'NTC action campaigns empower ordinary Americans to hold accountable self-proclaimed arbiters of tolerance when they betray their own stated values.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/18/gaza-pride-parade-can-get-you-1-million/	2024-09-17T20:00:26-07:00

Iran envoy to Lebanon loses eye, severely injured	Iranian state media reported Tuesday that Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was injured in the Hezbollah communication devices explosions. The incident has brought renewed attention to the close ties between Iran and the Lebanon-based terror group, with implications for regional security and diplomacy. div]:bg-bg-300 [&_pre]:-mr-4 md:[&_pre]:-mr-9'> _*]:min-w-0'> Additionally, sources in the Revolutionary Guards told The New York Times that Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amini, lost one eye and was severely injured in his second eye during the explosions in Beirut yesterday. The Guards members also said that his injuries were more severe than Iran initially reported and that he will be transferred for medical treatment in Tehran. Video: Iran's ambassador being evacuated after injury According to the Iranian news agency Fars, Ambassador Amani suffered superficial injuries and was evacuated to the hospital. His wife reportedly stated that he was lightly injured. The Al-Mayadeen channel, which is close to Hezbollah, reported that Amani 'was not carrying a pager,' but was injured by the explosion of a device carried by one of his escorts. Video: The scene of one of the explosions in Lebanon The reports did not specify whether the explosion involved a device Amani was carrying himself. If so, it would serve as evidence of Iran's deep involvement in Hezbollah's activities. Amani is considered one of the most important liaisons between the Tehran government and the organization in Lebanon. Previously, it was estimated that Hezbollah hosted meetings at the Iranian embassy. Concurrently, reports emerged of Hezbollah operatives being injured in Syria due to similar explosions. An official source stated that in total, at least 1,000 members were wounded in various areas across Lebanon.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/17/iran-envoy-to-lebanon-wounded-in-hezbollah-blasts/	2024-09-17T07:39:13-07:00	
Israel expands war goals	In an overnight session spanning Monday to Tuesday, the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet amended its war goals to incorporate a crucial new objective: facilitating the secure return of northern residents to their homes. The move could further fuel speculation that Israel may be heading toward an escalation in the north, as it comes just hours after it was reported that a major reshuffle could be underway that would include replacing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who has had odds with Netanyahu over the conduct of the war.

Israel will continue to act to implement this objective,' the Prime Minister's Office said on X. This strategic pivot, spearheaded by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, emerges not only in response to growing public concern but also due to mounting political pressure. Key figures driving this change include Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and former war cabinet minister Benny Gantz.

It signals Israel's intent to more comprehensively address the Hezbollah threat after 11 months of conflict. Previously, Netanyahu had prioritized diplomatic and military efforts in the Gaza Strip, relegating the northern front to secondary status, largely due to the substantial military resources and ammunition required.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/17/israel-expands-war-objectives-to-include-northern-residents-return/	2024-09-16T22:06:19-07:00	
Instagram introduces 'Teen Accounts' with enhanced privacy featur...	Instagram is set to launch a new initiative aimed at bolstering privacy and safety measures for its teenage users. The social media platform, owned by Meta, will begin automatically placing teens into 'teen accounts' with built-in restrictions and enhanced parental controls. Naomi Gleit, head of product at Meta, explained the rationale behind the move: 'Everyone under 18, creators included, will be put into teen accounts,' she told NBC News. 'They can remain public if their parent is involved and gives them permission and is supervising the account. But these are pretty big changes that we need to get right.' The new accounts will limit messaging, tagging, and mentions to only those individuals the teen already follows. This represents Meta's most significant effort to date in managing how minors interact with the platform. The initiative comes in the wake of recent controversies surrounding child safety on social media platforms. In January, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg issued an apology to parents during a Senate hearing on online child safety, where some testified that Instagram had contributed to their children's suicides or exploitation. While Meta has previously introduced various opt-in restrictions for teen users, including parental supervision controls, their application has been inconsistent. Gleit acknowledged the feedback received from parents, citing simplicity, consistency, and increased control as key areas of focus for this launch. The rollout of teen accounts will be gradual. New users under 18 will be automatically placed into these accounts upon sign-up, but existing teen users may not see immediate changes. According to Meta, many users worldwide won't be transitioned to teen accounts until next year. Parental supervision feature in Instagram's 'Teen Accounts.' Screenshot: fb.com fb.com Teen accounts will also feature the most restrictive content settings, limiting potentially sensitive material from unfollowed accounts. The Hidden Words feature will be activated by default, automatically filtering offensive words or phrases from comments and direct messages. Users under 16 will require parental or guardian permission to modify their teen account settings, while those over 16 can adjust settings independently unless their accounts are linked to parental supervision. Anticipating attempts to circumvent these measures, Meta plans to implement various age verification methods. These include requesting government IDs or video selfies when users attempt to create new accounts on the same device. The company is also developing AI technology to predict whether users claiming to be adults might actually be teens, based on behavioral signals such as account creation date, content interactions, and writing style. Gleit declined to provide detailed information about this technology, citing concerns that teens might learn to bypass detection tools. The age prediction tools are scheduled for testing in the US early next year. For parents utilizing supervision controls, new features will allow them to view their teens' messaging contacts – without reading the actual conversations – and see topics of interest selected by their teens for the Explore page. Additional features include a 'Sleep Mode' replacing the existing Quiet Mode and Night Nudges, which will silence notifications from 10 pm to 7 am. Teen accounts will also receive 'Daily Limit' prompts encouraging app closure after 60 minutes of use. To prevent misuse of parental controls, Meta will implement restrictions on teen account supervision and limit the number of teen accounts one person can oversee. Gleit emphasized the company's approach: 'We think parents know their teens best, and so I don't think that all of those controls are necessarily right for everyone, but we want to give parents the options to choose what's right for their child.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/17/instagram-introduces-teen-accounts-with-enhanced-privacy-features/	2024-09-16T20:30:44-07:00	
Ukraine says it hit Russian base in Syria	Ukraine's Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR) special forces conducted an operation against a Russian military base in Syria on Sunday according to a source in Ukrainian military intelligence who spoke to the Kyiv Post. The attack targeted a facility on the southeastern outskirts of Aleppo, where Russian forces were reportedly manufacturing and testing strike UAVs. The Kyiv Post obtained exclusive footage of the operation, which shows a HUR flag visible behind a berm near a garage used as a Russian base. The video, filmed by an intelligence officer, captures an explosion at the Russian facility followed by the detonation of ammunition. Military and explosive experts who examined the footage for the Kyiv Post suggested that the explosion was likely triggered by a rifle shot rather than an RPG, possibly striking pre-planted explosives inside the facility. The targeted base was allegedly used by Russian forces to produce 'camouflaged improvised explosive devices' and store their warheads, according to HUR. This operation is part of a series of strikes carried out by Ukrainian special forces against Russian military targets in Syria. In June, the Ukrainian special forces attacked enemy positions in Syria's Golan Heights. Russia's involvement in Syria dates back to 2015 when it intervened to support President Bashar al-Assad's regime during the civil war. This intervention led to the permanent deployment of thousands of Russian troops in the country. However, in the fall of last year, Moscow reportedly transferred some of these forces to Ukraine, potentially weakening their presence in Syria. The prolonged Russian presence in Syria has resulted in the establishment of recruitment centers for Syrian mercenaries to fight in Ukraine. Lt Gen Kyrylo Budanov, chief of HUR, stated in May 2023 that they would 'destroy Russian war criminals anywhere in the world they may be.' This commitment extends beyond Syria, with Ukrainian HUR special forces reportedly targeting pro-Kremlin Wagner mercenaries in Sudan and other parts of Africa.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/17/ukraine-says-it-hit-russian-base-in-syria/	2024-09-16T20:30:25-07:00	
Is Iran about to end hijab rules?	Iran's newly appointed president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has indicated that the country's morality police will no longer 'bother' women over the mandatory hijab headscarf, according to a report by the BBC. The statement comes just days after the United Nations cautioned that women in Iran were still facing violent punishment for violating the strict dress code. Pezeshkian's comments, made during his first press conference since taking office in July, coincided with the second anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death in police custody. Amini, 22, was arrested for allegedly not wearing the hijab properly, an incident that sparked nationwide protests in 2022. Responding to a female reporter who mentioned taking detours to avoid police vans on her way to the press conference, Pezeshkian stated, 'The morality police were not supposed to confront [women]. I will follow up so they don't bother [them].' The exchange, broadcast live on major state TV networks including rolling news channel IRINN, has since gone viral online. The president's remarks suggest a potential shift in the enforcement of Iran's mandatory hijab law. During his election campaign, Pezeshkian pledged to oppose police patrols enforcing the headscarf requirement and vowed to ease some of the country's long-standing internet controls. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian (Majid Saeedi/Getty Images) Getty Images However, the UN's latest fact-finding mission paints a different picture. In a report released last week, the UN stated that Iran's government had 'intensified efforts' to suppress women's rights and crush activism since the 2022 protests. The report noted that authorities have 'enhanced surveillance of hijab compliance' in both public and private environments while escalating violence in punishing women and girls who break the rules. The UN mission also highlighted that a 'Hijab and Chastity' bill is in the final stages of approval before Iran's Guardian Council. If passed, the legislation would introduce harsher penalties for women who do not wear the mandatory hijab, including substantial fines, longer prison sentences, restrictions on work and educational opportunities, and travel bans. Despite these concerns, there were signs of a potentially more relaxed attitude at Pezeshkian's press conference, where some female journalists wore loose head coverings. This marked a departure from previous official events where full hijab was typically required for female journalists, the BBC reported. Pezeshkian, who became president after his predecessor died in a helicopter crash, is viewed as a potentially reformist leader. His comments on the morality police and hijab enforcement have sparked discussions about possible changes in Iran's approach to women's rights and personal freedoms. As Iran grapples with these internal issues, the international community continues to monitor the situation closely. The contrast between Pezeshkian's statements and the UN's findings highlights the complex and evolving nature of Iran's social and political landscape.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/17/iran-signals-shift-on-hijab-enforcement/	2024-09-16T18:30:16-07:00	
Wikipedia entry on Zionism defines it as 'colonialism', sparking ...	A heated debate has erupted on social media over recent changes made to the Wikipedia entry for Zionism, sparking accusations of historical revisionism. Users on social media have over the past several 24 hours, posted a comparison between the 2023 and 2024 versions of the Wikipedia page, with one online user, Liv Lovisa, claiming that 'history is being rewritten.' Blake Flayton, a vocal commentator on Jewish and Israeli issues, responded to the post, calling the changes 'egregious' and urging someone with expertise to edit the page to reflect what he considers a more accurate portrayal. Pro-Palestinian students celebrate reaching a deal with the administration at Brown University, bringing an end to their encampment, in Providence, Rhode Island on April 30, 2024 (Joseph Prezioso / AFP) Joseph Prezioso / AFP At the center of the debate are key changes in the language used to describe Zionism, the movement that called for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in what is now Israel. The 2023 version of the page framed Zionism as a nationalist movement born in the 19th century that sought to secure Jewish self-determination. In contrast, the 2024 version of the entry introduces more charged terminology, describing Zionism as an 'ethno-cultural nationalist' movement that engaged in 'colonization of a land outside of Europe,' with a heightened focus on the resulting conflicts with Palestinian Arabs. 'Zionists wanted to create a Jewish state in Palestine with as much land, as many Jews, and as few Palestinian Arabs as possible,' it writes. Wikipedia lets editors who have gained status on its platform to change things according to various guidelines, which usually ensure that there is a balanced approach. It is unclear what led to the sudden change in the defintion, and whether this was a result of more weight given to pro-Palestinian users. On its website, Wikipedia says the following on its policies: 'Wikipedia has no central editorial board. Contributions are made by a large number of volunteers at their own discretion. Edits are neither the responsibility of the Wikimedia Foundation (the organization that hosts the site) nor of its staff, and edits will not generally be made in response to an email request.' The Wikipedia page for Zionism; 2023 vs 2024. History is being rewritten. pic.twitter.com/8pglmWJKBB — Liv Lovisa (@eljest_) September 16, 2024 Critics, including Flayton, argue that this new language unfairly distorts the historical narrative, positioning Zionism in a more negative light by drawing parallels to colonialism and downplaying the movement's core goal of creating a safe homeland for Jewish people. The use of the term 'colonization,' in particular, has been a flashpoint, as it evokes a political context that some feel misrepresents the motivations behind the establishment of Israel and overlooks the historical persecution faced by Jews that led to the Zionist movement. Another Twitter pro-Israel voice, Hen Mazzig, wrote: The new Wikipedia entry on Zionism isn't just inaccurate, it's downright antisemitic. It asserts that the origin of Ashkenazi Jews is 'highly debated and enigmatic,' echoing Khazar theory, the dangerous lie that Ashkenazi Jews are converts and not descendants of the Jews exiled from the Land of Israel.' He added, 'This theory is often weaponized to call Israelis 'colonizers' and thus dehumanize us. In fact, Jewish history of repeated exile and migration from Israel to Europe is incredibly well-docmented, as are genetic studies linking our people to the Middle East. Any balanced article discussing Jewish genetics and Israel would mention that. @Wikipedia has become a hate site. I hope they'll change course.' This is disgusting and it throws Wikipedia's entire project of neutrality and accuracy into question. — Brianna Wu (@BriannaWu) September 16, 2024 > The uproar underscores broader concerns about the influence of Wikipedia, one of the most visited websites in the world, and the potential for bias or misinterpretation in politically sensitive topics like Zionism. As a public, user-edited platform, Wikipedia is often subject to scrutiny, especially when it comes to contentious issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With millions of readers relying on the site for information, changes to entries like these can have significant implications for public understanding of historical events and modern geopolitical debates. Israel Hayom has yet to receive a response from Wikipedia. What on earth is going on at @Wikipedia? The current state of the entry for 'Zionism' is beyond appalling.

Hamas mastermind's low-tech means to stay alive	Hamas's top leader Yahya Sinwar has managed to elude Israeli intelligence and military efforts to locate him, thanks to a low-tech communications system developed during his time in prison, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. The system, which relies heavily on handwritten notes and a network of couriers, has allowed Sinwar to direct Hamas operations while hiding in underground tunnels in Gaza. This method has frustrated Israeli attempts to track and target the mastermind behind the October 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Arab cease-fire mediators have provided insight into Sinwar's communication methods. A typical message from the Hamas leader is handwritten and passed through a chain of trusted couriers, some of whom may be civilians. The messages often use complex codes that vary depending on the recipient, circumstances, and timing. The Israeli military declined to comment on the matter, while Hamas did not respond to questions about Sinwar's communication methods. Sinwar's approach to evading detection has become increasingly sophisticated following Israeli strikes that killed other high-ranking Hamas and Hezbollah officials. The assassination of Saleh al-Arouri, Hamas's deputy political leader, in Beirut prompted Sinwar to further tighten his security measures. Palestinian men walk along a narrow street past destroyed buildings in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip on June 11, 2024 (AFP / Eyad Baba) AFP / Eyad Baba The rudimentary communication system has its roots in Hamas' early years and was refined during Sinwar's time in Israeli prisons. As the founder of Hamas's internal security police, Majd, Sinwar developed methods for distributing encoded messages within prisons, including wrapping letters in bread balls that could be tossed between prison sections. Israel estimates that Sinwar spent years planning for a major conflict, including the construction of an extensive tunnel network and the establishment of a communication system designed to circumvent modern intelligence gathering techniques. The effectiveness of Sinwar's methods has made it difficult for Israeli forces to confirm his location, with some speculating that he may not even be in Gaza. His role has become increasingly crucial following the reported assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's former political leader, in Tehran – an attack attributed to Israel. Sinwar's cautious approach has at times slowed negotiations to end the war, which has resulted in the deaths of more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials. Hamas-led fighters took about 250 people hostage in the October 7 attacks, with 97 still remaining in Gaza, many believed to be dead. Despite the challenges posed by his communication methods, Sinwar has managed to relay messages quickly when necessary. For example, he sent a condolence letter to Haniyeh within hours of an Israeli airstrike that killed three of Haniyeh's sons in April. The Hamas leader's ability to evade detection highlights the limitations of even the most sophisticated intelligence-gathering techniques when faced with determined low-tech counter-measures. As Thomas Withington, an expert on electronic warfare and an associate research fellow at London's Royal United Services Institute think tank, noted, 'That split second where you forget discipline, that can sign your death warrant.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/16/exposed-hamas-masterminds-low-tech-means-stay-alive/	2024-09-16T06:22:07-07:00	
Putin orders military to boost troop numbers by 180,000 to 1.5 mi...	MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday ordered the country’s military to increase its number of troops by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million, as Moscow’s military action in Ukraine drags on for more than 2 ½ years. Putin’s decree, published on the official government website, will take effect Dec. 1. It sets the overall number of Russian military personnel at nearly 2.4 million, including 1.5 million troops, and orders the government to provide the necessary funding. The previous increase in Russian troop numbers came last December, when a decree by Putin set the total number of Russian military personnel at about 2.2 million, including 1.32 million troops. The most capable Russian troops have been pressing an offensive in eastern Ukraine, where they have made incremental but steady gains in the past few months. In June, Putin put the number of troops involved in what the Kremlin calls the 'special military operation' in Ukraine at nearly 700,000. After calling up 300,000 reservists in the face of Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the fall of 2022, Russian authorities have switched to filling the ranks of troops fighting in Ukraine with volunteer soldiers, who have been attracted by relatively high wages. Many commentators have noted that the Kremlin has been reluctant to call more reservists, fearing domestic destabilization like what happened in 2022 when hundreds of thousands fled Russia to avoid being sent to combat. The shortage of military personnel has been widely cited as a key reason behind the success of Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region launched Aug. 6. The Kremlin has sought to avoid the redeployment of troops from eastern Ukraine and relied on reinforcements from other areas to stem the Ukrainian incursion. The Russian Defense Ministry on Monday reported reclaiming control of two more villages in the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-putin-orders-military-to-boost-troop-numbers-by-180000-to-1-5-million-as-ukraine-fighting-continues/	2024-09-16T05:47:49-07:00	
Reshuffle likely underway	Likud party insiders reported Monday that negotiations with New Hope — The National Right party leader Gideon Sa'ar have made substantial headway. They suggest that the primary hurdle to forming a government with Sa'ar hinges on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision regarding Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's future – a decision yet to be finalized despite the strained relationship between the two. Likud sources hint at a possible rotation agreement for the defense portfolio between Sa'ar and Foreign Minister Israel Katz, with Katz becoming defense minister and Sa'ar becoming foreign minister, until a later point in which they would swap. Sa'ar's office has remained tight-lipped, stating simply: 'There is nothing new.' Political observers speculate that New Hope MK Zeev Elkin might be tapped for the health minister position. Will Gideon Sa'ar become defense minister during the war? (Photo: Oren Ben Hakoon) Oren Ben Hakoon Netanyahu's office swiftly dismissed the reports saying, 'The claims regarding negotiations with Gideon Sa'ar are inaccurate.' The Shas Haredi party echoed this sentiment. However, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum reacted with fury, 'Appointing Gideon Sa'ar as defense minister would be tantamount to the prime minister admitting he has abandoned the hostages for good,' they said. Netanyahu appears to be in no rush to oust Gallant and opposes the idea of moving Israel Katz from the Foreign Ministry to accommodate Sa'ar. Sources close to the prime minister argue it's illogical to sideline Katz, a party loyalist, while rewarding Gallant, who has taken opposing stances to Netanyahu. Gallant's office has yet to comment, though insiders suggest there might be some truth to the reports. The government and Likud are keen to bring Sa'ar back into the fold to broaden the Coalition, hoping Gallant's potential exit might resolve conscription disputes with ultra-Orthodox parties. The question remains whether Sa'ar would be amenable to compromises on conscription – compromises Gallant rejected, leading to the current impasse. Government officials believe Sa'ar's security stance aligns more closely with the majority of the cabinet than Gallant's does. In a candid interview with Israel Hayom just before his March resignation, Sa'ar stated: 'Had I pledged support for the conscription law, I'd be sitting in the War Cabinet today. Naturally, I declined. Our principles and values are not up for negotiation.' He elaborated: 'Various offers were on the table. Some fell short of an adequate alternative to the War Cabinet, while others came with strings attached that I couldn't accept. I believe my demand was reasonable – after all, in this administration, all party leaders either hold portfolios or sit on the War Cabinet.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/16/major-reshuffle-reportedly-in-the-works-amid-netanyahu-gallant-tensions/	2024-09-16T04:02:40-07:00	
Female hunger strike in Tehran honors Mahsa Amini	A group of 34 female prisoners at Tehran's Evin Prison began a hunger strike Sunday, commemorating the second anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death in police custody, which sparked nationwide protests in Iran. According to VOA News, an Instagram account linked to jailed Nobel peace laureate Narges Monammadi announced the hunger strike, describing it as marking the anniversary of the 'Woman, Life, Freedom' movement and Amini's death. Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died on Sept 16, 2022, days after being detained by Iran's morality police for allegedly violating the country's mandatory hijab law. Her death ignited widespread protests throughout Iran, with demonstrations erupting in streets, universities, and schools that persisted for months. The government's response to the 2022 protests resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries and arrests, as reported by VOA News. People hold up a photo of Iranian woman Mahsa Amini as they participate in a protest against Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi outside of the United Nations on Sept. 21, 2022 in New York City (Stephanie Keith/Getty Images/AFP) AFP On the anniversary, the Kurdistan Human Rights Network reported that Ministry of Intelligence officials have surrounded the home of Amini's parents in Saqqez. The officials allegedly threatened the family and forbade them from leaving their house or visiting their daughter's grave. In western and northwestern Iranian cities, including Sanandaj, Saqqez, Divandarreh, Mahabad, and Bukan, tradespeople and shopkeepers are reportedly staging a strike to mark the anniversary. Amini's mother, Mozhgan Eftekhari, took to Instagram to address those responsible for her daughter's death. 'They will be eternally disgraced in history,' she declared. Reflecting on the events of two years ago, Eftekhari emphasized that Mahsa Amini was seized by 'those dark-hearted individuals who could not tolerate the beauty of their nation's daughter' during her trip to the capital. The family had alleged that Amini was beaten in the police van after her arrest. Police rejected these allegations, stating that Amini died after being taken to a hospital due to a heart attack. However, her family disputes this claim, according to VOA News. As the anniversary renews focus on Iran's human rights record and the ongoing tensions between the government and civil society, the international community continues to watch developments closely.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/16/female-prisoners-on-hunger-strike-to-mark-mahsa-amini-death-anniversary/	2024-09-15T18:30:30-07:00	
2 people die in Ukraine's Odesa after Moscow and Kyiv exchange dr...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Two people died in a missile attack on the Ukrainian Black Sea port city of Odesa, local officials said, as Moscow and Kyiv exchanged drone and missile attacks. The Ukrainian air force said Sunday it shot down 10 of the 14 drones and one of the three missiles Russia launched overnight. Oleh Kiper, Odesa's regional governor, said the two who died in the suburbs of Odesa on Saturday night were a married couple, and that another person was wounded in the attack. At least 41 people were wounded Sunday afternoon when a Russian aerial bomb struck a multistory residential building in Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said, adding that the guided bomb hit the 10th floor of the building, with the fire spreading across four stories. Twelve other buildings were also damaged, he said. Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry said that it downed 29 Ukrainian drones overnight into Sunday over western and southwestern regions, with no damage caused by the falling debris. It also said another Ukrainian drone was shot down Sunday morning over the western Ryazan region. While Ukraine and Russia regularly launch overnight drone raids on each other’s territory, Ukrainian officials generally don't confirm or deny attacks within Russia’s borders. The latest attacks came after Ukraine made a new call Saturday on the West to allow it to use the long-range missiles they have provided to strike targets deep inside Russia, as Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. So far, the U.S. has allowed Kyiv to use American-provided weapons only in a limited area inside Russia’s border with Ukraine. Kyiv officials argue the weapons are vital to weaken Russia’s ability to strike Ukraine and force it to move its strike capabilities further from the border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took to social media on Sunday to again appeal for a shift in the West's policy on the use of long-range weapons, noting that Russia had launched 'around 30 missiles of various types, more than 800 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 300 strike drones against Ukraine' this week. 'Ukraine needs strong support from our partners to defend lives against Russian terror — air defense, long-range capabilities, support for our warriors. Everything that will help force Russia to end this war,' Zelenskyy posted on X. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-two-people-die-in-ukraines-odesa-after-moscow-and-kyiv-exchange-drone-and-missile-attacks/	2024-09-15T09:59:08-07:00	
IDF says it accidentally killed 3 hostages in 2023	The IDF disclosed Sunday that the families of hostages Sergeant Ron Sherman, Corporal Nik Beizer, and Elia Toledano – who were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip on October 7 from the Nova rave – have been officially informed of the news that their loved ones were killed as a result of IDF fire, months after their bodies were found. The three hostage who were killed by IDF fire (Courtesy) Courtesy Military officials briefed the families on the findings of an investigation, providing the first confirmation that the hostages died due to an IDF strike. At that time, it was reported that the pathological examination could not conclusively determine the cause of death for two of the hostages. The IDF has now presented the families with key findings from the pathological report and details surrounding the recovery of the bodies. Military officials emphasized to the bereaved families that during the operation in the underground area where the strike occurred, there was no intelligence indicating the presence of hostages at the location. The remains of two of the deceased were retrieved from a Hamas tunnel during an IDF operation in Jabalia on December 14, 2023, alongside Toledano's body. Just two days prior, the bodies of Eden Zacharia and Staff Sergeant Ziv Dado, who fell victim to Hamas on October 7, were recovered from the same vicinity. Initially, it was stated that the pathological examination could not definitively determine the cause of death for two of the hostages. The IDF has now presented the bereaved families with crucial findings from the pathological report and details surrounding the recovery operation. Military officials stressed to the families that during the operation in the underground area where the strike occurred, there was no intelligence suggesting the presence of hostages at the site. In close proximity to where the bodies were discovered, the IDF had targeted a tunnel that led to the elimination of Ahmed Ghandour, the commander of the Northern Brigade of Gaza. The investigation uncovered that during the strike, the IDF had no knowledge of hostages in the area. The forces stumbled upon the bodies during tunnel searches, without any prior intelligence about their whereabouts. The forensic report revealed no signs of physical trauma or gunshot wounds on the bodies, indicating they were not killed by direct impact from the strike. Given the condition of the remains, the precise cause of death could not be established.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/15/idf-says-it-accidentally-killed-4-hostages-whose-bodies-were-recovered-in-january/	2024-09-15T05:14:41-07:00	
Nuclear express: Russia-Iran pact might spill bomb secrets	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and US President Joe Biden have voiced alarm over the possibility of Russia sharing nuclear expertise with Iran in exchange for ballistic missiles used against Ukraine. The issue was a key topic during their summit in Washington DC on Friday, as reported by The Guardian. The leaders acknowledged the tightening military cooperation between Russia and Iran at a time when Tehran is reportedly advancing its uranium enrichment program. British sources indicated that concerns were raised about Iran's potential trade for nuclear technology, highlighting a deepening alliance between the two nations. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had previously warned of this development during a visit to London last week. 'Russia is sharing technology that Iran seeks – this is a two-way street – including on nuclear issues as well as some space information,' Blinken stated, accusing both countries of engaging in destabilizing activities. Russian President Vladimir Putin (Gavriil Grigorov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) AP Britain, France, and Germany jointly cautioned last week that Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium had 'continued to grow significantly, without any credible civilian justification.' The three nations reported that Iran had accumulated four 'significant quantities' that could each be used to produce a nuclear bomb. The extent of Tehran's technical capability to construct a nuclear weapon remains unclear. However, collaboration with experienced Russian specialists could potentially accelerate the process, although Iran denies any intention to build nuclear weapons. The 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and Western nations, which aimed to halt Iran's nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions relief, was abandoned in 2018 by then-US President Donald Trump. Iran subsequently breached agreed limits on enriched uranium stockpiles. Western concerns about Iran's nuclear capabilities have contributed to heightened tensions in the Middle East, already strained by the ongoing war in Gaza. Iran and its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, support Hamas, making Tehran's nuclear development a direct threat to Israel. The growing alliance between Russia and Iran has been evident in their military cooperation. Iran has supplied Shahed drones to Russia for use in Ukraine and recently launched a missile and drone attack against Israel, which was largely thwarted with US and UK assistance. During their summit, Starmer and Biden also discussed the potential use of long-range Anglo-French Storm Shadow missiles by Ukraine against targets within Russia. The decision would require US approval due to American-made components in the missiles. The leaders and their teams engaged in a comprehensive discussion about strategy, covering topics including the war in Ukraine, the Middle East crisis, Iran, and the emerging competition with China.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/15/us-uk-concerned-over-potential-iran-russia-nuclear-deal/	2024-09-14T20:30:17-07:00	
Missile from Yemen hits central Israel in Houthi attack	More than 2,365,000 people sought shelter Sunday morning as sirens unexpectedly sounded across central Israel, breaking a long period of relative calm in the region.

Officials attributed the loud explosions heard by residents to interceptor missiles. The incoming projectile reportedly landed in an open area between Kfar Daniel and the Gezer power station. Remnants of an interceptor were later discovered near the Paatei Modi'in train station.

As of now, following consultations with the Home Front Command, authorities have not issued any new directives, and educational institutions are operating on their regular schedules. However, in the country's north, officials have raised alert levels, and students in northern regions will start their school day later than usual.

Luai Ahmed, a Yemeni exile and pro-Israeli, wrote on Sunday that 'the Houthi terrorists are at it again – firing missiles towards Israel. Each missile costs more than a million dollars. Meanwhile, more than 10 million Yemeni children are starving to death. Only antisemitic terrorists do such things.'

A month earlier, a drone launched by the Houthi rebels in Yemen hit central Tel Aviv, resulting in one Israeli fatality and triggering an unprecedented strike by the Israeli Air Force on the strategic Yemeni port of Hodeidah. The sirens Sunday echoed through major population centers, including Or Yehuda, Yehud-Monosson, Kiryat Ono, Holon, Ramat Gan, Rishon LeZion, Rehovot, Lod, Ramla, Ness Ziona, Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, Elad, and Shoham. The alert system was also activated in the Latrun area and select parts of Samaria. Central Israel has not had a siren for incoming projectile in months. A senior Houthi official said over the weekend that 'there will be surprises' in the coming days that Israel and the US would not be expecting. Since July, the Houthis have been threatening a response to the Israeli strike on the port of Hodeidah.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/15/missile-from-yemen-lands-in-central-israel/	2024-09-14T20:00:57-07:00	
Ukraine renews calls on the West to approve long-range strikes on...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine made a new call Saturday on the West to allow it to strike deeper into Russia after a meeting between U.S. and British leaders a day earlier produced no visible shift in their policy on the use of long-range weapons. The renewed appeal came as Kyiv said Russia launched more drone and artillery attacks into Ukraine overnight. 'Russian terror begins at weapons depots, airfields and military bases inside the Russian Federation,' Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak said Saturday. 'Permission to strike deep into Russia will speed up the solution.' Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called on allies to greenlight the use of Western-provided long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory. So far, the U.S. has allowed Kyiv to use American-provided weapons only in a limited area inside Russia’s border with Ukraine. Discussions on allowing long-range strikes were believed to be on the table when U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met in Washington on Friday but no decision was announced immediately. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pressing the U.S. and other allies to allow his forces to use Western weapons to target air bases and launch sites farther afield as Russia has stepped up assaults on Ukraine’s electricity grid and utilities before winter. He did not directly comment on the meeting Saturday morning, but said that more than 70 Russian drones had been launched into Ukraine overnight. The Ukrainian air force later said that 76 Russian drones had been sighted, of which 72 were shot down. 'We need to boost our air defense and long-range capabilities to protect our people,' Zelenskyy wrote on social media. 'We are working on this with all of Ukraine’s partners.' Other overnight attacks saw one person killed by Russian artillery fire as energy infrastructure was targeted in Ukraine’s Sumy region. A 54-year-old driver was killed and seven more people were hospitalized, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said. Another three people died Saturday in a Russian strike on an agricultural enterprise in the front-line town of Huliaipole in the Zaporizhzhia region, Gov. Ivan Fedorov said. Moscow warns Western nations Meanwhile, officials in Moscow have continued to make public statements warning that long-range strikes would provoke further escalation between Russia and the West. The remarks are in line with the narrative the Kremlin has promoted since early in the war, accusing NATO countries of de-facto participation in the conflict and threatening a response. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told state news agency Tass on Saturday that the U.S. and British governments were pushing the conflict, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, toward 'poorly controlled escalation.' Biden on Friday brushed off similar comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said on Thursday that allowing long-range strikes 'would mean that NATO countries, the United States and European countries, are at war with Russia.' Asked what he thought about Putin’s threat, Biden answered, 'I don’t think much about Vladimir Putin.' POWs exchanged Russian and Ukrainian officials also announced on Saturday a prisoner swap brokered by the United Arab Emirates. It included 206 prisoners on both sides, including Russians captured in Ukraine’s incursion in the Kursk region. The swap is the eighth of its kind since the beginning of 2024, and puts the total number of POWs exchanged at 1,994. Previous exchanges were also brokered by the UAE. Both sides released images of soldiers traveling to meet friends and family, with Zelenskyy commenting, 'Our people are home.' Elsewhere, Russia’s Defense Ministry said that 19 Ukrainian drones had been shot down over the country’s Kursk and Belgorod regions. A woman also died Saturday after a Ukrainian shell hit her home in the border village of Bezlyudovka, Belgorod regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraine-renews-calls-on-the-west-to-approve-long-range-strikes-on-russian-territory/	2024-09-14T09:57:35-07:00
