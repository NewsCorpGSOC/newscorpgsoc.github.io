Amid ceasefire: Gaza terror tunnel discovered near Israel	A year and three months into the war, the shaft of a tunnel was discovered close to the Gaza border. Explosives were found inside, according to information obtained Wednesday by 'Israel Hayom.' Since the ceasefire began, there have been numerous attempts by Gazans to breach the border perimeter. Some instances were met with warning shots, while in other cases, Israeli forces fired to kill in response to infiltrations. During efforts to clear the perimeter, IDF soldiers in southern Gaza located the tunnel shaft. The discovery is particularly concerning given Hamas' ongoing control over significant parts of Gaza and the presence of hundreds of thousands of Gazans in the southern region of the strip.

Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit The proximity of the tunnel shaft to the fence shows that despite aggressive IDF operations in Gaza, the threat of infiltration into Israel persists. This underlines the need for continued efforts to neutralize Hamas, which is reestablishing its control over Gaza. Currently, the IDF is working to establish a series of outposts along the perimeter, which is approximately 700 meters wide in most areas, and as narrow as 400 meters in certain sections.

Israel, Egypt agree on PA management of Rafah Crossing	Israel and Egypt have agreed that the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing will be managed by the Palestinian Authority, under United Nations supervision, according to a report published this morning (Wednesday) in the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat. According to the report, the agreement on the crossing - the only crossing point between Egypt and and the Gaza Strip - was reached during a meeting between Mossad Director David Barnea, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar, and Egyptian intelligence head Hassan Rashad. A source monitoring the Gaza ceasefire implementation confirmed the agreement, but noted that no timeline has been set for the transfer of control or the reopening of the crossing. Philadelphi Corridor, Photo: Reuters Regarding the Philadelphi Corridor, a narrow strip of land along the Gaza-Egypt border, the source said disputes are 'technical and logistical' and are expected to be resolved. Israel has proposed partial withdrawals from the corridor, but Egypt has rejected this approach, demanding a complete withdrawal and a return to the pre-conflict situation. The source also emphasized that during the meeting, the idea of revising the Agreement on Movement and Access at a later stage was discussed. He clarified that all agreements related to the ceasefire are temporary measures, tailored to the current phase.

Gazans return to Jabaliya, Rafah to find ruins	Gazans have begun returning to residential areas that were combat hotspots, including Jabaliya and Rafah, finding their neighborhoods reduced to rubble following IDF operations targeting Hamas terror infrastructure embedded throughout residential areas. One resident, who returned to Rafah, told Arab media, 'The road is no longer paved, buildings are destroyed, and the debris forces us to move across long distances. Fear accompanies us because Israeli forces are still positioned along the Philadelphi Corridor on the southern border.' Another interviewee said, 'We cannot leave our city despite the pain.' Video: Gaza in ruins / Credit: Arab media In western Khan Younis, aid organizations began maintenance operations including laying new water pipes, in an effort to rehabilitate the area's infrastructure following the ceasefire. Meanwhile, in northern Gaza, one resident who returned to Gaza City, found his home reduced to a pile of stones, 'In the first moments of the ceasefire, I felt great joy because I could return home with my family. But when I arrived at the location, I was shocked by the extent of destruction that had befallen all areas, from the al-Saftawi neighborhood in northwest Gaza to Beit Lahia in the northern strip. 'I was in shock when I found my house destroyed. Nothing remained except stones. It's not easy to lose a home, but we will remain on our land no matter the cost. We will live on the ruins of our homes until life returns to normal,' he added. The Rafah municipality began working to open roads for people and vehicle movement. A municipal official said that clearing debris to allow residents to reach their homes is the top priority. 'It's not an easy task but we need to start the process.' Earlier today, the IDF Arabic spokesperson issued a message to Gaza residents, warning them not to approach IDF forces, troop concentration areas in the southern strip, or the maritime space. The statement also noted that movement from south to north Gaza and toward the Netzarim corridor remains dangerous, and instructions about safe routes will be provided later. 'If Hamas adheres to the agreement details, the process of residents returning to northern Gaza could begin as early as next week,' the military said.

Amid the ceasefire, IDF Arabic spokesperson Colonel Avichay Adraee issued a message to Gaza residents today (Tuesday), outlining that 'if Hamas upholds the agreement, starting next week Gazans will be able to return to northern Gaza. 'I want to reemphasize and clarify several points to prevent friction and avoid misunderstandings. We are committed to ensuring all aspects of the agreement are implemented,' Adraee stated in his message. 'As per the agreement, IDF forces maintain positions in various locations throughout Gaza. Everyone must avoid approaching IDF forces in these areas. Coming near the forces poses a direct risk to your safety.' IDF soldiers in the Netzarim Corridor. Photo credit: Hanan Greenwood Adraee emphasized that movement from southern to northern Gaza or toward the Netzarim corridor remains dangerous due to ongoing IDF operations in the area. Once such movement becomes feasible, detailed instructions for safe passage routes will be provided. He included a crucial warning: 'You are cautioned that in southern Gaza, it is extremely dangerous to approach the Rafah crossing area, the Philadelphi corridor area, and any areas where troops are concentrated.' He also highlighted that in the maritime zone along the entire Gaza Strip, there are significant risks for fishermen, swimmers, and divers, who are advised to avoid entering the sea in the coming days. Any movement toward Israeli territory is strictly prohibited, and approaching the buffer zone is forbidden. Getting close to the buffer zone poses extreme danger. As previously stated, if Hamas complies with all aspects of the agreement, beginning next week residents will be permitted to return to northern Gaza, and specific instructions will be issued to the population accordingly.

US partially lifts arms embargo on Israel ahead of ceasefire	The United States has begun lifting key restrictions from its arms embargo on Israel, with approximately 70 D9 bulldozers now cleared for shipment, according to security sources. While the hostage agreement was set to begin Sunday morning, the IDF announced that the implementation is delayed as Hamas has not yet provided the list of hostages scheduled for release. The bulldozers represent a portion of a comprehensive 130-vehicle acquisition agreement signed approximately ten months ago, a deal that had remained suspended under the American arms embargo. Sources familiar with the matter told Israel Hayom that the authorization for the bulldozer transfer emerged from extensive negotiations with American administration officials, integrated within the broader framework of the hostage deal discussions. On operational activity in Gaza (IDF Spokesperson's Unit) Military officials emphasize the critical battlefield significance of these engineering vehicles in Gaza Strip operations. The heavy-duty bulldozers serve multiple essential functions: establishing secure movement corridors, creating access routes for combat forces, and detecting explosive devices. Their reinforced design enables them to withstand explosive impacts while maintaining operational capability. According to security sources, the availability of this equipment during recent military operations could have significantly reduced casualties from explosive devices among military personnel. The decision to release the equipment follows October's temporary weapons halt, which the Biden administration implemented as leverage to facilitate humanitarian aid access to Gaza.

Gazans flood back to Jabaliya despite IDF warnings	Gazans began to stream back to Jabaliya Sunday morning despite explicit IDF warnings that the planned ceasefire remains delayed, as Hamas has yet to provide the list of hostages scheduled for today's release. Arab media networks show significant civilian movement northward, even though the 8:30 a.m. planned start time has passed without implementation. Video: Gazans return to Jabaliya ahead of ceasefire / Arab media The IDF's Arabic-language spokesman, Avichay Adraee, issued urgent warnings, 'IDF forces continue operating in multiple locations throughout the strip. Any approach toward these forces puts civilian lives at risk.' Adraee emphasized that military positions are being maintained across Gaza until the ceasefire formally begins and highlighted specific danger zones, particularly along the Netzarim route in northern Gaza and near the Shaath area in southern Rafah. The Rafah municipality has reinforced these directives, warning residents to avoid areas near the Egyptian border.

IDF: Truce stalls as Hamas withholds hostage list	The anticipated ceasefire between Israel and Hamas hit a critical impasse Sunday morning, as the terrorist organization failed to provide the required list of female hostages scheduled for release, IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said. Despite the passing of the designated start time, implementation of the ceasefire agreement remains suspended pending Hamas' compliance with this crucial prerequisite. 'Hamas continues to violate its commitments under the agreement,' Hagari emphasized, noting that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has explicitly directed that the ceasefire will not take effect until Israel receives the complete list of hostages to be freed. Hamas attributes the delay to 'technical reasons on the ground,' a claim that comes amid growing tension over the agreement's implementation. IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari (Gideon Markowicz) Gideon Markowicz In a significant development parallel to the ceasefire negotiations, Hagari confirmed that a complex military operation has successfully recovered from Gaza the remains of Oron Shaul, who was killed and captured by Hamas in 2014 during Operation Protective Edge, and addressed the ongoing mission to recover the remains of Hadar Goldin – who too was killed and taken in the operation – confirming that security forces maintain their determined efforts for his return. 'While we all await the implementation of the hostage return agreement this morning, we must be clear that the ceasefire's implementation remains entirely contingent on Hamas fulfilling its obligations under the agreement,' Hagari said.

Arab world reacts to Gaza agreement	Arab reactions to the Gaza ceasefire and hostage agreement have revealed significant divisions across the region, with official statements carefully navigating diplomatic waters while individual voices challenge the Hamas terrorist organizations' victory claims. Responses have ranged from cautious diplomatic welcomes to outright rejection of Hamas' narrative. In a striking rebuke to regional sentiment, former Iraqi parliament member Faiq al-Sheikh Ali delivered a pointed critique on X: 'Arabs, Muslims, and Arab media – it's shameful and disgraceful to continue talking about Hamas' victory in Gaza. Hamas was severely defeated. As for Israel – it destroyed Hamas, devastated Gaza, killed its people, humiliated Iran, and removed it from the conflict equation. This is defeat by all criteria.' This stands in marked contrast to Iraq's pro-Iranian Shiite militias, which praised what they termed the 'Gaza support front.' The terrorist group's allies in Yemen, the Houthis, have maintained strategic ambiguity about their operations. Senior Houthi official Mohammad Abdul Salam offered a carefully worded statement: 'With the Gaza battle reaching its end with the ceasefire announcement, the Palestinian issue will remain the primary issue. Yemen entered the battle to support Gaza not as a show of force, but due to difficult circumstances.' The Iranian-backed group awaits guidance from their leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi regarding their missile and UAV launches against Israeli and international targets. Israelis rallying for the release of the hostages held by the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip (Gideon Markowicz) Saudi Arabia's response typifies the measured approach taken by regional powers. While the Saudi Foreign Ministry welcomed the agreement, it coupled this with familiar demands regarding Israeli withdrawal 'from the Gaza Strip and other Palestinian and Arab territories.' The ministry's statement emphasized Palestinian statehood within 1967 borders with east Jerusalem as its capital, maintaining its traditional diplomatic position. Notably, Saudi social media has featured pointed criticism of Hamas' claims. Activists have circulated cartoons depicting Hamas spokesmen Abu Obeida and Osama Hamdan making victory signs while holding a corpse symbolizing Gaza, and another showing a Hamas official delivering a victory speech amid destruction. The Saudi newspaper ASharq Al-Awsat highlighted international aspects with its headline: 'Israel and Hamas welcomed Trump with hostage deal,' while Okaz declared: 'Gaza deal sees light.' Egypt's Al-Azhar institution maintained its support for terrorist organizations, stating: 'Al-Azhar expresses appreciation for the Palestinian people's steadfast stance, their loyalty to their homeland, and their resistance.' The religious body added: 'The souls of Gaza's martyrs will serve as inspiration for the continued Palestinian struggle until the full restoration of Palestinian rights.' Lebanese media framed the agreement through a local lens, with one outlet headlining: 'Gaza liberates itself from the Oct. 7 nightmare,' reflecting regional attempts to reshape the narrative around the terrorist attacks and subsequent war.

Hamas backtracks on hostage deal terms	According to an official statement from the Prime Minister's Office, Hamas is attempting to modify the ceasefire agreement terms after initial understandings were already reached. The terror organization demanded to strip Israel of its veto rights regarding the release of mass murderers and to independently dictate who would be released – a direct contradiction to the original agreement terms. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, conducting a conference call with the negotiating team stationed in Doha, firmly stated that Israel would not accept any alterations to the terms. 'We must maintain the agreements as previously established and reject Hamas' attempts at extortion,' the office's statement declared. Sources in Netanyahu's circle emphasized that Israel will not permit Hamas to impose new conditions at this crucial juncture, and the established understandings will remain unchanged. President-elect of the US, Donald Trump declares a deal has been reached. Photo credit: Gideon Markowitz This critical development emerged mere hours after Qatar's Prime Minister, President-elect Donald Trump, President Joe Biden, and Israeli President Isaac Herzog collectively announced a ceasefire and hostage release agreement. Netanyahu personally spoke with both the incoming and outgoing presidents, expressing gratitude for their roles in facilitating the agreement. However, it's significant to note that the Prime Minister's Office has yet to declare the agreement final, and had indeed indicated Wednesday evening that minor gaps still existed. In a related development, Mike Waltz, who served as National Security Advisor during the Trump administration, told Fox News that the President-elect's inauguration day would witness hostages reuniting with their families. A senior White House official disclosed to CNN that Sunday's release would include five female soldiers, alongside American citizens in the deal's initial phase. The official emphasized that should Hamas violate the agreement, the US would back the resumption of war and provide support. 'I want the Israelis to know this,' Waltz stated.

What's left of Hamas after 15 months of war?	With a ceasefire agreement and hostage release negotiations underway, attention turns to the current state of the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza following approximately 15 months of war. As of Thursday, Israeli strikes have eliminated close to 20,000 terrorists from various organizations, decimating most of Hamas' senior leadership in Gaza. Despite these losses, the organization maintains control over humanitarian aid distribution and commands thousands of terrorists who now primarily operate as guerrilla fighters rather than an organized force. Before the war, Hamas commanded approximately 30,000 terrorists structured as a military force. According to Hamas sources, while eliminated commanders – including brigade and battalion leaders – have been replaced, these new leaders no longer maintain the same command and control structure. Gaza's civilian institutions descended into chaos, with no functioning judicial system. Hamas terrorists now impose impromptu street justice to intimidate opposition within the population. These forces periodically engage in armed confrontations with local groups attempting to gain control of humanitarian aid supplies. Hamas terrorists ride on top of a humanitarian aid truck in Rafah, Gaza Strip, Dec. 19, 2023. Photo credit: AP A police force numbering several thousand focuses primarily on controlling humanitarian aid distribution. Currently, there is no effective control over Gaza Strip borders, including the Egyptian one. Under the proposed agreement, withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor would commence only after the release of all 33 hostages in the first phase, concluding on day 50 of the ceasefire – during either the second phase or its negotiation period. Beyond the police force and the terrorists, Hamas also maintains control over a civilian emergency services system under its direct command. Current status of senior terrorist organization leadership Political leadership: The head of the Political Bureau Yahya Sinwar and Government head Rawhi Mushtaha are dead, as well as seven bureau members. Six bureau members escaped abroad before the war. Four bureau members remain alive: Mahmoud al-Zahar, an education official, the head of women's affairs, and another relatively minor figure. Hamas police chief, his deputy, and several station commanders are dead, as well as Hamas' head of the Legislative Council. The head of the internal security apparatus Tawfiq Abu Naim remains alive. Military leadership: Military wing commander Mohammed Deif and deputy wing commander Marwan Issa are dead. However, Southern Gaza commander Mohammed Sinwar, who was recently 'promoted' as Hamas' de facto leader, is alive. Northern Gaza commander Ahmed Ghandour, Central Gaza commander Ayman Nofal, and his replacement are dead, along with Khan Younis brigade commander Rafa Salameh. Gaza brigade commander Izz al-Din Haddad who was 'promoted' is alive, and so is Rafah brigade commander Mohammed Shabaneh. Chief of Operations Staff Raad Saad's fate remains unknown, while the Head of Intelligence Staff Mohammed Khamis Dababesh is dead.

Two-state solution all but dismissed by Trump confidant	A senior figure within US President-elect Donald Trump's innermost circle has recently said that the establishment of a Palestinian state was not under consideration. The source, who belongs to Trump's and his family's closest orbit of confidants and has carried numerous crucial assignments for him previously, made these comments during recent private conversations at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. The senior Trump-world persona offered no explanation for this position, simply stating that 'it's clear this won't happen.' Notably, Trump in December spoke about what kind of Mideast peace he would back. 'I support whatever solution we can do to get peace. There are other ideas other than two-state, but I support whatever is necessary to get not just peace, [but] a lasting peace. It can't go on where every five years you end up in tragedy. There are other alternatives,' he said at the time. On Tuesday, Mar-a-Lago hosted a Jerusalem Prayer Breakfast conference, bringing together Christian and Jewish participants as part of the effort to bolster Israel-US relations. American and Israeli speakers uniformly expressed firm opposition to both the establishment of a Palestinian state and any Israeli withdrawal from Judea and Samaria. They emphasized that both religious and security considerations make it imperative for Israel to maintain its presence in these territories. The settlement of Ma'ale Efrayim in Samaria (AP / Oded Balilty) In a related development, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar, during his visit to Italy on Monday, addressed the ongoing discussion about a 'Palestinian state,' stating that 'the two-state solution is a slogan and an illusion. A 'Palestinian state' in the heart of our country would be a Hamas terror state that would undermine stability in the entire region and severely harm Israel's security.'

Erdogan warns Israel against 'aggressive actions' in Syria	Turkey's president has issued threats against Israel regarding its operations in Syria, Yeni Safak reported Wednesday, marking another diplomatic confrontation between Ankara and Jerusalem. In a combative address to his party, Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded Israel cease what he termed 'aggressive actions' in Syria, warning of 'negative consequences.' 'Starting with Israel, the forces attacking Syrian territories must immediately put an end to their aggressive actions. Otherwise, the consequences will have a negative impact on everyone,' he said. Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip (IDF Spokesperson's Unit) IDF Spokesperson's Unit With regard to the war with Hamas, Erdogan continued his hostile rhetoric toward Israel. 'With the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, where genocide and massacres have been ongoing for 15 months, an important opportunity will arise for lasting peace and stability across the entire region. We are closely following the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, and we hope to receive positive news as soon as possible.' The statements come as Syria's transition government under Prime Minister Ahmed al-Sharaa seeks international support for reconstruction efforts. Turkey has positioned itself as a key supporter of the new Syrian administration. While claiming to support Kurdish rights, Erdogan maintained his hardline stance against Kurdish autonomous regions. 'We are followers and supporters of the solution to all the issues of our Kurdish brothers, just like every other group in Syria, and we are the guarantor of the security of the Kurds,' he said.

Pager-style? Iran claims Israel 'rigged' nuclear centrifuges	Iranian officials discovered explosives embedded in equipment purchased for the country's nuclear program, Iran International reported Wednesday, citing claims by Vice President Mohammad Javad Zarif. 'Our colleagues had purchased a centrifuge platform for the Atomic Energy Organization, and it was discovered that explosives had been embedded inside it, which they managed to detect,' Zarif said, according to Iran International. The timeline of the alleged incident remains unclear, Iran International reported. The revelation follows a series of security incidents targeting Iran's nuclear facilities, including a power failure at the Natanz uranium enrichment site in April 2021. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks during a meeting at the IRGC Aerospace Force achievements exhibition in Tehran, Iran November 19, 2023 (Reuters / West Asia News Agency) According to Iran International, Zarif detailed how international sanctions have forced Iran and its allies to rely on intermediaries for equipment purchases, creating security vulnerabilities. 'Instead of being able to order equipment directly from the manufacturer, sanctions force you to rely on multiple intermediaries for such purchases,' Zarif said, according to the report. 'If the Zionist regime infiltrates even one of the intermediaries, they can do anything and embed anything they want, which is exactly what happened,' Zarif said, Iran International reported. The Iranian official linked these vulnerabilities to a series of explosions in Hezbollah's communication devices in September 2024, the report said. According to Iran International, these incidents resulted in 32 deaths and more than 3,000 injuries when approximately 5,000 pagers and 1,000 walkie-talkies detonated. In response to these incidents, Iran International reported that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps suspended the use of communication devices and initiated inspections. The Iranian Civil Aviation Organization implemented a ban on electronic communication devices, including mobile phones, on commercial flights. 'These are, in fact, some of the damages caused by sanctions, which have made circumventing them a necessity for us,' Zarif said, according to Iran International. 'In addition to financial losses, there have also been significant security risks.' The post Pager-style?

Talks remain intensive': Hostage deal negotiation in Doha persis...	The Hostages and Missing Families Forum provided an update to families on Tuesday evening regarding a high-level situation assessment that included Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his team, Defense Minister Israel Katz, senior security officials, and the negotiating team stationed in Doha. According to the message, 'Throughout recent hours, intensive consultations and situation assessments continued at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, alongside comprehensive comprehensive interagency coordination necessitated by the current state of negotiations. The talks remain intensive, focusing on details requiring resolution, and will continue throughout the night.' Saudi media reported that Hamas requested several additional hours to examine specific clauses within the ceasefire agreement before delivering their final response. The Saudi news channel AlHadath cited a senior Israeli source stating that the Hamas delay is not related to any issues regarding the transfer of troop withdrawal maps. In a parallel development, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan expressed optimism, stating he 'hopes to close the hostage deal this week.' A source familiar with the negotiations revealed to the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Hamas had submitted its 'agreement' to the draft proposal on Monday night. However, the organization simultaneously requested detailed maps from mediators specifying the areas designated for IDF withdrawal, along with precise timetables for each phase of the withdrawal process. The source explained that 'Hamas fears Israel might avoid implementing the gradual withdrawal unless mediators possess clear, referenceable maps that can be consulted in the event of any Israeli violations.'

X's new sister? Musk could take over US' TikTok	Chinese government officials are exploring the possibility of Elon Musk acquiring TikTok's US operations if the platform cannot prevent an impending ban, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the discussions. While Beijing officials strongly prefer ByteDance Ltd. to maintain ownership of TikTok, Bloomberg reported, they have begun evaluating backup options as part of broader discussions about working with President-elect Donald Trump's administration. 'In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,' Musk wrote on X, Bloomberg reported. 'Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.' One scenario under consideration involves Musk's X platform taking control of TikTok's US operations, which would combine the platforms' operations, Bloomberg reported. TikTok's US user base of more than 170 million could potentially boost X's advertising appeal. Elon Musk walks on Capitol Hill on December 5, 2024 (Reuters/Benoit Tessier) Reuters Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun declined to comment during a Tuesday press briefing, directing reporters to Beijing's previous statements. 'We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction,' a ByteDance representative said, according to Bloomberg. The Chinese government maintains influence through a 'golden share' in a ByteDance affiliate, though TikTok maintains this only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., Bloomberg reported. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated TikTok's US operations could be valued at $40 billion–$50 billion. The transaction's feasibility remains unclear, as Musk is still paying off loans from his $44 billion Twitter acquisition in 2022.

Alternative outlets exploring potential TikTok acquisition include a bid from billionaire Frank McCourt and 'Shark Tank' investor Kevin O'Leary through Project Liberty, while Microsoft Corp. previously sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. maintains a technology partnership with the company, Bloomberg reported.

Israel concessions 'neither end war nor compromise achievements'	The IDF is preparing to implement a potential hostage deal, including force redeployment during the ceasefire and aid deliveries, contingent on Hamas' approval in intensive Qatar negotiations that progressed on Sunday. The talks, featuring Mossad Chief David Barnea, Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, and retired Major General Nitzan Alon, focus on a phased agreement framework. According to foreign reports, the first phase involves Israel's demand for the return of 33 hostages, as reported by the BBC last week, in exchange for a 42-day ceasefire. In discussions with Israel Hayom, a senior security official emphasized that Israel remains firm on not committing to war termination within the deal's framework. 'The current deal structure preserves our ability to resume military operations,' the source stated. The official highlighted Israel's unwavering stance on maintaining an Israeli presence along the Philadelphi Corridor during the ceasefire – both positions previously rejected by Hamas. A diplomatic source acknowledged progress in Qatar discussions while noting remaining gaps. 'The concessions we're considering neither end the war nor compromise its achievements,' the official concluded. This stance underlies political assessments suggesting both Religious Zionism Chairman Bezalel Smotrich and Otzma Yehudit leader Itamar Ben-Gvir will ultimately endorse the emerging agreement. The deal faces challenges in both Qatar and Jerusalem regarding prisoners who will be released, IDF withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor throughout the ceasefire, and the relocation of serious offenders to foreign countries. Mossad Chief David Barnea and Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani (Gideon Markowicz / Salim MATRAMKOT / AFP) Qatar discussions also address establishing a screening mechanism for northern Gaza returns, with Israel transferring screening authority to a foreign entity instead of the IDF. Another key focus is securing commitment to continue negotiations for the second phase – complete hostage return – beginning in the third week of the first phase's implementation. Regarding military positioning during the ceasefire, foreign reports indicate Israel's agreement to maintain partial presence in the Philadelphi Corridor, withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor, and position forces around Gaza's perimeter. Concurrent with Qatar negotiations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu initiated individual meetings with potential opposition to the proposed framework. Despite having secured majority support in the governing coalition, Netanyahu seeks to maintain government unity. This motivated his separate evening consultations with Ben-Gvir and Smotrich to reaffirm deal red lines designed to preserve coalition stability regardless of voting positions.

Israel's strike on Houthis accidentally showcases Saudi megaproje...	In footage released Sunday by the IDF spokesperson documenting strikes against Houthi terror targets in Yemen Friday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious megaproject 'The Line' – a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia's future vision – appears prominently alongside an Israeli Air Force Ram 707 refueling aircraft. The endeavor appears to be an unprecedented feat of engineering on a global scale: a futuristic metropolis extending 170 kilometers (106 miles) and soaring 500 meters (1,640 feet) above the desert landscape of Ras al-Sheikh Hamid. The planned linear city, with its slender width of 200 meters (656 feet), will feature a striking exterior completely clad in light-reflecting glass, designed to mirror the surrounding desert vistas. The structure will span from the mountainous NEOM region to the shores of the Red Sea. Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman meets US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, not pictured, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Wednesday, March 20, 2024 (AP/Evelyn Hockstein) The project eschews conventional urban infrastructure in favor of a sophisticated underground transportation network, linking numerous residential, commercial, workplace, and leisure facilities along its length. Saudi planners project the creation of approximately half a million employment opportunities, with an estimated $50 billion contribution to the national GDP. Emphasizing environmental sustainability, the development will operate entirely on renewable energy sources while maintaining 95% of its surroundings as pristine natural space. The city's design accommodates roughly 9 million inhabitants, with a carefully planned layout ensuring all essential services remain within a 5-minute walk. A state-of-the-art high-speed rail system will enable residents to traverse the entire length of the city in just 20 minutes. Construction commenced with initial excavation work in October 2021, with project completion targeted for 2045.

Abbas' son to pay Israeli researcher after suing for NIS 500,000	The Jerusalem District Court rejected today (Sunday) an appeal by Tareq Abbas, son of Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), in a defamation lawsuit against Middle East expert Dr. Reuven Berko. Abbas, who sought damages of NIS 500,000 ($141,000) regarding a television interview given by Berko, will now be required to pay legal expenses of NIS 20,000 ($5,640). The case centered on an Arabic language interview where Dr. Berko discussed Tareq Abbas' business activities. Berko asserted that he owns multiple companies and characterized the Abbas family as 'full of money.' He further stated that 'without security coordination, their presence in the Authority's territory would be short-lived,' and claimed that Abbas' family members 'arrived here with nothing and became millionaires.' In a detailed verdict, Judge Ram Winograd, Vice President of the District Court, found that the lawsuit relied solely on edited portions of the original interview, downloaded from a Gaza news site. 'The alteration of how statements were made, and potentially their sequence and substance, prevents the court from evaluating the publication as a whole,' the judge wrote. Dr. Reuven Berko A crucial aspect of the ruling addressed Tareq Abbas' allegation that the statements portrayed him as collaborating with Israel. The court firmly rejected this claim, stating that Israeli courts do not consider statements about cooperation with Israel as defamatory. Judge Winograd stated: 'This claim cannot be sustained as an Israeli court cannot view such expressions as defamation.' The proceedings revealed that contrary to Abbas' initial assertion, the interview was not aired on an Israeli channel but was distributed through a Gaza news site. Berko maintained that in the complete interview, he had actually commended the Abbas family, and his statements were presented without proper context. Judges Shoshana Leibowitz and Tamar Bar-Asher concurred with Judge Winograd's decision. Attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, president of the 'Shurat HaDin' organization representing Berko, commented: 'This is another failed attempt at silencing by Abu Mazen's [Mahmoud Abbas] son. Let all those who wish us harm and try to intimidate our rights, especially in these days, know that justice is on our side, and it will ultimately come to light.'

Israel seizes billions in shock PA debt maneuver	The Finance Ministry has offset all electricity debts of the Palestinian Authority – 1.1 billion shekels ($310 million) – while simultaneously emptying the Norwegian fund where Palestinian Authority-destined funds had been deposited since the start of the war. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich led this initiative throughout the past year and on Sunday told the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet the completion of the process – collecting the entire debt that had stood 1.9 billion shekels ($515 million) for over a decade. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Oren Ben-Hakoon) Additionally, and no less significantly, the Finance Ministry on Sunday issued an order to the Norwegian fund, where Israel had deposited millions deducted from PA funds earmarked for the Gaza Strip (275 million shekels monthly or $74 million), totaling some 1.4 billion shekels accumulated until May ($379 million). This money will cover PA debts to Israeli companies: Half will go to companies that supplied fuel to the Palestinian Authority and half to the Israel Electric Corporation. Since last May, when Norway announced its unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, Minister Smotrich also stopped transferring the offset funds to the Norwegian fund and began accumulating the amount separately in Israel. Now, the sum that was supposedly meant to return to the PA after the war from both the fund and Israel is being transferred to cover debts to the Israel Electric Corporation in coordination with the US. The behind-the-scenes negotiations on this matter with the PA and various American entities were led by Finance Ministry deputy director-general. The latter succeeded where his predecessors failed: transferring the money in full, without reducing late payment interest, from PA funds to the Israel Electric Corporation. The PA's debt to the Israel Electric Corporation has been an ongoing issue for Israel for 15 years. Former Finance Ministry Director-General Shai Babad reached two agreements in 2016 and 2020 with the PA to settle the rolling debt, but these were repeatedly violated by the Authority. As we reported in September 2023, Smotrich, in his role as finance minister, began reducing the rolling debt by associating the Jerusalem District Electricity Company with the PA , thus stopping the debt from growing every two months and fixing it at 1.9 billion shekels. Since then, in July and November of last year, a total of approximately 700 million shekels were collected from the Authority. Today, this historic collection process reached its peak and conclusion – 1.1 billion shekels will be cleared in full and the money will be transferred to the Israel Electric Corporation, partly from the Norwegian fund and partly from funds accumulated in Israel. After reaching agreements with US Ambassador Thomas Nides and preventing the use of accumulated funds in the Norwegian fund for Palestinian purposes, Norway will receive a letter requesting the funds from the Accountant General, from there to pay various debts. Despite American demands for interest rate discounts, the Finance Ministry refused to compromise even one shekel, understanding that such 'discounts' are a negative incentive that no Israeli citizen receives. A deadline was also set for the first time with the Americans: transferring the budget in Israel without indirectly rolling additional burdens onto citizens due to the debt held by the Israel Electric Corporation. The fact that the Biden administration boycotted the Israeli finance minister played in favor of the matter, as the absence of relations meant the absence of obligation to respond to their demands on Palestinian issues. The diplomatic gain means that the Palestinian Authority was indirectly forced to pay the debt it had been rolling over year after year. This is also a significant economic event as the PA's debt to the Israel Electric Corporation led to loans and high interest rates as well as damage to the Israel Electric Corporation's credit rating, which ultimately rolled over to citizens.

The ugly call between Israeli, Australian ministers	Amid escalating antisemitism in Australia, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar and Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong engaged in a heated phone call on Tuesday. The discussion, initially aimed at improving bilateral relations, quickly escalated into a direct clash of viewpoints on Gaza. Gideon Sa'ar (Ancho Gosh / JINI) Ancho Gosh / JINI Wong, known for her alignment with anti-Israel voices within the ruling Australian Labor Party, accused Israel of failing to provide sufficient humanitarian aid for Gaza's Palestinian residents. Sa'ar refuted her claims, emphasizing that Israel had endured a large-scale assault on October 7 not just by Hamas but also by five additional entities, some of which do not even share borders with the country. 'Australia chose to distance itself from Israel during the most challenging year in its modern history,' Sa'ar said, condemning Australia's weakened international support for Israel. He further criticized Wong's recent inclusion of Israel alongside Russia and China as part of the same ilk. 'Israel is a Western democracy with robust rule of law, an independent judiciary, and adherence to international standards,' he stated. Sa'ar also protested the recent incident in which former Israeli minister Ayelet Shaked was refused entry into Australia, calling it a diplomatic affront. 'How would Australians respond if we treated one of their former ministers this way?' he asked. Shaked's invitation to a conference hosted by Australia Israel & Jewish Affairs Council (AIJAC) was seen as an effort to strengthen ties between the two nations, making the rejection unprecedented for a figure of her political standing. Reports suggest the visa denial stemmed from her opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Addressing the broader issue of antisemitism, Sa'ar expressed concern over the recent arson attack on Melbourne's historic Adass Israel Synagogue, a symbol of resilience for the city's Jewish community. 'Israel expects decisive action from Australia,' he declared. Benjamin Klein, a synagogue board member, described the attack as deeply shocking. 'Our community has been on high alert with security patrols and cameras, but seeing this level of destruction is heart-wrenching,' he said.

Envoy to Dublin explains unusual embassy move	Fourteen months after taking office and several months after leaving Ireland due to anti-Israel measures in the international arena, Dana Erlich, Israel's ambassador to Ireland, speaks about her difficult period as an ambassador in Europe's most anti-Israel country and the decision to close the Israeli embassy in Ireland. 'It's a very difficult feeling. The decision to close the embassy is brave and correct, but it's a complex situation for the staff, the embassy, the Israeli and Jewish community, and on a personal level. As someone who has been on the front lines every day since the tensions began, it's not easy,' the ambassador said. 'True, Ireland has been a diplomatically challenging country for many years, even before Oct. 7, 2023, but it's still hard to close an embassy. It's a historic event. It's also difficult to part with the people who accompanied us and were partners in the challenging journey we've been through in the last 14 months.' This is Dana Erlich's first role as an ambassador. Previously, she held numerous positions in the Foreign Ministry, including roles in Costa Rica and Los Angeles, political advisor in London, and headquarters positions such as coordination manager in the Foreign Ministry Director General's office and director of the cadet course. 'When I started my mission in Ireland, I met with Irish officials who claimed they weren't anti-Israel, and I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and see where the relations would progress,' Erlich said. Just a month after taking office, she quickly realized that the Irish conduct was anti-Israel. 'In the past year, we've seen how the Irish have crossed every boundary of extremism, to the point of obsession against us. When you ask the International Court of Justice to change the definition of 'genocide' to fit what they want us to be guilty of, which is what the Irish did, then it's already an obsession.' Pro-Palestinian activists from the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, supported by members of left-wing parties including People Before Profit and the Socialist Party and students, participate in the National March for Palestine from the Garden of Remembrance to Connell Street and Leinster House, on May 18, 2024, in Dublin, Ireland. Photo credit: Artur Widak/NurPhoto via AFP NurPhoto via AFP Receiving thank-you notes from Hamas and promoting BDS legislation 'When they recognize a Palestinian state and receive thank-you notes from Hamas, we understand where they stand in terms of their opinions. When they try to promote BDS legislation that will harm Irish citizens and the Irish economy, these are not steps that contribute to coexistence. These aren't even pro-Palestinian steps; they're anti-Israel steps.' Since she began serving as ambassador in early September 2023, Erlich encountered a harsh reality bordering on impossible, with hostility coming from the media, the political establishment, and ordinary citizens. 'The extreme discourse has taken over Irish public opinion. I think they are in an echo chamber that only fuels each other. The media, civil society, and politicians are competing to see who can be more extreme against Israel. 'I don't think the entire Irish nation is antisemitic or that everyone is against Israel, but given the discourse that has developed, people who think Israel is okay are afraid to express their opinion, and a completely one-sided discourse has been created, including bullying towards anyone who expresses a balanced position, let alone pro-Israel positions. A total distortion has been created here. A one-dimensional narrative against Israel 'We keep saying that there's a one-sided bias and double standard when it comes to Israel, and it's so ingrained in the Irish system that they can't even see it. The delegitimization of any cooperation with Israel, even without government sponsorship, has become illegitimate, and this is what we don't see in any other country. 'I also look at Ireland and don't see that a change in the political map will change their attitude towards us. In the media, there's no other story but a one-dimensional narrative against Israel. In the public sphere, there are no factors presenting a more balanced position. It's one similar voice that is ultimately anti-Israel.' Q: Why is it important to maintain relations with Ireland? 'It's important to emphasize that closing the embassy is not severing relations, but transitioning to a different format. We don't have embassies in every country we have relations with. The decision is to channel and transfer resources to a place that is interested in cooperating with us. We maintain channels of dialogue with many countries where we don't have embassies. Regarding relations with Ireland, there's a Jewish and Israeli community there, and it's important for us to ensure their presence and security.

Photo credit: REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne REUTERS 'There are many large international companies in Ireland, and we have shared trade relations between Israel, Ireland, and the US, as well as relationships with the business sector and the private sector, and these relationships will continue. Israel has relationships with other countries as well, even those that are relatively hostile to Israel's policies.' Delegitimization campaign In addition to the delegitimization campaign against Israel, there was also a delegitimization campaign directed specifically against Ambassador Erlich, including death threats, distribution of posters with her picture, sending threatening letters to the embassy, and countless calls against her, including on social media. 'It's difficult to be at the center of an incitement campaign focused on the country you love and on you personally. It's hard to see the price all the embassy staff members paid because they worked at the Israeli embassy. It was a difficult year for all of us, but what kept me going was the pride I have in having a voice and role during one of the country's most difficult periods. 'The incitement campaign stems from the fact that our messages received resonance and presence in Ireland. I also felt a personal threat at times; my freedom of movement was restricted due to the many threats and the specific situation there. But I think it's not easy for anyone in the Foreign Ministry during this period; it's not easy for any ambassador to be in this situation. What we showed in the last 14 months is that we're not afraid and are at the forefront of facing every diplomatic challenge. At the same time, part of this duty is also knowing how to reassess resources and benefits. Q: To what extent did you experience antisemitism there? 'If we define delegitimization of Israel as antisemitism, then it's impossible to separate the two. Antisemitism is present.' Q: People from the Israeli community in Ireland expressed great appreciation for your activities in Ireland, and at the same time, expressed concern about the future due to the closure of the embassy. What is your message to them? 'I hear their concerns and understand them. We will continue to help them in every possible way. It should be emphasized that their concerns stem from the fact that the Irish government does not provide security for the Jewish and Israeli communities. In the past year, the Israeli community in Ireland has been a close, important, and valued partner. They are amazing people who pay high personal prices in their workplaces because of their support for Israel and because they are Israelis or Jews. I appreciate them, and for me, they are one of the things that made it easier for me, knowing that we are on the front lines but not alone, and they also need to know that they are not alone, and we will continue to help them as much as we can.'

Gantz poised to end unity pact in dramatic presser	Benny Gantz, the leader of the State Party and a member of Israel's War Cabinet, was set to announce his party's withdrawal from the unity government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling a news conference for Sunday evening. This move comes after Gantz issued an ultimatum in May demanding a clear post-war plan for Gaza by June 8, which the government has failed to present. Gantz's six-point plan outlined a vision for the governance of Gaza after the conflict, including the release of Israeli captives, demilitarization of the territory, and the formation of an international coalition to oversee its civil affairs. He insisted that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority could rule Gaza post-war and called for the complete dismantling of Hamas's military wing, echoing Netanyahu's calls for 'total victory.' The lack of a coherent post-war strategy has fueled tensions within the war cabinet, with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also publicly disagreeing with Netanyahu on the future of Gaza. The US government has expressed concern over the absence of a clear plan and urged Israel to protect civilians and present a credible vision for Gaza's future. Netanyahu is facing mounting public pressure, with tens of thousands of protesters gathering in Tel Aviv, demanding his resignation due to his handling of the war and failure to secure the release of the remaining 120 captives. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid has pledged to work towards the fall of Netanyahu's government and the return of the captives. Families of the captives have also called on Gantz and former army chief Gadi Eisenkot to expose the truth and swiftly remove Netanyahu from power, believing he is abandoning the hostages.

New Labor leader facing police inquiry after 'civil disobedience'...	The Israel Police has launched a probe into the new leader of the Labor Party, Yair Golan, for statements that might potentially constitute incitement, although it appears that they were taken out of context. In a video released a month ago, Golan – who won a landslide victory Tuesday, having garnered 95% of his party members' votes – was heard calling for 'widespread civil disobedience,' such as refusal to do reserve duty, to exert pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. When his remarks drew reactions from the audience, Golan clarified, 'I'm not saying now that this is the right move.' הוא אומר פה במפורש: ״לא עכשיו לא עכשיו״ חברים הביביסטים בישלו דייסה הוציאו מהקשר כי למה לא אם אפשר pic.twitter.com/P6V1ZqDGd7 — לירי בורק שביט (@lirishavit) May 29, 2024 National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir urged Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara to launch a criminal investigation against Golan, accusing him of 'blatantly inciting insubordination – at a time when the State of Israel is at war.' Rejecting such allegations, Golan wrote on Twitter that they were 'cheap manipulation' by the 'poison machine' backing the 'historically failed prime minister.' 'We are calling for a large, broad, and continuous non-violent civil protest that will bring about a change of government, elections, the return of the hostages, the return of the evacuees to their homes, and an end to the existential war of the Netanyahu regime,' he said.
