2 dual US-Israeli citizens to be freed in first phase of deal	A senior US administration source has disclosed to CNN that two American citizens held hostage in Gaza since Oct. 7 are expected to be released in the first phase of the hostage deal. The Americans slated for release are Keith Siegal and Sagui Dekel-Chen, according to the source. Along with them, five IDF female surveillance soldiers – Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, and Naama Levy – could be freed as early as Sunday.

The development comes as part of broader negotiations to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza. Currently, seven Americans remain in captivity there, including soldier Idan Alexander, along with Siegal and Dekel-Chen. Four additional Americans initially listed among the hostages have been confirmed dead, with their bodies still unrecovered. The wife and daughters of Sagui Dekel-Chen holding a poster of him (Liran Moldovan) United States President Joe Biden confirmed American citizens would be included in the first group of releases. However, he carefully avoided specifying numbers, identities, or details about their conditions. 'Even as we welcome this news, we remember all the families whose loved ones were killed in Hamas's October 7th attack, and the many innocent people killed in the war that followed, Biden said. 'It is long past time for the fighting to end and the work of building peace and security to begin. I am also if thinking of the American families, three of whom have living hostages in Gaza and four awaiting return of remains after what has been the most horrible ordeal imaginable. Under this deal, we are determined to bring all of them home.'

Medics gear up for release of hostages	The Health Ministry has formulated a comprehensive protocol for treating hostages, who will soon be released, based on lessons learned from past experiences and knowledge gained from the 2023 exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The protocol includes detailed guidelines for medical examinations, mental health care, privacy protection, and long-term support for returnees and their families, emphasizing personalized care and respect for dignity. Key guidelines Advance information: Transfer of medical information to hospitals before returnees' arrival, including reports from border crossing medical teams Initial assessment: Immediate evaluation with family member present, with option for female staff for women returnees Comprehensive battery of tests: Infectious disease screening, pregnancy tests for women, blood clot detection tests, and complete nutritional assessment Minimum stay: Recommendation for at least four days of hospitalization for organization and acclimation Care framework: Dedicated team including specialist physicians, coordinating nurse, social worker, and forensic doctor Privacy protection: Coding returnees as 'other' in medical records, treatment in isolated units with closed visitor lists and absolute prohibition on photography and social media posting Continued care: Long-term support in community clinics and assistance with medical equipment such as hearing aids Rescued hostages Louis Har and Fernando Simon Marman reunited with their loved ones (IDF Spokesperson's Unit) IDF Spokesperson's Unit Hospitals will receive advance medical information about each returnee upon notification of their release, including reports from medical staff at the border crossing. Upon arrival, returnees will undergo initial examination accompanied by a family member or companion of their choice to rule out urgent medical conditions. Female returnees have the option for examination by female medical staff. The medical protocol includes a comprehensive series of tests: infectious disease screening, pregnancy tests for women of childbearing age, assessment for blood clots - a condition observed in past returnees due to prolonged immobility, and complete nutritional evaluation including vitamin levels, potassium, zinc and B12. Based on returnees' medical conditions, consultations will be held with specialists in various fields, including ophthalmologists, gynecologists, geriatricians and dentists. The Health Ministry recommends a minimum four-day hospital stay for organization and acclimation. The ministry is also prepared for specific needs. Hearing aids have been purchased, and health funds are committed to providing personally fitted hearing aids to those who need them. After release, a coordinating nurse and social worker will accompany returnees to ensure continuity of care in community clinics. A permanent care team, including a forensic doctor for documenting injuries, will be responsible for ongoing treatment. Privacy First Privacy receives special attention: returnees will be coded as 'other' in medical records to prevent unauthorized information searches. Treatment will be provided in an isolated unit with a closed visitor list, including separate areas for hosting families and rest. A separate space has been allocated for military personnel to prevent crowding in corridors. Photography is absolutely prohibited in the unit, and families are instructed to avoid posting information on social media. All media coverage will be coordinated and approved only through the Health Ministry spokesperson's office. 'Israel's healthcare system awaits the return of the hostages from captivity with anticipation, and is leading the absorption of returnees to Israel with a sense of mission, duty of excellence, professionalism and humility,' notes Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Health Ministry's medical division. 'Experience shows that return from captivity requires immediate hospital evaluation and treatment, followed by long-term monitoring including medical, mental health and social aspects.' Noa Argamani and her father at the hospital shortly after her rescue from Gaza (Maayan Toaf/GPO) Maayan Toaf ????? ???? / ???? According to Mizrahi, the plan was developed based on lessons learned from the 2023 exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and experience gained from other rescue operations. 'The response must be comprehensive and prolonged, with personal adaptation to the choices of each male and female returnee, and strict attention to privacy protection,' she emphasized. Four Central Hospitals, Two 'Shortcut Destinations' in South and Psychiatric Care Returnees will be admitted to one of four central hospitals: Sheba, Rabin, Tel Aviv Sourasky and Shamir. Additionally, Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba and Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon are designated as 'shortcut destinations' for those requiring immediate treatment among returnees in complex and difficult conditions. According to Mizrahi, she has not yet decided which hospital will be the first to receive returnees, and considerations will be 'according to the returnees' condition.' Regarding various scenarios, she noted among other things that there is preparation for the possibility that returnees will need intensive care. 'Our preparation is for more complex and difficult mental and physical aspects. The days spent in captivity have implications. Refeeding syndrome is one of the issues we're preparing for. Intensive care is also on the table and there may be cases requiring more intensive treatment.' 'In the name of privacy protection principles, we want treatments to be given in a relatively isolated manner from the public,' she added, 'but if there are emergency cases requiring us to leave the returnees' unit for other parts of the hospitals, this will certainly happen.' Another possibility being prepared for is that returnees may need psychiatric hospitalization. 'We will allow them to stay within the unit to provide maximum mental health care there, including a long-term hospitalization-like framework according to medical needs and family requests,' says Mizrahi. However, if needed, there is the possibility of hospitalization in a psychiatric ward in the same hospital or in a psychiatric hospital. One of the lessons learned relates to continuity of care and hospitals' responsibility after discharge. 'There is a need to ensure they receive continued care at the hospital's returnee clinic or another clinic of the returnee's choice. This is in light of lessons we learned where continued care was not maintained, especially in the mental health aspect. Therefore, we have community liaison nurses.'

Arab world reacts to Gaza agreement	Arab reactions to the Gaza ceasefire and hostage agreement have revealed significant divisions across the region, with official statements carefully navigating diplomatic waters while individual voices challenge the Hamas terrorist organizations' victory claims. Responses have ranged from cautious diplomatic welcomes to outright rejection of Hamas' narrative. In a striking rebuke to regional sentiment, former Iraqi parliament member Faiq al-Sheikh Ali delivered a pointed critique on X: 'Arabs, Muslims, and Arab media – it's shameful and disgraceful to continue talking about Hamas' victory in Gaza. Hamas was severely defeated. As for Israel – it destroyed Hamas, devastated Gaza, killed its people, humiliated Iran, and removed it from the conflict equation. This is defeat by all criteria.' This stands in marked contrast to Iraq's pro-Iranian Shiite militias, which praised what they termed the 'Gaza support front.' The terrorist group's allies in Yemen, the Houthis, have maintained strategic ambiguity about their operations. Senior Houthi official Mohammad Abdul Salam offered a carefully worded statement: 'With the Gaza battle reaching its end with the ceasefire announcement, the Palestinian issue will remain the primary issue. Yemen entered the battle to support Gaza not as a show of force, but due to difficult circumstances.' The Iranian-backed group awaits guidance from their leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi regarding their missile and UAV launches against Israeli and international targets. Israelis rallying for the release of the hostages held by the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip (Gideon Markowicz) Saudi Arabia's response typifies the measured approach taken by regional powers. While the Saudi Foreign Ministry welcomed the agreement, it coupled this with familiar demands regarding Israeli withdrawal 'from the Gaza Strip and other Palestinian and Arab territories.' The ministry's statement emphasized Palestinian statehood within 1967 borders with east Jerusalem as its capital, maintaining its traditional diplomatic position. Notably, Saudi social media has featured pointed criticism of Hamas' claims. Activists have circulated cartoons depicting Hamas spokesmen Abu Obeida and Osama Hamdan making victory signs while holding a corpse symbolizing Gaza, and another showing a Hamas official delivering a victory speech amid destruction. The Saudi newspaper ASharq Al-Awsat highlighted international aspects with its headline: 'Israel and Hamas welcomed Trump with hostage deal,' while Okaz declared: 'Gaza deal sees light.' Egypt's Al-Azhar institution maintained its support for terrorist organizations, stating: 'Al-Azhar expresses appreciation for the Palestinian people's steadfast stance, their loyalty to their homeland, and their resistance.' The religious body added: 'The souls of Gaza's martyrs will serve as inspiration for the continued Palestinian struggle until the full restoration of Palestinian rights.' Lebanese media framed the agreement through a local lens, with one outlet headlining: 'Gaza liberates itself from the Oct. 7 nightmare,' reflecting regional attempts to reshape the narrative around the terrorist attacks and subsequent war.

Hamas backtracks on hostage deal terms	According to an official statement from the Prime Minister's Office, Hamas is attempting to modify the ceasefire agreement terms after initial understandings were already reached. The terror organization demanded to strip Israel of its veto rights regarding the release of mass murderers and to independently dictate who would be released – a direct contradiction to the original agreement terms. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, conducting a conference call with the negotiating team stationed in Doha, firmly stated that Israel would not accept any alterations to the terms. 'We must maintain the agreements as previously established and reject Hamas' attempts at extortion,' the office's statement declared. Sources in Netanyahu's circle emphasized that Israel will not permit Hamas to impose new conditions at this crucial juncture, and the established understandings will remain unchanged. President-elect of the US, Donald Trump declares a deal has been reached. Photo credit: Gideon Markowitz This critical development emerged mere hours after Qatar's Prime Minister, President-elect Donald Trump, President Joe Biden, and Israeli President Isaac Herzog collectively announced a ceasefire and hostage release agreement. Netanyahu personally spoke with both the incoming and outgoing presidents, expressing gratitude for their roles in facilitating the agreement. However, it's significant to note that the Prime Minister's Office has yet to declare the agreement final, and had indeed indicated Wednesday evening that minor gaps still existed. In a related development, Mike Waltz, who served as National Security Advisor during the Trump administration, told Fox News that the President-elect's inauguration day would witness hostages reuniting with their families. A senior White House official disclosed to CNN that Sunday's release would include five female soldiers, alongside American citizens in the deal's initial phase. The official emphasized that should Hamas violate the agreement, the US would back the resumption of war and provide support. 'I want the Israelis to know this,' Waltz stated.

What's left of Hamas after 15 months of war?	With a ceasefire agreement and hostage release negotiations underway, attention turns to the current state of the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza following approximately 15 months of war. As of Thursday, Israeli strikes have eliminated close to 20,000 terrorists from various organizations, decimating most of Hamas' senior leadership in Gaza. Despite these losses, the organization maintains control over humanitarian aid distribution and commands thousands of terrorists who now primarily operate as guerrilla fighters rather than an organized force. Before the war, Hamas commanded approximately 30,000 terrorists structured as a military force. According to Hamas sources, while eliminated commanders – including brigade and battalion leaders – have been replaced, these new leaders no longer maintain the same command and control structure. Gaza's civilian institutions descended into chaos, with no functioning judicial system. Hamas terrorists now impose impromptu street justice to intimidate opposition within the population. These forces periodically engage in armed confrontations with local groups attempting to gain control of humanitarian aid supplies. Hamas terrorists ride on top of a humanitarian aid truck in Rafah, Gaza Strip, Dec. 19, 2023. Photo credit: AP A police force numbering several thousand focuses primarily on controlling humanitarian aid distribution. Currently, there is no effective control over Gaza Strip borders, including the Egyptian one. Under the proposed agreement, withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor would commence only after the release of all 33 hostages in the first phase, concluding on day 50 of the ceasefire – during either the second phase or its negotiation period. Beyond the police force and the terrorists, Hamas also maintains control over a civilian emergency services system under its direct command. Current status of senior terrorist organization leadership Political leadership: The head of the Political Bureau Yahya Sinwar and Government head Rawhi Mushtaha are dead, as well as seven bureau members. Six bureau members escaped abroad before the war. Four bureau members remain alive: Mahmoud al-Zahar, an education official, the head of women's affairs, and another relatively minor figure. Hamas police chief, his deputy, and several station commanders are dead, as well as Hamas' head of the Legislative Council. The head of the internal security apparatus Tawfiq Abu Naim remains alive. Military leadership: Military wing commander Mohammed Deif and deputy wing commander Marwan Issa are dead. However, Southern Gaza commander Mohammed Sinwar, who was recently 'promoted' as Hamas' de facto leader, is alive. Northern Gaza commander Ahmed Ghandour, Central Gaza commander Ayman Nofal, and his replacement are dead, along with Khan Younis brigade commander Rafa Salameh. Gaza brigade commander Izz al-Din Haddad who was 'promoted' is alive, and so is Rafah brigade commander Mohammed Shabaneh. Chief of Operations Staff Raad Saad's fate remains unknown, while the Head of Intelligence Staff Mohammed Khamis Dababesh is dead.

Two-state solution all but dismissed by Trump confidant	A senior figure within US President-elect Donald Trump's innermost circle has recently said that the establishment of a Palestinian state was not under consideration. The source, who belongs to Trump's and his family's closest orbit of confidants and has carried numerous crucial assignments for him previously, made these comments during recent private conversations at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. The senior Trump-world persona offered no explanation for this position, simply stating that 'it's clear this won't happen.' Notably, Trump in December spoke about what kind of Mideast peace he would back. 'I support whatever solution we can do to get peace. There are other ideas other than two-state, but I support whatever is necessary to get not just peace, [but] a lasting peace. It can't go on where every five years you end up in tragedy. There are other alternatives,' he said at the time. On Tuesday, Mar-a-Lago hosted a Jerusalem Prayer Breakfast conference, bringing together Christian and Jewish participants as part of the effort to bolster Israel-US relations. American and Israeli speakers uniformly expressed firm opposition to both the establishment of a Palestinian state and any Israeli withdrawal from Judea and Samaria. They emphasized that both religious and security considerations make it imperative for Israel to maintain its presence in these territories. The settlement of Ma'ale Efrayim in Samaria (AP / Oded Balilty) In a related development, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar, during his visit to Italy on Monday, addressed the ongoing discussion about a 'Palestinian state,' stating that 'the two-state solution is a slogan and an illusion. A 'Palestinian state' in the heart of our country would be a Hamas terror state that would undermine stability in the entire region and severely harm Israel's security.'

Erdogan warns Israel against 'aggressive actions' in Syria	Turkey's president has issued threats against Israel regarding its operations in Syria, Yeni Safak reported Wednesday, marking another diplomatic confrontation between Ankara and Jerusalem. In a combative address to his party, Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded Israel cease what he termed 'aggressive actions' in Syria, warning of 'negative consequences.' 'Starting with Israel, the forces attacking Syrian territories must immediately put an end to their aggressive actions. Otherwise, the consequences will have a negative impact on everyone,' he said. Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip (IDF Spokesperson's Unit) IDF Spokesperson's Unit With regard to the war with Hamas, Erdogan continued his hostile rhetoric toward Israel. 'With the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, where genocide and massacres have been ongoing for 15 months, an important opportunity will arise for lasting peace and stability across the entire region. We are closely following the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, and we hope to receive positive news as soon as possible.' The statements come as Syria's transition government under Prime Minister Ahmed al-Sharaa seeks international support for reconstruction efforts. Turkey has positioned itself as a key supporter of the new Syrian administration. While claiming to support Kurdish rights, Erdogan maintained his hardline stance against Kurdish autonomous regions. 'We are followers and supporters of the solution to all the issues of our Kurdish brothers, just like every other group in Syria, and we are the guarantor of the security of the Kurds,' he said.

Pager-style? Iran claims Israel 'rigged' nuclear centrifuges	Iranian officials discovered explosives embedded in equipment purchased for the country's nuclear program, Iran International reported Wednesday, citing claims by Vice President Mohammad Javad Zarif. 'Our colleagues had purchased a centrifuge platform for the Atomic Energy Organization, and it was discovered that explosives had been embedded inside it, which they managed to detect,' Zarif said, according to Iran International. The timeline of the alleged incident remains unclear, Iran International reported. The revelation follows a series of security incidents targeting Iran's nuclear facilities, including a power failure at the Natanz uranium enrichment site in April 2021. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks during a meeting at the IRGC Aerospace Force achievements exhibition in Tehran, Iran November 19, 2023 (Reuters / West Asia News Agency) According to Iran International, Zarif detailed how international sanctions have forced Iran and its allies to rely on intermediaries for equipment purchases, creating security vulnerabilities. 'Instead of being able to order equipment directly from the manufacturer, sanctions force you to rely on multiple intermediaries for such purchases,' Zarif said, according to the report. 'If the Zionist regime infiltrates even one of the intermediaries, they can do anything and embed anything they want, which is exactly what happened,' Zarif said, Iran International reported. The Iranian official linked these vulnerabilities to a series of explosions in Hezbollah's communication devices in September 2024, the report said. According to Iran International, these incidents resulted in 32 deaths and more than 3,000 injuries when approximately 5,000 pagers and 1,000 walkie-talkies detonated. In response to these incidents, Iran International reported that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps suspended the use of communication devices and initiated inspections. The Iranian Civil Aviation Organization implemented a ban on electronic communication devices, including mobile phones, on commercial flights. 'These are, in fact, some of the damages caused by sanctions, which have made circumventing them a necessity for us,' Zarif said, according to Iran International. 'In addition to financial losses, there have also been significant security risks.' The post Pager-style?

Talks remain intensive': Hostage deal negotiation in Doha persis...	The Hostages and Missing Families Forum provided an update to families on Tuesday evening regarding a high-level situation assessment that included Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his team, Defense Minister Israel Katz, senior security officials, and the negotiating team stationed in Doha. According to the message, 'Throughout recent hours, intensive consultations and situation assessments continued at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, alongside comprehensive comprehensive interagency coordination necessitated by the current state of negotiations. The talks remain intensive, focusing on details requiring resolution, and will continue throughout the night.' Saudi media reported that Hamas requested several additional hours to examine specific clauses within the ceasefire agreement before delivering their final response. The Saudi news channel AlHadath cited a senior Israeli source stating that the Hamas delay is not related to any issues regarding the transfer of troop withdrawal maps. In a parallel development, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan expressed optimism, stating he 'hopes to close the hostage deal this week.' A source familiar with the negotiations revealed to the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Hamas had submitted its 'agreement' to the draft proposal on Monday night. However, the organization simultaneously requested detailed maps from mediators specifying the areas designated for IDF withdrawal, along with precise timetables for each phase of the withdrawal process. The source explained that 'Hamas fears Israel might avoid implementing the gradual withdrawal unless mediators possess clear, referenceable maps that can be consulted in the event of any Israeli violations.'

X's new sister? Musk could take over US' TikTok	Chinese government officials are exploring the possibility of Elon Musk acquiring TikTok's US operations if the platform cannot prevent an impending ban, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the discussions. While Beijing officials strongly prefer ByteDance Ltd. to maintain ownership of TikTok, Bloomberg reported, they have begun evaluating backup options as part of broader discussions about working with President-elect Donald Trump's administration. 'In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,' Musk wrote on X, Bloomberg reported. 'Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.' One scenario under consideration involves Musk's X platform taking control of TikTok's US operations, which would combine the platforms' operations, Bloomberg reported. TikTok's US user base of more than 170 million could potentially boost X's advertising appeal. Elon Musk walks on Capitol Hill on December 5, 2024 (Reuters/Benoit Tessier) Reuters Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun declined to comment during a Tuesday press briefing, directing reporters to Beijing's previous statements. 'We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction,' a ByteDance representative said, according to Bloomberg. The Chinese government maintains influence through a 'golden share' in a ByteDance affiliate, though TikTok maintains this only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., Bloomberg reported. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated TikTok's US operations could be valued at $40 billion–$50 billion. The transaction's feasibility remains unclear, as Musk is still paying off loans from his $44 billion Twitter acquisition in 2022. A man walks along the Bund in Shanghai, China, 19 August 2024 (EPA/Alex Plavevski) Supreme Court justices signaled support for security concerns over free speech arguments during January 10 deliberations, though no formal decision has been issued. President-elect Trump, who takes office January 20, has sought to delay the January 19 ban to continue negotiations, expressing his desire to 'save' the application. Alternative outlets exploring potential TikTok acquisition include a bid from billionaire Frank McCourt and 'Shark Tank' investor Kevin O'Leary through Project Liberty, while Microsoft Corp. previously sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. maintains a technology partnership with the company, Bloomberg reported.

Israel concessions 'neither end war nor compromise achievements'	The IDF is preparing to implement a potential hostage deal, including force redeployment during the ceasefire and aid deliveries, contingent on Hamas' approval in intensive Qatar negotiations that progressed on Sunday. The talks, featuring Mossad Chief David Barnea, Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, and retired Major General Nitzan Alon, focus on a phased agreement framework. According to foreign reports, the first phase involves Israel's demand for the return of 33 hostages, as reported by the BBC last week, in exchange for a 42-day ceasefire. In discussions with Israel Hayom, a senior security official emphasized that Israel remains firm on not committing to war termination within the deal's framework. 'The current deal structure preserves our ability to resume military operations,' the source stated. The official highlighted Israel's unwavering stance on maintaining an Israeli presence along the Philadelphi Corridor during the ceasefire – both positions previously rejected by Hamas. A diplomatic source acknowledged progress in Qatar discussions while noting remaining gaps. 'The concessions we're considering neither end the war nor compromise its achievements,' the official concluded. This stance underlies political assessments suggesting both Religious Zionism Chairman Bezalel Smotrich and Otzma Yehudit leader Itamar Ben-Gvir will ultimately endorse the emerging agreement. The deal faces challenges in both Qatar and Jerusalem regarding prisoners who will be released, IDF withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor throughout the ceasefire, and the relocation of serious offenders to foreign countries. Mossad Chief David Barnea and Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani (Gideon Markowicz / Salim MATRAMKOT / AFP) Qatar discussions also address establishing a screening mechanism for northern Gaza returns, with Israel transferring screening authority to a foreign entity instead of the IDF. Another key focus is securing commitment to continue negotiations for the second phase – complete hostage return – beginning in the third week of the first phase's implementation. Regarding military positioning during the ceasefire, foreign reports indicate Israel's agreement to maintain partial presence in the Philadelphi Corridor, withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor, and position forces around Gaza's perimeter. Concurrent with Qatar negotiations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu initiated individual meetings with potential opposition to the proposed framework. Despite having secured majority support in the governing coalition, Netanyahu seeks to maintain government unity. This motivated his separate evening consultations with Ben-Gvir and Smotrich to reaffirm deal red lines designed to preserve coalition stability regardless of voting positions.

Israel's strike on Houthis accidentally showcases Saudi megaproje...	In footage released Sunday by the IDF spokesperson documenting strikes against Houthi terror targets in Yemen Friday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious megaproject 'The Line' – a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia's future vision – appears prominently alongside an Israeli Air Force Ram 707 refueling aircraft. The endeavor appears to be an unprecedented feat of engineering on a global scale: a futuristic metropolis extending 170 kilometers (106 miles) and soaring 500 meters (1,640 feet) above the desert landscape of Ras al-Sheikh Hamid. The planned linear city, with its slender width of 200 meters (656 feet), will feature a striking exterior completely clad in light-reflecting glass, designed to mirror the surrounding desert vistas. The structure will span from the mountainous NEOM region to the shores of the Red Sea. Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman meets US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, not pictured, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Wednesday, March 20, 2024 (AP/Evelyn Hockstein) The project eschews conventional urban infrastructure in favor of a sophisticated underground transportation network, linking numerous residential, commercial, workplace, and leisure facilities along its length. Saudi planners project the creation of approximately half a million employment opportunities, with an estimated $50 billion contribution to the national GDP. Emphasizing environmental sustainability, the development will operate entirely on renewable energy sources while maintaining 95% of its surroundings as pristine natural space. The city's design accommodates roughly 9 million inhabitants, with a carefully planned layout ensuring all essential services remain within a 5-minute walk. A state-of-the-art high-speed rail system will enable residents to traverse the entire length of the city in just 20 minutes. Construction commenced with initial excavation work in October 2021, with project completion targeted for 2045.

Abbas' son to pay Israeli researcher after suing for NIS 500,000	The Jerusalem District Court rejected today (Sunday) an appeal by Tareq Abbas, son of Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), in a defamation lawsuit against Middle East expert Dr. Reuven Berko. Abbas, who sought damages of NIS 500,000 ($141,000) regarding a television interview given by Berko, will now be required to pay legal expenses of NIS 20,000 ($5,640). The case centered on an Arabic language interview where Dr. Berko discussed Tareq Abbas' business activities. Berko asserted that he owns multiple companies and characterized the Abbas family as 'full of money.' He further stated that 'without security coordination, their presence in the Authority's territory would be short-lived,' and claimed that Abbas' family members 'arrived here with nothing and became millionaires.' In a detailed verdict, Judge Ram Winograd, Vice President of the District Court, found that the lawsuit relied solely on edited portions of the original interview, downloaded from a Gaza news site. 'The alteration of how statements were made, and potentially their sequence and substance, prevents the court from evaluating the publication as a whole,' the judge wrote. Dr. Reuven Berko A crucial aspect of the ruling addressed Tareq Abbas' allegation that the statements portrayed him as collaborating with Israel. The court firmly rejected this claim, stating that Israeli courts do not consider statements about cooperation with Israel as defamatory. Judge Winograd stated: 'This claim cannot be sustained as an Israeli court cannot view such expressions as defamation.' The proceedings revealed that contrary to Abbas' initial assertion, the interview was not aired on an Israeli channel but was distributed through a Gaza news site. Berko maintained that in the complete interview, he had actually commended the Abbas family, and his statements were presented without proper context. Judges Shoshana Leibowitz and Tamar Bar-Asher concurred with Judge Winograd's decision. Attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, president of the 'Shurat HaDin' organization representing Berko, commented: 'This is another failed attempt at silencing by Abu Mazen's [Mahmoud Abbas] son. Let all those who wish us harm and try to intimidate our rights, especially in these days, know that justice is on our side, and it will ultimately come to light.'

Israel seizes billions in shock PA debt maneuver	The Finance Ministry has offset all electricity debts of the Palestinian Authority – 1.1 billion shekels ($310 million) – while simultaneously emptying the Norwegian fund where Palestinian Authority-destined funds had been deposited since the start of the war. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich led this initiative throughout the past year and on Sunday told the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet the completion of the process – collecting the entire debt that had stood 1.9 billion shekels ($515 million) for over a decade. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Oren Ben-Hakoon) Additionally, and no less significantly, the Finance Ministry on Sunday issued an order to the Norwegian fund, where Israel had deposited millions deducted from PA funds earmarked for the Gaza Strip (275 million shekels monthly or $74 million), totaling some 1.4 billion shekels accumulated until May ($379 million). This money will cover PA debts to Israeli companies: Half will go to companies that supplied fuel to the Palestinian Authority and half to the Israel Electric Corporation. Since last May, when Norway announced its unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, Minister Smotrich also stopped transferring the offset funds to the Norwegian fund and began accumulating the amount separately in Israel. Now, the sum that was supposedly meant to return to the PA after the war from both the fund and Israel is being transferred to cover debts to the Israel Electric Corporation in coordination with the US. The behind-the-scenes negotiations on this matter with the PA and various American entities were led by Finance Ministry deputy director-general. The latter succeeded where his predecessors failed: transferring the money in full, without reducing late payment interest, from PA funds to the Israel Electric Corporation. The PA's debt to the Israel Electric Corporation has been an ongoing issue for Israel for 15 years. Former Finance Ministry Director-General Shai Babad reached two agreements in 2016 and 2020 with the PA to settle the rolling debt, but these were repeatedly violated by the Authority. As we reported in September 2023, Smotrich, in his role as finance minister, began reducing the rolling debt by associating the Jerusalem District Electricity Company with the PA , thus stopping the debt from growing every two months and fixing it at 1.9 billion shekels. Since then, in July and November of last year, a total of approximately 700 million shekels were collected from the Authority. Today, this historic collection process reached its peak and conclusion – 1.1 billion shekels will be cleared in full and the money will be transferred to the Israel Electric Corporation, partly from the Norwegian fund and partly from funds accumulated in Israel. After reaching agreements with US Ambassador Thomas Nides and preventing the use of accumulated funds in the Norwegian fund for Palestinian purposes, Norway will receive a letter requesting the funds from the Accountant General, from there to pay various debts. Despite American demands for interest rate discounts, the Finance Ministry refused to compromise even one shekel, understanding that such 'discounts' are a negative incentive that no Israeli citizen receives. A deadline was also set for the first time with the Americans: transferring the budget in Israel without indirectly rolling additional burdens onto citizens due to the debt held by the Israel Electric Corporation. The fact that the Biden administration boycotted the Israeli finance minister played in favor of the matter, as the absence of relations meant the absence of obligation to respond to their demands on Palestinian issues. The diplomatic gain means that the Palestinian Authority was indirectly forced to pay the debt it had been rolling over year after year. This is also a significant economic event as the PA's debt to the Israel Electric Corporation led to loans and high interest rates as well as damage to the Israel Electric Corporation's credit rating, which ultimately rolled over to citizens.

Biden signals major progress in hostage negotiations	President Joe Biden delivered a promising update on the hostage deal negotiations between Israel and Hamas and the Gaza ceasefire discussions overnight (between Thursday and Friday), declaring that 'real progress' has been achieved, with the possibility of completion before Jan. 20. The outgoing president revealed he had met earlier with key negotiators while identifying Hamas as the current obstacle to finalizing the deal. Despite the challenge, Biden maintained his optimistic outlook, emphasizing that he believes 'we should be able to reach an agreement.' In a separate diplomatic development, Biden mentioned his conversation with Lebanon's new president, Joseph Aoun, whom he praised as 'the right leader' for the country. US President Joe Biden (EPA/Jim Watson) In a parallel development, families of the hostages convened Thursday with Gal Hirsch, the Prime Minister's Office coordinator for captives and missing persons. During the meeting, Hirsch assured family representatives that despite its phased implementation, the agreement under discussion in Qatar encompasses all hostages. He further emphasized the ongoing coordination with both the outgoing and incoming US administrations to ensure seamless continuity as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to assume office. The diplomatic momentum continued as President Isaac Herzog met with Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides in Nicosia Thursday, where discussions included the international community's efforts to secure the hostages' return.

Report: US, UK, Israel conduct joint strikes in Yemen	Arab media outlets reported an unprecedented military operation Friday, marking the first coordinated strikes by US, British, and Israeli forces since the escalation of regional hostilities. According to international sources, the operation comprised three waves of strikes targeting critical infrastructure across Houthi-controlled territories. The operation, totaling approximately 30 strikes, focused on several strategic locations: underground military installations in the Amran governorate, military complexes in Sanaa, a power generation facility south of the capital, and the strategic western ports of Al-Hudaydah and Ras Issa. Hamas terrorists take part in an anti-Israel rally in the Gaza Strip, May 22, 2021 (Reuters/Mohammed Salem) A mass pro-Hamas demonstration took place in Sanaa concurrent with the military operation. Participants rallied behind the Shia-Zaidi terror movement's ideological slogan, chanting 'Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse upon the Jews, Victory for Islam.' Eyewitness documentation captured smoke plumes rising from multiple strike locations across the capital. Responding to the operation, Nasreddin Amer, a representative of the Houthi propaganda apparatus, confirmed strikes in 'the Seventieth Square vicinity in Sanaa' during the Hamas demonstration.

Army chief walking a tight rope: Meet Lebanon's leading president...	Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun has emerged as the leading contender for Lebanon's presidency, with opposition factions coalescing around his candidacy in a rare show of consensus. The decisive parliamentary session, scheduled for Thursday, comes as Aoun has secured support from 74 of 128 parliament members. The path to presidency, however, faces a constitutional hurdle. As a general, Aoun must overcome a mandatory two-year 'cooling period,' requiring 86 votes for a constitutional amendment. To bridge this gap, he needs either partial support from the Amal-Hezbollah alliance (31 votes) or backing from the Free Patriotic Movement (13 votes). Video: Compilation footage of the Beirut explosion A significant breakthrough came with the withdrawal of Suleiman Frangieh, Hezbollah's initial candidate from the Marada Movement party. While Frangieh's party holds only two seats, his endorsement of Aoun signals a potential shift in Hezbollah's stance. Sky News reports an agreement between Hezbollah and Amal to support Aoun, though no official announcement has been made. Born in 1964 in San Fil, Mount Lebanon governorate, Aoun's military career began in 1983 when he joined the Lebanese Army as a cadet. His rise to army commander in 2017 was marked by extensive military education, including counter-terrorism training in the US. Early in his command, he successfully led operations against ISIS in the eastern Bekaa Valley. Aoun's leadership style emerged clearly during Lebanon's cascading crises, including the 2020 Beirut port explosion. He maintained neutrality while navigating relationships with Hezbollah, protesters, the US, and Arab nations. This approach, while earning broad support, drew criticism from the Free Patriotic Movement during protests against then-President Michel Aoun. Beyond his military credentials, Aoun holds bachelor's degrees in political science and military science. Fluent in Arabic, English, and French, he is known in Lebanese media as an intellectual who often quotes Sun Tzu's 'The Art of War.' His diplomatic skills and strategic mindset have become hallmarks of his leadership approach.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/09/army-chief-walking-a-tight-rope-meet-lebanons-leading-presidential-candidate/	2025-01-08T22:20:38-08:00	
Hamas sells aid to Gazans, uses profits to pay operatives	Hamas continues to pay its operatives regular salaries 15 months into the war, despite Israeli cabinet efforts to dismantle its governing infrastructure, security sources confirmed to Israel Hayom. The organization has established a systematic operation of intercepting humanitarian aid shipments destined for Gaza residents. Armed operatives commandeer supply trucks carrying internationally funded cargo transported by the IDF, then resell essential supplies at premium prices to the local population. 'The resale of international aid has become their dominant revenue stream,' a senior security official told Israel Hayom. These proceeds finance both existing operatives' salaries and new recruitment efforts targeting Gaza youth. A truck carrying fuel decorated with a UN flag crosses into Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, Nov. 15, 2023 (Said Khatib/AFP) While the closure of the Philadelphi Corridor and suspension of private commerce has eliminated major funding channels, the official noted that 'Hamas maintains its recruitment capabilities through aid-generated revenue.' The political establishment, while broadly aligned on the need to revise current aid policies, has yet to develop concrete plans for implementation following Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. Defense Minister Israel Katz, who championed the initial Gaza blockade following Hamas' Oct. 7 assault, had declared, 'For years we provided Gaza with electricity, water and fuel, and instead of gratitude, they dispatched thousands of human animals to slaughter, murder, rape and kidnap babies, women and elderly. We've halted these supplies, and their local power plant has failed. We'll maintain pressure until the Hamas threat is eliminated.' However, the blockade strategy collapsed under Biden administration pressure and concerns over potential disruptions to American ammunition supplies. Israel's leadership now anticipates that Trump – who recently warned that unless the hostages were released before he is sworn in, 'there will be all hell to pay in the Middle East' – may be more receptive to significant reductions in Gaza's aid supply.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/09/humanitarian-absurdity-hamas-sells-aid-to-gazans-uses-profits-to-pay-operatives/	2025-01-08T22:14:29-08:00

Israel concerned over Turkish moves in Syria	Turkey's attempt to turn Syria into a client state, replacing Iran and Russia as key influencers, is a growing concern for Israeli officials. A senior political source in Jerusalem confessed that Turkey's activities in Syria have become a top priority in recent days. This concern is evident: Two critical discussions are scheduled in the coming days by Israeli leadership: one at the Defense Ministry, and another led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli officials view Turkey's moves in Syria as carrying 'the potential for heavy friction between the two countries.' Israel is preparing for the possibility of Turkey becoming a strategic threat, as reflected in the The Nagel Commission's report. The Commission, established to formulate recommendations on Israel's force building needs and security budget in the coming decade, mentioned Turkey 15 times in the report, highlighting regional instability and the potential for rapid changes, including attempts to destabilize the Jordanian monarchy, shifts in Egyptian and Turkish approaches, and rising friction with Israel. Erdogan and Al-Julani, Photo: Reuters, AFP One section of the report explicitly warns the prime minister about the risks: 'The problem will escalate if Syrian forces effectively become a 'Turkish proxy,' as part of Turkey's ambition to restore Ottoman-era influence. The presence of Turkish forces or their proxies in Syria could heighten the risk of a direct Israel-Turkey confrontation.' What could lead to this scenario? The Turkish military's entry into Syria, which could result in the rapid arming of the country, and military actions against the Kurds in the country's east, potentially spilling over to Israel's doorstep. This threat is described by the Commission as a 'potential for drastic change' in relations with Turkey, a country with which Israel maintains ongoing diplomatic ties, albeit currently based solely on mutual interests. Turkish forces near the border with Syria. Photo: AFP In response to the tectonic shifts in Syria, Western countries are rushing to build bridges with the new regime. Recently, the foreign ministers of Germany and France visited Damascus. Moreover, there is a growing trend in Western capitals, including Washington, to remove the main rebel group in the new government, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), from the list of terrorist organizations. 'We cannot afford to do otherwise,' Western officials explained to senior Israeli figures regarding their approach to the group, which was previously affiliated with al-Qaeda. Concerns for the fate of the Kurds Israel's concerns can be divided into two main issues. The first is the continued smuggling of weapons through Lebanon under the auspices of the new Syrian regime. The second is Erdogan's potential exploitation of the situation to crush the autonomous Kurdish rule in eastern Syria, which could result in a massacre of the Kurdish population in the region. In a recent statement on the matter, Erdogan vowed to 'bury in the ground, with their weapons, those who choose terror and violence,' referring to the Kurdish militias in the area. The Kurds have a long-standing relationship with Israel, but Israeli officials emphasize that Israel does not seek direct confrontation with Turkey. The issue of military protection for Kurdish autonomy in Syria is considered a responsibility of the US. Kurdish fighters after their victory over ISIS in Syria (archive). Photo: Reuters Immediately after Assad's fall, the IDF outlined two possible scenarios for Syria: one in which the country would be ruled by al-Julani (Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, leader of HTS), or a division of the country into cantons with varying levels of autonomy. The latter scenario is Israel's preferred outcome. In practice, Israeli officials say Turkey has become the most influential power in Damascus, replacing Iran's Shiite axis with a Sunni-Turkish alignment. While this alignment is not yet seen as an outright adversary, it may offer safe harbor for terrorist groups. 'The arena is multidimensional,' a senior diplomat noted. 'Turkey's interests in turning Syria into a client state, thereby bolstering its regional influence, are clear. Our response includes on-the-ground actions and preparing for potential threats that could escalate rapidly.' A counter-alliance to the Sultan? Amid public statements in support of the Kurds, Israel is strengthening ties with Turkey's historical rivals. In recent months, Israel signed a series of defense agreements with Greece and Cyprus, including a €2 billion deal involving advanced radar and interception systems for Greece. Cyprus has already received Israeli-made Barak MX air defense missiles to replace its Russian systems. In contrast, Israel's unique relationship with Azerbaijan, marked by advanced arms sales and substantial oil imports via Turkey, adds another layer of complexity. Israeli weapons played a crucial role in Azerbaijan's victory over Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh. Given Turkey's close alliance with Azerbaijan, tensions between Jerusalem and Ankara could test these ties as well.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/08/israel-concerned-over-turkish-moves-in-syria/	2025-01-07T23:59:02-08:00	
Complaint filed against IDF soldier in Argentina	The Hind Rajab Foundation filed a legal complaint Tuesday against the soldier wanted in Brazil who fled to Argentina, following a federal court's investigation order regarding suspected involvement in murder and crimes against humanity. Additionally, it was revealed Tuesday that another war crimes complaint, including charges of crimes against humanity and genocide, was filed last week in Argentina against a second Israeli soldier, a Givati Brigade fighter. They indicate they have evidence to support these claims. Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip (IDF Spokesperson's Unit) The Hind Rajab Foundation was established in September 2024 in Brussels as a nonprofit organization, named after a Palestinian child allegedly killed by the IDF during Operation Iron Swords. The foundation is a branch of the March 30 Movement, which has been active for more than three decades in legal pursuit of IDF soldiers. The foundation collects publicly available information online about IDF soldiers, including information about military operations they participated in, with the aim of prosecuting these soldiers in foreign countries. To date, the foundation has filed lawsuits against at least 28 soldiers in eight different countries. But that's not all – it appears the organization has submitted information to the International Criminal Court about 'war crimes' allegedly committed by more than a thousand soldiers and officers during their operations in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/07/complaint-filed-against-idf-soldier-in-argentina/	2025-01-07T03:33:41-08:00

He also said, 'I have to add, I am also for peace, it's time, this fight has been going on for too long,' noting that he was going to try to end the war between Hamas and Israel that began on Oct. 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas terrorists massacred some 1200 Israeli residents and took more than 230 captive.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/07/hostages-have-to-get-out-now-trump-ups-ante-on-hamas/	2025-01-06T21:30:16-08:00

Gaza rockets strike Sderot home	Three rockets were launched from northern Gaza toward the southern Israeli border city of Sderot Monday morning. According to the IDF, one was successfully intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system, another struck within city limits, causing minor property damage to a residential building, and the third landed in an open area without causing significant damage. Masked terrorists from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad place homemade rockets before later firing them into Israel on the outskirts of Gaza City, Dec. 20, 2008 (AP/Ashraf Amra) AP/Ashraf Amra The attack triggered two sirens in Sderot at 11:11 and 11:12 a.m., prompting immediate emergency responses. Magen David Adom emergency response teams immediately mobilized, conducting thorough searches of the affected areas and confirming no casualties in the attack. Residents in southern Israel noted that significant explosions heard before the rocket fire were attributed to ongoing intensive IDF operations in northern Gaza.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/06/gaza-rockets-strike-sderot-home/	2025-01-05T23:00:12-08:00	
You have been warned': Hamas' explicit warnings hours before Oct...	Lieutenant Colonel (res.) Jonathan D. Halevi of the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs (JCFA) revealed this morning (Sunday) a series of alarming posts that appeared on a Hamas-affiliated Telegram channel the night before the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre. His analysis suggests that different preparedness measures might have been possible had this intelligence been monitored and analyzed in real time. The infiltration of Gaza terrorists into Israel on Oct. 7 was preceded by explicit Telegram warnings, as documented in Arab network footage. The channel contained more than just overt threats against Israel – it served as a repository of detailed military instruction materials, encompassing combat methodology, concealment techniques, and explosives handling. The researcher's findings show that Hamas' intentions were telegraphed as early as September 2023, with explicit messages describing plans to target the communities along the Gaza border and execute a comprehensive attack. The investigation revealed that warning signals about Hamas' planned dawn attack on Oct. 7 were disseminated through the 'Military Tactics' Telegram channel, known to be affiliated with Hamas' military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades. The channel's administration and ownership were attributed to Hamam Rashid al-Masri, a terrorist who participated in the Oct. 7 attack and was later killed in November. A series of increasingly explicit hints and threats appeared on the Telegram channel between 00:20 and 00:26 on Oct. 7, 2023. The messages, accompanied by the researcher's contextual analysis in brackets, were as follows: 12:20 a.m.: '5,12 people of dawn are people of Allah.' [The numerical reference likely corresponds to morning prayer times – 05:20 in Gaza and 05:13 in Ramallah. In Islamic tradition, dawn prayer carries special significance, marking practitioners as devoted followers and guaranteeing divine blessing. The message appears to link this sacred time with the impending attack.] A Telegram message warned: 'The gunfire will reach you in your own backyard.' Photo credit: Arab media 12:22 a.m.: 'We say to the Zionist enemy, no one has experienced [the action] that will come to you.' 12:22 a.m.: 'There are many many many many many surprises.' 12:23 a.m.: 'We swear by Allah, we will humiliate you and destroy you completely, and the next phase will be difficult for you and all the cowardly settlers.' 12:22 a.m.: 'The pure rifles are loaded, and your heads are the target.' 12:25 a.m.: 'We will fight you in all [combat] arenas, and al-Qassam Brigades [Hamas] and al-Quds Brigades [Islamic Jihad] will roar with a thunder of gunfire and explosions in every [combat] arena, to the extent that media will be flooded with urgent reports about casualties and severe injuries in enemy forces' ranks.' 12:25 a.m.: 'Your attacks against [mosque] al-Aqsa in recent times will return to you in fire and flame.' 12:26 a.m.: 'You have been warned. What's coming will be massive.' [Accompanied by three emojis: a hand gesturing to wait, a flame of fire, and a green heart – Hamas and Islamic colors]. The researcher's investigation extended to September 2023, revealing additional warning signs posted three weeks before the Hamas attack on another Telegram channel connected to al-Masri, who identified himself as an 'al-Qassam Brigades writer.' A particularly telling message from September 2023 read: '[Message] to Gaza border settlers: before it's too late, run and leave, as we have made an unequivocal decision that has no mercy in it. We will turn your skulls into a bridge over which we will cross to Jerusalem and al-Aqsa [mosque]. You are deluding yourselves about your weak army and crumbling government. Nothing will help you except escape. Woe to you from our coming hours [our actions in the near future] which will bring you what no eye has seen and no ear has heard. The revolutionary youth, Gaza Strip. Monday, September 18.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/05/you-have-been-warned-hamas-explicit-warnings-hours-before-oct-7/	2025-01-05T04:50:01-08:00	
IDF soldier who survived Oct. 7 escapes Brazil as court seeks arr...	An Israeli soldier, who survived the October 7 Nova festival massacre and subsequently participated in military operations in Gaza, departed Brazil today (Sunday) after a federal court issued an investigation order against him on suspicion of genocide and crimes against humanity. The investigation stemmed from a complaint filed by a pro-Palestinian organization. The soldier had been vacationing in Brazil when the order was issued. IDF soldiers during Operation Iron Swords in Gaza (Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit) In a related development in Israel, the Ima Era (Awake Mother) organization, representing mothers of combat soldiers, delivered a strongly worded letter today to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi regarding the Brazilian authorities' investigation. The mothers expressed serious concern that unclear governmental policies and inflammatory statements by cabinet ministers are exposing soldiers to international legal jeopardy. 'The IDF has been conducting operations for 15 months without clear objectives or strategy due to the government's failure to establish definitive policies,' the letter emphasizes. 'This has resulted in a prolonged, exhausting campaign that not only drains our soldiers but also creates space for extreme viewpoints to penetrate both the IDF internally and the global perception externally.' The mothers highlight the government's inadequate response to repeated warnings about soldiers' vulnerability to international legal action. 'Israel's government has chosen willful ignorance, allowing the chaos instigated by its most radical ministers to expand unchecked,' their letter states. At a recent emergency gathering of reserve commanders two weeks ago, participants cautioned that IDF personnel and defense officials would face increased risk of overseas arrest should the Israeli judicial system's independence be compromised. Former Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit, who previously served as chief military advocate general, echoed these concerns during the conference. בברזיל פתחו בחקירה נגד תייר ישראלי שביקר במדינה ושירת בצה'ל במהלך המלחמה. הוא נאשם ב'פשעי מלחמה'- ולגודל האבסורד מדובר בבחור שניצל מהטבח במסיבת הנובה, אבל אותו מאשימים בפשעי מלחמה!!! לא מפתיע אותי כשמדובר במדינה כמו ברזיל שהנשיא האנטישמי שלה לולה האשים את ישראל ברצח עם, טען… pic.twitter.com/nytExnNCCm — יוסף חדאד - Yoseph Haddad (@YosephHaddad) January 5, 2025 Public diplomacy representative Yoseph Haddad addressed the situation on his X platform account, characterizing Brazil's actions as antisemitic. 'This behavior is predictable from a country like Brazil, led by an antisemitic president, Lula, who has accused Israel of genocide, compared IDF operations to Hitler's actions, and absurdly claimed Israel killed 12 million children in Gaza (demonstrating an astounding level of ignorance).'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/05/idf-soldier-who-survived-oct-7-escapes-brazil-after-court-issues-arrest/	2025-01-04T22:59:29-08:00	
Government failed to respond to Hamas sexual violence, report fin...	A comprehensive report by the Israel Women's Network and the Women and War Documentation and Research Collective reveals critical failures in Israel's response to sexual violence during and after the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre. The report highlights systematic governmental failures, including unimplemented UN resolutions and ignored civil society warnings about protecting women and children in conflict zones. 'We're more than a year into the event, and no one can guarantee that if this happens again, the state will handle it differently,' says Tal Hochman, executive director of the Israel Women's Network. The report, which will be submitted to multiple government offices, including the Prime Minister's Office and ministries of defense, foreign affairs, and justice, points to a 'lack of knowledge and professional capability within governmental mechanisms.' Video: Israeli interrogation of Gaza father and son confessing to rape and murder of civilians on Oct. 7 National security researcher Shira Shaham emphasizes that sexual violence in conflicts represents a fundamental security issue, not merely a women's rights concern. 'A security concept that doesn't consider aspects of dangers to women is an incomplete security concept,' she states. The report criticizes the absence of an official, transparent government account of war crimes and sexual violence during the attack. It particularly emphasizes the ongoing plight of hostages who 'continue to be exposed to violence in general and gender and sexual violence in particular' in Hamas captivity. In April, National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi directed the establishment of a 'national team on gender violence following Oct. 7' to integrate the issue with a broad perspective. The team brings together representatives from various government ministries and security branches, and focuses on action in diplomatic and international dimensions, working with UN bodies and human rights organizations. The State Attorney's Office stated, 'A thorough investigation of all Oct. 7 events has been and continues to be conducted, examining the role of each and every one of those investigated. Beyond this, at this stage we cannot detail the particulars and findings of the investigations.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/05/government-failed-to-respond-to-hamas-sexual-violence-report-finds/	2025-01-04T22:21:00-08:00	
Hamas' remaining rocket capability: A strategic assessment	Fifteen months into the war, Hamas demonstrates its continued capability to threaten Israeli territory, maintaining an almost daily pattern of rocket launches over the past ten days despite significant degradation of its infrastructure. In the latest incident Saturday afternoon, Israeli radar systems detected a rocket launch from northern Gaza that landed in the Erez region. This followed Friday's dual launches – one impacting near Kibbutz Nir Am and another in an unpopulated area. A separate significant development occurred Friday when Hamas attempted to target an IDF helicopter with a man-portable air-defense system. While the helicopter emerged unscathed, the projectile – assessed to be headed toward the Be'eri region – was intercepted by Israel's Iron Beam defense system. The Iron Dome in action (Defense Ministry) Defense Ministry Security analysts attribute Hamas' persistent launch capability to several strategic factors. Israeli defense assessments indicate the organization retains a limited stockpile ranging from dozens to several hundred rockets. With smuggling routes restricted primarily to the Philadelphi Corridor and Rafah crossing, each launch effectively depletes the terror group's diminishing arsenal. Defense officials have consistently maintained that completely eliminating Hamas' rocket capability was an unrealistic objective, though the current operational tempo represents a fraction of their previous capacity. The timing and intensity of recent launches potentially reflect multiple strategic considerations. Intelligence assessments suggest Hamas may be accelerating deployments to prevent stockpile seizure by advancing IDF forces. Additionally, the increased activity could represent psychological pressure tactics ahead of potential hostage negotiations, exemplified by the organization's recent release of footage showing captured IDF lookout Liri Albag. A more concerning analysis suggests the possibility of operational recovery in areas where IDF presence has diminished. Despite severe disruption to Hamas' command and control infrastructure, the absence of alternative governance structures may be enabling the terror organization to reconstitute certain capabilities.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/05/hamas-remaining-rocket-capability-a-strategic-assessment/	2025-01-04T18:30:27-08:00	
It drives the antisemites crazy': French vigilante erases pro-Ha...	Claudine (pseudonym), a content creator from France, has discovered a powerful and innovative approach to expressing her views in public spaces: under cover of darkness, she transforms pro-Hamas and pro-Palestinian graffiti into messages supporting hostage return and French values of liberty. 'I'm fighting for our freedom,' she declares, 'public spaces belong to everyone, not to extremists.' Growing up in the southern suburbs of Paris, Claudine was immersed in a multicultural environment where Jews, Muslims, Christians, and secular individuals coexisted against a predominantly leftist political backdrop. Born to a Jewish father who escaped Tunisia in 1960 and a non-Jewish French mother, she was raised with strong principles of liberty and equality, though she identifies as a 'secular French Jew.' @tous_resistants #freefrance ♬ Paris my passion - Music For Business In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack, she made a pivotal decision to revisit her graffiti roots with a new mission. 'I began with massive graffiti declaring 'HAMAS RAPE' and 'FUCK HAMAS,'' she reveals. Since then, her nighttime missions involve locating anti-Israel graffiti such as 'Free Gaza' and 'Death to Israel,' which she transforms into messages advocating for hostage return, accompanied by French flags. Her activism has created ripples within the French hip-hop community where she belongs, which she estimates is 90% pro-Palestinian. 'They despise me for utilizing tools they considered their exclusive domain,' she notes, 'but that doesn't faze me. I avoid confrontation, violence, or arguments – I simply take action.' @tous_resistants Chacun peut agir. ' Love Israel ' #fckhms #bringthemhomenow #savethewest #freeworld #laïcité #feminist #loveisrael ♬ Love Is Gone (Acoustic) - SLANDER, Dylan Matthew When Claudine started sharing her activities on social media in July 2024 with the message 'everyone can act,' she initially faced pushback from the Jewish community, concerned about potential antisemitic backlash. Yet gradually, both Jewish and non-Jewish supporters reached out with gratitude and offers to join her cause. 'I'm not leading a group, but sparking a movement,' she emphasizes. Now, she receives documentation of similar actions from throughout France and neighboring countries including Germany, Luxembourg, and England. Roughly two months ago, she expanded her presence to TikTok, despite facing platform restrictions. 'I persist there because I succeed in frustrating antisemites and pro-Palestinians, and I absolutely love it!' she says with a knowing smile.

'French society cannot accept neighborhoods dominated by women in full cover,' she observes, 'France's secular identity is fundamental to our national character.' Nevertheless, she has grown skeptical about change emerging from within Muslim communities. 'While I wish they would stand up against Islamists and champion equality, I've abandoned that hope.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/05/it-drives-the-antisemites-crazy-french-content-creator-erases-pro-hamas-graffiti/	2025-01-04T18:30:19-08:00	
Turkish officials: Assad's fall wasn't the original plan	Turkish officials have disclosed to the US administration that neither they nor Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) had originally planned or anticipated the overthrow of Bashar Assad and Syria's capture, instead seizing an unexpected opportunity for success – information that US officials subsequently shared with Israel. The Turkish explanation indicated their original strategy aimed only to modestly expand Mohammad al-Julani's organization's control around Aleppo in northern Syria, near the Turkish border. The unexpectedly rapid collapse of Aleppo and the disintegration of Syrian military forces prompted al-Julani and his supporters to push forward into additional regions of the country. Simultaneously, contradictory reports emerge from Syria regarding the new leadership's approach toward minority communities. Images obtained by Israel Hayom from Homs show new leadership officials wearing ISIS insignia on their clothing. Additional photographs from Baniyas in northwestern Syria reveal HTS representatives requiring women to wear face-covering niqabs. A representative of the new Syrian leadership wearing ISIS insignia.

Despite these assurances, the Kurdish leadership in northern Syria continues to report harassment from the new leadership. Israel Hayom has obtained information about an extensive phone discussion between Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and Ilham Ahmad, Foreign Minister of the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Syria. During their conversation, the Kurdish representative reported arbitrary arrests and executions of Kurdish citizens by the new leadership. Saar indicated he consistently raises Kurdish concerns during all his diplomatic conversations with international colleagues.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/03/turkish-officials-assads-fall-wasnt-the-original-plan/	2025-01-02T20:30:55-08:00	
NYT: UNRWA prepares to cease operations in Gaza, West Bank	The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) plans to fully suspend its operations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the New York Times reported today (Friday). The report indicates that the agency's decision comes in response to legislation passed by the Knesset in October. UN officials indicated they are preparing to terminate operations in both territories primarily because the new laws will prevent Israeli officials from engaging with UNRWA. The agency emphasizes that coordination with the Israel Defense Forces is essential whenever its personnel deliver aid or traverse areas throughout Gaza and sections of the West Bank. 'Without the ability to share this information with Israeli authorities on a daily basis our teams would face severe security risks,' Louise Wateridge, a senior UNRWA official in Gaza, said. She noted that the Gaza war has already claimed the lives of more than 250 UNRWA workers.
