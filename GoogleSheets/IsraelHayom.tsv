Syrian rebels surround Damascus	Syrian opposition forces have captured the village of Deir Hafer east of Aleppo, Arab media outlets reported overnight Saturday. The northern Syrian city is largely under rebel control, with the remaining portion held by Kurdish forces. Further south, opposition forces have reached the northern outskirts of Hama. Simultaneously, developments are unfolding in southern Syria. Al-Arabi channel broadcast footage of demonstrations in the Damascus area supporting the operations of Islamic rebels. Pro-opposition protests were also documented in the southern city of Daraa, where demonstrations against the Assad regime have been ongoing for several months. Opposition sources in the Daraa region told Al-Arabi Al-Jadid newspaper that rebel infrastructure is already in place there. According to these sources, the goal is to conduct a 'pincer movement from south and north' to attack the capital, Damascus. Reports indicated that the capital witnessed military deployments by Assad regime forces. A local website in Daraa also reported that local factions plan to conduct military operations against Assad army checkpoints in southern Syria.

'The Assad regime is in a weak position, as are its operators. This is a golden opportunity for Syrians. Syria cannot become a developed country unless this tyrannical regime is removed,' the source said. In northern Syria, the rebels' operations department announced they had taken control of Aleppo and the entire Idlib governorate and succeeded in blocking the road between Aleppo and Raqqa (an eastern provincial city and another key stronghold).

During the night, Russian fighter jets conducted strikes in the northern Idlib governorate, the main stronghold of the Syrian opposition. Syrian President Bashar Assad, who returned to Damascus over the weekend, declared yesterday that 'Syria is capable, with the help of its allies, of defeating the terrorists. No matter how much their attacks have intensified.' In a conversation with UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed, Assad said, 'Syria will continue to defend its stability and territorial integrity against all terrorists and their supporters.' Assad also spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, who expressed readiness to assist the Syrian regime.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/01/syrian-rebels-employ-pincer-movement-on-damascus/	2024-11-30T23:00:36-08:00	
These are the rebels fighting the Iranian axis in Syria	Syrian rebels stunned the world on Wednesday with a large-scale surprise attack on the defensive lines of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime in the country's north. In less than 72 hours, the rebels seized vast parts of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, which had taken Assad's forces over four years to capture from the opposition. Video: Rebels arrive in Aleppo, Syria. Source: Arab networks The rebels employed tactics all too familiar to Israelis: rocket fire, drones, and surprise raids by light forces using pickup trucks from hidden positions and pre-prepared tunnels to evade the Russian and Syrian air forces that dominate the skies. The operation was a resounding success, leaving the Syrian army and its allies—Iranian militias and Russian forces—caught off guard and in disarray. Images and videos circulated of rebels celebrating their victory, taking prisoners, capturing abandoned Syrian military equipment, and chanting religious slogans with fervor.

The answer is complex, much like the intricacies of Syrian insurgent politics. Broadly speaking, the rebel forces can be divided into two primary factions. Tahrir al-Sham The first faction is Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), or simply Tahrir al-Sham. This is an extremist Islamist organization with roots in al-Qaeda operatives who joined the uprising against Assad early on. HTS is led by Abu Mohammad al-Julani, the most powerful figure among the Syrian rebels and the driving force behind the northern offensive. The rebels in Syria. Photo: Reuters HTS has been preparing for this offensive for over two years, undergoing extensive training—likely with funding and support from Gulf states—and building underground command infrastructures while stockpiling weapons and ammunition from Turkey. How extreme is HTS? While Julani has softened some of his positions over the years, at least publicly, many of the group's members are former al-Qaeda and ISIS fighters, some of whom proudly bear the Islamic State flag on their uniforms. The Syrian National Army The second major force leading the offensive is a coalition of dozens of groups under the umbrella of the 'Syrian National Army' (SNA), a body that receives direct military support from Turkey and enjoys unwavering backing from Ankara. The groups within the SNA are diverse, ranging from moderate, nationalist-oriented factions to outright Islamist groups. Notably, not all these groups cooperate smoothly; in recent months, some have openly clashed with one another. Residents of Idlib in northern Syria celebrate the rebels' takeover of Aleppo. Photo: AFP While only one of these factions is directly linked to Turkey and its support, both rely heavily on Turkey's military presence in northern Syria for survival. Turkey's involvement in northern Syria, particularly between 2017 and 2018, helped the rebels stabilize their frontlines and prevent the fall of Idlib Province, the last major rebel stronghold in Syria. This province has become a kind of 'Wild West,' using Turkish currency and hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees struggling to survive in dire conditions. The perfect storm From this region, which spans large parts of northern Syria, the rebels have been meticulously planning to take back their country. A lethal convergence of Turkey's desire for revenge against Moscow and the weakening of the Iranian axis—due to the blows suffered by Hezbollah in Lebanon—turned months of meticulous preparation into a 'perfect storm.' The Syrian civil war, far from over, continues to reshape alliances and redraw the lines of conflict, with consequences reverberating across the region and beyond.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/30/these-are-the-rebels-fighting-the-iranian-axis-in-syria/	2024-11-29T14:20:55-08:00	
UAE official visits family of slain Rabbi Kogan	Dr. Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi, a senior representative of the United Arab Emirates authorities, arrived at the shiva (seven-day mourning period) in Jerusalem on Friday to express his sincere condolences to the family of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, the Chabad emissary who was killed in Abu Dhabi on November 24, 2024, emphasizing the UAE's unwavering commitment to coexistence and rejection of extremism. During his conversation with family members, Nuaimi emphasized that the UAE will continue to advocate for coexistence and never allow extremists to divide us. 'The state and its citizens are more committed than ever to the values of openness and peace and will increase their efforts to ensure that Rabbi Zvi's legacy continues and that all communities live in harmony in the UAE,' the senior official said.

Nuaimi holds the position of Chairman of the Defense Commission of the Federal National Council's Internal and External Relations Committee. In practice, he can be described as a senior advisor whose words reflect the position of the president of the UAE, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Nuaimi was among the major proponents of the Abraham Accords and is known as a harsh critic of radical Islam. For instance, in a special interview marking the first anniversary of establishing relations with the UAE, he said of radical Islam: 'This is not Islam, and it does not serve the interests of Muslims worldwide. Instead of religion uniting all human beings, they developed a narrative of hatred.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/29/uae-official-visits-family-of-slain-rabbi-kogan/	2024-11-29T00:00:40-08:00	
Is Tehran changing course amid Trump win and Hezbollah setback?	Iran appears to be recalibrating its regional strategy following Donald Trump's election victory and the weakening of its proxy Hezbollah, the New York Times has reported based on multiple sources familiar with Tehran's decision-making process. In a notable shift from its typically aggressive stance, Tehran has made several conciliatory diplomatic moves. These include dispatching a senior official to Beirut in mid-November to encourage Hezbollah to accept a ceasefire with Israel, and its UN ambassador meeting with Elon Musk, seen as an attempt to establish communication channels with Trump's circle. Seven Iranian officials, including one from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), told the New York Times that Trump's Nov. 5 election victory prompted this strategic shift. They cited concerns about renewing confrontation with an administration that had previously pursued a 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran. Donald Trump stands on stage with Melania and Lara Trump, Nov. 6, 2024, West Palm Beach, Florida (AP/Evan Vucci) AP/Evan Vucci This diplomatic pivot represents a stark departure from late October, when Iran was preparing for a potential strike against Israel. At that time, a deputy IRGC commander had declared, 'We have never left an aggression unanswered in 40 years.' The change in approach also follows significant losses by Hezbollah in its confrontation with Israel. According to Iranian media reports, there is growing discontent among displaced Lebanese Shia communities who traditionally look to Iran for protection. Mehdi Afraz, director of research at Baqir al-Olum University, offered an unusually frank assessment: 'Our friends from Syria called and said the Lebanese Shia refugees who support Hezbollah are cursing us up and down, first Iran, then others. We are treating war as a joke.' Iran's domestic challenges have also influenced this shift. The country faces mounting economic pressures, with the government recently announcing daily power cuts. The death of hard-line president Ebrahim Raisi and the election of moderate Masoud Pezeshkian in July has brought promises of economic reform and increased Western engagement. Several senior Iranian officials have indicated openness to negotiations with the incoming Trump administration on nuclear and regional issues. 'Iran is now applying restraint to give Trump a chance to see whether he can end the Gaza war and contain Netanyahu,' said Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat now at Princeton University. 'Without doubt in Iran, among senior officials and ordinary people, there is a real desire to end the tensions with the West and to get along,' Naser Imani, an analyst close to the government, told The New York Times. 'Cooperation with the West is not viewed as defeat, it is seen as transactional diplomacy and can be done from a position of strength.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/28/is-tehran-changing-course-amid-trump-win-and-hezbollah-setback/	2024-11-28T04:59:22-08:00	
Hamas signals openness to Gaza ceasefire after Hezbollah deal	A high-ranking Hamas official has told French news agency AFP Wednesday that the terror group is prepared to enter into a ceasefire arrangement mirroring the recent agreement between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Though the source did not specify ceasefire terms, Hamas has maintained its demands for a permanent cessation of hostilities, backed by international guarantees and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. Palestinians celebrate by a destroyed Israeli tank at the Gaza Strip fence east of Khan Younis, Oct. 7, 2023 (AP/Hassan Eslaiah) AP/Hassan Eslaiah On Tuesday, an Egyptian diplomatic mission arrived in Israel to explore possibilities for a hostage deal that could potentially expand into a broader ceasefire in Gaza. Previously, Hezbollah had conditioned its cessation of fire toward Israel on the termination of the IDF's military operation in Gaza. The organization has now abandoned this position, leaving Hamas alone in the fighting against IDF forces. Of the Israelis taken hostage by Hamas during the Oct. 7 massacre, 101 remain in captivity, with 35 declared dead	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/27/hamas-signals-openness-to-gaza-ceasefire-after-hezbollah-deal/	2024-11-26T23:00:05-08:00	
US guarantees on Israel's ceasefire rights to stay classified	An American side letter guaranteeing Israel's rights in case of ceasefire violations will remain classified, Israeli officials announced following a cabinet meeting, casting uncertainty over the document's effectiveness as a diplomatic safeguard. The document, secured through extensive negotiations between Minister of Strategic Affairs of Israel Ron Dermer and the US administration, had been touted by the Prime Minister's Office as a major diplomatic achievement that would guarantee Israel's right to resume military operations if the agreement was breached. Cabinet ministers who reviewed the letter during the session described it as comprehensive, covering various scenarios of potential violations. However, Israeli officials have now indicated that the letter, obtained during President Biden's current term, will remain sealed, raising questions about its practical enforceability.

A notable example was the letter from President George W. Bush that accompanied Israel's 2005 Gaza withdrawal. In a televised address Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu first spoke to residents of northern Israel: 'This war will not conclude until all our objectives are met, and at this stage, specifically not until we can ensure the safe return of northern residents to their homes.' Video: Netanyahu on the ceasefire deal / Credit: Itay Beit On 'Until now, thanks to the valor of our fighters, we have achieved remarkable successes across all seven fronts of this war of resurgence. These achievements demonstrate Israel's power throughout the Middle East, and directly to Iran, which stands at the head of this network. I am resolved to take all necessary steps to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.' Addressing the hostage situation, Netanyahu declared: 'In Gaza, we have dismantled Hamas's battalions, eliminated Sinwar, Deif, and their leadership echelon, and secured the return of 154 of our hostages. We remain committed to bringing everyone home and ending their families' unbearable suffering, just as we are committed to completing Hamas's elimination. In Syria, we are systematically preventing weapons transfers to Lebanon. Assad needs to understand – he is playing a dangerous game.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/27/us-guarantees-on-israels-ceasefire-rights-to-stay-classified/	2024-11-26T20:00:18-08:00	
UNRWA announces closure of east Jerusalem headquarters	UNRWA has announced the closure of its East Jerusalem headquarters, following recent Israeli legislation severing ties with the organization. Palestinian employees have been notified that their positions at the Sheikh Jarrah (Shimon HaTzadik) facility will be terminated. According to reports published by Saudi news network AlHadath, employees have been given a 12-month grace period to find new employment, after which their contracts with the United Nations organization will be terminated. UNRWA's presidential office in Sheikh Jarrah houses the organization's legal department, which oversees the agency's legal matters across all areas of operation. The facility also includes the agency's spokesperson's office and its central communications department. A Palestinian woman stands outside the UNRWA Gaza Headquarters (AP/Khalil Hamra) AP/Khalil Hamra The Saudi network also reported that the agency's foreign employees will not be dismissed but instead will be reassigned to the agency's offices in Amman, Jordan. Following the revelation of UNRWA staff and institutions' involvement in acts of terror, particularly in the Oct. 7 massacre, the Knesset passed two significant laws last month to curtail the organization's activities in Jerusalem and Gaza. The first law, initiated by Knesset members Boaz Bismuth and Sharren Haskel, which passed its second and third readings, now prohibits UNRWA's operations in the Shuafat refugee camp in Jerusalem and all of the organization's activities in East Jerusalem. The second law, initiated by Knesset members Yulia Malinovsky, Dan Illouz, Ron Katz, and others, prohibits contact between Israeli government officials and UNRWA personnel. The implications: denying organization members the ability to work in Gaza, travel to it, or operate there in general.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/26/unrwa-announces-closure-of-east-jerusalem-headquarters/	2024-11-26T01:11:20-08:00	
UN advisor fired over refusal to label Gaza war as genocide, WSJ ...	An op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal editorial board titled 'The UN's anti-Israel 'genocide' purge' claims the United Nations' decision not to renew Alice Wairimu Nderitu's contract as Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide stems directly from her refusal to characterize Israel's military campaign in Gaza as genocide. 'The United Nations long ago lost credibility as a moral arbiter, but its assault on Israel is hitting a new low,' the op-ed began. The UN has decided to fire its Special Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide. Alice Wairimu Nderitu from Kenya is being forced out because she publicly said that Israel's operations in Gaza don't meet the definition of genocide. pic.twitter.com/eceOYCHryM — Visegrád 24 (@visegrad24) November 26, 2024 The editorial board quotes her UN biography, which describes her as a 'recognized voice in the field of peacebuilding and violence prevention.' She has served since 2020 and is being dismissed 'because she has stood firm in her belief that Israel's war with Hamas isn't genocide.' They note that her position has put her at odds with 'the anti-Israel cabal at the UN.' Nderitu's office previously issued guidance in 2022 stressing that UN officials should 'Adhere to the correct usage' of the term genocide, warning against 'its frequent misuse in referring to large scale, grave crimes committed against particular populations.' In defending Nderitu's position, the WSJ editorial board emphasizes the legal requirements for classifying violence as genocide. 'As a legal matter, establishing a pattern of violence as a genocide requires demonstrating intent,' they write. 'Israel's campaign of self-defense doesn't qualify. The war against Hamas has had many deaths, but Israel's strategy is intended to dismantle a terrorist regime, not eliminate an ethnic group.' The board adds that 'The Jewish state has gone to great lengths to minimize Palestinian civilian casualties, even as Hamas uses civilians as shields so their deaths can be used as propaganda.' But, 'That's not what the anti-Israel cabal at the UN want to hear.' The editorial points to mounting pressure from other UN officials, particularly Austrian Volker Turk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who the board says 'has spent the past year assailing Israel.' This culminated in a November 14 report from the UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices that supported 'serious concerns of breaches of international humanitarian and human rights laws' and 'the possibility of genocide in Gaza and an apartheid system in the West Bank.' UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk addresses media personnel in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2024 (Photo: AP /Mahmud Hossain Opu) AP 'The word has become a weapon of political propaganda that will erode its moral authority when it's needed to describe genuine horrors,' the editorial board argues. A UN spokesperson maintained that 'Alice Nderitu is leaving the UN as her contract is expiring,' adding that 'Genocide is strictly defined in international law and any legal determination' is made by 'appropriate judicial bodies.' However, the WSJ editorial board argues this explanation rings hollow, noting that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has the authority to extend such contracts, which are 'often renewed when their terms expire,' Nderitu's 'removal is a political choice.' The board characterizes Nderitu's stance as 'a profile in courage' for 'her refusal to endorse a lie in service of a political agenda,' while questioning whether 'anyone with integrity can survive at the UN.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/26/un-advisor-fired-over-refusal-to-label-gaza-war-as-genocide-wsj-argues/	2024-11-25T23:00:57-08:00	
How does Hamas keep its grip on Gaza's aid?	While fierce battles between IDF and Hamas terrorists have become routine in Gaza, a different kind of conflict has emerged within the Gaza Strip in recent weeks. The terrorist organization is now fighting crime families and mobs who dare to interfere with what has become Gaza's primary source of power and revenue – international humanitarian aid. For this battle, crucial to Hamas' survival in Gaza, the organization is willing to divert weapons and fighters, despite their severe shortage in the war against the IDF. For this purpose, Hamas established a special unit called 'Saham' (arrow in Arabic), whose formation received favorable coverage in Arab media outlets last week. According to the Palestinian news site Shahab, the Saham unit was created by Hamas' Interior Ministry, which oversees the terrorist organization's police forces. The unit consists mainly of former police officers and 'volunteers,' presumably terrorists whom the organization has pulled from combat duties. However, Gaza bloggers assert this is merely a rebranding of a force established by eliminated Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, consisting of 'thugs' from Jabalia recruited to eliminate the organization's opponents. Palestinian media sources state that the unit's mission is to 'confront merchants who inflate prices, swindlers, thugs, and armed criminal gangs.' The unit has been operating for several weeks and has reportedly killed dozens of gang members. This morning alone, two unit members were killed during a raid on a Jargoun area gang compound in Khan Younis, where the gang was trading in smuggled cigarettes. Five gang members were killed in the raid, with footage of the confrontation spreading across social media. Hamas terrorists ride on top of a humanitarian aid truck in Rafah, Gaza Strip, Dec. 19, 2023. Photo credit: AP AP Saham unit operatives employ all the terrorist organization's characteristic methods. They move in civilian clothes to avoid IDF detection, wearing masks. Unit members have been documented executing civilians, beating them with iron rods, and even firing RPG rockets at smugglers' vehicles. For many Gaza residents suffering from dramatic price increases, the unit's actions serve as a release valve for anger and helplessness, but for many others, it represents outright terror. The attention given to the Saham unit also underscores the central struggle for control over Gaza – it appears that even Hamas recognizes that whoever controls the flow of aid to Gaza's residents will control the Gaza Strip when the fighting subsides.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/25/how-does-hamas-keep-its-grip-on-gazas-aid/	2024-11-25T03:04:36-08:00	
Khamenei: Netanyahu deserves execution	In an escalation of rhetoric, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested Sunday that the International Criminal Court in The Hague should pursue capital punishment rather than arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The remarks came during Khamenei's address to members of the Basij force, a paramilitary organization known for its role in internal security operations and suppression of domestic opposition in Iran. International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan (Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP) AFP During his speech to the assembled forces, Khamenei claimed that 'Iran's Basij will certainly succeed in destroying the Zionist regime in one day.' He continued with rhetoric against Israeli military operations, stating, 'Bombing homes in Lebanon and Gaza is not victory. They are foolish if they think that bombing homes, hospitals, and gatherings constitutes victory. No one sees this as victory.' 'What the Zionists are doing is a war crime,' Khamenei told his forces, referring to existing ICC warrants before adding, 'but that's not enough. They must issue a death sentence for Netanyahu. This criminal leader must receive a death sentence.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/25/khamenei-netanyahu-deserves-execution-not-mere-arrest-warrant/	2024-11-24T22:30:45-08:00	
Body of missing Chabad rabbi found in UAE	UAE authorities confirmed Sunday the death of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a Chabad-Lubavitch emissary whose disappearance last week sparked international concern. Kogan, who also held Moldovan citizenship, had not been heard from since Thursday, when all contact with him ceased.

The rabbi's family in Israel has also been notified. I mourn with sorrow and outrage the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan.

The unrest coincided with the arrival of roughly 300 NATO delegates in Montreal for a high-level summit focused on Ukraine, climate change, and the alliance's future, running from Nov. 22-25. The protest also aligned with the second day of widespread student pro-Palestinian demonstrations across the city, according to the Montreal Gazette.

Report: Iran-West nuclear talks to resume in Geneva	Kyodo News, Japan's leading news agency, reported Sunday that nuclear negotiations between Iran and Western powers are set to resume next month, as the eighth round of talks between the two sides has been on hold for more than 3 years. According to the Japanese news outlet, Iranian officials are expected to meet with representatives from Britain, France, and Germany in Geneva, Switzerland.

Chabad emissary missing in UAE, Israel suspects Iranian involveme...	Rabbi Tzvi Kogen, the Chabad emissary in Abu Dhabi, has been missing since last Thursday, with no communication since then. Over recent days, as the investigation into his disappearance intensifies, concerns are growing that he may have been kidnapped or killed. Reports suggest that hostile elements might be related, and Iranian involvement is also under investigation. Israeli authorities are investigating potential connections between Kogen's disappearance and terrorist organizations. His family alerted security officials that he had not been in contact for several days, prompting the immediate launch of a joint investigation with the Mossad and UAE security forces. Rabbi Tzvi Kogen. Photo: Screenshot from Chabad's Facebook page The Mossad has stated that Tzvi Kogen has been missing since Thursday afternoon and, following his disappearance and in light of information suggesting a terrorist act, an intensive investigation has begun. A Level 3 travel warning (medium threat) has also been issued for the UAE, advising against non-essential travel to the country from Israel. In recent days, as multiple parties work to uncover leads in the Chabad emissary's disappearance, fears have surfaced that hostile elements had been monitoring him before he vanished. The possibility that this was a nationalist-motivated attack is now being closely examined, with the investigation focusing on this scenario.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/20/chabad-emissary-missing-in-uae-israel-suspects-iranian-involvement/	2024-11-20T08:13:27-08:00	
US vetoes Gaza ceasefire proposal at UN	The US exercised its veto power against a United Nations Security Council resolution demanding a ceasefire in Gaza, a diplomatic source revealed Wednesday, pointing to the proposal's failure to incorporate provisions for the release of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Video: Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon thanks the US for vetoing the Security Council's Gaza ceasefire proposal.

The Trump effect? Turkey pitches Gaza hostage talks	Turkey has launched a fresh diplomatic initiative to broker the release of Israeli hostages held by the Hamas terror group, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported, marking a potential shift in regional dynamics amid speculation about former President Trump's influence on Middle Eastern politics. According to a high-ranking Hamas source, Turkish authorities extended an invitation to the Israeli government to resume negotiations that could potentially lead to the conclusion of the Gaza war and the return of the 101 Israelis that have been held hostage in Gaza for over a year. The source indicated that Ankara has positioned itself to facilitate direct communications with Hamas leadership. The official, however, stated that Prime Minister Benjamin 'Netanyahu derailed the Turkish initiative in its early stages by rejecting both Turkish mediation and Ankara's role as an intermediary in the Gaza situation.' Israelis rallying for the release of the hostages held by the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip (Gideon Markowicz) Gideon Markowicz The report said that Shin Bet security agency director, Ronen Bar, conducted an undisclosed visit to Turkey on Saturday, meeting with Turkey's intelligence director to discuss the status of hostages in Gaza. According to Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, Bar's presence at the meeting was primarily to evaluate the Turkish proposal. Sources indicated that the diplomatic engagement followed patterns similar to Israel's approach since the conflict's onset, characterized as 'delaying tactics to gain time' and utilizing the initiative to address domestic pressure within Israel. A senior Israeli diplomatic official told Israel Hayom that Netanyahu had authorized Ronen's Turkey visit to explore potential hostage release arrangements and discuss bilateral relations. The visit's timing comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House with his pro-Israel team. The Turkish diplomatic overture indicates a significant shift in President Erdogan's position, reflecting an understanding of potential changes in Washington's diplomatic stance. While Turkey continues to serve as a base for senior Hamas officials, Israel is exploring this new channel for hostage recovery, parallel to existing mediation efforts.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/20/the-trump-effect-turkey-steps-forward-with-gaza-hostage-initiative/	2024-11-20T00:50:45-08:00	
Security Council to vote on Gaza ceasefire as US stance unclear	The United Nations Security Council will convene Wednesday to vote on a resolution for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The initiative, spearheaded by the council's ten non-permanent members and formally introduced by the Guyananese delegation, comes after days of intensive diplomatic efforts to craft language that might avert a US veto. Washington's stance on the measure remains uncertain. The United Nations Security Council (Johannes Eisele/AFP) Johannes Eisele/AFP Previously, in June, the United States successfully shepherded through the Security Council a resolution that called for both a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages. While Security Council resolutions currently serve as declarations without immediate enforcement power over Israel, the council retains the authority to implement various measures, including the potential imposition of sanctions. The current Gaza war broke out on Oct. 7, when Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel, killing over 1,000 Israelis and taking over 250 kidnapped. As of Nov. 20, 101 Israelis remain held hostage in Gaza, 35 of whom have been declared dead.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/20/security-council-to-vote-on-gaza-ceasefire-as-us-stance-remains-uncertain/	2024-11-19T22:25:42-08:00	
IDF warns of 'Sabra and Shatila scenario' in debate over US-manag...	A crucial meeting convened yesterday (Monday) by Defense Minister Israel Katz with top IDF brass focused on overhauling humanitarian aid distribution methods in Gaza to circumvent Hamas control. The discussions centered on a controversial proposal to allow a US private security firm to manage civilian affairs and aid distribution in designated Gaza neighborhoods, with the IDF maintaining only peripheral security operations. The high-level gathering included IDF Operations Chief Major General Oded Basyuk, Strategy and Third-Circle Directorate Head Major General Eliezer Toledano, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, and additional military officials. The senior command presented a comprehensive analysis of the plan's merits and potential pitfalls, highlighting several critical concerns. In a particularly pointed intervention, Major General Toledano issued a stark warning, invoking the specter of a 'Sabra and Shatila' scenario. He cautioned that any civilian casualties caused by the private company's operations in Gaza neighborhoods could be attributed to the IDF, given its presence in the area, potentially triggering international backlash. Displaced Palestinians make their way as they flee Hamad City following an Israeli evacuation order, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on August 11, 2024. Photo credit: Reuters/Hatem Khaled REUTERS The historical parallel references the aftermath of the First Lebanon War, when Christian forces, operating under IDF security perimeter, entered the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. While their stated mission targeted PLO fighters, the operation resulted in civilian casualties, leading to widespread international condemnation of Israel as the overseeing force. Defense Minister Katz pushed back against these comparisons, emphasizing the fundamental difference between a professional American security company and the historical events involving Christian factions at Sabra and Shatila, dismissing any parallel between the two scenarios. The concerns voiced by Toledano resonated with other participants, including the head of the International Law Department in the Military Advocate General's Corps, who shared similar reservations about introducing a US private security company into the humanitarian aid operation. Earlier reporting revealed an additional legal complexity: if Israel finances the American company's civilian operations in Gaza neighborhoods, international law could view it as an extension of Israeli authority. To navigate this challenge, officials are exploring alternative funding through foreign nations or international aid organizations. Member of the Security Cabinet, Minister of National Missions Orit Strock offered a stark assessment: 'Each day that humanitarian aid continues to sustain Hamas represents another cycle of self-defeating actions that undermine our war objectives, endanger our soldiers, and compromise our hostages. This paradox cannot continue.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/19/idf-warns-of-sabra-and-shatila-scenario-in-debate-over-us-managed-gaza-aid/	2024-11-19T10:07:13-08:00	
Former Hamas hostage confronts UCLA protest leader in campus deba...	A survivor of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack in Israel delivered powerful testimony about her 54 days in captivity as she faced off with a student protest leader at a campus debate in Southern California. The confrontation, captured in a video segment released Monday by The Gr8 Debate and filmed by Trusted Confidential Coverage (TCC), brought together former hostage Moran Stella Yanai, UCLA encampment leader Aidan Doyle, and Mosab Hassan Yousef, son of Hamas co-founder Sheikh Hassan Yousef. Released hostage Moran Stella Yanai stands up to UCLA Encampment leader Aidan Doyle, who glorified October 7 Massacre.

Doyle, who had previously expressed support for the Oct. 7 attack, avoided eye contact throughout much of Yanai's testimony. 'We went to dance. We didn't attack,' Yanai said of the festival, as Doyle shook his head. 'Don't get annoyed. I'm really asking you as a person, do you support those actions? If you didn't support those actions and October 7th didn't happen, would we sit here, talking right now?' Doyle replied: 'Well yeah, actually, we probably would be.' Yanai described how her ordeal began when she broke her leg while trying to escape through the desert near Mount Negev. She recounted the horror of being taken into Gaza, where she witnessed civilians celebrating her capture despite her visible injuries. 'When I was entering Gaza I saw 100 percent of civilians celebrating me being taken,' she said, describing her broken leg and extensive bruising. 'I didn't know about the other hostages, I thought it was only me.' Her family learned of her kidnapping through a viral TikTok video discovered by her 12-year-old niece, which showed Yanai pleading for her life as her captors shouted in the background. During her 54-day captivity, Yanai was moved between seven heavily guarded locations where she faced constant surveillance, limited access to food and water, and needed permission to use bathroom facilities. She revealed that her captors told her they 'planned to move on and kill as much as they could and slaughter everybody,' unaware that 3,000 people were present at the festival. Nearly 400 festival attendees were killed in the attack. they brought a hostage to a debate — Aidan Doyle (@aidandoyleee) November 18, 2024 Yanai was released last November as part of a hostage exchange agreement. Despite the trauma she endured, she emphasized her desire for dialogue and understanding, telling Doyle, 'I really want to hear your side, that's my agenda, of co-existing.' Currently, 101 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza. Following the debate, Doyle took to X (formerly known as Twitter) dismissively commenting on Yanai's presence, writing 'They brought a hostage to a debate.' Hassan Yousef later offered a scathing critique of Doyle's performance, saying mockingly, 'He came really prepared. He memorized the narrative, even perfected it more than those who had been claiming it for 70 years. He knows a lot more than Yasser Arafat on Palestine.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/19/former-hamas-hostage-confronts-ucla-protest-leader-in-campus-debate/	2024-11-19T06:00:25-08:00	
Legal snag blocks US firm from handling Gaza aid	Israeli defense and political leadership are evaluating a proposal to deploy an American security company in the Gaza Strip to oversee humanitarian aid distribution, with a specific focus on preventing the Hamas terror organization from seizing the supplies. The northern Gaza neighborhood of Al Atatra has been designated as the potential pilot site for this initiative. However, according to information obtained by Israel Hayom, the proposal has yet to reach the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet for approval, facing significant legal hurdles. The primary obstacle stems from international law's definition of 'occupation,' as the American company would effectively function as an Israeli proxy, operating under Israeli authority. Palestinians carry bags of flour they grabbed from an aid truck near an Israeli checkpoint in Gaza City, Feb. 19, 2024 (Reuters/Kosay Al Nemer) Reuters/Kosay Al Nemer Defense officials are exploring alternative funding mechanisms to address these legal challenges, including potential financial support from international aid organizations or foreign nations for the American security company's operations, which are projected to cost tens of millions of dollars. In related developments, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disclosed Monday during a closed-door session of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that he has instructed the IDF to present a comprehensive plan by Thursday to prevent Hamas from intercepting humanitarian aid in Gaza. Addressing the same issue, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told Army Radio that 'the IDF's failure to assume responsibility for humanitarian aid distribution represents one of the significant shortcomings in this war.' The ongoing efforts to establish a secure aid distribution mechanism reflect the broader challenges of ensuring humanitarian assistance reaches Gaza's civilian population while preventing its diversion by Hamas.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/19/legal-snag-blocks-us-firm-from-handling-gaza-aid/	2024-11-19T02:00:34-08:00

WATCH: Noa Argamani surprises young survivor on birthday	The sound of laughter echoed through the home of former hostage Emily Hand's home on Sunday as fellow survivors of Hamas captivity Noa Argamani and Hila Rotem Shoshani arrived bearing gifts, traditional Moroccan doughnuts, and birthday candles to celebrate the young girl's 10th birthday. Life in Kibbutz Be'eri had already dealt Emily significant challenges before the Oct. 7 attack. After losing her mother to cancer as a toddler, she found maternal love through her father's former wife Narkis Hand, who raised her as her own until tragedy struck again. Narkis was among those killed in the massacre, her life cut short at age 54. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Free Our Kids il (@freeourkids_il) That fateful morning, Emily was enjoying a sleepover at her friend Hila's house, unaware that their world was about to change forever. Both girls were taken captive and held in Gaza for approximately two months before being freed together in a hostage exchange agreement. Now, almost a year after their release, Hila returned to Emily's life once more, this time accompanied by Noa, to transform a regular Sunday into a celebration of life and friendship. As Emily blew out her birthday candles, surrounded by those who shared her extraordinary journey, the moment served as a powerful reminder of survival and hope. The young girl, who holds dual Irish-Israeli citizenship, continues to rebuild her life in Israel alongside her 65-year-old father Thomas.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/19/watch-noa-argamani-surprises-young-survivor-on-birthday/	2024-11-18T23:28:19-08:00	
Families of American Oct. 7 victims file lawsuit against Iran	The families of American victims who were murdered in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, along with families of American-Israeli soldiers killed during subsequent military operations in Gaza, have filed a lawsuit against Iran in a US federal court. According to The New York Times, the lawsuit accuses Tehran of providing crucial support for what the plaintiffs describe as the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust, including direct funding for what Hamas leaders internally called 'the big project.' The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in Washington, outlines Iran's extensive financing network supporting Hamas and details Tehran's backing of other terror organizations committed to Israel's destruction. The case builds its foundation, in part, on recently captured Hamas documents discovered in Gaza and subsequently published in media reports. The plaintiffs' legal team has secured original documents revealing a crucial December 2022 clandestine planning meeting of Hamas' political and military leadership. During this high-level gathering, Yahya Sinwar, then Hamas' Gaza chief, sought an additional $7 million in monthly funding from Iran's Revolutionary Guards to finance what would become the Oct. 7 attack, cryptically referred to in documents as 'the big project.' Families gather at the White House to advocate for their relatives held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. Photo credit: AFP AFP According to The New York Times, the lawsuit highlights the Revolutionary Guards' critical role in orchestrating coordination between Hamas and Hezbollah during attack preparations. All organizations named in the lawsuit – Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the US. The Oct. 7 attack claimed the lives of 46 Americans, including children. Hamas took approximately 250 people hostage, among them 12 Americans. While seven Americans remain in Gaza, three have been declared dead. The legal action also encompasses Americans killed in combat operations in Gaza or along Israel's northern front. More than 30 American-Israeli citizens lost their lives while serving in the IDF. Among those fallen was Moshe Leiter, 39, a reservist serving in an elite naval unit. His father, Dr. Yechiel Leiter, is slated to become Israel's ambassador to the US next year. The American casualties included Danielle Waldman, 24, a Palo Alto, California native. She and her boyfriend were among at least 360 people killed at the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023. Evidence suggests she was ambushed in her vehicle, later found with multiple bullet holes and bearing bloodstains. According to The New York Times, the plaintiffs seek damages under both the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and the PATRIOT Act. The case is being pursued by a team of prominent attorneys, including Gary M. Osen, known for representing Nazi victims, and Lee Wolosky. American courts have seen numerous lawsuits against Iran by terror victims over the years. Iran consistently fails to appear in its defense, typically resulting in default judgments for the plaintiffs.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/18/families-of-american-oct-7-victims-file-lawsuit-against-iran/	2024-11-17T23:00:37-08:00	
Canada foils Iranian plot to assassinate Jewish human rights advo...	According to reporting by The Globe and Mail, Canadian law enforcement authorities recently foiled an Iranian plot to assassinate Irwin Cotler, a prominent human rights advocate and outspoken critic of Tehran's leadership. Authorities identified two suspects in the assassination plot, though their current status, whether arrested or fled, remains unclear. Cotler was informed on Thursday that the threat level against him had been significantly reduced. The Jewish 84-year-old has been under 24/7 Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) protection for over a year following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack in Israel. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) informed him he was a high-profile target of Iran. His security detail includes bulletproof vehicles, heavily armed officers and additional protective measures. Since 2008, he has spearheaded a global campaign to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. He has also represented Iranian political prisoners and strongly supports Israel. In June, following opposition party pressure, Canada joined the United States in declaring the IRGC a banned terrorist group. Ottawa cut diplomatic relations with Iran over a decade ago. Cotler served as Canada's first special envoy on Holocaust remembrance and combatting antisemitism from 2020 to 2023. He currently chairs the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights internationally. Today marks 6 months since the black sabbath of October 7th. 1200 brutally murdered, 250 taken hostage,& grave acts of torture & mass sexual violence by Hamas. 134 hostages remain in captivity. Freeing the hostages is standalone humanitarian issue, moral duty, & legal obligation pic.twitter.com/3ysPHrd7l1 — Irwin Cotler (@IrwinCotler) April 7, 2024 The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has also contacted Cotler regarding an unsealed New York indictment involving an Iranian murder-for-hire operation, the source said. While not named in the indictment, the FBI indicated to Cotler that his name emerged during their investigation. On Oct. 22, the US Justice Department charged senior IRGC official Ruhollah Bazghandi in connection with a 2022 plot to kill American human-rights activist Masih Alinejad, allegedly using Eastern European criminal organizations in New York. 'That is happening more and more with intelligence services using criminals to do work for them, and it gives them plausible deniability,' said Alan Treddenick, a former CSIS station chief in Saudi Arabia. Earlier this month, the US Justice Department charged Farhad Shakeri, described as an Iranian government operative previously imprisoned in America for robbery, in an alleged IRGC-ordered plot to kill Donald Trump and Alinejad. Shakeri remains at large in Iran. Two other men face charges for allegedly being recruited by Shakeri to surveil and kill Alinejad. Daniel Stanton, former CSIS senior manager and current director of the national-security program at the University of Ottawa Professional Development Institute, who recently hosted Alinejad, said Iran targets high-profile critics like Cotler and Alinejad as a warning to others. 'Regimes like Iran and also India want to hit the most high-profile, outspoken critics and dissidents because that sends a message to the people who don't have that status to basically shut up,' Stanton said. 'A lot of these intelligence agencies find it difficult to operate in countries like Canada and the United States, so they have to hire unscrupulous proxies to carry out the dirty work and that is easy to detect.' Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, with Minister of Foreign Affairs Melanie Joly, and Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions, and Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic LeBlanc, takes part in a press conference about the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's investigation into 'violent criminal activity in Canada with connections to India,' on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, October 14, 2024 (Photo: Reuters/Blair Gable) REUTERS Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei called the allegations a 'repulsive' plot by Israel and Iranian dissidents to 'complicate matters between America and Iran.' US authorities say the IRGC's elite Quds Force has historically targeted critics and recently began outsourcing assassination plots to organized crime groups and violent criminals. Iran's Quds Force operates as a clandestine wing of the IRGC, responsible for foreign operations, including arming Hezbollah and Hamas and conducting assassinations. Victims of Oct 7 sexual violence deserve recognition, justice & accountability- not gaslighting, silence, and denial. This is not a political issue; it's about human rights.

He warned that authoritarian regimes are waging a war against Western countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and many of those in Europe 'through three primary methods – electoral interference, transnational repression, and the spreading of harmful disinformation.' In 2015, Cotler founded the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, a Montreal-based organization dedicated to promoting human rights, advocating for political prisoners, and combatting injustice around the world. The group works in memory of Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved 100,000 Jews during the Second World War by issuing them diplomatic passports and sheltering them in safe houses.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/18/canada-foils-iranian-plot-to-assassinate-jewish-human-rights-advocate/	2024-11-17T23:00:02-08:00
