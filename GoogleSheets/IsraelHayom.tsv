Israeli security forces on high alert amid concerns of Hamas atta...	Israel's defense and security apparatus is preparing for potential Hamas attacks from Gaza that could break the ceasefire. Military preparations are clearly visible, with forces being reinforced along the Gaza border region and planned tree-planting events in celebration of the holiday of Tu B'Shevat in border communities being canceled. A senior security source told Israel Hayom this morning: 'We're not playing 'chicken,' but preparing with utmost seriousness for threats and returning to combat according to political directives. Hamas created the current crisis with various pretexts of Israeli violations that never existed. We're preparing for all scenarios.' Israel expects the deal to continue while preparing for renewed warfare, this time without restraints: An Israeli source familiar with Cabinet discussions said Israel has support from President Donald Trump to resume fighting if Hamas doesn't uphold the agreement. According to the source, this time the war will look different, similar to the first months after Oct. 7, with renewed weapons shipments, no commitment to humanitarian aid, and complete American backing in the UN Security Council. During the cabinet discussion, ministers expressed complete support for Trump's statement regarding the equation on the table – return of hostages or renewed warfare as soon as this Saturday.

An Israeli source said Israel wants to receive more than three hostages this Saturday and insists all releases must occur by Saturday at 12 p.m. If and when phase two talks resume, Israel maintains that ending the war can only include one possible outcome: release of all hostages and Hamas no longer remaining as a governing or military force in Gaza. The cabinet will shape this mandate after Hamas signals it's ready to return to implementing the agreement. Additionally, the Defense Minister warns entities against smuggling in humanitarian aid to Gaza: 'Those found involved in smuggling may be included in economic sanctions lists and subject to strict financial restrictions.' An Israeli Air Force aircraft earlier today struck a drone and two suspects in southern Gaza, according to an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson. The military noted the drone was identified crossing from Israel to southern Gaza and was tracked until the strike. They added that several recent attempts to smuggle weapons into Gaza using drones have been identified. Earlier, Arab networks reported that an IDF drone struck east of Rafah, resulting in one death and one injury. According to assessments, these were two operatives attempting to launch a drone. Meanwhile, Al-Arabiya reported that the IDF continues strikes in the al-Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah, and that 'the Israeli military is destroying residential buildings' in the area.

Study finds Hamas starved hostages despite ample Gaza aid	An Israeli study analyzing food quantities entering Gaza as humanitarian aid has found that sufficient amounts of diverse food with adequate caloric content were delivered during most months of the war. The food met most international humanitarian standards, despite complex challenges on the ground. This underscores that Gaza had no food shortage, highlighting that hostages are being deliberately starved. The research, published in the scientific journal of the 'Israel National Institute For Health Policy Research,' examined aid volume from January 2024, approximately two months after the ground operation began, until July 2024. Senior officials from the Ministry of Health, Ben-Gurion University, Hebrew University, and the University of Haifa conducted the study. Additionally, researchers analyzed data from the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories regarding all food shipments transferred to Gaza through land crossings and airdrops. The findings show that during the examined period, approximately 478,229 tons of food were transferred to Gaza, after adjusting for expected food loss. Consequently, each Gaza resident received an average supply of about 3,000 calories per day. Protein quantity stood at 98 grams daily (13% of total energy), fat consumption reached 61 grams daily (18% of total energy), and iron supply was 23 mg per day. The study also found that food transferred to Gaza contained all nutritional components, except iron, in quantities exceeding the World Health Organization's standard for minimum food requirements for populations in crisis. Additionally, a consistent upward trend was observed in food quantities transferred to Gaza, except for a decrease in February compared to January.

Photo credit: Bashar Taleb/AFP 'Claims are incorrect' However, researchers emphasize they lack reliable data regarding actual food accessibility to residents and its consumption on the ground. 'The data shows that sufficient quantities of nutritious food were transferred to Gaza during most of the first half of 2024,' the researchers noted. 'However, increased cooperation between all involved parties is needed to overcome barriers and improve communication and information sharing.' The research provides a comprehensive snapshot of the food supply to Gaza during the examined period, emphasizing the importance of continued monitoring and assessment of the nutritional situation in the region. The findings may assist in better planning future humanitarian aid efforts. Professor Ronit Endevelt, nutritionist at the University of Haifa School of Public Health and former director of the Ministry of Health's Nutrition Department, who co-authored the study, stated: 'In most months when humanitarian aid was transferred, the quantity and quality of food entering was reasonable to good, meaning if the population didn't receive food, it's because distribution wasn't equitable by those controlling the territory, meaning Hamas. Hamas terrorists ride on top of a humanitarian aid truck in Rafah, Gaza Strip, Dec. 19, 2023. Photo credit: AP 'Claims echoing worldwide about insufficient food in Gaza are incorrect. Hamas had the ability to adequately feed the hostages yet consciously chose to starve them. This is beyond other shocking physical and mental torture, such as various restraints, lack of exposure to sunlight and daylight, inability to move – causing life-threatening malnutrition, damage to skeletal systems, immune system, hormonal system, and internal organs to the point of death risk. 'Israel, unlike other nations at war that don't feed the enemy, didn't prevent humanitarian aid to the civilian population,' Endevelt emphasized. 'Ultimately, Hamas seized control of much aid, profited from it, and thus accumulated funding for activities.'

Released hostages confirm Matan Angrest still alive in Gaza	In a significant development offering both hope and heartache, the family of captured Israel Defense Forces soldier Matan Angrest has received confirmation their son remains alive, through testimonies from recently released hostages who shared captivity with him. This crucial update comes approximately 500 days after Angrest was taken from his tank position at Kibbutz Nahal-Oz. The first tangible proof of Angrest's survival emerged in September 2024, when an audio recording was played during a gathering at the Hostages Square. In the recording, Angrest made a direct, emotional appeal to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pleading for rescue from captivity. His mother, Anat Angrest, speaking on Channel 12, revealed that recent testimonies from released hostages have provided crucial confirmation of her son's survival. 'We are living in constant anxiety over the government's handling of this situation,' she said. 'While we have received confirmation that Matan is alive, he is being held in extremely harsh conditions. We know he was captured while serving in his IDF uniform.' She specifically referenced testimony from Or Levy, another hostage, describing the captors' emphasis on Levy's military status and the severe interrogations he endured. Anat Angrest, mother of Matan Angrest, who is being held hostage in Gaza (Photo: Yehoshua Yosef) 'My son's name appeared on the humanitarian list of wounded Israelis,' Anat Angrest explained, 'despite the prime minister's assertion that wounds aren't categorized. My son was wounded while defending our tank position at the border. He was unconscious when captured while protecting our nation's borders.' The mother voiced increasing frustration with the government's response: 'The state isn't even discussing how or when they will bring him home. Every mother in Israel needs to understand the reality of our situation. We know he suffered severe injuries, emerged from the tank with burns, and endured harsh interrogations. We've seen evidence of this on his face in footage we haven't yet released. We remain uncertain about the long-term implications of his injuries or whether they can be fully treated. Israel effectively abandoned him there from the moment of his capture. Please, just bring my child home.' In the September 2024 proof of life video, Matan Angrest addressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a direct appeal: 'Netanyahu, I desperately want to see my family and friends. This is crucial. I believe you're capable of this – you just need to want it. I trust you. You can do this, and I hope it happens soon.' Following the release of that first proof of life, Anat Angrest shared the painful experience of seeing her son: 'I received proof that Matan is alive through a video found by IDF forces in Gaza. In it, he says, 'Netanyahu, I don't understand how this happened, but I trust you to get me out of here.'' She concluded with words that cut to the heart of her family's ongoing nightmare: 'How disappointing that the prime minister hasn't extracted you yet, that you weren't discussed in the first phase of releases and aren't being discussed in the next. You're not a child, not a woman, not elderly, not chronically ill – just a soldier who fought, who was willing to sacrifice himself, and now you remain there, in tunnels in darkness, wounded and bleeding, who knows if surviving.'

Eldest Hamas hostage confirmed killed on Oct. 7	Shlomo Mantzur, 86, the eldest hostage in Hamas captivity, was expected to be released in the first phase of the hostage deal. However, the Israeli Defense Forces declared today that he was murdered on Oct. 7, 2023, and his body has been held by Hamas in Gaza ever since. 'With heavy hearts, we received the news this morning of the murder of our dear friend, Shlomo Mantzur, aged 86, who was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Kisufim during the Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023,' the kibbutz statement read. The Mantzur family stated: 'We received the devastating news from IDF representatives about the murder of our beloved and cherished Shlomo. He was the cornerstone of our entire family. A man of high moral values and principles, a humanitarian who always helped others wholeheartedly. We call on decision-makers to make a brave and principled decision to bring all hostages home immediately – the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for proper burial in their homeland.' The Oct. 7 kidnapping Shlomo Mantzur would have celebrated his 87th birthday this March. For over 70 years, Mantzur lived in Kibbutz Kisufim in southern Israel. It was his home, his safe haven – but on that Saturday, he was abducted from his house as his wife Mazal watched him being dragged away by terrorists.

Photo credit: Courtesy of Bring Them Home Now via REUTERS Hamas terrorists bound him, beat him, and took him by car to Gaza. The terrorists who infiltrated Kibbutz Kisufim murdered at least 12 of his fellow kibbutz members and six Thai workers. On his previous birthday, his nieces Naama and Hadar Cohen said: 'Close your eyes and imagine your grandfather sitting in Hamas tunnels, freezing with only an undershirt on his body, eating a quarter of a pita bread per day, thinking he's been forgotten. Our hearts break and there are no words to describe it.' The mustache that became his trademark, and the grandchildren who waited for grandpa Shlomo and Mazal have five children and 12 grandchildren. Relatives described him as a peace-loving man, caring, sensitive, honest, and kindhearted. His mustache became one of his trademarks, and a family member summed it up: 'I love and miss the tickling kiss with the mustache. I appeal to the world – help us bring back Shlomo and all the hostages with him.' Last Hanukkah, his family and community lit candles in a menorah he had built years ago. His daughter Batya said: 'We haven't celebrated holidays for a long time; for us, there are no holidays. But Hanukkah is a holiday of miracles, wishes, and prayers, so we observe the holiday's commandments hoping our wishes might come true. Hanukkah is a holiday of miracles, but I expect decision-makers not to wait for miracles.' Sister of Israeli hostage Shlomo Mantzur at the Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, Israel, on February 1, 2025. Photo credit: Gideon Markowicz Speaking about attempting to rebuild their lives, she shared: 'Since Oct. 7, we've moved between several residences, trying to build new lives – but you can't build new lives without a father. We're in a state of waiting.' The horrors he experienced as a child and the demand to embrace him again As a child, Shlomo Mantzur survived the Farhud riots in Iraq. His niece previously recounted: 'He witnessed with his own eyes the abuse of Muslim rioters against his family and acquaintances. Horrors that the mind refuses to process and the hand refuses to write. He immigrated to Israel convinced that no harm would come to him. He initially lived in a shack, and at age 15 arrived at Kibbutz Kisufim, believing the state would do everything to protect him.' His daughter Batya said: 'It's not real until we see it happen. There might be a bit more hope, but the fear doesn't disappear; on the contrary, it's much greater because there's also the fear of disappointment, as we've seen what happened before. Dad should have been home long ago.'

Trump to Jordan, Egypt: Back Gaza plan or lose aid	President Donald Trump escalated diplomatic tensions Tuesday by suggesting he might cut US aid to Jordan and Egypt if they reject his proposed Gaza development strategy, ABC News reported. Trump hosted Jordan's King Abdullah at the White House – marking the first visit by an Arab leader since Trump returned to office last month. When asked about securing the king's support for his Palestinian plan, Trump called Abdullah 'a good man.' The president's ambitious proposal envisions relocating close to 2 million Palestinians from Gaza to create what he describes as 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' Despite Jordan already hosting millions of registered Palestinian refugees, the Jordanian royal court stated on X: 'His Majesty King Abdullah II stresses the need to put a stop to settlement expansion, expressing rejection of any attempts to annex land and displace the Palestinians.'

'If they don't agree, I would conceivably withhold aid,' Trump told reporters Monday night. When asked if Palestinians could return after reconstruction, Trump answered in a Fox News interview aired Monday, 'No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing. I'm talking about building a permanent place for them.' Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to visit Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia this week. During recent Central America meetings, Rubio suggested Gazans would need alternative housing 'in the interim' when questioned about their return.

Uncertainty over Gaza pushs many back to displacement camps	The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center estimates that uncertainty regarding the duration of Gaza's reconstruction, particularly in the northern part of the Strip, is expected to increase frustration among residents. Many are likely to return to displacement camps in the southern part of the Strip, where basic infrastructure for survival exists and humanitarian aid is consistently supplied. The research center noted that in light of President Donald Trump's proposal to make Gaza's residents leave, either temporarily or permanently, the devastation may prompt young Gazans to consider leaving for foreign countries in the hope of building a better future. The report's authors assessed that Hamas will attempt to suppress critical voices by force. However, given the widespread public frustration and the extensive destruction in Gaza, it will be difficult for the terrorist organization to maintain its 'victory' narrative without presenting concrete solutions for residents. Hamas may try to shift responsibility to another entity, such as the Gaza governance committee that Egypt is working to promote, while striving to preserve its military power. The report also provided data on movement toward northern Gaza. According to monitoring of movement from southern to northern Gaza, 545,355 people crossed the Netzarim Corridor between January 30 and February 3, 2025. Of those, 62% moved independently, while 38% were families. Among the returnees, 66% headed to northern Gaza, while 34% went to Gaza City. Additionally, 36,620 people crossed southward through the Netzarim Corridor between January 27 and February 3, 2025, according to data from ReliefWeb. Gaza. Photo: Reuters The report highlighted testimonies from Palestinians who returned to northern Gaza and vowed never to leave again. One such case was Wasim Al-Za'im, who was interviewed by the Palestinian newspaper Al-Ayyam. He expressed deep regret for having fled northern Gaza at the start of the war, saying he would never repeat the experience, even if it meant facing death for himself and his family. He described his displacement as a bitter ordeal he would never forget. According to him, those who remained in their homes ultimately fared no worse than those who were displaced. Another testimony came from Samiha Saad, who, after returning to her home in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood of Gaza City, described the experience as so harrowing that she vowed never to go through it again, regardless of circumstances. 'Death here is a million times better than a life of displacement,' she stated. Despite the relief felt by many Palestinians upon returning home, the reality of widespread destruction quickly led to frustration, anger, and despair. The report stressed that many residents who initially returned to northern Gaza soon moved south again after realizing they had no homes to return to. Journalist Hossam Sha'at described the dire situation: 'People returned to ruins without tents, without drinking water… They are trying to rebuild their lives, gathering scraps of fabric and wood, perhaps from what remains of their homes. They walk hundreds of meters in search of water or food, sleep in the open, and spread out on the ground under the sky. As for those whose homes are still partially standing, they are trying to repair them as best they can to live among the rubble.' A Palestinian youth was documented holding a small child he had adopted after the child's parents were not found. The young man, a resident of Jabaliya, had returned to northern Gaza after staying in a school in Rafah. 'What is there for us in the north? Why return? Our homes are destroyed. We don't even have tents there,' he lamented. The report also included criticism from Palestinians against Hamas, though it emphasized that such sentiments are not widespread due to fear of the terrorist organization. Dr. 'Az al-Din Shahin, a physician from Gaza, commented: 'The supply of water to all northern areas depends on clearing the rubble from the roads and reopening them, as well as bringing in heavy equipment to restore water lines, at least at a minimal level. No one is even talking about the importance of this issue, because, of course, images of prisoner [hostage] releases are far more compelling than discussing the disasters we are living through.'

1700 physicians warn of imminent danger to remaining hostages	Within just 12 hours, 1,700 doctors and healthcare professionals signed an urgent petition demanding the immediate release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, following the alarming condition of the three hostages released last Saturday – Or Levy, Eli Sharabi, and Ohad Ben Ami. Israel Medical Association (IMA) Chairman Professor Zion Hagay warned Monday that 'the disturbing images we witnessed upon the release of the three hostages leave no doubt – the government must take every possible action to expedite the release of all remaining hostages, as quickly as possible.' He stated that the returned hostages endured physical and mental abuse along with starvation, and their condition indicates immediate danger to all remaining hostages' lives. 'The images we witnessed reminded us all of humanity's darkest days,' Professor Hagay said, calling on the international medical community 'to look into the eyes of Ohad, Eli, and Or and take a clear and unequivocal stance on the severe health condition of both the released hostages and the many who remain captive.' Israel Medical Association Chairman Professor Zion Hagay. Photo credit: Oren Cohen The petition, addressed to the prime minister, members of the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet, and government ministers, warns that 'we have come to the stark realization that the hostages who are still alive are no longer merely in 'harsh captivity' or difficult conditions: they are being held in life-threatening conditions.' Professor Naftali Stern, an endocrinologist and director of the Sagol Center for Epigenetics at Ichilov, who led the petition, addressed the condition of one released hostage: 'Eli Sharabi, who was a full-bodied man, is now just a skeleton. Had he remained there for another two months, what would have been left of him?' Stern, a child of Holocaust survivors, added: 'I am the son of Holocaust survivors, and if there's one message I've passed on, it's 'never again.'' Thousands of protestors react while participating in the weekly rally to released the hostages calling on the continuation of the ceasefire and hostage agreement on February 08, 2025 in Tel Aviv, Israel. Photo credit: Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images The physicians who signed the petition emphasized they were 'not naive' and understood the war's cost. 'We have experienced wars as both soldiers and doctors,' the petition states, 'but this is not the situation before us. Israel is no longer in immediate danger and has already struck its enemies decisively, even if the mission is not complete.' 'The sight of the returned hostages caused an emotional collapse and shock,' Professor Stern said. 'We are many months past the existential danger, and there is no reason and no ability to live alongside the fact that dozens of our people are being held in starvation and extermination sites. These people could simply not wake up one morning. Physically, their time has simply run out.' The petition concludes with a grave warning: 'This is not a political position but a medical outcry from doctors and health professionals. Every minute counts. We warn publicly and will warn from every possible platform: those who are still alive will not survive. Their return cannot be delayed by a day, not by an hour.'

Trump says without Iran deal US could 'bomb the hell out of it'	President Donald Trump disclosed plans Friday to broker a deal with Iran that could prevent Israeli military action, telling The New York Post in an exclusive Air Force One interview that he prefers diplomacy over force. 'I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear. I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it,' Trump said during an exclusive interview aboard Air Force One, emphasizing Tehran's desire for survival. 'They don't want to die. Nobody wants to die.' The president indicated that his diplomatic initiative could potentially prevent Israeli military action against Iran. 'If we made the deal, Israel wouldn't bomb them,' Trump told The New York Post, though he remained deliberately vague about specific details of potential negotiations. Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a campaign rally at Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan on November 5, 2024 (AFP / Kamil Krzacynski) Maintaining strategic ambiguity about his approach, Trump explained his reluctance to publicly detail his message to Tehran. 'In a way, I don't like telling you what I'm going to tell them. You know, it's not nice,' he said, suggesting that his proposal could influence Iran's current strategic calculations. The president expressed optimism about potential outcomes if Iran responds positively to his diplomatic overtures. 'I hope they decide that they're not going to do what they're currently thinking of doing. And I think they'll really be happy,' Trump said, emphasizing his commitment to finding a diplomatic solution. While outlining his preference for negotiation, Trump remained firm about his position. 'I'd tell them I'd make a deal,' he said, though he declined to specify potential terms, noting only that he wouldn't pursue military action, saying 'I won't bomb them.' Regarding the specific incentives he might offer Iran, the president maintained his strategic silence, stating only that 'I can't say that because it's too nasty,' while reiterating his preference for diplomatic engagement over military confrontation.

Saudis fume after Netanyahu's statehood joke	Saudi Arabia issued a sharp rebuke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, The National reported, rejecting his tongue-in-cheek suggestion that the kingdom could host millions of Palestinians on its territory and sparking a broader diplomatic confrontation. The Saudi Foreign Ministry condemned what it called an 'extremist, occupying mentality' after Netanyahu told Israel's Channel 14, 'The Saudis can create a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia; they have a lot of land over there,' in response to questions over the controversial US plan to relocate Gazans temporarily in order to rebuild Gaza. Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman meets US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, not pictured, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Wednesday, March 20, 2024 (AP/Evelyn Hockstein) In a strongly worded statement, the Saudi Foreign Ministry criticized what it described as ongoing Israeli actions in Gaza without directly addressing Netanyahu's specific comments about relocating Palestinians to Saudi territory. The United Arab Emirates and Egypt joined in condemning Netanyahu's proposal, according to The National. The Saudi statement emphasized that Palestinians have deep historical and legal connections to their land. 'The kingdom stresses its categorical rejection to such statements that aim to divert attention from the continuous crimes committed by the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian brothers in Gaza, including the ethnic cleansing they are subjected to,' the Saudi Foreign Ministry statement said. The ministry added that more than 160,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly children and women, have been killed or injured. 'They are not intruders or immigrants to it who can be expelled whenever the brutal Israeli occupation wishes,' the statement continued. The proposal has drawn particularly sharp criticism from within Saudi Arabia itself. Yousef bin Trad Al-Saadoun, a member of the Saudi Shura Council, responded with a pointed counter-suggestion, Middle East Eye reported. Al-Saadoun proposed that President Donald Trump should consider relocating Israelis to Alaska or 'after annexing it,' to Greenland. Writing in the Saudi newspaper Okaz, Al-Saadoun delivered a stern message about regional sovereignty. 'The Zionists and their supporters must realize well that they will not be able to lure the Saudi leadership and government into the traps of media maneuvers and false political pressures,' he wrote, according to Middle East Eye. The Shura Council member criticized what he characterized as the US approach to Middle East policy. 'The official foreign policy of the United States will seek the illegal occupation of sovereign land and the ethnic cleansing of its inhabitants, which are the Israeli approach and are considered crimes against humanity,' Al-Saadoun said in his Okaz column. He further argued that 'this plan was certainly formulated and approved by the Zionist entity, and was handed over to their ally to read from the White House podium,' Middle East Eye reported. UAE Minister of State Khalifa Shaheen Al Marar expressed full solidarity with Saudi Arabia, declaring the kingdom's sovereignty a 'red line' and rejecting any infringement on Palestinian rights. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a press conference in Jerusalem, Dec. 9, 2024 (AP/Maya Alleruzzo) Al Marar called for an end to construction in communities in Judea and Samaria, warning such activities threaten regional stability. He urged the UN Security Council to address practices that violate international law. The Saudi Foreign Ministry's comprehensive statement outlined its position in stark terms, emphasizing the broader regional implications. 'The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia appreciates the condemnation, disapproval and total rejection announced by the brotherly countries towards what Benjamin Netanyahu stated regarding the displacement of the Palestinian people from their land,' the statement read, according to The National. The ministry forcefully rejected what it characterized as attempts to shift focus from the situation in Gaza. In its statement, it emphasized that 'this extremist, occupying mentality does not understand what the Palestinian land means to the brotherly people of Palestine and their emotional, historical and legal connection to this land.' The statement took particular issue with the humanitarian impact of recent events, noting that Israeli actions had 'completely destroyed the Gaza Strip, killed and injured more than 160,000, most of them children and women, without the slightest human feeling or moral responsibility.' Addressing longer-term peace prospects, the Saudi statement pointed to specific obstacles: 'The proponents of these extremist ideas are the ones who prevented Israel from accepting peace by refusing peaceful coexistence, rejecting the peace initiatives adopted by the Arab countries.' The ministry noted these actions had affected Palestinians 'for more than 75 years, with disregard to the truth, justice, law and the values established in the United Nations Charter.' The statement concluded with a firm position on Palestinian rights, declaring they 'will remain firmly established and no one will be able to take it away from them no matter how long it takes.' It emphasized that 'lasting peace will not be achieved except by returning to the logic of reason and accepting the principle of peaceful coexistence through the two state solution.'

Military experts cast doubt on Iran's new drone carrier after spo...	Iran launched the 'Shahid Mahdavi' on Thursday, its first drone carrier vessel for the Revolutionary Guards' naval forces, as reported by Tasnim news agency in an extensive dispatch featuring images and video footage of the large ship and its aircraft complement. However, military analysts identified numerous technical inconsistencies in the presentation, casting doubt on the ship's actual operational capabilities. The footage displayed various drone models either airborne or positioned on the vessel's deck, which bears standard naval gray coloring. The carrier features a 590-foot flight deck suitable for small aircraft operations, having been converted from a commercial vessel with the addition of a flight deck. Released imagery showed three drone variants and four helicopters aboard the vessel, which Iranian authorities claim will extend their strike capabilities well beyond Iranian territorial waters. Revolutionary Guards commander General Hossein Salami stated the ship can conduct 'independent operations' without escort vessels. 'Iran poses no threat to any nation, but we will not yield to any power,' Salami declared. Yet despite the elaborate presentation and commander's bold claims, online observers quickly identified discrepancies in the released materials. 'Iran's boast about launching 24-inch radio-controlled model aircraft from a ship is inadvertently comical. The video later reveals the true scale of the Qaher drone, which is actually ten times larger than shown,' military analyst Oliver Alexander posted on X. Another observer highlighted the conspicuous lack of an arrest system on the 'drone carrier's' deck – essential equipment for landing aircraft. The absence of arrest system preparations on the aircraft themselves raises doubts about Iran's capability to conduct launch and recovery operations from the new vessel.

The footage displayed various drone models either airborne or positioned on the vessel's deck, which bears standard naval gray coloring. The carrier features a 590-foot flight deck suitable for small aircraft operations, having been converted from a commercial vessel with the addition of a flight deck. Released imagery showed three drone variants and four helicopters aboard the vessel, which Iranian authorities claim will extend their strike capabilities well beyond Iranian territorial waters. Revolutionary Guards commander General Hossein Salami stated the ship can conduct 'independent operations' without escort vessels. 'Iran poses no threat to any nation, but we will not yield to any power,' Salami declared. Yet despite the elaborate presentation and commander's bold claims, online observers quickly identified discrepancies in the released materials. 'Iran's boast about launching 24-inch radio-controlled model aircraft from a ship is inadvertently comical. The video later reveals the true scale of the Qaher drone, which is actually ten times larger than shown,' military analyst Oliver Alexander posted on X. Another observer highlighted the conspicuous lack of an arrest system on the 'drone carrier's' deck – essential equipment for landing aircraft. The absence of arrest system preparations on the aircraft themselves raises doubts about Iran's capability to conduct launch and recovery operations from the new vessel.

Among those present at the meeting was Noa Argamani, who was rescued in a daring IDF raid in the summer. 'Noa survived the unbelievable and returned by the grace of God – she is an inspiration to everyone,' Trump said, Israel Hayom reported. The meeting comes just days after Trump vowed to let Israel obtain its objectives in the ongoing war with Hamas and even said that the US would 'take over' Gaza after the Palestinians leave it so that it could be rebuilt. This has had a ripple effect around the world, with Trump doubling down on the Gazan emigration scheme on Wednesday, saying that the Israel would hand over the territory to the US after the fighting concludes.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has directed the Israel Defense Forces to develop a comprehensive plan enabling the voluntary evacuation of Gaza residents, following President Donald Trump's announcement regarding US control of the Gaza Strip. The initiative, unveiled Thursday morning, represents a significant shift in approach to the region's humanitarian challenges. 'I welcome President Trump's bold initiative,' Minister Katz declared. 'The people of Gaza should have the right to freedom of movement and migration, as is customary everywhere in the world. The plan will include exit options via land crossings, as well as special arrangements for departure by sea and air.'

'Countries such as Spain, Ireland, Norway, and others, which have falsely accused Israel over its actions in Gaza, are legally obligated to allow Gazans to enter their territory. Their hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse. Meanwhile, countries like Canada, which has a structured immigration program, have previously expressed willingness to take in residents from Gaza.'

According to administration officials versed in Middle East strategy, Trump's proposal was recently developed, maintained under strict confidentiality, and shared exclusively with his closest advisors and confidants. The broader administration remained unaware of the plan's formulation during the period leading up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit. However, the report indicates that hints of the strategic thinking behind the plan occasionally emerged. During a late summer discussion, Trump characterized the Gaza Strip as prime real estate to Netanyahu, inquiring about potential hotel development opportunities, according to a source privy to the conversation.

All that glitters: Netanyahu gifts Trump golden pager	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a symbolic golden pager to US President Donald Trump during their summit meeting at the White House in Washington, marking a significant moment in US-Israel relations. Inscribed with the words 'Press with both hands,' the pager serves as a direct reference to explosive devices that detonated when handled by Hezbollah operatives. The inscription was strategically designed to ensure maximum impact on the target. Upon receiving the gift, President Trump said it was 'a great operation.'

Israel announces withdrawal from UN human rights council	Foreign Minister Gideon Saar declared Wednesday that Israel will withdraw from the United Nations Human Rights Council, aligning with the United States' stance of non-participation in the organization. In a pointed critique, Saar characterized the council as a platform that systematically undermines Israel's diplomatic standing while failing to address genuine human rights concerns globally. Saar argued forcefully that the council serves as a mechanism for protecting human rights violators, enabling them to evade international scrutiny. He specifically condemned the body's 'obsessive focus' on demonizing Israel, the sole democratic state in the Middle East, rather than genuinely addressing worldwide human rights challenges. Israel welcomes President Trump's decision not to participate in the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). Israel joins the United States and will not participate in the UNHRC. The UNHRC has traditionally protected human rights abusers by allowing them to hide from scrutiny, and… — Gideon Sa'ar | גדעון סער (@gidonsaar) February 5, 2025 The most striking statistic Saar presented was the disproportionate number of condemnatory resolutions targeting Israel. Over 100 resolutions have been passed against the country, representing more than 20% of all council resolutions – a number that surpasses the combined total of resolutions against Iran, Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela. Moreover, Israel remains the only nation with a dedicated agenda item, which Saar views as clear evidence of institutional bias. By withdrawing from the council, Israel sends a powerful diplomatic message about its unwillingness to participate in what it considers a fundamentally prejudiced international mechanism. Saar's announcement reflects a broader strategy of challenging what Israel perceives as systemic discrimination within multilateral institutions.

Behind the Arab world's opposition to Trump plan	President Trump's remarks triggered a barrage of denunciations from Hamas. His vision, which includes massive Palestinian migration and US ownership of Gaza, directly threatens the terrorist organization's interests. Chief among them is maintaining the population as a human shield and a recruitment pool for terrorists, while continuing to control the Strip from behind the scenes, with the Palestinian Authority functioning as a puppet government. Unsurprisingly, the dramatic announcement caused considerable alarm. Hamas quickly condemned the White House statements and called for an 'emergency conference' of the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the United Nations, aiming to mount pressure against Trump's vision. Hamas understands that the Palestinians alone have limited influence over Washington, particularly under the current administration. Hamas Terrorists. Photo: EPA Yet, Hamas didn't have to work too hard. Arab states were already preparing to block the plan. This week saw a flurry of discussions among Arab leaders, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas was invited to Jordan, where he firmly rejected Trump's statements. In recent days, the veteran Saudi prince Turki al-Faisal sent Trump an especially scathing letter. The former Saudi intelligence chief leveled a series of accusations against Israel, blaming it for creating the Gaza problem during the War of Independence. As a Saudi researcher explained in an interview with Israel Hayom, the Palestinian issue has long been exploited by terrorist organizations to target Arab states themselves. This is one of the primary reasons for their strong opposition, and the war in Gaza has only reinforced it. It is no surprise, then, that the Saudi Foreign Ministry issued a harsh response to Trump's claim that Riyadh does not demand a Palestinian state as a condition for normalization with Israel. The statement asserted that Crown Prince bin Salman had repeatedly emphasized that 'Saudi Arabia will not stop working for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and that there will be no diplomatic relations with Israel without it.' It also highlighted that bin Salman has pressured countries to recognize a Palestinian state, conveying these messages to both the Trump administration and the previous Biden administration. Mohammed bin Salman in a meeting with Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Archive), Photo: Reuters Egypt, for its part, faces a constant threat from Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood. Cairo harbors no illusions about Hamas, viewing its leadership as equally responsible for Egyptian soldiers' deaths in the Sinai Peninsula as the local ISIS affiliate. That group received Hamas support from Gaza in the previous decade until a joint Egyptian-Israeli operation dismantled it. Consequently, Cairo is pushing for the Palestinian Authority to take control of Gaza, even if Hamas continues to operate behind the scenes, following the 'Hezbollah model' in Lebanon. Against this backdrop, PA Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa met with his Egyptian counterpart Mostafa Madbouly to 'advance Gaza's reconstruction.' Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdel Aty also stressed the importance of strengthening the PA and transferring control of Gaza to it. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Photo: AFP The same logic applies in Jordan. In response to Trump's remarks, lawmakers proposed a bill to 'prevent Palestinian migration to Jordan,' arguing that such a law would protect 'national unity,' affirm the kingdom's sovereignty, and reject the notion of 'Palestinians migrating to Jordan as an alternative homeland.' A casual observer might think Jordan lacks a significant Palestinian population, when in fact millions of Palestinians already reside in the kingdom. That, precisely, is why Jordan opposes any moves that might provoke unrest and destabilize the state. The current hysteria echoes the paranoia surrounding Trump's previous 'Deal of the Century' initiative, which his administration promoted during its first term. Back then, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas expressed deep concerns over the US plan to allow Israel to extend sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria. Ultimately, the main factor that derailed the move was the Abraham Accords with the UAE and Bahrain. The formal normalization between Israel and Arab states sidelined previous declarations about fundamentally reshaping the region. It is not inconceivable that the White House is once again creating a smokescreen, which may ultimately lead to a new agreement, this time with Saudi Arabia. Still, not everyone in the Arab world is alarmed by the idea. Many Palestinians in Gaza, who have long been seeking any possible means to leave, expressed significant interest. This does not apply to the entire population, but to a substantial portion. Since the war began, an estimated 200,000 Palestinians have already left Gaza. Hundreds of thousands more may seize the opportunity to build a new life far from the illusions peddled by terrorist organizations. At the same time, many others in Gaza remain steadfast in their support for Hamas and the concept of 'steadfastness' (sumud), a commitment to staying on the land. Trump's words may only deepen their resolve. Yet cracks are emerging in the so-called 'Arab consensus.' Senior Emirati commentator Amjad Taha questioned, 'Why would anyone want Palestinians to remain in a war-torn region when the world could offer them a lifeline?' He went on to suggest, 'Imagine an international initiative providing Gazans the option to relocate to temporary housing for ten years, away from destruction and danger, while Gaza is rebuilt, cleansed of Hamas terrorists, and transformed into a city of hope rather than hate, a place where children learn love and respect, rather than antisemitism and glorification of violence and abduction.'

In what senior diplomatic sources are characterizing as a watershed moment in US-Israel relations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu concluded an extensive five-hour White House meeting that sources say exceeded all expectations and carried 'profound implications for Israel's future.' Hamas terrorists secure an area in a square before handing over four Israeli hostages to a Red Cross team in Gaza City on January 25, 2025 (AFP / Omar Al-Qattaa) AFP / Omar Al-Qattaa The prime minister's visit to the White House, which took place Tuesday night, lasted five hours, beginning with President Trump personally greeting Netanyahu at the White House entrance. The two leaders proceeded to the Roosevelt Room, where the prime minister signed the guest book in the presence of both delegations. Netanyahu presented President Trump with both a gold-plated and standard pager as gifts, to which Trump responded, 'That was a tremendous operation,' referring to the sophisticated Israeli attack on Hezbollah in September, which included thousands of exploding pagers killing many of the terrorist group's operatives. Moving to the Oval Office, they delivered statements and fielded press questions before engaging in comprehensive discussions on pressing matters. The American delegation included Vice President J.D. Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and United States Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff. Secretary of State Marco Rubio joined via secure telephone line. The Israeli delegation comprised Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, National Security Council Chairman Tzachi Hanegbi, Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter, Chief of Staff Tzachi Braverman, and Netanyahu's military secretary, Major General Roman Gofman. Following these discussions, the prime minister and the president held a private one-on-one conversation. According to the diplomatic source, 'The president sent warm regards to the prime minister's wife, Sara Netanyahu, and their son Yair, recalling how impressed he was with them during dinner at Mar-a-Lago, and particularly noting Mrs. Netanyahu's influence regarding the urgency of securing the hostages' release.' The meeting concluded with a press conference, after which Trump gave Netanyahu a personal tour of the White House's second floor, including the Lincoln Bedroom. They proceeded to a two-hour dinner, characterized by its warm, friendly, and relaxed atmosphere. The president presented the prime minister with an inscribed and signed photograph of them together, reading: 'To Bibi, a great leader.' The diplomatic source emphasized that 'the relationship between Netanyahu and Trump has never been stronger or closer. Those hoping to see rifts between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu were sorely disappointed. Trump proposed brilliant solutions to challenges that have confronted Israel since its establishment. The prime minister thanked President Trump for releasing weapons that were previously withheld while Israel fought on seven fronts, as well as for his unwavering support of Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu.' The source added: 'President Trump spoke out against the Deep State in Israel and criticized the absurdity of requiring the prime minister to attend court proceedings three times weekly while managing a war that is reshaping the Middle East. It's now universally understood that attempting to topple a right-wing government during Trump's presidency represents national irresponsibility and severely damages the right-wing camp. We have nearly two years to achieve historic changes, and we must not squander this opportunity.'

The president outlined his vision for American oversight of the territory, which would include clearing unexploded ordnance and rebuilding the region's infrastructure. Trump explained his plan would involve leveling damaged structures and fostering economic development to create jobs and housing. 'Do a real job. Do something different. Just can't go back. If you go back, it's going to end up the same way it has for 100 years,' Trump said. 'Level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area,' Trump elaborated. The meeting marked Netanyahu's position as the first world leader to visit the White House under Trump's second administration. When asked about the proposed American control of Gaza, Trump expressed his view that US oversight could bring regional stability. Video: Trump-Netanyahu meeting at the White House on Feb. 4, 2025 / Credit: Ariel Kahana 'I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East,' Trump said. He added that his consultations on the matter had received positive feedback, noting the potential for transforming an area currently marked by destruction. Netanyahu, addressing reporters' questions about Gaza, reaffirmed his three primary objectives, emphasizing the need to prevent future threats to Israel. 'President Trump is taking it to a much higher level,' Netanyahu said. 'He sees a different future for that piece of land that has been the focus of so much terrorism.' The leaders' discussions encompassed the ongoing ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Iran's regional influence, and plans for relocating Gaza residents to other countries. Trump characterized Gaza's current state as 'a symbol of death and destruction for so many decades,' suggesting that its future should take a different direction from its past. Netanyahu praised Trump's innovative thinking and willingness to challenge conventional wisdom. 'Your willingness to puncture conventional thinking, thinking that has failed time and time and time again, your willingness to think outside the box with fresh ideas, will help us achieve all these goals,' Netanyahu said. The Israeli leader concluded by emphasizing the shared nature of their nations' success, stating: 'Israel's victory will be America's victory. We will not only win the war working together, we will win the peace.'

President Donald Trump called for a 'verified nuclear peace agreement' with Iran on Wednesday, even as his administration moved to tighten sanctions against Tehran. Then-President Donald Trump during an event in New Jersey in 2020 (AP / Alex Brandon) Trump dismissed reports that the US and Israel were preparing military action against Iran as 'greatly exaggerated' in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform. 'I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper. We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed. God Bless the Middle East!' Trump wrote on the platform, Financial Times reported. The statement came as Trump issued an executive order Tuesday signaling a return to 'maximum pressure' sanctions aimed at compelling Tehran to address nuclear concerns. The order directs US agencies to conduct a 'robust and continual campaign' to eliminate Iran's oil exports, including sales to China, Financial Times reported. Iran maintains its nuclear program serves peaceful civilian purposes, though it has enriched uranium to near weapons-grade levels.

Erdogan taking over? Turkey-Syria agreement revealed	Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are expected to discuss a joint defense pact today (Tuesday) in Ankara, which would include the establishment of Turkish air bases in central Syria and training for the new Syrian army, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. During the Syrian civil war, Turkey backed certain rebel groups, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which was led by al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammad al-Julani According to Reuters sources, including a Syrian security official, two foreign security officials based in Damascus, and a senior regional intelligence officer, the agreement may allow Turkey to establish new air bases in Syria, use Syrian airspace for military purposes, and take a leading role in training the forces of the new Syrian army. Abu Mohammad al-Julani. Photo: Reuters A regional intelligence source stated that potential locations for these air bases include the Palmyra military airfield and the Syrian army's T4 base, both of which were previously used by Iranian militias and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Over the past decade, these bases have been the target of numerous airstrikes attributed to the Israeli Air Force. Last week, al-Sharaa declared himself Syria's interim president, a month and a half after the fall of the Assad regime. In the same speech, he also announced the disbanding of 18 armed militias that participated in the offensive that led to Assad's downfall. 'We have broken the chains of Assad's regime, freed the tortured, and lifted the dust of humiliation and disgrace from the shoulders of al-Sham (the Levant). The sun of Syria has risen again, the people cheered, and the victory was great,' al-Sharaa declared in his speech. Erdogan presides over unprecedented military buildup. Photo: AFP An official from the Syrian presidential office told Reuters that al-Sharaa would discuss with Erdogan 'the training of the new Syrian army, as well as new deployment zones and areas of cooperation,' without specifying the locations. According to the official, Ankara is eager to establish bases in the region as a message to Kurdish autonomy forces in northeastern Syria. Although Turkey has previously threatened military action in the area, it has refrained from doing so while the new Damascus government engages in talks with Kurdish authorities over the fate of their military forces.

Iran preparing for rapid nuclear weapon development	New intelligence obtained by the US indicates that Iran is exploring faster ways to develop a nuclear weapon, according to The New York Times, The report was published overnight (Tuesday). This development comes as Iran's relatively new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has conveyed messages indicating his interest in engaging in dialogue with the new US administration. In addition, The New York Times reports that this intelligence was gathered in the final months of the Biden administration, and was transferred to Trump's team during the transition of power. President Masoud Pezeshkian, third right, reviews Iran's new ballistic missile in an exhibition in Tehran, Iran.

American officials told the newspaper that they believe Iran and its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have not yet made a final decision to develop a nuclear weapon.

According to The New York Times, US intelligence estimates indicate that Iran is on the verge of possessing a nuclear bomb. This issue is expected to be a key topic in today's White House meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump.

Saudi researcher: Permanent Gaza ceasefire is prerequisite for no...	Normalization has become increasingly politicized, Saudi Arabia has developed a more nuanced understanding of Israeli dynamics, and security considerations have taken on unprecedented relevance. In an exclusive interview with Israel Hayom, senior Saudi researcher Dr. Aziz Alghashian provides insights into the intricate relationship between Riyadh and Jerusalem, while examining the profound impact of the Oct. 7 terror attack. Born into a prominent Saudi family with close ties to the ruling elite, Dr. Alghashian's early exposure to international diplomacy came through his childhood years in Washington, DC, where his father served at the Saudi embassy in the US. This experience sparked his enduring interest in Saudi foreign policy. After returning to Saudi Arabia in his youth, he pursued what he terms an 'academic journey,' completing his studies in Britain, earning his doctorate from the University of Essex, and teaching international relations and Middle East studies at the same institution. A central focus of his research has been examining why Israel and Saudi Arabia lack formal diplomatic relations despite their apparent convergence of interests. 'The relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia doesn't follow a linear trajectory. In fact, this process often experiences significant setbacks. The notion that 'my enemy's enemy is my friend' isn't necessarily correct. Many observers view bilateral relations through this simplistic lens, and unfortunately, this perspective persists even now. Even Israel's ambassador to the United States, in his remarks to the Jerusalem Post, continues to embrace this view. However, the reality is far more complex. While shared interests exist, they don't automatically translate into official relations.' Ceasefire for normalization Q: Recent reports indicate renewed interest from the Trump administration in reviving Israel-Saudi normalization talks. 'This clearly ranks among their [the Americans'] top priorities, but the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel and the potential for normalization hinges on two key elements – the Palestinian issue, and what can be offered through a US-Saudi agreement in the Senate. These two policy layers create inherent complexity. The outcome always depends on multiple factors.

While I acknowledge ongoing efforts, I maintain that a permanent ceasefire is the primary prerequisite for normalization, among other conditions. Furthermore, the Saudis have consistently demanded credible and irreversible steps toward Palestinian statehood. It's worth noting that while these steps have been discussed, such conversations have typically remained confined to Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The Palestinians must also engage in negotiations and articulate their requirements for these steps. This dynamic reflects the current state of Saudi-Palestinian cooperation. This is what we're observing. 'Regarding the Palestinian component in normalization, a two-state solution framework is essential. Any normalization framework lacking strong, credible, and concrete steps in this direction seems improbable. Why? The Saudis require internal legitimacy. This becomes particularly crucial when considering that not only the broader Arab population but also Saudi citizens are closely monitoring developments in Gaza (during the war). 'Additionally, the Saudis have gained a more sophisticated understanding of how Palestinian and Israeli dynamics have evolved. They've developed insights into Netanyahu's conflict management approach, which involves constraining moderate elements while enabling Hamas, making it difficult to accept superficial gestures toward normalization. The Saudis will need to confront this reality. It's remarkable how some parties seem unwilling to accept 'no' as an answer. The Israel-Saudi normalization issue has become highly politicized in both Israel and Washington, which explains why it generates such extensive discussion.' The Saudi researcher then elaborated on additional factors underlying the Palestinian issue's significance for Saudi Arabia. 'From their perspective, this is fundamentally a security matter. Many overlook that it's not merely about legitimacy. I recall the terrorist attacks against Saudi Arabia, including a wave of al-Qaida violence. While this history might be forgotten or unknown to many outside Saudi Arabia, these terrorists consistently exploited the Palestinian issue.

Photo credit: IDF, AFP When al-Qaida targeted the US, they characterized Americans as occupiers and facilitators of cooperation with Israel. This underscores the necessity of establishing a secure pathway toward Palestinian statehood.' The Palestinian issue Alghashian continued: 'From the Saudi perspective, even before the events of Oct. 7, they maintained that resolving the Palestinian issue was crucial for regional progress, citing the economic benefits of regional stability. However, I believe the Oct. 7 events and their aftermath transformed what was once a theoretical consideration into an immediate Saudi security concern. Essentially, the unresolved Palestinian issue has evolved into a direct security challenge. 'I sincerely believe there are Israelis committed to peace. This is undeniable, and I believe the current moment calls for enhanced dialogue and more proactive engagement,' the researcher concluded. However, he emphasized that despite recent enthusiasm surrounding Israel-Gulf relations and assumptions about moving beyond the Palestinian issue, the actual situation reflects a different reality.

Report: Iran develops nuclear missiles that can hit Israel, Europ...	The British Telegraph reported that Iran is developing missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads with a range of up to 3,000 kilometers, citing information from an exiled opposition group. Additionally, Iran unveiled what it claims to be a new ballistic missile capable of striking targets up to 1,700 km away - well within range of Israel. According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an opposition group, the Ayatollah regime has been using two facilities for missile development, concealing them as communication satellite launch sites. Work at these locations is conducted under strict secrecy and stringent security measures. The report identifies two key facilities where development and production are taking place. The first is located 35 kilometers from the northern Iranian city of Shahroud. The site reportedly employs personnel from the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND), which serves as the regime's arm for nuclear weapons development, alongside specialists from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) working on nuclear warheads.

This system, the report claims, would enable Iran to target locations within a 3,000-kilometer range, bringing even European targets within reach. The second site, known as the Imam Khomeini Facility, is situated about 70 kilometers southeast of the central Iranian city of Semnan. At this location, Iran is reportedly developing missiles based on North Korea's Unha-1 rocket, which Pyongyang uses to launch satellites into space. The report indicates that the site contains underground facilities and has seen the addition of new structures over the past decade. The opposition organization shared satellite images with the British newspaper, showing suspicious activity at the site, activity that has previously been reported by international media.

The missile, named Etemad, meaning 'Trust' in Persian, was presented as the latest step in strengthening Iran's defensive capabilities. 'Developing defense capabilities and space technologies... aims to ensure that no country dares to attack Iranian territory,' Pezeshkian said in a televised speech. The path to a nuclear weapon To acquire nuclear weapons, in addition to fissile material, two other key components are required: designing the material into a nuclear warhead (where the processes leading to a nuclear explosion occur) and developing a system capable of delivering the warhead to its target, such as a ballistic missile, aircraft, or another platform.

The first was planetary mixers, which are essential for ballistic missile production. The second, according to a report by journalist Barak Ravid on Axios, was a site in Parchin, where advanced equipment used to create a critical component of a nuclear warhead was reportedly damaged.

Freeing Hostages, ending Hamas rule: Talks on phase two begin	Negotiations on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement and of hostage deal will begin tomorrow in Washington with a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. As stipulated in the initial agreement, talks on the second phase are set to begin on the 16th day of the deal - tomorrow - and it now appears that this is about far more than just another stage in a temporary agreement. Israel seems to be on the path toward a comprehensive diplomatic agreement, with its foundation in Gaza and its head in Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu hinted at this just before his departure when he spoke about broadening the circle of peace. The fact that the talks are being orchestrated by the White House through Ron Dermer and will begin with Netanyahu's own meeting tomorrow, indicates that a significant diplomatic agreement is on the table.

The actual negotiations will be led by the Israeli negotiating team, headed by Mossad chief David 'Dadi' Barnea, who will only be dispatched for talks with the mediators after receiving directives from the White House. Unlike the previous discussions, which took place in a roundtable format with the participation of the US, Egypt, Qatar, and Israel, this phase will be managed entirely by the White House. Later this week, Witkoff is expected to initiate similar discussions with Qatar's prime minister and senior Egyptian officials, followed by another likely meeting with Netanyahu to coordinate the Israeli delegation's travel schedule for negotiations.

The negotiations will take place through 'shuttle diplomacy' led by Trump administration representatives, moving between Israel and the mediators following this week's discussions in Washington. It is worth noting that Netanyahu seems to have broad support in his coalition for entering negotiations on the second phase of the deal, which also includes long-term arrangements. Even those who had previously insisted on continuing the war at all costs appeared to have softened their stance over the weekend, allowing the Trump administration to present a formula for ending the war without a return to full-scale conflict. Tens of thousands of Gazans head to northern Gaza. Photo: Reuters With both the US and Israel looking toward Saudi Arabia in the next phase, it is important to note that the second phase and the return of the remaining hostages cannot be finalized without a commitment to ending Hamas rule in Gaza—something that would require Hamas representatives to agree to as well. Until now, Hamas has refused any framework that entails ending the war and its governance, thereby forcing Israel to continue fighting. Now, however, the talks will be restarted under new directives from the White House, and possibly a renewed willingness on the part of the Israeli government to bring the war to an end.

Iran says it has powerful new ballistic missile	Iran has revealed what it claimed to be new ballistic missile capable of travelling 1,056 miles, marking a significant display of military technological advancement during a ceremony attended by President Masoud Pezeshkian. Iran's supreme leader arriving at a joint graduation ceremony for cadets from armed forces academies in the Iranian capital Tehran on October 10, 2023 (Khamenei.ir / AFP) The missile, named Etemad – meaning 'trust' in Persian – was broadcast on state television on Sunday, with officials highlighting its substantial range. According to Agence France-Presse, the Iranian defense ministry described it as their 'most recent ballistic missile'. Western nations have increasingly expressed concerns about Iran's expanding ballistic missile program, viewing it as a potential destabilizing factor in the Middle East. The missile's capabilities are particularly notable as it can potentially reach Israel, which Iran targeted twice during the recent Gaza conflict. President Pezeshkian emphasized the strategic importance of the missile, stating in a televised address that the development of defense capabilities 'aims to ensure that no country dares to attack Iranian territory,' Agence France-Presse reported. The unveiling occurred on Iran's national Aerospace Day, just days before the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Republic's establishment on February 10, 1979. This event follows a pattern of military demonstrations that have intensified since the return of US President Donald Trump, who previously pursued a 'maximum pressure' approach towards Iran. Agence France-Presse noted that Tehran has simultaneously signaled openness to restarting negotiations over its nuclear program, a long-standing source of tension with Western countries. Historically forced to develop its own military equipment after US sanctions following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has constructed a substantial domestic arsenal. Despite being under an arms embargo during its devastating war with Iraq from 1980 to 1988, the country has since developed an extensive range of domestically produced weapons, including missiles, air defense systems, and drones. The missile's presentation underscores Iran's continued commitment to military self-sufficiency and technological independence in the face of international sanctions and geopolitical pressures.

Trump's vision for a new Gaza – and how Hamas might surrender	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embarks Sunday on a Washington visit centered around a pivotal Tuesday meeting with President Donald Trump. While the Prime Minister's Office announced a Friday return to Israel, concurrent preparations suggest a possible extension until the following Sunday. The leadership summit will address all major regional and international issues and their interconnections: Gaza ceasefire status, ongoing hostage liberation efforts, and subsequent phases of the hostage agreement. The agenda encompasses Hamas' eradication from Gaza, Iranian threats – particularly nuclear developments, and normalization agreements between Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the broader Arab world. Hamas terrorists secure an area in a square before handing over four Israeli hostages to a Red Cross team in Gaza City on January 25, 2025 AFP / Omar Al-Qattaa Israel Hayom has learned that mass evacuation from Gaza, including both Hamas operatives and those categorized as 'uninvolved population,' represents a cornerstone of American regional strategy – beyond mere public statements as many Israeli observers believe. During his visit, presidential envoy Steve Witkoff's messages indicated that through substantial Gazan emigration, the administration seeks to align Trump's war conclusion objectives with his stance, shared by many in the new administration, that Hamas must cease controlling Gaza. Significantly, during his Israel discussions, Witkoff stressed that considering October 7's atrocities, he too considers future Hamas governance of Gaza untenable. The American perspective holds that with minimal or no population remaining, Hamas control becomes unsustainable. Arab nations oppose relocation plan A phone conversation between Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi took place Saturday following multiple Arab nations' decisive rejection of Gaza evacuation proposals. Egyptian Presidential Palace communications termed the discussion 'positive dialogue' without elaborating. Earlier, foreign ministers of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates issued a joint statement 'rejecting forced Palestinian displacement while expressing readiness to collaborate with Trump on Israeli-Palestinian two-state solution implementation.' Israel would welcome extensive Gaza emigration, with Minister Ron Dermer, the prime minister's envoy, initially presenting the concept to Trump. However, Jerusalem maintains discretion given the matter's sensitivity. Ruling out Hamas 'shadow authority' In exclusive comments to Israel Hayom, a senior Israeli official suggested Hamas might voluntarily surrender Gaza control rather than face war-end demands. 'The option of renewed military action to achieve objectives remains viable, and we stand prepared,' the official stated. However, they consider Hamas leadership's voluntary relinquishment of control the most probable outcome. 'Within Palestinian faction discussions, Hamas recognizes the necessity of transferring authority. Their desire for ceasefire generates momentum for continued hostage releases. Consequently, further warfare might prove unnecessary, with the framework potentially satisfying war objectives,' the senior official told Israel Hayom. However, they emphasized Israel's rejection of any Hamas shadow authority in Gaza – contrasting with Hezbollah's years of Lebanese dominance.

EXCLUSIVE: Trump support revives Israeli plan for voluntary Gaza ...	A confidential document obtained by Israel Hayom reveals that the Ministry of Intelligence prepared an analysis in the second week of the war concluding that 'voluntary humanitarian evacuation of the civilian population from Gaza to other countries worldwide' represents the option that 'will yield positive, long-term strategic results for Israel.' The ministry advocates this approach over alternatives such as installing Palestinian Authority governance in Gaza or fostering local Arab leadership. Drafted before Israel's ground operation in Gaza, the recommendation to facilitate population evacuation was initially aimed at minimizing civilian casualties. While the Biden administration expressed reservations about Gazans leaving the Gaza Strip, and Egypt's firm opposition ultimately led to shelving the idea, Israeli sources now indicate the proposal has gained renewed relevance, particularly given the possibility of resumed combat operations. These sources point to historical precedent, noting that humanitarian corridors for civilian populations proved crucial during the US-led coalition's campaign against ISIS in the previous decade. The document specifically states that 'humanitarian evacuation of the population from the combat zone serves the best interests of Gaza's civilians.'

Photo credit: Abdel Kareem Hana/AP AP The initiative has gained fresh momentum after President Donald Trump recently voiced strong support for Gaza migration during a meeting with Intelligence Minister Gila Gamliel. This prompted renewed work on the plan originally formulated a year ago. Gamliel, who initiated discussions on the second day of the war and engaged with ministers from potential receiving countries last year, had previously suspended the initiative amid international legitimacy concerns and accusations of forced transfer. Current assessments suggest that securing the first country willing to accept Gaza residents could create a domino effect. Israeli officials estimate that 100,000 to 200,000 Gaza residents have already left the Gaza Strip since the war's outbreak, primarily through the Rafah crossing, with most settling in the Cairo area. An additional 1,000 wounded individuals and their escorts have departed via Israel's Ramon Airport to various countries. Professional sources continue to advocate for building international legitimacy around this 'outside-the-box' proposal. The strategy envisions prioritizing wounded individuals and humanitarian cases for initial departures. While experts anticipate initial criticism and backlash, they believe the international community will gradually accept the concept, noting that the right to emigrate is protected under the UN Declaration of Human Rights.

Photo credit: Brian Snyder/Reuters Israeli sources consistently emphasize, both now and previously, that the proposal strictly excludes forced evacuation, focusing solely on voluntary migration options, whether temporary or permanent. They stress Israel's commitment to allowing all who choose to leave the ability to return to Gaza at their discretion.
