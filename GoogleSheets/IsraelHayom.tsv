Iran-led espionage ring run by Jews who made aliyah uncovered in ...	Seven Israeli Jews, including two minors aged 16 and 17, as well as a father and son, have been in custody since September on suspicion of serious espionage for Iran in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars. On Monday, a prosecutor's statement was submitted against them with a request to extend their detention until the end of the proceedings, while the security establishment is still investigating how they operated for two years under the radar of the Shin Bet, IDF, police, and Mossad. On Friday, the prosecution is expected to file an indictment against them in the Haifa District Court for a series of serious security offenses. The suspects are Aziz Nisanov, Alexander Sadikov, Yigal Nisan, Vyacheslav Gushchin, Yevgeny Yoffe (and two minors). They are all Israeli Jews who immigrated from Azerbaijan. The adults among them did not serve in the IDF and were not employed at security facilities that they documented as part of their espionage activities. They are residents of the northern area of Krayot and Haifa, who received their citizenship under the Law of Return and through other methods that are still under investigation. First responders in Caesarea in northern Israel near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home (Shmuel Buchris) Shmuel Buchris The seven are expected to be charged with aiding the enemy during wartime, an offense punishable by death or life imprisonment. The police reject the assessment that the seven were part of Hamas's decision to invade the border communities on October 7, but emphasize that 'every missile fired towards the country in the last two years from Gaza, Lebanon, or Iran reached places they photographed and sent to the Iranians, especially in the last year.' Among other targets, the suspects photographed the Golani training base, where a Hezbollah drone struck and killed four IDF soldiers. The investigation reveals that this is an espionage case, directed by two Iranian agents, which lasted about two years but was exposed a few months ago following information received by the Shin Bet. Due to the real concern that the espionage efforts would harm Israelis, the investigation of the case became public before the completion of the covert investigation against them. The seven were arrested on September 19. 'This is one of the most serious events investigated ever,' the head of the security division at Lahav 433 Major Crimes Unit Chief Superintendent Yaron Binyamin said. 'It seems we have too many such people in the country, and it's very troubling.' From the investigation details, it emerged that the seven carried out between 600 and 700 espionage missions for Iran over two years. They documented sensitive security facilities, military bases, and human targets, the last of which was the commander of the Nevatim base and his son. According to investigators, in the Iranian attack that took place on Oct. 1, 2024, Iran launched ballistic missiles across Israel towards targets that the seven had documented, including the Nevatim and Ramat David Air Force bases and the Mossad headquarters in Glilot. Additionally, it was revealed that after the missile attack, the seven were sent by Iran to check the accuracy and damage caused to improve in the future. The police and Shin Bet are still investigating whether the seven collected and surveilled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesaria, which was targeted by a Hezbollah drone late last week. In their investigation, the seven said they 'became addicted to the money paid to them' totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars transferred to them in cryptocurrency, in an encrypted manner, through exchange stores in the country, and even several times through Russian couriers who came to the country and transferred the funds to them in meetings they held with them. 'We know about the systematic way in which the group operated,' Chief Superintendent Binyamin said. 'We caught dozens of documents listing which facility to photograph, which facility to gather information on, and how much money they were supposed to earn from it. The method of operation was receiving a mission, such as photographing, driving to the location, unloading from the vehicle, taking a high vantage point, photographing, and transferring the documentation in short ranges to Iran using encrypted software.' It also turns out that the group's leader was recruited in Turkey in the past and had already activated Israelis in other cases that were recently exposed. Unlike other cases, this involves espionage that lasted about two years. It should be noted that the Iranians do not work directly with Israelis, and to recruit them, they operate through intermediaries. In this case, too, the Iranians used a Turkish intermediary named Al Hassan, who had already activated Israelis in short espionage missions in the past. As far as is known, arrests related to the case have recently been made in Turkey and Azerbaijan. Iranian Protesters unveil a digital countdown showing 8411 days until Israel is destroyed in Tehran, Iran, Friday, June 23, 2017 (AP/Ebrahim Noroozi) AP/Ebrahim Noroozi Details of the investigation reveal that the seven knew at some stage or another that the materials they collected were being transferred to Iran. The severity of the acts became clear during the overt investigation and in the covert wiretapping placed on them. 'We clearly understood that they were thirsty for missions because they were thirsty for money. They asked each other 'So when is the next mission'. Sometimes they performed three or four missions a day,' Binyamin said. 'The method was to receive a mission in an ascending order. Two years ago, they received simple missions and then it gradually increased. This is an exceptional event by any measure. I don't know of a terror cell that operates systematically and primarily for such a long period and executes. I don't know whether to be happy or sad on this day, on one hand, there's satisfaction, on the other hand, it's very troubling in what reality we live.' Three of the seven were caught red-handed while they were near the home of the commander of the Nevatim base in southern Israel, and were on a mission to monitor him and his son. 'This was the mission that led to the decision to break into the investigation because we didn't want to take the risk of harm to human life. They were directed by the Iranians on which day and at what time to photograph the home of the Nevatim commander. This was supposed to happen at the time his son was expected to leave the house,' Binyamin said, adding that unlike other cases where contact with the Iranians was, among other things, through social networks, in this case, the contact with them was physical. 'The investigation material is crazy,' he adds. A senior Shin Bet official said, 'As part of the investigation, many materials were seized that were collected by the members of the infrastructure and transferred to Iranian agents, including photographs and videos of many IDF bases across the country, ports, energy infrastructures in Israel, all while the State of Israel is fighting on several different fronts. The assessment is that the activities of the infrastructure members led to security damage to the state's security.' The police said the following in a statement: 'During the overt investigation, the severity of the events and their scope were revealed, which are among the most serious that the State of Israel has known. The suspects acted with knowledge of their actions and out of greed for money - and harmed the State of Israel and its citizens.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/22/tep/	2024-10-21T15:10:13-07:00

Sinwar didn't fight, he hid under 3 blankets': A look inside Raf...	Just over a year ago, the idea of an Israeli civilian setting foot in Gaza seemed unthinkable. Today, that scenario has become a reality, as evidenced by an Israel Hayom reporter standing inside the Rafah home where Hamas's top leader met his end. This location will undoubtedly be etched into the annals of Jewish history. The house where the mass murderer met his end is located a mere 18-minute drive from the Israeli point at Kibbutz Kerem Shalom. Despite its proximity to the border, military officials believe Sinwar calculated this urban location, less than a mile from the sea, as his safest option. Speculations suggest he was attempting to reach the civilian area of al-Mawasi, Rafah, to blend in among the civilians or possibly access tunnels in Rafah for an escape to Egypt. It's unlikely he anticipated IDF forces reaching his hideout. And they did. Video: Footage from an IDF drone showing Yahya Sinwar moments before his elimination Blood drops on the entrance wall alerted approaching soldiers to a presence inside. They strategically retreated, regrouping with additional firepower and drone support before the famous footage was captured. The house lies in ruins. On the second floor are two orange sofas, on one of which Sinwar sat in his final moments. It's hard to shake off the thought, which is even a bit satisfying, that when Sinwar sat on the sofas, wounded, bleeding, dying, and looked out through the wall, he saw the results of his actions – Gaza dismantled, broken, destroyed, in ruins. Sinwar was alone when found. His security detail had scattered in the face of pursuing IDF forces, with members fleeing to nearby buildings. Every Israeli can find some solace in knowing that in his final moments, with Hamas leadership decimated and Gaza in ruins, Sinwar must have realized the futility of his actions – a suicide mission from which he and his comrades would never return. Contrary to the false Palestinian narrative, Sinwar did not fight. Even the pathetic stick-throwing wasn't fighting. The soldiers who eliminated him say that he covered himself with three blankets and tried to hide behind furniture. He wasn't a great fighter, more of a cowardly flea. Sinwar's body being removed by the IDF Lt. Col. Gilad Pasternak, Deputy Commander of the brigade, appears in the famous image of soldiers standing over Sinwar's body. For Pasternak, this mission closed a personal circle – a decade after being wounded in battle in Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip, he now stood over the body of Israel's most wanted enemy. 'This is closure. Sinwar was responsible for that incident, he planned and carried it out, and now he was lying dead here,' Pasternak said. 'There's great pride throughout the country – in our fighters, our commanders, and all our soldiers. You see in front of you the one who murdered so many Israelis, caused so much suffering to so many Israelis lying thrown, pathetic, as he deserves. The feeling is one of satisfaction. Justice done. Joy over an operational achievement and the professionalism of the soldiers. Now we have to win the war to bring back the hostages.' Pasternak emphasized that Sinwar did not die fighting. 'We know what combat looks like, and this wasn't it. This was a man fleeing and hiding. Someone who fights doesn't cower under blankets or make feeble attempts to throw sticks. Real combat looks entirely different.' The journey to Tel Sultan, where Sinwar was found, is as significant as the final hideout itself. The Philadelphi Corridor is well paved and has two lanes, and now they're already marking driving arrows with spray paint as if it were a road in Tel Aviv. The destruction in Rafah is evident, with neighborhoods reduced to rubble and infrastructure in shambles. The destruction cannot be conveyed in words or pictures. Along the route, there are infrastructure works. It's doubtful anyone intends to leave the place anytime soon. One of the orange armchairs Sinwar sat in in his final moments. Photo credit: Yehuda Shlezinger Lt. Col. Pasternak shared his feelings: 'There's no joy over the destruction of innocent lives, but we all understand that they brought this upon themselves.' At the entrance to the house stood Brigade Commander Sivan Bloch. 'I'm interviewing on behalf of my soldiers and commanders, I'm just representing them, they did a wonderful and difficult job,' he said. He then recounted the elimination of Sinwar: 'The brigade took the Rafah area for defense and offensive missions. We carried out ambushes. A very alert soldier identified suspicious movement, two blocks from here, 650 feet to the south.' 'He then mobilized forces. Trackers identified footprints, moved from detection to detection, reached the house, and heard voices. Sinwar's cell gets nervous and flees to the house next door. That's where the first encounter took place. The cell fleed, they didn't fight or anything. The force hit some of them, and they scattered from fear. Sinwar fled to this house. One terrorist and two others fled to nearby houses. The battalion strived for contact. A soldier was wounded in the encounter, the soldier is from the Druze community. And it should be noted that this operation involved Israelis from all sectors of society – Druze, religious, secular, everyone participated. That's one of the remarkable aspects of this event.' He continued with the dramatic description. 'Blood stains were identified at the entrance to the stairs and the soldiers understood that there was someone there, they took back, brought tanks, and identified terrorists, yet still didn't understand that it was Sinwar. They carried out fire until he was killed.' The blood-stained wall. Photo credit: Yehuda Shlezinger 'You could see Sinwar's pathetic state,' Bloch said. 'With a stick, covered face, not really a battle going on, there wasn't any real fighting happening. On the contrary, he was trying to hide, to conceal himself, to cover himself with things. Although they didn't understand who it was, the soldiers were doing a wonderful job.' The operation continued through the night, with forces eliminating the remaining members of Sinwar's cell by 6 a.m. It was only when scanning the area with drones that they identified Sinwar's face. 'We joked that it resembled Sinwar. As verification came in, we realized this was far more significant than just another terrorist neutralized by our battalion.' Bloch emphasized that Sinwar's elimination, while significant, is not the end of their mission. 'Killing Sinwar doesn't mean our job is done. We'll continue to capture terrorists, eliminate threats, and dismantle their infrastructure. We must remain vigilant to prevent Hamas from regrouping. Our ongoing operations are crucial to Israel's security.' The brigade commander bristled at suggestions that Sinwar's elimination was mere luck. 'This wasn't a fluke,' he stated firmly. 'I've heard people saying it was, but that's simply not true. This was the result of our soldiers' relentless hard work and dedication to bringing victory to Israel.' Despite the magnitude of their achievement in eliminating Hamas' top leader, Bloch and his soldiers didn't engage in overt celebrations. 'Our celebration was continuing our mission – conducting more ambushes, maintaining our operational tempo. There were no barbecues or fireworks. Our bulldozers kept working, our soldiers remained active. We're proud of what we've accomplished, and we're glad it brings some comfort to our nation. But our work continues.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/21/sinwar-didnt-fight-he-hid-under-3-blankets-a-look-inside-rafah/	2024-10-20T20:00:51-07:00	
IDF announces 401st Armored Brigade commander KIA	Colonel Ehsan Daxa, commander of the 401st Armored Brigade, who had only taken up his position a few months ago, was killed in action in Jabalia, Gaza Strip. During the same incident, another commander was wounded. Daxa, 41, a resident of the Druze city of Daliyat al-Karmel, was a highly respected and decorated officer in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). He enlisted in the Armored Corps in 2001 and rose through the ranks until his final position as commander of the 401st Brigade, to which he was appointed last June. Colonel Ehsan Daxa.

Sexual misconduct claims made against ICC chief prosecutor	The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, is facing accusations of misconduct related to harassment claims involving a female colleague, The Mail on Sunday reported on Sunday. This revelation comes amid controversy surrounding Khan's recent request for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged crimes against humanity in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends a special session to vote on a new government at the Knesset in Jerusalem, on June 13, 2021 (AFP / Emmanuel Dunand) AFP / Emmanuel Dunand According to The Mail on Sunday investigation, in the two weeks preceding Khan's announcement, he was subject to internal scrutiny at the ICC in The Hague, Netherlands. Sources claim that a female official at the court made allegations about Khan's conduct to a colleague, who then informed senior managers. The woman was reportedly so distressed that she was in tears. The Independent Oversight Mechanism (IOM), responsible for investigating misconduct allegations at the court, questioned the alleged victim. However, she chose not to file a formal complaint. The IOM decided against launching an investigation and instead recommended undisclosed measures 'to safeguard everyone's rights.' Khan, 54, vehemently denied any wrongdoing and suggested a deliberate smear campaign. He stated, 'I absolutely can confirm there is no truth to suggestions of misconduct.' He added that he and the court were being subjected 'to a wide range of attacks and threats.' Paivi Kaukoranta, president of the Assembly of States Parties overseeing the court, confirmed awareness of the allegations. She stated, 'Following the conversation with the alleged victim, the IOM was not in a position to proceed with an investigation at that stage.' Kaukoranta emphasized the court's zero-tolerance policy towards prohibited conduct, including harassment and discrimination. The controversy surrounding Khan intensified after his May 20 announcement requesting arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, along with Hamas leaders Yahiya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh. This move sparked widespread condemnation. US president Joe Biden responded forcefully, stating, 'Let me be clear: whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence – none – between Israel and Hamas.' Netanyahu called it a 'moral outrage of historic proportions,' while Gallant branded it 'despicable.' The UK government initially issued a legal challenge questioning the ICC's jurisdiction over Israeli citizens. However, the Labour government later stated it would not object to Khan's request, saying the warrants were a matter for the courts to decide. This shift in stance was criticized by Jewish groups, with Labour Friends of Israel calling it 'deeply disappointing.' Despite the allegations, Khan maintains his innocence and expresses willingness to cooperate with any IOM investigation. He stated, 'I have worked around the world for 30 years and there has never been such a complaint lodged against me by anyone.' Khan emphasized his support for victims of sexual harassment or abuse, encouraging survivors to come forward. He concluded, 'I have always been supportive of a proactive approach in this regard.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/20/sexual-misconduct-claims-made-against-icc-chief-prosecutor/	2024-10-20T00:42:04-07:00	
Source says Iran to 'pay heavy price' for attempt on Netanyahu's ...	As Israel braces for a tense week ahead, officials are now pointing the finger at Iran for Saturday's attempted drone strike on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea, even as the country deliberates its response to a recent Iranian attack. First responders in Caesarea in northern Israel (Photo: Shmuel Buchris) Shmuel Buchris While Hezbollah launched the drone from Lebanon, a diplomatic source told Israel Hayom that Iran is ultimately responsible. 'Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy, so Iran bears responsibility for this incident as well,' the source said, adding, 'There will be consequences for the attempt on Prime Minister Netanyahu's life.' The threats against the prime minister are well-known to security services, prompting frequent changes to his locations over the past year. However, the shift from threats to an actual attempt crosses a red line that Israel won't ignore. Senior officials told Israel Hayom, 'We've long known that Iran and Hezbollah wanted to target the prime minister, but this attempt breaks all the rules. It's an assassination attempt on the prime minister, and Iran will pay a heavy price for it, sooner or later.' All eyes in Israel and the US are on Israel's next move. Even before the attempt on Netanyahu, US President Joe Biden had called for a measured response to Iran's Oct. 1 missile attack on Israel, which was meant as a retaliation for alleged Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil in late July and the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in late September. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit Israel this week to discuss the ongoing Gaza campaign following the elimination of Sinwar, as well as other fronts. The attempt by Iran's proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake. This will not deter me or the State of Israel from continuing our just war against our enemies in order to secure our future. I say to Iran and its proxies in its axis of evil:… — Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) October 19, 2024 Responding to the drone attack, Netanyahu said, 'Iran's proxies who tried to assassinate me and my wife today made a grave error. This won't deter me or Israel from continuing our war of resurgence against our enemies to secure our future. I tell Iran and its partners in the axis of evil: Anyone who harms Israeli citizens will pay dearly.' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated, 'The attempt on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his family aims to strike at Israel and its government symbols. Our defense system will continue to target any terror element and hit hard any enemy that has harmed or tries to harm Israel. Our actions across the Middle East have proven this and will continue to do so. Israel is advancing on all war fronts – dismantling Hamas, significantly reducing Hezbollah's capabilities, and eliminating the terror leaders who waged war on us. Hezbollah's attempts to deter us and prevent us from achieving our war goals will fail.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/20/source-says-iran-will-face-consequences-for-attempt-on-netanyahus-life/	2024-10-20T00:00:03-07:00

Did Sinwar's wife go into hiding with Birkin bag?	The discovery of what seems to be a luxury Hermès Birkin handbag in the possession of eliminated Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's wife has sparked controversy amidst the ongoing war in Gaza. The high-end accessory, potentially worth tens of thousands of dollars, was spotted in images of released by the IDF on Saturday evening, showing Sinwar, his wife, and children, going underground on Oct. 6, the evening before the massacre. The image has raised questions about the lifestyle of Hamas leadership in contrast to the conditions faced by regular Gazans. Video: Sinwar and his family going underground on Oct. 6 / Credit: IDF Spokesperson's Unit Social media platforms buzzed with activity following the release of photos from Gaza's underground tunnels. The leather masterpiece, inspired by fashion icon and actress Jane Birkin, stands as one of the world's most prestigious and desired handbags. It has evolved into a global emblem of status, reflecting affluence, prominence, and refined taste. Crafted through a meticulous six-stage process, each Birkin requires approximately 20 hours of skilled handiwork, commanding exorbitant prices. Acquiring a Birkin from a Hermès boutique is no simple feat. Prospective owners must cultivate strong relationships with the brand's staff and invest in other Hermès products – such as silk scarves, timepieces, and footwear – before they might 'earn' the privilege of purchasing the illustrious accessory. While it's possible that the bag glimpsed in the tunnel images could be a replica or imitation, this caveat has done little to quell the fervent discussions among netizens.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/20/did-sinwars-wife-go-underground-with-birkin-bag/	2024-10-19T18:30:22-07:00

New details emerge on Sinwar's elimination, physical state	Forensic experts at the National Center of Forensic Medicine (Abu Kabir) have concluded their meticulous examination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was successfully eliminated by IDF troops on Thursday. In a move that hints at strategic considerations, the remains were promptly transferred to an undisclosed site, fueling speculation about their potential role in future negotiations.

The primary cause of death appears to be a long-range gunshot wound to the head, executed with sniper-like precision. However, this was not the only mark of violence on the body. Examiners noted additional trauma consistent with shell impact, and the corpse was riddled with shrapnel fragments after the house where he was staying was fired upon by a tank.

Weighing in at 152 pounds, it appears that even while orchestrating operations from hidden tunnels, the Hamas leader maintained access to adequate nutrition. In addition, the forensic team found no evidence of significant health deterioration attributable to Sinwar's extended periods in subterranean hideouts. As the investigation continues, toxicology reports, which could reveal the presence of any drugs or medications in Sinwar's system at the time of his death, are still being processed.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/18/new-details-emerge-on-sinwars-elimination-physical-state/	2024-10-17T23:52:30-07:00	
Outrageous interference': Lebanese PM furious with Iran	Lebanon's interim Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, expressed anger today (Friday) over Iran's interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. This reaction followed a statement from the Iranian parliament speaker, who suggested that Tehran is willing to negotiate with France regarding the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701. According to the 2006 resolution, Hezbollah is required to withdraw its forces to the Litani River in southern Lebanon. 'We were surprised by the comments from Iranian parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who said that Tehran is prepared to negotiate with France on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701,' Mikati said. 'This position is an outrageous interference in Lebanon's affairs and an unacceptable attempt to impose unwarranted guardianship over Lebanon.' Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf. Photo: EPA He emphasized that 'any negotiations regarding the UN resolution should be conducted by the Lebanese state, and everyone is required to support this effort, not seek to impose new patrons who are rejected in every national and sovereign sense.' Mikati noted that Lebanon had informed Iranian parliamentary and foreign ministry delegations during their visits that they must 'understand Lebanon's situation, especially given that the country is facing unprecedented Israeli aggression. We are working with all of Lebanon's friends - including France - to pressure Israel into agreeing to a ceasefire.' Lebanese commentator Mohammad Ali al-Husseini also reacted to Ghalibaf's remarks, writing, 'Ghalibaf's audacity reveals the behavior of the Iranian regime, which is always ready to negotiate with the West to secure its own benefits. Tehran's claim that it is ready to negotiate with France over Resolution 1701 and the cessation of the war in Lebanon means that Iran is controlling the conflict at the expense of Lebanese blood. Iran, the merchant, has already sold out Hezbollah once and is prepared to sell it again to preserve its regime's stability.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/18/outrageous-interference-lebanese-prime-minister-furious-with-iran/	2024-10-17T20:03:36-07:00	
Israel yet to release damaging info on UNRWA despite evidence	Several months after conclusive evidence was found linking the UNRWA agency to Hamas, Israel's political leadership has still not directed the IDF and its intelligence agencies to release the 'damaging materials' on the UN refugee agency. This was confirmed to Israel Hayom by a well-placed source. According to this source, this is why the State of Israel has not yet launched an official public relations campaign against UNRWA. It also explains why even the United States opposes legislation intended to sever ties between Israel and the agency. Yesterday, an UNRWA staff ID was found on the body of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar after his elimination. This is just one more piece of evidence in a long series proving the close connection and collaboration between Hamas and UNRWA. During the war in Gaza, a direct link was uncovered between UNRWA's headquarters in the Rimal neighborhood and Hamas computer labs located directly underneath it. Additionally, a principal of an UNRWA school in Lebanon was found to be the commander of Hamas' Lebanon branch and a member of the organization's external political bureau. For years, Israel has known that UNRWA plays a central role in perpetuating the conflict between the Arabs of Israel and the State of Israel. Despite the intelligence community's possession of this information, the Prime Minister and the government have yet to instruct the IDF or other relevant agencies to distribute these damaging materials to various public relations and policy-making bodies. IDF Soldiers at UNRWA Headquarters in Gaza (Archive), Photo: Reuters Without such directives, the IDF has kept the information to itself. It has not been shared domestically or internationally, neither with policymakers nor with local or international media outlets. As a result, the international community remains largely unaware of the reasons behind the pending legislation in the Knesset to sever ties between Israel and UNRWA. This may explain Hungary and the Czech Republic's decision yesterday to block the European Union from issuing a unified statement against the UN agency. It should be noted that Prime Minister Netanyahu has not yet taken a firm public stance in favor of shutting down UNRWA. Instead, he has stated that alternatives should be found to replace it in Gaza. However, to date, Netanyahu has not taken steps to delay the legislation that is expected to pass in the Knesset immediately after the holidays. According to diplomatic sources, a statement was prepared by the European External Action Service and circulated among member states for approval. Two of Israel's closest allies in the European Union refused to support it. Since EU decisions require consensus, this blocked the condemnation of Israel. One diplomatic source commented, 'The Czech Republic indeed holds views similar to those of the current Israeli government. Nevertheless, it's surprising that the Czech Republic would oppose a statement aimed at ensuring the continued functioning of the UN refugee agency as part of upholding international humanitarian law.' Since the beginning of the conflict, there have been numerous shifts in positions on the issue of UNRWA funding among EU member states, even within the European Commission itself. 'We are talking about the only institution that provides assistance to Gaza on such a scale,' the diplomatic source added. The Czech Foreign Ministry confirmed that it had indeed opposed the statement, mainly because 'we cannot predict the final wording of the proposed law.' This is the second time in recent days that the Czech Republic has vetoed an EU statement. A few days ago, Prague opposed a European declaration criticizing Israel's military actions in Lebanon. As a result, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who is soon to step down, had to issue a statement in his own name rather than on behalf of all EU member states. So far, there has been no response from the Israeli Prime Minister's Office.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/18/israel-yet-to-release-damaging-info-on-unrwa-despite-evidence/	2024-10-17T20:00:27-07:00	
Watch: dramatic footage of Sinwar's elimination	The IDF spokesperson unveiled new details and footage from the elimination of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas and the chief architect of the October 7 massacre. Video: Footage from an IDF drone showing Yahya Sinwar moments before his elimination In a video, captured by an Israeli drone, shows Sinwar sitting on a couch inside a destroyed building. Upon noticing the drone hovering above, Sinwar, who had already lost his hand from earlier gunfire, attempts to throw a piece of wood at the drone in a futile effort to knock it down.

In his statement, the IDF spokesperson said: 'For months, IDF and Shin Bet forces have been working to gather intelligence in order to eliminate Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the Hamas terrorist organization and one of the founders of its military wing. Sinwar had been hiding in an area our forces surrounded for an extended period. We didn't know he was there, but we continued to act with determination. The forces found Sinwar with a vest, a pistol, and 40,000 shekels in cash. He tried to flee, and our forces eliminated him.' Sinwar's belongings: This Is What the IDF forces found near his body. 'There were no hostages with the terrorists we eliminated,' the spokesperson clarified. 'The forces are now scanning the area and are proceeding with the necessary caution.' Regarding Sinwar's presence in the Rafah tunnel where the bodies of the six hostages, who were murdered in captivity, were discovered, he added: 'After an investigation, we can confirm that Sinwar's DNA was found in an underground tunnel, a few hundred meters from the tunnel where the hostages were killed.' 'We had known Sinwar's estimated location for some time despite the high level of secrecy that Hamas employed regarding his whereabouts,' military sources stated. 'We knew he had been in Rafah, and we have been extracting information from underground tunnels there to understand where he was.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/18/watch-dramatic-footage-of-sinwars-elimination/	2024-10-17T14:14:36-07:00	
British elites are in complete denial about attempts to Islamize...	Borrowing from the Israeli discourse after Oct. 7, Jewish-British journalist Melanie Phillips (73) is one of the UK's earliest and most famous 'disillusioned' figures: from being a senior left-wing journalist and a 'Jew by accident,' to becoming a fighter for neo-conservative values in the West and an outspoken pro-Israel voice. Lebanon, now in the spotlight of both the conflict and media attention, played a crucial role in Phillips' process of leaving the British left. 'The first time I was exposed to the hypocrisy towards Israel in the world press was in 1982, when the First Lebanon War began,' she recalled. 'I hadn't visited Israel before, had no such plans, and didn't know much about the Israeli-Arab conflict. To my shock, the coverage in the British press portrayed Israel as a Nazi state. I'll never forget how Ariel Sharon, then defense minister, was described as a Nazi general and mass murderer. Out of nowhere, and for the first time since the Holocaust, displays of antisemitism towards Jews in Britain began to emerge, claiming that we, British Jews, support a state that is committing 'genocide' against Palestinians in Lebanon. 'At that time, I was a senior writer at The Guardian. I asked my colleagues – educated and wonderful people on a personal level who advocate moral principles – how it was that a shocking tragedy in the Middle East, where the army of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad murdered between 25,000 and 40,000 people in the city of Hama in Syria, received a side headline in our newspaper, while Israeli attacks against Palestinians in Lebanon received front-page headlines and extensive coverage. 'We have a double standard towards Israel,' I told them.' The answer she heard changed her life: 'Of course we have a double standard,' her colleagues explained. 'Israel is a Western country, so we judge you by our morals, while from the Arab world, which wasn't educated on human rights values, we don't have similar expectations. If we made such a comparison, it would be racism on our part.' Phillips replied: 'What are you talking about? If someone claims that Arabs can't be expected to be as moral as the West, in my eyes, that's racism.' People carry a huge Palestinian flag during a pro-Palestinian rally in Rome, Italy, 12 October 2024. Photo credit: EPA/Fabio Frustaci EPA This conversation was a turning point for her: 'The left revealed itself as fundamentally racist. This realization stunned me. They weren't the moral knights I thought they were. Although it took me time to part ways with The Guardian and the left, in retrospect, this was the moment when my previous world began to crumble.' Beyond the ideological debate, Phillips realized that in her colleagues' eyes, she was a Jew representing Israel, and accordingly, they addressed her with expressions like 'you' and 'you all.' The series of attacks on the London Underground on July 7, 2005, sent shockwaves through the UK. Four Al-Qaeda terrorists with British citizenship detonated bombs in three train stations, killing about 52 people and injuring about 700. This tragedy catalyzed the publication of Phillips' most famous book in 2006: 'Londonistan: How Britain Created a Terror State Within.' Despite being published by a small, unknown publishing house, the book quickly became a bestseller in Britain and the US. 'The major publishing houses in Britain boycotted me and refused to publish my books,' Phillips explained. ''Londonistan' sparked a wide public debate on the integration of Muslim immigrants in Britain and the West's failure to address the internal Muslim threat, not only in terms of terrorism but also on the cultural front.' Q: 18 years after the publication of 'Londonistan,' how do you view the current attitude of the British elites towards Muslim immigration? 'The situation hasn't improved but worsened, in the sense that they're still in complete denial of the religious component of the attempts to Islamize the West, which is essentially jihad. On the other hand, in the general public, people understand that this is a terrible problem that only gets worse year by year. One can't ignore the fact that in France, there's a phenomenon of churches being deliberately and symbolically burned by Muslims, and that entire communities essentially function as enclaves operating under Sharia law.' Police secure the area on the south side of Westminster Bridge close to the Houses of Parliament in London after a man drove his rented SUV into pedestrians at London's Westminster Bridge, killing four people and stabbing a police officer to death on March 22, 2017. Photo credit: AP Photo/Matt Dunham AP 'I still hold the same values' 'When asked about my transition from left to right,' Phillips said, 'I emphasize that I still hold the same values that have always guided me: giving voice to the weak against the centers of power, presenting the truth against lies, and going where the evidence leads me. I'm simply a Jew who believes in tikkun olam [a concept in Judaism about healing the world] and a journalist who believes in telling the truth. In many ways, I haven't changed; I just realized over time that the environment that surrounded me, those I thought were with me 'on the same front,' were never really there.' An example of Phillips' approach in British media can be seen from her appearance in March on the BBC's long-running program, 'Question Time.' Phillips argued that Israel is not systematically starving Gaza residents as a means of warfare. The audience reacted with astonishment, some even with overt laughter. Panel members and the program's host also expressed opposition to her statements. Q: At times it seemed like everyone there was against you. 'When you see how a story like the Palestinian narrative, which is entirely based on lies, receives such support in the West, you understand the power of the intellectual and moral degeneration that has struck its elites, in Britain and in general. 'Palestinianism,' the Palestinian ideology aimed at fighting Israel, plays a much more central role today compared to other destructive ideologies: it's a moral cancer at the heart of Western civilization. It has distorted collective logic by paralyzing our ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and has emasculated the West from defending its way of life.' The full interview will be published in Makor Rishon in the coming days.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/15/british-elites-are-in-complete-denial-about-attempts-to-islamize-the-west/	2024-10-14T23:00:03-07:00	
PM said to tell Biden IDF would only target Iran military sites	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated to the Biden administration that Israel is considering a more measured response to Iran's recent missile attack, targeting military infrastructure rather than nuclear or oil facilities, officials familiar with the matter have told The Washington Post. According to the report, Netanyahu conveyed this intention during a phone call with President Joe Biden on Wednesday, their first conversation in over seven weeks amid reported rising tensions between the two leaders. The Israeli prime minister stated he was planning to target military sites in Iran, according to a US official and another official familiar with the discussion, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the talks. The remains of an Iranian missile launched at Israel, Oct. 2, 2024, Arad (Erik Marmor/Getty ImagesErik Marmor/Getty Images) Erik Marmor/Getty ImagesErik Marmor/Getty Images The White House has not provided immediate comment on the matter. In a statement, the Prime Minister's Office said, 'We listen to the opinions of the United States, but we will make our final decisions based on our national interest.' Sources indicate that the proposed retaliatory action would be calibrated to avoid the perception of 'political interference in the US elections,' signaling Netanyahu's awareness of the potential impact on the presidential race. An Israeli strike on Iranian oil facilities could lead to a surge in energy prices, while targeting the country's nuclear research program might eliminate remaining boundaries in Israel's conflict with Tehran, potentially drawing the US into a more direct military role. The apparent moderation in Netanyahu's stance reportedly influenced Biden's decision to deploy a powerful missile defense system to Israel. On Sunday, the Pentagon announced the deployment of its anti-ballistic THAAD battery system, along with approximately 100 US military personnel, to Israel. The system is expected to arrive in the coming days, underscoring 'the United States' ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel,' according to the Pentagon statement. An official familiar with the matter stated that the Israeli strike on Iran would likely occur before the US elections on Nov. 5, as inaction could be interpreted by Iran as a sign of weakness. 'It will be one in a series of responses,' the official added.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/15/netanyahu-tells-biden-israel-to-target-iran-military-sites-not-nuclear-or-oil-facilities/	2024-10-14T22:11:16-07:00	
Quds Force chief appears in public, ending speculation	Putting an end to weeks of speculation about his fate, Esmail Ghaani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, made a public appearance at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport early Tuesday. His presence dispels rumors of his death or injury that had circulated following an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs in late September. In the pre-dawn hours of Tuesday, Esmail Ghaani, commander of Iran's Quds Force, was spotted at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport. He was there to receive the body of Abbas Nilforoushan, a high-ranking official of the organization in Lebanon, who was killed alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut.

Israeli intelligence suggests that Nasrallah's intended heir was eliminated in the operation. In the days following the strike, unverified reports emerged suggesting Ghaani had been killed or wounded. Iranian sources later confirmed to Reuters that Ghaani had been in Beirut in the period leading up to the aerial bombardment of the underground bunker. Subsequently, Revolutionary Guards spokespersons asserted that he was unharmed. More recently, reports from Sky News and the Middle East Eye website alleged that Ghaani was under investigation by the Revolutionary Guards. According to Sky News sources, Ghaani was being questioned about a suspected intelligence leak and had reportedly been hospitalized after suffering a heart attack. Iranian officials once again refuted these claims. A correspondent for the Lebanese channel Al-Mayadeen, reporting from Iran, stated that Tehran had deliberately released live footage of Ghaani to counter what it called 'completely false narratives' about him circulated by certain media outlets. The public appearance of Ghaani at Mehrabad Airport seems to be a calculated move by Iranian authorities to quash rumors and demonstrate the Quds Force commander's continued active role in the country's military leadership.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/15/iranian-quds-force-chief-appears-in-public-ending-speculation/	2024-10-14T20:00:32-07:00	
Model, ex-minister, defense chief's janitor: The Israelis who bec...	In recent years, Israel has faced an increasing number of espionage attempts orchestrated by Iranian intelligence services, ranging from social media manipulation to the recruitment of Israeli citizens. Vladislav Viktorson (Free usage under Israeli copyright law (Section 27A) Most recently, 30-year-old Vladislav Viktorson, from Ramat Gan, was detained for questioning in connection with alleged espionage activities conducted with his partner, Anna Bernstein. The investigation reveals that Viktorson was reportedly tasked with sabotaging communication infrastructure and ATMs, as well as setting forests ablaze, for a sum of approximately $5,000. Investigators claim Viktorson even agreed to carry out an assassination of a high-profile figure in Israel and to lob a grenade at a residence. The probe uncovered that since last August, Viktorson had been in contact via social media with an individual using the name 'Mari Hossi.' Their exchanges were conducted in Hebrew. Anna Bernstein (Instagram) As part of this connection, Viktorson allegedly performed various tasks under the guidance of the Iranian operative, fully aware of their identity. These tasks included graffiti, poster hanging, money planting, and even torching vehicles in Tel Aviv's Yarkon Park area. Subsequently, Viktorson was reportedly instructed to sabotage communication infrastructure and ATMs, and to ignite forest fires. Some of these missions were documented, with payments exceeding $5,000 received for their execution. The investigation also suggests that Viktorson worked to procure weapons, including a sniper rifle, pistols, and fragmentation grenades. Bernstein, an 18-year-old Ramat Gan resident, who works as a model, allegedly participated in some of the missions. Moti Maman (Dudu Grushpan) In a separate case, Moti Maman, a 72-year-old Ashkelon resident, was apprehended in August 2024 in a joint operation by the Shin Bet security agency and Israel Police. He faces serious espionage charges. The indictment reveals that Maman had a criminal history, including five previous convictions for various offenses such as extortion and tax evasion, with his most recent conviction in 2013. According to the charges, the Israeli-Jewish businessman, who had resided in Turkey for an extended period, was recruited by Iranian intelligence agents. He allegedly agreed – through Turkish intermediaries – to meet with an Iran-based businessman, ostensibly to promote business activities. For this purpose, Maman traveled to Samangad, Turkey, where he met with two representatives sent on the businessman's behalf. The three held a phone conversation with the businessman, who was unable to leave Iran. The indictment charges Maman with offenses against state security, including contact with a foreign agent and entering an enemy state without authorization. Similarly, last July, the Shin Bet and the Israel Police's Unit of International Crime Investigations, known in Hebrew by its acronym Yahbal, arrested three Israeli citizens. They were suspected of planting money-filled packages and hanging posters in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv under the direction of Iranian intelligence agents. The Shin Bet and Yahbal investigation exposed a network of Iranian intelligence operatives who, disguised as foreign entities, approached Israeli citizens to recruit and deploy them for missions within Israel. One of the citizens faces charges of contact with a foreign agent. Elimelech Stern, a 21-year-old Vizhnitz Hassid from Beit Shemesh, was suspected of communicating with a Telegram profile named 'ANNA ELENA'. Iranian operatives allegedly tasked him with various missions, such as hanging posters in Tel Aviv, planting money at different locations in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, setting a forest on fire, and delivering packages containing a severed animal head or doll (along with a knife and threatening message) to be placed at Israeli citizens' doorsteps. The investigation revealed that Stern agreed to most tasks, excluding murder and forest arson. To accomplish the poster hanging, money planting, and package deliveries, he recruited two other Israeli citizens, who carried out some of the missions for financial compensation. Stern received cryptocurrency payments from ANNA ELENA for completing the tasks. Gonen Segev (Flash 90) In 2022, a complex case of Iranian attempts to recruit spies from among Iranian expatriates in Israel came to light. The operation used a fake Facebook account under the name 'Rambod Namdar,' posing as an Iranian Jew interested in immigrating to Israel. The account contacted dozens of people, mainly Jewish women of Iranian descent, building trust through lengthy conversations. Gradually, 'Rambod' requested various tasks, including photographing Israeli sites and transferring money. In November 2021, five suspects were arrested and brought to trial in the Jerusalem District Court. The case shocked Israel's Persian community and exposed Iran's sophisticated methods for infiltrating Israeli systems. However, during the trial, most defendants were acquitted, with only one convicted of contact with a foreign agent. Nahum Manbar (Yehoshua Yosef) In 2018, Gonen Segev, a former energy ministry, was arrested on suspicion of spying for Iran. Segev, who served as a minister in Israel during the 1990s, was convicted of severe espionage and providing information to the enemy. Recruited by the Iranian embassy in Nigeria, he provided information on strategic facilities, the security system, and Israeli officials. Segev was ultimately sentenced to 11 years in prison as part of a plea bargain. The Shin Bet stated that Segev, who resided in Nigeria, was transferred to Israel from Equatorial Guinea in May 2018 after being denied entry due to his criminal record. He was immediately arrested upon arrival in Israel. The investigation revealed that Segev had been recruited by Iranian intelligence in 2012, meeting his handlers in Iran and various locations worldwide. He passed information related to Israel's energy sector, security sites, and political and security officials. Segev also attempted to connect Israeli citizens to Iranian intelligence agents under the guise of business opportunities. Omri Goren In 1997, Nahum Manbar, an Israeli businessman, was arrested on suspicion of maintaining connections with Iran. Manbar was convicted of aiding the enemy after selling secrets about nerve gas production to Iran. And perhaps most shockingly, in November 2021, Omri Goren, an Israeli citizen employed at Defense Minister Benny Gantz's residence, was charged with espionage. The investigation revealed that Goren, on his own initiative, contacted a figure associated with Iran through social media shortly before his arrest. He offered assistance in various ways, leveraging his access to the minister's house. Among other things, he proposed to the representative of the Iranian-associated hacking group Black Shadow that he could plant malware on the minister's computer via a USB device in exchange for financial compensation.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/15/supermodel-former-minister-defense-chiefs-janitor-the-israelis-who-became-spies-for-iran/	2024-10-14T18:30:43-07:00	
Hamas blocks Gazans from evacuating to safe zones	Fresh evidence has come to light regarding Hamas' ruthless exploitation of Gaza civilians as human shields. As Jabaliya area residents try to heed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) calls to evacuate to safe zones due to ongoing military operations, Hamas is reportedly obstructing their efforts, even resorting to violence. During a conversation between a Gaza resident and an IDF representative, as part of the IDF's efforts to warn civilians in Jabaliya, the Gazan individual stated, 'Hamas members are beating us with batons, blocking our evacuation attempts, and forcing us back from the designated humanitarian zone.' When the IDF official sought confirmation that Hamas was indeed preventing the evacuation, the distressed resident confirmed, adding, 'What are we supposed to do? We want to leave but they're beating us.' Hamas members shoot the feet of Gazans accused of 'disrupting order.' Photo credit: Arab social media As previously reported, following the start of the IDF's operations in the Jabaliya area last week, the IDF urged Jabaliya residents to leave their homes for their own safety. Hamas continues to use Gazan civilians as human shields, impeding their ability to respond to IDF evacuation calls to safer areas.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/14/hamas-blocks-gazans-from-evacuating-to-safe-zones/	2024-10-13T22:00:54-07:00	
Israeli couple hired by Iran to assassinate prominent figure	In a coordinated counterintelligence effort, Israel's Security Agency (Shin Bet) has uncovered a network of Iranian intelligence operatives working to recruit and activate Israeli citizens, the Israeli authorities revealed on Monday. As part of this operation, authorities arrested Vladislav Viktorson, a 30-year-old Ramat Gan resident, for questioning. Investigators found that since August, Viktorson had been in contact via social media with an individual using the name 'Mari Hossi.' Their communications were conducted in Hebrew. Under the direction of an Iranian operative, and fully aware of their identity, Viktorson allegedly carried out various tasks. These included spray-painting graffiti, hanging posters, planting money, and even torching vehicles in Tel Aviv's Yarkon Park area. He was later instructed to sabotage communication infrastructure and ATMs, and to set fires in forests. Some of these activities were documented, and Viktorson received over $5,000 for their execution. The investigation revealed that Viktorson even agreed to assassinate a prominent figure in Israel and to throw a grenade at a house. Following this, he took steps to acquire weapons, including a sniper rifle, handguns, and fragmentation grenades. The cars allegedly burnt by the couple Israel Police To assist in his operations, Viktorson recruited two additional citizens, including his girlfriend, Anna Bernstein, an 18-year-old Ramat Gan resident, who participated in some of the missions. Viktorson was also tasked with locating homeless individuals for recruitment and photographing protesters during demonstrations. On the day of their arrest, the couple was at City Tower in Ramat Gan, where police apprehended them in broad daylight. Their Iranian handler assigned them various missions. Initial tasks included spray-painting 'Bibi Hitler' and burning cars, allegedly to test their commitment. A senior police official stated, 'They carried out not only test missions but also operations that caused actual damage.' The final mission was to assassinate an individual whose identity remains unknown. Viktorson reportedly agreed but was arrested two days before the planned hit. Prosecutors recently filed indictments against those involved on security-related charges. Such activity by Iranian intelligence entities through social media is a known tactic for recruiting Israelis through deception to carry out various missions. While these tasks may initially seem harmless, they have the potential to significantly compromise state security. The recruiters communicated in various languages, including English and Hebrew, through platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter. Citizens responded to these approaches for financial gain. It's worth noting that a significant number of Israeli citizens who received suspicious approaches did not respond and alerted the relevant authorities. A senior Shin Bet official stated: 'In recent months, we've exposed several networks of Iranian intelligence operatives working to recruit Israeli citizens for various missions, including plans to harm individuals in Israel. We identified and monitored numerous fictitious Iranian profiles on social networks and gathered information about the entities behind their operation. Exposing this activity led to the arrest and interrogation of Israeli citizens who were tempted to carry out these missions.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/14/iranian-intelligence-operation-that-recruited-israeli-citizens-to-carry-out-acts-of-sabotage-and-potentially-assassinate-a-high-profile-target/	2024-10-13T19:11:49-07:00
